    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that in some health board areas insured workers seeking treatment in district psychiatric hospitals are required after a short period in such hospitals to have up to half their social welfare disability benefit retained by the health board; and, if so, the action he intends to take to have the situation rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>An insured person is entitled to receive treatment in a district psychiatric hospital free of charge.  Where such a patient remains in the hospital and his continued stay is governed by social reasons rather than treatment requirements, then he is regarded as a person in receipt of institutional assistance.  In such cases the health board concerned generally appropriates part of the social welfare payment towards maintenance charges.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy will be kind enough to let me have particulars of cases he has in mind I will have the position examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider it important that this matter be examined urgently?  It is a serious matter when public officials are deciding whether a person is ill.  It is contrary to the whole purpose of the Acts in respect of mental and medical treatment.  The Minister in the past few years has supported me in my plea with regard to this matter and I would ask him now to give it urgent consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>These abuses are <Col N="2031" /> occurring throughout the country.  In many cases pension books and social welfare allowances are being taken from people and I would appreciate if the Minister would look into the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will authorise health boards to pay the full cost of maintenance and treatment to private nursing homes in cases where persons in lower and middle income groups are admitted in an emergency for specialist treatment or where the treatment necessary proves to be much longer than originally anticipated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons eligible for services under the Health Acts are entitled to receive hospital in-patient services free of direct charge in a public ward in a public hospital. Where they exercise a choice and go to a private nursing home or private maternity home, health boards normally pay portion of the cost only. This is an arrangement which has worked well.</P>
      <P>Where an emergency arises and a patient is rushed to a private nursing or maternity home for treatment this becomes, of course, a special case. Each such case is considered on its merits, initially by the health board and, if necessary, later by the Minister. While abuses are not permitted, all reasonable care is taken to deal with sympathy with the financial burden of the emergency situation.</P>
      <P>As regards duration of stay, health boards pay the daily subvention for up to six weeks stay in a private nursing home or two weeks in a maternity home or such longer period as the board at their discretion may decide.  It is open to those whose stay is longer than those mentioned to apply to the health board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of State-enrolled <Col N="2032" /> nurses employed by health boards and other institutions.</P>

    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has received representations in respect of State-enrolled nurses; and if he proposes granting recognition to these nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I have received such representations. &ldquo;State-enrolled&rdquo; nurses, I should explain to the House, are nurses who have completed a two-year training course, whereas &ldquo;State-registered&rdquo; nurses have a three-year course.  In Britain, they have nurses of both grades.  Here only &ldquo;State-registered&rdquo; nurses are recognised.</P>
      <P>The education and training of nurses is primarily a matter for An Bord Altranais who have statutory functions in this field.  The board have considered the recognition of &ldquo;State-enrolled&rdquo; nurses on a number of occasions but have not been in favour of this.  The whole question of the education and training of nurses is at present being reviewed by the board, however, and the position of &ldquo;State-enrolled&rdquo; nurses will be considered again in this review.</P>
      <P>The grade of &ldquo;State-enrolled&rdquo; nurse is not a recognised grade for appointment in the health services.  I understand, however, that some persons who have acquired this qualification in Great Britain have been employed from time to time in some hospitals, mainly as ward attendants.  I have no information on the numbers of these who have this qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in some cases State-enrolled nurses are performing duties identical with those performed by State-registered nurses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but An Bord Altranais have told the Department that there are sufficient State-registered nurses in this country in recent times to do the jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are sufficient State-registered nurses, why is it necessary <Col N="2033" /> to have State-enrolled nurses performing their duties in certain hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the position it should not happen because at the moment there are sufficient State-registered nurses here to do the jobs nurses should perform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he has any reports on the dangers to the health of local residents arising from cement dust fall-out from cement silos at Cabra Road, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received reports of the nature mentioned by the Deputy.  I am informed by the health board that their chief medical officer does not consider that there is a hazard to the health of local residents from cement dust fall-out in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary state on what grounds the chief medical officer has based his findings?  The position is that there is a fall-out of cement dust daily.  When, as a result of certain operations, pipes are burst the entire area is covered in cement dust and this must be a health hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that this complaint was also made some five years ago and the matter was then investigated with regard to the cement silo at Cabra. The then chief medical officer was of the opinion that there was no health hazard.  I understand a further inspection has been carried out in the past few days and it was found that the situation was unchanged.  The chief medical officer is satisfied a health <Col N="2034" /> hazard to the local residents does not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that if a person gets an increase in a pension which brings it over £273.75 per annum he loses his free electricity allowance; and if he will take steps to prevent this happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Eligibility for free electricity allowance is confined to persons over 70 years who are in receipt of old age pension or similar social welfare type pension and who fulfil the other conditions of the scheme.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware not only is the qualifying age for the old age pension being reduced to 69 years from July next but the means conditions for non-contributory pensions are being very considerably eased.  No other changes affecting the free electricity scheme are at present contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is that, with rapidly progressing parity in pensions, people who benefit by these schemes pass the limit and may not receive the benefits to which they are entitled.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the qualifying limit was £273. As and from next month that limit will be increased to £494.  Therefore, I doubt very much if this problem will arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is generally no undue delay in determining claims for retirement pension, the vast majority of which are decided within four weeks of date of receipt.  In some cases, however, inquiries necessary to establish age or the fulfilment of contribution conditions etc., may take longer than usual, with resulting unavoidable delay.  I can assure the Deputy however, that every possible effort is made to deal with such cases expeditiously, but if he is aware of any case which seems to have been unduly delayed I will be glad to look into the matter if he will let me have the necessary particulars.</P>

      <P>Recipients of non-contributory old age, blind and widows and orphans pensions and deserted wives allowances will, when the arrangements are completed, receive their vouchers by post from my Department and recipients of unemployment assistance will receive theirs from the local employment exchange or employment office from which they receive their assistance.

While I would be happy to see non-commissioned officers and privates, as well as officers, participating in such competitions, the absence of mounted troops renders it difficult to discern non-commissioned personnel with the potential to make suitable riders.  In the case of officers, equitation is part of the curriculum at the Cadet School and in this way potentially suitable riders can be selected for attachment to the Equitation School.

      <P>The Government have approved participation in European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975.  Earlier this year, a number of organisations were invited to nominate representatives so that a national committee could be formed to promote and co-ordinate activities in connection with the year, including the use of the emblem specially chosen for the year and the slogan &ldquo;A future for our Past&rdquo;.  The committee have had informal meetings but will be formally inaugurated in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975, has its charter from a decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to designate a year similar to European Conservation Year, 1970, for the preservation and rehabilitation of the cultural heritage of monuments and sites.  The objectives of the year are to awaken the interest of European peoples in their common architectural heritage, to protect and enhance buildings and areas of architectural or historic interest, to conserve the character of old towns and villages, and to assure for ancient buildings a living role in contemporary society.  The inspiration for the year is not simply preservationist. The aim being advanced is rehabilitation for economic and social as well as for cultural reasons.  That will be the matter considered by the committee which is to be inaugurated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if Irish firms may tender equally with their European counterparts for European public works contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as such contracts come within the terms of EEC directives 71/304 and 71/305 the answer is in the affirmative.  Broadly, these directives require that public works contracts, which are estimated to be in excess of 1,000,000 &ldquo;units of account&rdquo; (about £480,000 at current exchange rates) in value, must be open to competition throughout the Community. Directive 71/304 requires the abolition by each member state of any restrictive or discriminatory practices which might prevent contractors from all member states from participating in public works contracts on equal terms. It came into force here on the 1st January, 1973.  Directive 71/305 provides for co-ordinated procedures and criteria in the selection of tenders and <Col N="2048" /> the award of contracts.  It comes into force here on 1st July, 1973, together with a consequential directive&mdash;72/277 &mdash;which prescribes the format of the notice to be given, in the Official Journal of the European Communities of impending public works contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the basis on which the Government's housing target of 25,000 completions this year was arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The target of 25,000 new houses a year was based on an awareness of the numbers of families on waiting lists for local authority housing and on an assessment of the housing situation generally, including the extent of the accumulated needs, arising from unfitness and overcrowding, which the former Government acknowledged in their White Paper, &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether the awareness of the numbers on waiting lists and on an assessment of the housing situation generally arose after the present Government took office or before they took office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The awareness of the assessment was certainly in the booklet &ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;. What the Government are going to do about it arose, I think, after the Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be true then, to say that there was no basis for the figure other than a guess by the members of the present Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was every reason for such a figure being adduced and there was a most detailed assessment by the present Government over long hours at Cabinet meetings to discover the best that could be done to relieve the existing dreadful housing situation for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The target of 25,000 is directly related to finance in the Capital Budget, as the ex-Minister for Finance knows perfectly well, and our target is 25,000 houses and it is stated to be such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>So we may take it the requirement is related to financial resources rather than to the White Paper to which the Minister referred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <P>As the reply to the first part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In so far as the second part of the question is concerned I think that, in the case of the limited number of authorities who operate a points system, a decision as to whether or not applicants should be informed on request of the number of points allocated to them, is better left to the housing authorities concerned.  Because of day-to-day changes in applicants' circumstances I doubt if the information would be of any real value to applicants.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Fifteen local authorities presently operate a points system in the allocation of tenancies of local authority housing.  They are as follows:</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>1.  Figures relate to grants allocated and paid by the Department of Local Government only.</P>
    <P>2.  The reduction in grant allocations in April, 1973 arose primarily from the temporary assignment of housing inspectors to duties connected with a sample survey of the housing stock.</P>

These limits are being kept under review and when the next revision is being made the Deputy's suggestion will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>The new house grants were revised under the Housing Act, 1970, and a further revision is not immediately contemplated.  A comprehensive review of improvement grants is being undertaken and when this is completed, I will consider what changes, if any, are desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of the loan limits and the income limits for loans by the Government in recent weeks are of great help.  As I have indicated in my reply, consideration will be given in any further review to the suggestion contained in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider that new house grants have remained at £325, depending on floor area, and the new house supplementary grants depend on income qualifications, while at the same time reconstruction grants have increased and those wishing to reconstruct can instal water and sewerage facilities and can be sure of grants of £550 without income qualifications?  I can appreciate that the Minister would like to see old houses brought up to a proper standard rather than money expended on new houses.  Would the <Col N="2057" /> Minister not consider that the grants for new houses are far too small at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House would like to see the grants increased. The Deputy will take into account what I already told his colleague, namely, that the limits for loans have been spectacularly increased and the income limit at which a person can get a loan from a local authority has also been increased.  The suggestion which the Deputy makes in his Supplementary Question will be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>Surely the information in regard to increases in 1970 is not correct?  Reconstruction grants were substantially increased last year.  Perhaps I did not hear the Minister correctly.  Surely the Minister is aware that these grants were revised upwards last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to accept that if the cost of houses goes up, as is anticipated in the next 12 months, a person who at present would pay £8 per week may have to pay £11 per week.  That will slow down the housing drive because the workers would not be able to pay such money.  If the repayments were about £11 per week the workers would not be able to pay.  The grants are inadequate.  The rise in the grants is not sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take question Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Premises used exclusively for charitable purpose are exempt from rates. Otherwise, parochial, community or recreational halls and centres do not qualify for special rating concessions under existing law.  However, I would point out that these halls and centres benefit from the recent Government decision to transfer on a phased basis from local to central taxation the burden of health charges on local authorities and the cost to them of local authority housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in order to stimulate <Col N="2061" /> community effort it would be a tremendous boost if the burden of rates was removed from community halls? At the moment the burden of rates is the single greatest item of expenditure in these community halls.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be a tremendous help if the Minister would remove the rates burden?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everything else that costs money and is desirable this is something that we would all like to do, but I would also like to point out that this burden has been there for a long time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that provision was contained in the recent Local Government White paper to waive rates on youth clubs and community halls?  Is the Minister so aware?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I am definitely so aware but I take the Deputy's word for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister that that is so.  Would he ask the Minister for Local Government to reconsider this in view of the tremendous difficulty that young people have in raising funds for their youth clubs? The vast majority of it is voluntary effort and they should at least get this concession.  Would the Minister ask the Minister for Local Government to reconsider this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This ill has been with us for a long, long time and, indeed, I will bring it to the notice of my colleague, the Minister for Local Government. Of course, they will have a lot less rates to pay this year then they had last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister sought to indicate that voluntary organisations, community centres and sports clubs will have the benefit of reduced rates by reason of the recent Government decision, does he agree that so will expensive office blocks and that, therefore, these community halls <Col N="2062" /> and other social centres will have no advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> expensive office blocks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Leader of the Opposition carefully followed the provisions of the budget he would find that there is a provision for an extra charge in relation to office blocks which will act in the manner of a claw-back.  I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition did not observe that in the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know that there is an extra advantage for the rated occupiers of office blocks in that they will enjoy income tax concessions as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will pay 5 per cent more on the cost of their office blocks and that will provide a clawback which will mean that the clubs referred to will benefit very spectacularly from the Government decision. The Leader of the Opposition is quite wrong and the office blocks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on the White-gate group water supply scheme, is nearing completion.  The Loughaderra extension to serve four houses was not included in the design for the original scheme due to lack of interest locally. Having been assured last year that the four houses on the proposed extension would now participate, the group agreed that as soon as the financial affairs for the main scheme were finalised the half mile extension to Loughaderra would be carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The design for this scheme, to serve six houses by way of an extension from the existing public mains, was received on 28th May, 1973.  Having been examined by my inspector and found to be in order, the design was forwarded to Cork County Council on 31st May, for formal <Col N="2064" /> approval.  The group are being advised to seek quotations in the meantime for the necessary materials, etc. to enable firm costings to be determined.</P>
      <P>There is some doubt on both technical and financial grounds as to whether it will be possible to serve the person in question from this extension. The position is, however, being further examined in conjuction with the design calculations now available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking on the last occasion on which we discussed this vote about the telephone services.  Last year the number of new lines connected was 27,000 as against 21,000 in the previous year.  While this increase may be an indication of progress, we must remember that the waiting list has increased by 9,500.  This brings the total number on the waiting list to 32,000.  This is a scandalous state of affairs.  A situation of this kind would not be allowed to develop in private enterprise but because the service is controlled by the State no great attention seems to be paid to this state of affairs.  During the debate we heard a Deputy from the other side of the House complain of the lack of telephones in industrial estates.  He referred in particular to the Tallaght area.  This lack of telephone services is hampering commerce and business.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is a vigorous effort made to ensure that there is an adequate service.  The waiting list must be reduced dramatically. The lack of these services indicates the lack of interest in the development of new business.  I hope the situation will be rectified as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer also to delays in postal deliveries, particularly in the Dublin area.  During the past few months I have had complaints regarding delays of two and three days between the time of posting letters and their delivery in the Dublin area.  While this is not the general pattern, it is happening to some extent.  In our competitive society communications must be satisfactory.  In business districts mail should be delivered to offices before 9 a.m. Saturday deliveries have not been in operation in Dublin for some time.  This practice is now accepted and, in my opinion, should apply throughout the country because it is only fair that the people outside Dublin who are connected with the postal services should also have the benefit of a five-day week.  This would make for better staff relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Post Office have been slow in regard to the Giro business.  They have left it to the banks to capture this business and to operate it.  Apparently, they have adopted the role of second <Col N="2088" /> fiddle in this regard.  This should not have happened.  The Post Office should always be to the forefront in any development that can mean more business for them.  They should be interested in providing a good consumer service, which is what the Post Office is all about.  They are not competing with the commercial banking societies in relation to the Giro system. Neither are they competing with them in relation to savings.  While the group savings schemes work quite effectively, the Post Office deposit account system is antiquated.  There are many people who use the Post Office savings schemes but they are not satisfied with the facilities that are available for withdrawing money.  These facilities do not compare favourably with those available in the commercial banks where there are no problems in this regard. Every effort must be made to encourage Post Office saving.  The rate of interest must be attractive and competitive and there must be every incentive to encourage people to save with the Post Office.  This is important for our economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>It should also be possible for people to apply to the post office for a driving licence or to tax a car.  They could pay their money and get a receipt and have their tax discs sent on from the relevant authority, but the availability of post offices throughout the city and country areas would make it much easier for people to tax cars and get driving licences.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the whole standard in relation to the Post Office generally will have to be raised to cope with our social welfare society.  We are not able to cope as we should with this situation and there is need for a complete overhaul in relation to staffing so that there would be qualified people to inform social welfare recipients of their rights and entitlement.  Some people may know their rights but, by and large, when they inquire they are referred to some other Department.   All this information should be available at post offices.</P>
    <P>Political rights for employees has been a strong bone of contention within the Post Office for a number of years now.  Post Office employees should be <Col N="2089" /> treated in the same way as those in semi-State bodies.  They should have the right to participate actively in the political life of the nation.  Apart from cases where it is undesirable for security or other reasons to enter politics, everybody should be encouraged to participate.</P>
    <P>It is my belief also that the Post Office should be a semi-State rather than a State body.  In this way it would have its own authority and have a greater degree of independence.  It would also be possible for the Post Office to exercise more imagination and to be a more creative and competitive structure within our society. I believe this could best be done if the Post Office were a semi-State body. There are pros and cons there, but I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>There should also be some form of consumers' council not necessarily for the Post Office but for other semi-State bodies as well.  There should be people to keep watch in order to ensure that consumers, the people using post offices, are getting the kind of service they should be getting.  It would be easier for the Minister as well if complaints coming in were channelled through this council.</P>
    <P>I would like to revert back to piped television.  As I said before, this matter is a bone of contention in my constituency. The Department's policy of having 500 per aerial is narrowminded and completely contrary to the needs of the people.  People who want piped television are being denied it, and it is a question of bureaucracy overriding the wishes of the people.  This should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned some television programmes, but I would like to suggest that there should be more sport.  Coming from a Dublin constituency I know that soccer on television is popular.  I know many people who are seeking piped television because they want to see soccer football.  I would ask the Minister to make representations to RTE to ensure that more football is shown on it.  It is good for young people; it encourages them to take up sport. They have their own heroes and I <Col N="2090" /> think a football or an athlete hero is preferable to others.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to wish the Minister well in his new Department, and I hope he will give consideration to the points I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, at the outset, to join with the previous speaker in wishing the Minister, who is a colleague in my own constituency, every success in his high office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I assure him at this stage that any criticism which I would feel compelled to levy at his policies or activities in the Department will be inspired with the wish to be as constructive as possible and to endeavour to ensure that under his guidance the Department continues to serve the Irish people as satisfactorily in the future as it has always done in the past.</P>
      <P>The principal feature of the Minister's opening statement was the amount of time which it devoted to broadcasting in proportion to that devoted to all the other activities of the Department put together.  Of the 30 pages which made up his statement, 15, or exactly one half, were given over to an outline of the situation in regard to broadcasting.  I look on that as being out of all proportion, and I hope it does not indicate a particular outlook or an attitude of mind by the Minister to the work of his new Department.  Broadcasting is of course the side of the Department's work that attracts most public interest and attention.  With the Minister's own particular background it would be only natural that it would be the side that would personally interest and attract him most.  However, I would strongly urge that he should resist the temptation, if such exists, to pre-occupy himself with the broadcasting aspect to the detriment or neglect of the other vitally important, though perhaps much more prosaic, services his Department provides throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that particularly in view of the fact that we have just had pretty severe increases imposed by the budget in respect of a number of these services. I am a bit disturbed to see in the Estimate statement, as I say, 15 <Col N="2091" /> pages devoted to broadcasting while the postal service was dismissed with a few lines.  I accept that this Estimate was, to a large extent, awaiting the Minister when he arrived at his desk. Even allowing for that I would have liked to have seen greater evidence that he had directed his mind to these other sectors.</P>
    <P>Whatever disadvantages there may be in a change of Governments, one advantage is that it does, or should, bring new minds into Departments, the asking of questions and the possibility of new thinking.  Broadcasting apart, there is nothing very much in the Minister's statement to encourage us to expect any great new advances in the particular Department for which he is responsible.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, while it may not be the most glamorous of Government Departments, is certainly one of the most important constituents of the infrastructure of our community.  The services it provides are availed of more extensively throughout the land than that of any other Department and the manner in which it provides these services can affect the entire economic and social life of our community for better or worse.  In particular the infrastructural services provided by the Department can, at the present time, be of great significance in promoting or impeding our economic progress. Like other Deputies one hears stories of enterprises not commencing here because of the inadequacy of the telephone services.</P>
    <P>This debate provides Deputies with the best opportunity available to see how this Department is fulfilling its role and contributing to our progress. It should be an occasion for a down-to-earth, working discussion of practical realities, facts and figures, plans and programmes.  In this respect the Minister's statement disappoints.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the postal service was dismissed with a few lines.  The Irish postal service has a great history and a great tradition behind it, but what are the plans for the future?  It is true, regrettably, that in some respects the Irish postal service was providing <Col N="2092" /> a better, more efficient and faster service 50 years ago than it is today. Admittedly changing circumstances may have made this inevitable, but even if this is so are there, on the other hand, any improvements or any new services under examination or contemplated? Is there, for instance, a development unit in the administration of the postal service?  Those same questions can be asked of the remittance service to which the last Deputy referred.</P>
    <P>On the staff side one welcomes very warmly, the Minister's statement when he says:</P>
    <P>There is a traditionally high spirit of service in the Department and it would be my aim to see that this spirit is fostered and developed.</P>
    <P>I regard that as very important.  This Department is a very big employer.  I believe it may be the largest single employer in the country.  Staff relations, morale and the <i>esprit de corps</i> are of paramount importance to such a Department. There are suggestions that these are not all that they might be and I hope the Minister will direct his attention to this particularly important area.</P>
    <P>I am told that the incremental system is generally regarded as being iniquitous and is in urgent need of revision and rationalisation.  There is also, I am told, a certain amount of discontent with the system of promotion.  I believe also that, in an organisation of the size of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, there is a need for a full scale, properly equipped and adequately staffed welfare section.  It is essential that matters of this sort receive continuing attention because the efficiency of the institution itself and the welfare of those who work in it are involved in these matters.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to quote from the Fourth Annual Report of AnCO:</P>
    <P>For training to be fully effective in a company there must be a commitment on the part of top management. The training must be organised in a systematic way and most of the training must be undertaken within the enterprise supplemented, where necessary, by external courses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> One would like to think that there is such a commitment by top management in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that new training techniques and programmes are being availed of.  Regrettably, however, the Minister's statement merely refers to schemes being kept under review. Admittedly there is reference to an innovation but one which is, I am afraid, of minor importance.</P>
    <P>Two of the matters in the Minister's statement which undoubtedly caused the greatest stir and will give rise to a great amount of controversy in the months ahead are his dramatic references to:</P>
    <P>a much more widely effective freedom of the airwaves over this island...</P>
    <P>and:</P>
    <P>the question of making all Ireland an open broadcasting area...</P>
    <P>In this area I must confess that I find it difficult to find coherence in the Minister's words, thoughts and actions.  When he comes to reply I think we are entitled to a great deal of elucidation and explanation of precisely and comprehensively what he has in mind.  At the outset I wish to say that I thought it regrettable that the Minister should have&mdash;there may however have been some very good reason for it&mdash;taken off to London to discuss these very important proposals with the British Minister concerned before he had an opportunity of hearing our views in this House in regard to them, whatever those views may be worth.  I say that particularly in view of what the Minister says on page 19 of his statement:</P>
    <P>There is no body in the country which has better authority, or a stronger incentive, to try to express what the people want, than this House has.  That aspect of this House, its broadly representative character, is of course often obscured by the factor of Party competition, which is also an unescapable part of democracy, but I am encouraged to hope, having sat through previous Estimate debates on this subject, that in this <Col N="2094" /> debate also the broadly representative aspect of the House will be uppermost and that we will be hearing from many Deputies, both in multi channel and single channel areas, expressions of what they believe their constituents want.</P>
    <P>I believe that, in view of that approach by the Minister, which is entirely commendable, he might have waited until we had concluded the debate on this Estimate.  He would then have had the benefit of all our views before embarking on this discussion with the British Minister on the fundamentally important matters. I believe that in other circumstances he would have been the first to criticise such action.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled by the dimensional aspect of the Minister's proposals.  If we are going to throw the Republic open to British television, surely there should be full reciprocity and we should have the corresponding opportunities over not just Northern Ireland but Britain as well.  I admit that the prospects of our availing of them on any comprehensive scale are remote but should we not, nonetheless, establish them if only for some unique occasion or in regard to some special area?  Perhaps I do not fully comprehend the Minister's mind but it seems to me that we were thinking only in terms of Northern Ireland and the Republic and not, as we should, on the basis of full reciprocity of both islands together as the area involved.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but he seems to be adopting contradictory stands on the functions of a future Council of Ireland and this matter of an open broadcasting area.  I am not clear whether he will wait for the Council to come into being and take on functions or whether he intends to press ahead in the meantime with specific proposals. What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;freedom of the airwaves&rdquo;?  Does that really mean freedom of the pipelines? Does he mean he would like to bring an end to present restrictions in the Dublin area on the number of households that may connect to <Col N="2095" /> community aerials?  Does he mean that the facilities now available in Dublin, even on this limited scale, should be extended to the people of Cork, Limerick and Waterford?  What about the rural areas where piped television will not be possible?  I believe that the Minister should spell out all these things to us when replying.</P>
    <P>If he means that we here should take an active part in retransmitting products of British television throughout the country, he should say so. It seems to me it is a question of rediffusion: there is no iron curtain around this country preventing reception. Are we to undertake an active responsibility for this rediffusion?  If so, will whatever comes over British television be automatically disseminated by us through some State machinery? These are questions I hope the Minister will answer fully when replying.</P>
    <P>We know most people desire to be able to receive or to be allowed to receive BBC and ITV programmes.  It is true that RTE fought a rearguard action against this possibility.  It feared, with some justification, loss of viewers and revenue and as a last resort it sought to get control of the method of rediffusion or community reception. There is a widespread suspicion that it has availed of that control to delay making these services available in areas where it was possible to make them available.  Certainly, that suspicion exists in the constituency which the Minister and I represent.  The Minister has also spoken of the dissatisfaction with the present restriction to 500 homes per masthead which exists in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has beside him a special adviser on broadcasting and I believe this adviser comes from the audience research side of television and can therefore be presumed to know the real picture and the dissatisfaction felt by many with RTE services.  The Minister himself has spoken of the certainty that an extension of cable television would mean a fall in viewing of RTE, with consequent implications for advertising revenue which, in the Minister's words, implies a deterioration in <Col N="2096" /> programmes or a rise in licence fees. The Minister, therefore, must be presumed to know pretty clearly that, if he proceeds and succeeds in overcoming the difficulties involved in what he proposes, he will be largely presiding over the obsequies of RTE as it operates at present and that, if he opens up the whole field and makes this a free broadcasting area, as he calls it, that, in effect, will be the end of RTE at least with its present programme policies. Does the Minister really want to leave us open to the full impact of British television while having little or no television of our own?  If not&mdash;and I do not believe he does&mdash;what is the answer?  I suggest there is only one answer, to which I hope to advert later on.</P>
    <P>Whatever the report of the Broadcasting Review Committee may say, it is legitimate for us to make up our minds at this point that, if the Minister proceeds with these proposals, we can then say goodbye to a second channel, and unless something positive happens we may also say goodbye to RTE television at least, because people will only stand for a certain amount of licencing and taxing in respect of a service which they have largely ceased to use.  Yet, since we do not seek to prevent people reading British newspapers, we have no right actively to prevent them watching British television, although actively participating in the rebroadcasting of that television is clearly a different matter.  Very widespread dissatisfaction exists among single-channel viewers with the present service and among many who are dependent for solace, comfort and entertainment on our television and radio services.  If they have only one channel and something is broadcast on that channel which either they cannot understand or is of such ineptitude that nobody would want to watch it, for that period of time they are deprived of that solace and comfort which are so much part of modern living.</P>
    <P>By the logic of public demand, therefore, if not by the Minister's eagerness to bring it about, the British channels will sooner or later have to be made available to those who want them; but I am concerned about what <Col N="2097" /> looks like&mdash;I may be wrong but it seems to be so at this stage&mdash;the indifference of the Minister to the fate of RTE in those circumstances.  I am also concerned with the readiness of RTE itself to face this new situation and challenge: for there is little doubt that, if the present programme policies of RTE are continued, in the new situation it will become either a heavily subsidised white elephant or another defunct symbol of an unachieved national ambition.  On a competitive level and as a mere carbon copy of other kinds of television, a television service of our own would be pointless. If, however, one could be satisfied that under the spur of competition RTE could and would change its role in a fruitful and creative way, then the new development might turn out to be that not uncommon thing in public and in other aspects of life, a blessing in disguise.</P>
    <P>It seems to be mostly for budgetary reasons that so much canned foreign material is used.  From personal observation, I am convinced it is not because the people want it.  In fact, there is a marked general desire for more specifically Irish television.  Nothing else can explain the continued popularity of programmes such as &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;. To say that television has to put on so much American crime films or cowboy rubbish because the audience demands it is to libel the audience.</P>
    <P>If RTE in order to survive were forced by the new development to become a vital reflection of Irish life in all its aspects, we could well have a situation that would be much better than what we have at present.  However, the vital question is if RTE can do that.  I am not certain that budgetary reasons stand in the way of such a development.  There is a pool of creative people in Ireland which is not being used by the television services and when they are used the writer or creator is the last person to be accounted for in the budget.  In fact, he is expected to be glad just to get the job.</P>
    <P>It is possible to find originally creative people here who can devise and make pleasing dramatic or culturally exciting television, however limited <Col N="2098" /> the budget.  It should be possible to devise forms of dramatic television that could work on a small budget rather than looking like poor, patchwork attempts to do a bigger job.  At a certain period in its history the French cinema did marvellous things precisely because the film makers had to operate on tiny budgets.  I am not as cognisant of this area as the Minister but I believe there have been times when Irish genius and creativity were paramount in the output of the BBC.</P>
    <P>There should be more programmes that are direct, living and spontaneous reflections of Irish life.  We are supposed to be a nation of talkers&mdash;people who have lots of topics to discuss and who are prepared to discuss them but, with the possible exception of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and specific interview programmes, the only topics discussed on television are politics and the more overtly social aspects of religion.  There should be at least one, if not more, non-political talk show. By that, I do not mean a mere interview that is hung on a news item or a public event; there should be some way of getting the people on television other than as mere subjects for interviews or as curiosities.</P>
    <P>There is a definite feeling among ordinary people that the world is divided among two classes&mdash;those on one side of the screen and the people on the other side.  There is also a feeling among the general public that RTE are run by executives and programme planners who are not aware of the needs and wishes of the ordinary person.  There are grounds for believing RTE have failed to do the job of enriching and deepening our national consciousness that many people envisaged when it was established.</P>
    <P>The Minister treated us to a disquisition on whether the provisions in the Broadcasting Act, which enjoined on RTE the duty of developing the national culture, referred mainly to the Gaelic language or whether the phrase &ldquo;the national culture&rdquo; also included forms of the English language which, as he said, most of us speak most of the time, and the literature in the English language created by our writers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" /> In that regard I think the Minister was tilting at an intellectual windmill and that if he re-examines the situation, he might be inclined to agree with me.  I should have thought, from a liberal point of view, that it would be better to leave the phrase &ldquo;national culture&rdquo; in an Act of Parliament in that general way.  It would be difficult and perhaps even dangerous to try to spell out what exactly was meant by it in the sections and subsections of the act.  I should prefer to leave it as a phrase, as an object or goal to be interpreted in a generous and creative way by people given the responsibility of interpreting it.  I hope when the Minister brings in the legislation he referred to he will keep this aspect in mind and that he will appreciate it is not always a good thing, particularly in this area, to try to de-limit too rigidly one's objectives and goals in an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>I suggest also, if we had more than the very limited hours of native Irish television we have that question, like many others, would have taken care of itself by now.  If there are very few hours of native television, some people will see an imbalance when some of those limited hours are devoted to Irish language programmes.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister's proposals are pressed rapidly or more slowly, I suggest RTE may be entering a sink-or-swim situation and the only possible way to survival will be more native television, not less.</P>
    <P>If we wish to seek guidance by way of a corollary in this situation, it can be found in the history of Irish newspapers. They face, and have always faced, uncontrolled and uninhibited competition from a strong, powerful British press.  However, because they did not seek merely to copy the features and format of that British press, because they devoted most of their space to exploring, defining and reflecting aspects of Irish life beyond the ken of their English competitors, they have survived robustly in the face of such competition.  There are English newspapers which many people here are pleased to buy but they buy their Irish <Col N="2100" /> newspapers as well and even first and RTE might have regard to this fact.</P>
    <P>With limited resources, sound radio has been operating to some extent in a free broadcasting situation.  Because it has been facing that competitive situation, perhaps it has given better results for the resources devoted to it than has television.  Everyone complains about the national broadcasting services and when this Estimate comes before us each year we turn ourselves into television critics.  However, this year there are matters of fundamental policy involved above and beyond criticising the quality of particular programmes and which point to RTE having to rethink their role in what may be for that body a survival situation.</P>
    <P>There are, and will be, budgetary difficulties but at present there is a fairly general suspicion that a greater or lesser amount or RTE's money is wasted internally, that there is over-staffing in some departments and that too little of revenue is given to programmes as such.  There has also been a lack of energy and imagination in the devising and the making of programmes.</P>
    <P>In general, my prescription for the new situation which I have described would be more Irish life on to our screens, put a much greater proportion of available budgets into creativity and less into the bureaucratic machine which has been built up.  If RTE are content to go into the future providing a service which is nothing more or less than a pale replica of the other two channels, then to my mind their future will be very dim indeed.</P>
    <P>I am not a filmgoer but I am told there is now a new era in films, an entirely new situation prevailing, that the film maker today is not content to accept that the last word was said by the great giants of the thirties.  The result is that there is a great new vitality in film making and in film viewing.  If that is possible in regard to films might it not also be possible in television?  Might there possibly be a new era for television and could we in Ireland not be the ones to bring in that new era?</P>
    <P>In his Estimate speech, the Minister <Col N="2101" /> stated he had been asked to assume certain responsibilities in relation to the GIB.  He said there were discussions on the reorganisation of the Government information services generally. This is a very important area and also a very complex one on which we are entitled to expect more information. I hope the Minister will be much more specific on what exactly his role and functions will be and how the system will work in the future.  The transfer of responsibility for the Government information services from the Department of the Taoiseach undoubtedly raises a number of questions and to my mind it may well give rise to difficulties.  I hope it will not.  The question arises as to the functions and the extent of the authority of the new head of the information services.  I should like personally to wish him well in his new appointment.  Is he now the new director of the GIB or will there be a new director who will be responsible to him?  Will his authority and responsibility extend over the whole spectrum of the Government information services, including foreign affairs?  If so, does this mean the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have a similar authority and responsibility?</P>
    <P>It is very important that there be clear lines of authority and demarkation in this area, and I hope the Minister will elucidate these fully for us. If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and, under him, the head of the information services, are to have responsibility over the whole spectrum of Government information, one can foresee problems arising.  They will arise because of the complexity of the situation itself, and indeed with this Government if I may take the liberty of saying so, the situation may be aggravated by the penchant which Ministers have for doing what I might call their own publicity thing.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, apart from any particular characteristics of the incumbent of the moment, have their own special information role to play and it is difficult to see that Department willing to be overlorded&mdash;I am speaking at departmental level&mdash;by the head of <Col N="2102" /> the information service who is responsible to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and not to the Taoiseach. The more one considers the departmental attitudes which are inbuilt into our system, the more difficult it is to visualise this new system working smoothly.  Apart from the personalities of the different Ministers, and simply at departmental level, any Department other than that of the Taoiseach will have difficulty commanding the necessary authority effectively to co-ordinate the activities of all the others.  I should like if the Minister would give us his views on the difficulties even at departmental level, which I can see arising.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there are three different aspects of Government information. First of all, we have the technical routine type which is supplied by the Departments as a public service. There are the leaflets and booklets put out by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, for instance, and by the Department of Social Welfare&mdash; all this factual, technical, departmental type of information.  Then there is information on Government policy, plans and activities, for the information of the general public.  Thirdly, and perhaps as important as any of the others, there is the projection of our situation and our image, in other countries.</P>
    <P>In regard to the first type of information, the dissemination of departmental technical information, that beyond any doubt is best left to each Department, to look after themselves in conjunction with the Stationery Office.  Such information is very often of a detailed technical character and only capable of being looked after by the Department concerned. Of course, there is room for improvement in the matter of keeping the information updated and keeping supplies of the various publications available.  There is nothing more exasperating for a member of the public than to be looking for a Government leaflet or pamphlet which is out of print.</P>
    <P>While leaving the information service in the hands of the Departments concerned, there may be a case for <Col N="2103" /> giving somebody the central responsibility of seeing that the Departments fulfil their functions in that respect, of seeing to it that their publications are updated and readily available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other two aspects, the need to inform the media at home and through them the general public, and also to promote our general image abroad, while there are many difficulties and complexities involved I personally believe it desirable to establish a central information office adequately staffed and equipped on the most up-to-date lines. This matter should be examined by the Minister as a matter of urgency in the light of his new responsibility, and by the Government as a whole. I have seen what damage can be done, what public confusion caused by something coming out from the Government not fully explained or correctly interpreted.  In recent years also we have seen the vital need there is for a valid picture being transmitted abroad of us and of our situation.  The need for such an office is compelling. As I have said, such an office would have to be properly staffed by experienced personnel and equipped with all the necessary machinery and facilities.</P>
    <P>On the question of personnel, I would very strongly favour recruitment to the Government Information Service from the journalistic profession rather than from the public service.  It is much easier to take a trained journalist and turn him into a reasonably competent public servant in this area than to transform a civil servant into a journalist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This central information office would have a very important task in presenting an informed and accurate picture of Ireland abroad.  The Minister from his own experience well knows that the first Department&mdash;and I have referred to this before&mdash;which could be expected to react unfavourably to the idea of centralising our information services abroad would be the <Col N="2104" /> Department of Foreign Affairs.  I do not think, however, that that should deter the Minister or the Government from proceeding with it or at least from proceeding with an examination of it.</P>
      <P>Anybody who thinks seriously about this problem knows that there is a huge job of work to be done in this area and it cannot be done piecemeal or on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  We are told that one, two or three aides are to be appointed to different embassies abroad, probably people with no practical experience or knowledge of the highly skilled and professional field of journalism.  That will not do anything really effective to meet the need which is clearly there.</P>
      <P>As I said before, conflicts over the spheres of influence between one Government Department and another are nothing new.  They are there at all times and from time to time they have to be resolved.  They cannot and must not be allowed to stand in the way of any line of action which is clearly in the best overall national interest to pursue. So far as the information service is concerned, it should not be beyond the bounds of human wisdom and departmental expertise to devise ways and means to meet our needs at home and abroad and co-ordinate them.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the establishment of a national news agency is the answer.  As the Minister knows personally&mdash;and probably better than anybody else&mdash;under the first Coalition we had a very salutary and costly experience of such an institution.  I do not know whether its re-establishment is being seriously thought about but I would certainly urge that, in preference, the idea of a central information office should be substituted.  With adequate financial provision and given agreement and co-operation all around we could have in the important centres abroad where they are most needed an information division attached to each of our embassies.  But&mdash;and this is the important point I would make&mdash;they should be directed from a central office in Dublin.  I think that is the right and indeed the only effective chain of command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would probably be desirable in the case of the information division <Col N="2105" /> attached to the embassy in a particular country that, because of his very special knowledge of the situation in that country, the ambassador concerned would have the final say as to whether something should or should not go out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy say that the Department of Foreign Affairs should not have control over that information service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I am trying to make.  It would not.  Generally the line of command would be from the central co-ordinating information office in Dublin to an information division attached to the embassy abroad but within any particular country the ultimate authority in a particular situation residing in the ambassador in that country if he wished to exercise it.  I do not think the sort of situation where the ambassador would feel it necessary to exercise his authority would arise very often.</P>
      <P>While one can see the problem in regard to the Taoiseach, who has so many burdens of office, exercising the authority and giving the necessary direction to the work of such a central information office, I also find it very difficult to visualise such an office being effective if it were attached to any Department other than that of the Taoiseach.  If it can be established it should remain as a permanent part of our public service and should not be something which, in effect, would be stood on its head every time there was a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone would it meet the need which is obviously there to ensure the adequate flow of information to the Press and the public alike but, properly organised and equipped, it would provide a suitable training ground for skilled information officers to serve us at home and abroad in the future. It would bring together, as I see it, under one umbrella all the important policy-making areas of Government with expert staff handling each information sector.  In time it might evolve into an efficient Government Department which would be headed, as is done in many other countries, by a Minister for Information.  The Minister asked us to give our views on <Col N="2106" /> that aspect of his new responsibility and I gladly availed of this opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister raised the question of the direct broadcasting of the proceedings in this House.  He looked at this question through the eyes of an historian and he suggested that our contemporary ban on direct broadcasting may very well seem absurd to our successors 50 or so years from now.  He might be right but I think that not to permit direct broadcasting is the right course at this point in time.  Here above anywhere else in the land men and women should speak with all the sincerity they possess, and from conviction; and anything which would tend to counteract that sort of situation, anything which would tend to encourage us to strike poses or adopt attitudes for public consumption would be detrimental, in my view.  However, with all the modesty for which I am well known, I am prepared to admit that I could be wrong and that in the course of time I may be prevailed upon to go along with the Minister in what seems to be his view of the situation.</P>
    <P>All in all, I believe that the criticism which I have to make of the Minister in presenting us with his Estimate on this occasion is that he overconcentrated on broadcasting to the detriment of the vital infrastructure services of his Department.  It is an imbalance which, when he has had more time in his Department, I hope he will rectify.  I hope he will direct his mind to the many other vital areas of his Department which, in my opinion, are just as important to the national welfare as that of broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I view Deputy Haughey's opinion that the Minister has been excessively preoccupied with broadcasting with a good deal of cynicism.  I do not think for one moment that the Minister's speech contains excessive references to broadcasting to the detriment of the postal and telegraph services.  We can compliment the Minister.  It has been the practice of his predecessors to circulate to Deputies notes for use in connection with the Estimate for <Col N="2107" /> the Department.  It is interesting to point out to Deputy Haughey and to the House that 23 out of 27 pages of notes circulated by the Minister deal exclusively with the postal and telegraph services.  It is necessary for the Minister to avoid giving a mass of detail in relation to the postal and telephone services because this information is circulated to Deputies prior to the debate.</P>
      <P>All in all, I would think that Deputy Haughey might have regarded the Minister's speech as being an attempt, if I may use the term, at a conceptual approach to the role of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, particularly in relation to broadcasting. If I may say so, with respect to Deputy Haughey, I am afraid that in regard to successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;and notably the Minister's two immediate predecessors, Deputy Lalor and Deputy Collins&mdash;I got the distinct impression that, as respective Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs, they were far more preoccupied with the fortunes of their party <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Department rather than the development of the telephone and postal services or the broadcasting system.  The only time in which Ministers indulged in a flurry of activity was when some sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress was to be appointed.  The deputations then to both Deputy Lalor and Deputy Collins were legion.  The broadcasting and television service got their attention only when they decided for some reason or other that they did not like the colour of someone's hair in RTE. Deputy Briscoe's eye was recently cast upon Mr. McGonagle and, if it were not Mr. McGonagle, it would be somebody else.  Such was the political preoccupation that Fianna Fáil Ministers did not seem able to forget the past and to plan for the future.</P>
      <P>I found Deputy Haughey's speech most interesting and most illuminating. I found some parts disturbing, particularly his oblique reference to commercial radio and television.  I have a feeling he had prepared a brief with regard to commercial radio and television. That was my impression.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I must confess I was concerned about some of his comments in regard to the future structure of RTE and I was forcibly reminded of Mr. Eamonn Andrews' article in <i>The Sunday Press.</i> However, I shall come back to that later.</P>
      <P>The Minister highlighted the problems facing both the postal and the telephone service.  There is very little appreciation of the magnificent work done by the 23,000 employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The Department is now the biggest employer in the State.  It is well ahead of CIE.  There is not sufficient appreciation of the work done by the employees in the Department and I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to them, particularly those on the telecommunications side who faced tremendous difficulties over the last decade.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been made to me from time to time about the postal service but in comparison with Britain and European countries generally our postal services are, by and large, superior.  The number of complaints I have had has been very low.  One does not receive many complaints about late delivery or misdelivery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would, of course, have a very heavy mail.  The number of complaints I can legitimately hand on to the Minister represents a tiny fraction of the complaints received about public services generally and constituents are quick to <Col N="2109" /> complain if public services are poor. I think the postal staffs deserve a particular tribute because of the magnificent work they do.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of Deputies about the inadequacy of the telephone service.  The waiting list has grown now to 32,000.  It was 21,000 in 1971-72 and 27,000 in 1972-73.  Last year I was critical of the previous Minister, Deputy Collins, and I suggested that he had not brought sufficient pressure to bear on the Government to obtain sufficient capital for telephone expansion. I was treated with disdain.  The capital allocation this year is £19 million and that will be inadequate because of the years of neglect of advanced planning.  Industrial development is affected because of the lack of an adequate telephone service.  I do not think the Minister for Finance can slide out of the years of neglect.  That must be placed on record.</P>
      <P>Emergency action will have to be taken by the Minister to improve the capacity of the Dublin exchanges. There is gross overloading in many of the exchanges.  There has been a marked deterioration in the service over the past two or three years. I urge the Minister to examine the situation without delay to see if there is any way in which the service can be improved.</P>
      <P>I would also urge the Minister to set up the recommended Consumer Council for the Department.  Such a body could act very effectively in this area of public administration.</P>
      <P>I have been shocked by the impression abroad with regard to appointments which come under the Minister's direct control.  The impression among people of all shades of public opinion was that one must be a strong political supporter of the party in power in order to get certain jobs in the Post Office.</P>

      <P>The former Parliamentary Secretary gave planning permission in certain areas where I have seen magnificent bungalows with big black, creosote poles destroying the view.  We should insist in many of these areas that underground telephone cables are installed.  I live in County Dublin and between ESB poles, public lighting, TV aerials, Post Office poles and cable television criss-crossing the streets one feels one is living in a wired jungle of houses. As a result the area is unattractive. Perhaps the Minister will consider the point I have raised.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer now to RTE. Deputy Haughey raised some points which I wish to pick up.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Ideally I would like to see a much more widely effective freedom of the airwaves over this island.  I would like, for example, not only to have RTE programmes fully available in Northern Ireland, but also to have programmes broadcast in Northern Ireland fully available throughout the Republic.  I have discussed this with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who believes as I do, that such a development would serve to promote better mutual comprehension and thereby serve the cause of peace and reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would broadly agree with the Minister. I was the former Labour Party <Col N="2113" /> spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs and we had discussions about the problems facing this idea.  The report in <i>The Financial Times</i> of the Minister's meeting with his opposite number in London shortly after this speech highlighted the tremendous political, economic and trade union problems which would face any Minister trying to implement that idea.  These difficulties should not be made light of in any way.  Otherwise we may be creating expectations which may not necessarily be easy to fulfil.  Certainly the economic difficulties are enormous.  In relation to the implementation of this idea one talks I suppose in terms of tens of million of pounds.  The legal contractual difficulties are very considerable. In my opinion it will be at least several years before these difficulties can be overcome even if one were to start negotiations now.  We in the Republic should not rush in as yet, until we have done a great deal of groundwork.  I know many Deputies are acutely conscious of the fact that only 14 or 15 per cent of households in Northern Ireland at present receive RTE.  Even if RTE were available to all households in Northern Ireland, I am not so sure that that reception would increase.  I do not see that many families in Northern Ireland would willingly give up the tremendous facility they have at the moment of the multi-channel TV, three full colour British UTV channels.  They are not likely to turn over to RTE overnight even if it was beamed strongly into Northern Ireland.  I would accept the ideal of the Minister that one should try to beam RTE as much as possible into Northern Ireland and I think the limited scope of that proposition should be travelled first by the Minister in any negotiations he may have with his British counterpart.</P>
    <P>There is the other major problem facing us, the channelling of British television into the Republic, giving people a multi-channel opening in this country.  One might, indeed, pose the question, if it is to be multi-channel, why only the BBC?  Might not European stations ask for multi-channel access to Ireland?  Might not some of the American stations ask for multi-channel <Col N="2114" /> access?  How could one confine it to the BBC and UTV?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of control over cable television is a major problem facing the Minister.  I think the problems here are, indeed, tremendous and I am extremely worried.  Many people in areas such as Cork and Waterford seem to be under the impression that they will have multi-channel television overnight, within a matter of a year or so.  Frankly, looking at it coldly, looking at the immense technical, political, legal, trade union and financial problems, indeed the very problems of commercial advertising on which RTE depend so much, the difficulties are so enormous that one will have to have some very straight talking to the Irish people about the enormity of the proposition itself.  I do not want to sound as if I am throwing cold water on the general approach but I must confess that I think it is time a note of caution was sounded here and I am not speaking from any particular knowledge of Departmental work done in this area or anything like that.  I have no access whatever to that kind of information but I certainly have a healthy regard for the money and the technical problems facing the country in any such extension.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that as an exercise in public information there should be published in printed form the report of the Broadcasting Review Body.  I was looking for a copy recently and I gather it is still in stencilled form.  That first report should be printed and widely circulated and, when the Minister receives the recently requested interim report, he should also have it printed and published as soon as possible and widely circulated because we need a major debate on the future of television.  I do not think the implications are fully understood by the electorate at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be under considerable pressure in the months and years ahead to accept the introduction of commercial radio and television channels into this country.  I see the lobbying starting already.  I am glad <Col N="2115" /> to receive the assurance of Deputy Haughey that he has no particular interest in this area and that, indeed, he is opposed to commercial television and radio.  I am glad that has gone clearly on the record because I was worried about some aspects of his speech this afternoon.  One of the most articulate lobbyists of the commercial radio idea, commercial television as well if he can get away with it, is the Irishman, Eamonn Andrews.  In <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 3rd June, 1973 he said he favoured commercial radio stations.  I quote:</P>
    <P>He reiterated that such stations should be divorced from RTE and must be commercially viable on the same basis as projected British channels and here he was quite frank about his own interests.  &ldquo;Naturally, I would like to have a commercial interest in such a project,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>I do not think he is the first Irishman or the first entrepreneur to have an interest in commercial radio and television. He went on to record, too, as saying that Ireland should have a separate radio system.  I quote further:</P>
    <P>Ideally, Eamonn Andrews would like to see another &ldquo;home-grown&rdquo; television channel, another radio station capable of reaching Europe, at least five local radio stations, say at Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And I would like to see all of them independent of RTE&mdash;not because RTE isn't doing an ever-improving job but because healthy competition will ensure the best service for the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only comment I have to make on that is that the Minister must resist the temptation to hand a licence to print money to any Irishman or any entrepreneur, native or foreign, because commercial radio and commercial television are simply handing a licence to print money to entrepreneurs. You cannot lose if you have a licence for commercial radio.  You cannot lose if you have a licence for a commercial television station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will develop the argument.  I am glad to note from the former Minister's contribution that he, too, is strongly opposed to commercial radio and television but the pro-commercial station lobby will be very vociferous in the years ahead. There must be effective public control and public influence over television and radio development in this country because if broadcasting passes into the hands of commercial entrepreneurs we will have many airwaves and nothing but commercial blurbs hour after hour.  In the long term, television and radio of that kind destroys social and cultural values in a community.  It does nothing more than to create an avaricious consumer orientated community and it would negative any effort by RTE to present a balanced programme to the Irish people.  Also, it could destroy RTE financially within a short time.  For these reasons and because I do not believe that we should hand over our broadcasting service to any commercial interest, I am totally opposed to the proposition and I am glad that the Minister is opposed to it also.</P>
      <P>I would advocate the development of local radio stations within the RTE system.  I do not regard Radio na Gaeltachta as such a station because it is a national station catering for people living in certain parts of the country. It would not cost a great deal of money to have local radio stations.  Perhaps it costs 15 to 20 times less to set up a radio station than to set up a television station.  There is no reason why there should not be a station for the greater Dublin area.  Cork, too, should have one which would serve the greater Munster area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>With cable television <Col N="2117" /> it is possible to have stations in every community as is the case in the U.S.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we should do this on a public service basis rather than on a commercial basis which is the system that operates for the most part in America although I am aware that there are some magnificent public service stations operating in communities there.  The third area in the country in which I would like to see a radio station is the midlands.  We must put greater emphasis on regional broadcasting.  Such broadcasting could be put to very effective use.  Throughout the country today one finds a decline in interest in, for example, party political issues.  It is much easier to persuade members of a local community to attend a meeting relating to some community project than it is to persuade them to go along to a local branch of a political party.  For the greater part these political meetings are unattended and merely serve the party political machines.  They do not reflect local communities any longer.  These people, then, should have access to local radios.  The Church and youth organisations should have access to regional radio in their respective areas. Any development in this field would be welcomed by the community generally.</P>
      <P>Regarding the financing of RTE, we in Ireland must face up to some of the very unpalatable facts in relation to our television service.  Unless we face up to the reality of the question of television financing, we will find RTE floundering between the Minister and their annual statement of accounts. One of the harsh realities of living on a small island with a population of 3,000,000 is that natural resources are very limited.  They are limited whether they be considered on a GNP basis, on a commercial revenue basis or any other basis.  Consequently, the resources available for our national television service must be modest but that does not necessarily mean that the service is to be inferior.  The service can be a very good product but the ambitions of presentation and of functioning must be on a relatively modest scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inception of television in this country was a very brave effort but an effort which will prove increasingly <Col N="2118" /> costly in the future and it will be very difficult to maintain.  We would be very foolish if we did not face up to these facts because we have on our doorstep the British television service which is one of the best in the world, a service that is unrivalled in terms of capacity of resources and of expertise. The three British channels are available to the most densely populated areas of this island.  Anybody calling for multi-channel television here would be very foolish to ignore the economic implications of any such extension of our service. I have not available to me the audience figures for RTE for the east coast but I understand that they are frightening in terms of audience usage. RTE will have to compete increasingly with three British channels for advertising so that the future for us in this regard might be critical.  I have no wish to see excessive advertising on RTE but at the same time there is a bitter choice to be made&mdash;either we shall have to pay a much higher licence fee or have much more commercial advertising on RTE.</P>
    <P>In their annual report, RTE stated that advertising income now accounts for almost 52 per cent of total revenue.  The report went on to say:</P>
    <P>The degree to which broadcasting has become financially dependent on advertising revenue is excessive and undesirable.</P>
    <P>That is quite an admission on the part of the RTE Authority, but it is rather an understatement.  RTE always knew that the licence fee income, which now runs at about 45 per cent of the total RTE revenue, should provide at least 60 per cent of total revenue.  Therefore, the implications facing the Irish people are, that we pay a substantially greater television licence fee or we spend substantially longer looking at advertisements destroying the few decent programmes that are available.  There is the further possibility that this House gives a substantially increased Exchequer subsidy and we pay for it again through direct taxation.  These are the choices facing our country and they are not pleasant.  I do not think successive Ministers for Posts <Col N="2119" /> and Telegraphs have faced up to this problem as they should.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing feature to which attention must be drawn is the enormous cost of coloured television.  I must confess that I am personally enthralled by colour television.  I do not have the money to buy a colour television set, and I regard the rentals as exorbitant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That should have been retrospective, too.  At the moment the three British channels are putting out 150 hours a week of colour transmission.  It is bad enough to have the tendency of the whole of the east coast to switch to one or other of the three British channels, but with cable television in Dublin, if a colour football match is transmitted by any of the three British channels, there is a massive switchover from RTE immediately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only one of the 200,000 householders in this country who have got cable television and who have reception from the three British channels producing 150 hours colour television a week.  In spite of this development, we are not quite clear what RTE intend to do in relation to colour television.  The authority says it has plans for what it calls the phased development of colour television here, but I do not see any massive attempt at conversion to colour operation by RTE.  The cost, <Col N="2120" /> which is enormous, must be faced up to in this House.</P>
      <P>I want to deal very briefly with a couple of points raised by Deputy Haughey.  There is an excessive cattiness on the part of some Deputies in regard to the appointment of Mr. Muiris Mac Conghail to the Government Information Bureau.  The remarks of some of the Opposition Deputies were stupid if not offensive.  The reservations are not shared on this side of the House.  I am quite convinced he will do his job and that he will do it fairly and objectively.  I am somewhat intrigued by Deputy Haughey's proposition for a central information office.  It may have a good deal of merit. Not only is there a need for the revamping of the Government Information Bureau and for the GIB to be more responsive to the needs of the communication media, but also for the re-examination of the whole question of Government Information services. The initial step of having a liaison between the Minister and the newly-appointed head, Mr. Mac Conghail is welcome, and I support that development. One can only wait and see how it works out, but I think one should express goodwill even if one is in Opposition rather than read into it dire prospects which may not prove to be true in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposed Press council, the Minister should consider the possible inclusion of RTE within the ambit of the council.  I know that if this Press council is ever set up it will be set up by the media themselves as a public service and that it will be done on a voluntary basis.  However, it is desirable that Press, radio and television should come within the ambit of whatever terms of reference might be agreed between the various heads of the media if and when they come together to form the Press Council.  I support the idea.  We, as politicians, have to treat any development of this nature with a good deal of circumspection, because it is very easy to be accused of messing in an area where politicians have no right.  However, I would urge that a Press council and the media themselves would not just deal with complaints that might be made from time to time, <Col N="2121" /> or merely set standards of approach which, in their opinion, might be necessary, but would also inspire the media, influence and uplift them, change attitudes in some respects and also reflect what is going on in this country.  That, to my mind, is the function of the media.  I welcome the idea of a council and believe it would be a valuable contribution to the development of the media.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that development I hope the Minister, when he comes to amending the Broadcasting Act, will ensure that written into any review of that legislation is a much greater degree of joint consultation and worker participation. I hope that specific expression will be given to this under any review of the Act.  I hope to see a recognition of the general principle of worker participation.  I do not think that this is met by putting an RTE staff member on to the board of RTE as an appointee of the Minister.  There should be provision for elected worker representatives or trade union appointed representatives to be appointed to the board of RTE.  I recommend that to the Minister as a practical implementation of the commitment of the Coalition Government to introduce a greater element of worker participation to State sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>On the question of worker democracy, I would urge the Minister&mdash;I have been pressing successive Ministers in this matter over the past three or four years&mdash;to give civil rights to Post Office employees.  It is a scandal that in the middle of 1973 this demand, which has been made for as long as I have been a member of a trade union, has not been met.  Negotiations commence and reach a certain level but never seem to come to any conclusion.  I gather that these negotiations have reached a very high level at present but it seems that they have been at such a high level for a long time.  They are always about to conclude but never seem to conclude. While I am not fully conversant with the present state of the discussions between the Post Office unions, the Minister and the Department of Finance, I feel that this announcment should be made as quickly as possible <Col N="2122" /> and that the Post Office staffs should be given political and civil rights.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out on a number of occassions the anomaly of the Post Office employee who may have to climb up a pole to fix a telephone.  If he joins a political party or takes part in political activity, he is crucified.  On the other hand, the man who climbs up an ESB pole to fix a light can be a member of a political party and stand for Dáil Éireann.  A Post Office technician or linesman cannot dare to join a political party or be involved politically.  He is precluded by public service statute.  This anomaly should be removed as quickly as possible.  I am aware that the Minister is fully committed and keenly interested in this area and I feel certain that he will deal with this matter speedily.</P>
    <P>There has been a profound suspicion, for some reason or other, within the Fianna Fáil Party that everybody in the Post Office either supports the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  As every Deputy knows, that is not true.  Political views amongst the Post Office staff very considerably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a question of party political loss or gain one way or the other.  A Post Office linesman or a postman should have every right to stand for Dáil Éireann if he wants to or for the local council, provided this does not cut across his public service.  In Northern Ireland, throughout Britain and Europe this is now accepted practice. They do not have this narrow legalistic interpretation of conditions of employment.  I do not think the case needs to be argued any further because I believe that the Minister will deal with this matter expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the appointment of the RTE Authority I should like to congratulate the Minister on the balance and the personnel of the new authority. The appointments were quite perceptive.  I particularly welcome the appointment from Northern Ireland. These are matters which, in the short and long term, can have a profound impact on the furture of community <Col N="2123" /> relations North and South.  I believe there was widespread public welcome for the new Authority and the Minister deserves to be commended on that appointment.  I feel sure he will appreciate that, because frequently politicians slag one another rather than commend one anothers' actions.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed that Deputy Collins is continuing in the game of self-justification, self-righteous justification. Deputy Collins can be gloriously self-righteous in numerous ways when he wants to but he can also be very nasty.  In the last 12 months, and the last couple of years, he has been particularly nasty in relation to the RTE Authority.  On occasions he has been downright vicious.  For hours on end, as Labour Party spokesman on the Opposition side, I listened to Deputy Collins berate the members of the RTE Authority.  Deputy Collins read voluminous extracts form correspondence about his dealings with the authority and how he had summarily dismissed them.  He seemed to relish the weight of his power on that occasion.</P>
    <P>It was almost as edifying in many respects as it was stupid.  The points he was making about the former authority could have been made without all the bluster and guff that we had during the many weeks this matter went on.  In fairness to the RTE Authority, who were ballyragged so much in this House, not so much the last authority but the one immediately prior to it, if there are any gaps in the record of correspondence and exchanges between the Minister and the authority, the Minister should fill them in so that the record can be set clean in their favour.  By and large, the authority tried to do as best they could.  Some of their actions were not the most discreet, some were not the most effective, but they tried to meet, as far as they could, the wishes of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know what got into the previous Cabinet, but one got the distinct impression that they were quite obsessional about the Board of RTE and the Broadcasting Authority.  It was this obsession which destroyed their <Col N="2124" /> good judgment.  The issues which were raised could have been resolved with goodwill on both sides.  They could have been resolved if the Minister had not been so heavy handed in exercising his political authority.  I should like to ask the Minister to fill in Deputy Collin's ommissions.  It is not sufficient to depend on newspaper articles by former authority members or public comment they made.  In his reply the Minister should deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Having been so critical of Deputy Collins, it is only right to say that I agree with him on one point.  I fully support his statement in the House on 24th of May, at Column 1908 of the Official Report, in which he stated that he does not object to the televising of Dáil proceedings.  I would urge the Minister to use the facilities of RTE and to provide any extra capital necessary for the televising and radio broadcasting of proceedings in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Collins when he also suggested at column 1910, Volume 265, of the Official Report that the matter should be raised in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the composition of which was announced today.  I personally intend to seek support first within my own party for this development.  I have no doubt that there will be a majority in favour of it and there may possibly be unanimous acceptance of the idea.  Subsequently, it would be a matter for discussion within the other political parties.  I believe that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which is widely representative of Deputies, will sympathetically approach the idea of broadcasting radio and television excerpts from the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that there may be considerable difficulties to be overcome in the editing and preparation of such transmissions.  I might even say that the recent row about the Persidential broadcast might possibly help in our approach because we can learn from that type of occurrence.  I think it is generally agreed that there is a need to open up the proceedings of both Houses of the Oireachtas to radio <Col N="2125" /> and television and my personal view is that there should be no great difficulty in having edited transmissions on both radio and television from Leinster House.  I also personally believe that the responsibility for such transmissions should devolve exclusively on the professional staffs of RTE so that politicians will not decide what excerpts from what speeches are to be transmitted which, of course, would be quite improper and an impossible system to operate.  I have sufficient faith in the personal competence of the existing radio and TV staffs in the House and in any additional staff that might have to be recruited to believe they will be equal to this task.  Probably substantial extra staff will be required and extra money for extra studio facilities and so on but I think both sides of the House can be happy about having this innovation introduced.  I know many Members may be very cautious and some very suspicious but I believe it can be done with real agreement between all political parties and I intend to press the Minister to have this innovation introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any function of Deputies to shoot their heads off, as was the custom in the past, about individual programmes on RTE, but I suppose news programmes and their presentation are of direct interest to Deputies in the public service context. I have no comment to make on the text of news but I think we should revert to the old RTE news at either 9.30 or 9.45 p.m. so that Deputies and members of the public who want to get the full international news subsequently from other channels would be free to switch over at 10 o'clock or 10.10 on occasion.  They could thus avail of both regional news&mdash;because the Irish news of the Twenty-six counties tends to be regional whether we like it or not&mdash;and the more international news from the BBC and UTV.  Many of us like to listen to UTV to find out precisely what political developments there have been in Northern Ireland and this results in a mad dash to change from one station to another at 10 o'clock to find out what is going on on the other channel.  Therefore, <Col N="2126" /> I think RTE news should be at 9.30, or alternatively at 9.45, so that one can get the international UK news afterwards.  Perhaps the Minister would use his good offices in that area so as to open up the possibility of being able to hear what goes on in the greater world.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that in general the Minister's speech this year was refreshing.  It was different from other years when one got a long dissertation on the telephone and postal services from the Minister of the day. The present Minister made an attempt to assess the national role of radio and television and put it in a futuristic, national conceptual context.  For this he deserves the thanks of the House and the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I read of the Minister's recent statements and of his discussions with British authorities in regard to the provision of extended services here.  This will be fine if it will be possible within a reasonable time.  Personally, I think it will be very difficult to achieve what is proposed. Reference was made to the Six County area in this context.  We have a number of TV booster stations at various points along the land frontier, one at Moville, another in the Fanad penninsula of Donegal, a second also in Donegal and others right along through Sligo. These stations can and do beam their programmes to the Six County area but, unfortunately, I and other Deputies have endless complaints about the quality of transmission and the very frequent breaks in this service. Instead of talking about bigger plans in the long term&mdash;which, of course, we should also study and discuss and aim to achieve&mdash;we might first get down to improving existing television broadcasts which are available to viewers in the Republic in the areas I mentioned and are also available in the Six County area.  We should ensure that here at least we avoid many of the complaints of our own subscribers and people in the Six Counties.  Although the letter do not pay for this service they should not be subjected to many of the ills that exist at the moment&mdash; I am referring to Breakdowns and interruptions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> In the last few years it amazed me that a number of people in the Six Counties were given unlimited time on RTE in Dublin.  These people advocated theories and proposals contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of the Irish people but much less time was given to those who were striving to put across the idea of peace, cooperation and development in the Six Counties.  As the recent local elections have shown, there is a 98 per cent will for peace in Northern Ireland and several people have openly advocated cessation of hostilities, of killings and murders.  Yet, how many of those people were given time to speak on RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For a long time there was an effort to make the postal services pay their way but in this Department, as in many other Departments, there is an element of social service and to try to eliminate this element is not desirable.  Admittedly we must get from the activities of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as much finance as possible from the customers who use the service but some of the social welfare classes should be given more of the facilities of the Department either free of charge or at reduced rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know television and radio licences are available to old age pensioners under certain conditions but the widow with a family and others are <Col N="2128" /> entitled to these concessions.  In order to encourage the welcome development where people are prepared to remain in their homes in rural Ireland rather than emigrate, in areas where there are no telephone facilities we should arrange for the provision of public telephone kiosks.  On many of the once uneconomic farms people are now able to earn a living and we should give them some of the facilities available in other parts of the country. The benefits of a free or reduced postal service should be given to people, particularly social welfare recipients. If we are able to provide free transport and butter at a reduced rate we should be able to give cheaper postal services.  When providing butter at a reduced rate, the home assistance officer may arrange to have the voucher delivered to the recipient who will hand this to the shopkeeper.  I do not know what will be the cost but it would be as easy to provide either reduced or free postage or at least arrange that social welfare recipients should not be required to pay for urgent telephone calls.</P>
    <P>There have been many delays in postal and telephone services in the northern part of Donegal although I realise it is not the fault of the Minister. Up to recently letters and parcels from the Inishowen area and other areas were sent to Lifford and then through the Six Counties to Dublin. This has not been possible in the past couple of years with the result that mail has to be re-routed through Sligo.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister do something about this?  Is there not a better way? I do not know how the mail is being sent but sometimes letters posted in Dublin do not reach my part of the constituency until the second day and sometimes even later.  It may not be the Minister's responsibility but I urge him to ask his officials to devise some way in which the situation can be improved.</P>
    <P>The other matter I wish to discuss is the telephone service.  The only remedy for present difficulties is the extension of the dialling system and I urge the Minister to speed up the installation of this system for all of County Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> The Minister may be aware of a phone-tapping case which was tried in the Donegal courts.  A temporary night telephonist was used, as the justice said, as a cat's paw by named people who are known to the Post Office.  The unfortunate individual concerned was convicted.  As a result of that case there is disquiet that these same people may use the same type of pressure on others.  We know how many telephones were tapped. I know, and it was proved, that my phone was tapped.  The system used was to channel calls through a third subscriber who listened in to conversations directed to my number.  As I have said, it has given rise to a lot of disquiet locally.  There are fears that it still exits&mdash;that the same people and, perhaps, others are still using the same means&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it amazes me that when this person who was charged made a statement and named certain individuals, no charges were preferred against those people. I appreciate that is not a matter for the Minister or his Department but it would be advisable for him to keep a watchful eye on the situation.  It is something which does not happen often, but it happened, we know why, and an unfortunate individual lost his job because of it.  This has given rise to feelings of no confidence which are not justified on a large scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I interrupted Deputy Desmond when he was talking about political influence in the allocation of sub-post offices.  He exaggerated the situation. I find that at the present time, due to the salary allowances allocated and due to the increased costs of running a sub-post office&mdash;lighting, fuel, rents, rates and so on&mdash;it is impossible in many cases to get people to accept sub-post offices.  I know of one which <Col N="2130" /> the Department have been hawking around a certain area in Donegal but for which they can find no takers.  It carries a salary of £2,500 a year, as much as a Deputy's at the moment, but there are no takers.  It does not involve a night telephone service but it is a seven-day-a-week job and people will not accept the conditions and the work involved.</P>
    <P>If the Department ran that post office themselves it would cost three times as much.  The same applies to other sub-post offices, especially the very small ones.  I know of a case where a sub-post office had to be taken away from an area completely because nobody was prepared to do the work involved for the amount of money allocated.  I suggest that a review takes place of what is being paid to the people who efficiently run sub-post offices in this country, especially in areas that I know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Estimate I am particularly conscious of the title of the Department&mdash;Posts and Telegraphs.  It is to these two matters&mdash;posts and the telephone and telegraphic services&mdash;that I particularly want to address my remarks.  I agree with the Minister's statement when he was moving the Vote:</P>
      <P>As the telephone service is no longer a luxury but an essential for many purposes including business and economic development, a major expansion is required to meet the projected demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have gone further and said that not only is it no longer a luxury economically but that there is also a social aspect.  The telephone service in 1973 has a social context and a social usage and I should like to speak about the service in the private, public and business fields.  I wish particularly to deal with installation delays and the delays in service afterwards, particularly from the point of view of private telephones. Obviously, some new dynamic programme for the provision of private telephones must be made if we are to catch up on the waiting list of 32,000 as of this date.  What will the situation <Col N="2131" /> be next year with so many houses being built?  Last year 27,000 new lines were provided and new subscribers were connected to the service.  I should like to congratulate the outgoing Minister on the magnificent job he did in the provision of telephones.  However, the size of the problem is becoming so enormous that something new and dynamic will have to be done to get to grips with it.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that 27,000 new lines were provided last year, the waiting list grew by 9,500 to the present figure of 32,000.  With the number of new houses now under construction this year, the demand will further outstrip the supply, with a subsequent further increase in the waiting list.  In the Minister's statement I see absolutely nothing to give any hope to the thousands of people on the waiting list that there is any possibility of their being connected to the telephone service in the coming 12 months, or in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the provision of public telephones and public kiosks.  Last year 199 telephone kiosks were erected, mostly in rural areas.  On 2nd May I asked the Minister if he would arrange for the provision of a telephone kiosk at Naul, County Dublin.  The answer was:</P>
    <P>The call office telephone at Naul sub-Post Office is little used and the provision of a street kiosk there is not contemplated at present.  The matter will, however, be reconsidered if there is significant increase in the users of the call office.</P>
    <P>That is typical of the situation throughout the country.  There is no great demand for the telephone service in the sub-post offices during the day because so many business premises are open and have public telephone boxes.  It is at night time, when the sub-post offices are closed, from about 5.30 p.m. or 6 o'clock, that people in the area may want to make an emergency call, and no service is available. Because these sub-post offices are closed there is not the great usage for which the Minister is asking.  If the Minister would take the telephone out of the sub-post office and erect <Col N="2132" /> a kiosk on the street the usage would be improved and would be above the figure quoted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A fairly contradictory type of reply was given to me on 2nd May when I asked the Minister if he would consider the erection of a telephone kiosk at Santry village, County Dublin.  The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>Santry village is served by a call office in the sub-post office and by two existing kiosks in the area.  None of these is extensively used.  It is accordingly not proposed to provide a kiosk at present but the matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The reply I got to a question about the erection of a telephone kiosk at Ard na Meala, Ballymun, was:</P>
    <P>The area in question is regarded as adequately served by public telephones at Ballymun Shopping Centre and at Joseph Plunkett and Thomas Clarke Towers.  The provision of additional public telephone facilities in the area is not considered warranted at present.  The matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>These are fairly typical cases of suburban Dublin at the moment.  Years ago telephone kiosks were erected in certain areas.  Since then estates have been built, not in close proximity to the existing services, but perhaps a quarter of a mile or half a mile away. Because of the distance from the existing kiosks to the new estates, the existing kiosks are not being used as much as they would if they were properly placed.  This is the situation in not only Santry and Ballymun, it is spread right across suburban Dublin. I would ask the Minister to be more broadminded and more lenient in his interpretation of his duties and his responsibilities in the placing of the telephone kiosk.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a constituency in which this problem arrives on the table of the Deputies from the area every day of the week.  My own area adjoins the Minister's and I have a similar problem.  It is in the developing areas that we have the problem of the provision of telephone kiosks in proximity to estates.  The only solution <Col N="2133" /> I see is that, as each new housing estate is being constructed, provision is made for a public telephone, and the kiosk is installed as the estate is being constructed so that when the people move into the area they have this basic facility.  If the Department cannot cope with the demand for private telephones, a public kiosk should be provided for at least each group of 100 houses, or less if possible. There are many villages in north county Dublin which have not got this service.  Every village should have a public kiosk for emergencies and other reasons.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at the amount of vandalism that is rampant in the Dublin area in general, and the damage which is caused to the public telephone kiosks.  I would ask the Minister to request the Minister for Justice to see that more men are put on the beat to protect vital services such as telephone kiosks.  You do not have to go out to the suburban areas to find this.  If you walk along O'Connell Street you can see the way the instruments are ripped from the walls of the kiosk.  They are very severely damaged.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the telephone operators for the courtesy they have always shown me when I asked for a number and so on.  I gather that many of them are young girls.  We should be as courteous as possible to those ladies and gentlemen to generate courtesy in return from them.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the telephone service which is particularly disturbing is in relation to telephones used for business. We are now in the EEC.  There are appalling delays in the provision of extra telephones for the business community.  Each week Members of the House are approached by some businessman who says: &ldquo;I am looking for an extra phone.  I have been looking for it for the last six months and I cannot get it.  Can you do anything for me?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am looking for a second, a third or a fourth line because my business is expanding.  I am trying to export and I cannot get through to my customers.  My customers are complaining that they cannot contact me because of the shortage <Col N="2134" /> of lines and consequently I am losing business.&rdquo;  All of us come across this sort of problem.  It is deplorable in this day and age in which we are trying to generate business, sales and exports, that such an elementary requisite as sufficient telephones should be one of the drawbacks to increased productivity and to our ability to sell abroad.</P>
    <P>There are also complaints about the inadequacy of exchange equipment, an inadequacy which makes confidential telephone calls quite impossible.  I am not now suggesting anything like the case made by Deputy Cunningham.  I am not suggesting there is a determined phone-tapping campaign or anything like that.  I am referring to the overloading of the existing equipment. Every one of us has had the experience of picking up a phone and coming in on a conversation by two strangers as a result of crossed lines.  Indeed, the business community and the public at large are becoming nervous of using the telephone for anything but the most urgent business calls.  That is simply not good enough and I would ask the Minister to bring some dynamism into his approach in an attempt to solve the problem and improve the service.</P>
    <P>Another major problem with which the business community has to contend is the inadequacy of the telex service. It is not uncommon to hear from manufacturers of losses of export orders because of inability to secure telex connection. I met a man who was attempting to build up an export trade as a result of advice and encouragement given to him by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He was hoping for an order from Japan, a country with which we have an adverse balance of payments.  The order was in the region of £10,000, not a very large sum in comparison with our adverse balance; it was essential that he should contact a particular company in Japan on a particular day by telex. He could not get telex connection and eventually he tried to get the company by telephone.  He was unsuccessful in this because of the overloading.  This is an appalling situation and I trust the Minister will take some action to remedy it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> In County Dublin we have a unique problem because of the growth in the population there.  The plan adopted by the Dublin County Council last year envisaged the development of three new cities, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin.  There are other large development areas like Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Swords, Malahide and Portmarnock.  Development is also envisaged in Lucan and other fringe areas.  Houses are being built very rapidly but there is a complete lack of liaison between the Department and the planning authority.  There should be regular consultation between the county council and the Department so that proper cabling can be laid to facilitate both industrialists and private householders in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght district is completely overloaded.  Dialling 50 brings no results because of overloading.  There is a vast industrial complex in Tallaght and every week 20 to 30 new families take up residence in Tallaght.  No proper provision is being made to supply either the industrialists or the residents with this essential amenity. Before Blanchardstown and Clondalkin get off the ground a conference should be held between the Department and the Dublin County Council to ensure that the situation which exists in Tallaght today will not be repeated in either Clondalkin or Blanchardstown or, indeed, in any of the other areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is a strain on the postal facilities in these developing areas. Demand has far outstripped the services available.  The service in Swords is very efficient.  We have a very courteous staff.  The sorting accommodation for letters and parcels consists of a caravan.  It is just not good enough in the light of the large exporting industries in the area and the rapidly growing population.  A similar situation exists in many other developing areas and steps will have to be taken by the Department to make adequate provision for expansion in these areas. The areas will have to get special treatment if postal and telephone services are not to grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to <Col N="2136" /> review the situation with regard to the Skerries-Balbriggan district without delay.  The service for private subscribers is appalling.</P>
    <P>The Minister's introductory speech comprised some 30 foolscap pages.  Of those 30 pages 15 were devoted to the Minister's views on Irish culture and on the development of RTE.  Radio and television are providing an excellent amenity for people generally and I am in no way anxious to downgrade their work but there are other equally, if not more important, aspects with which the Minister could with advantage have dealt in greater depth.  Be that as it may, the Minister, speaking on broadcasting, and I take it as an omen of depressing news for the not-too-distant future said:</P>
    <P>However, RTE have claimed that a significant increase in licence fee revenue will be needed in 1973-74 because of higher current expenses</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will deny them this increase in licence fees.  I am sure their expenses are going up nowadays, because everything is going up following the budget increases imposed by the Government.  I hope the advertisers will be made to pay for any increases in the services.  They may say that advertising rates are very high and that if the rates are increased the amount of advertising might drop.  Advertising, as any other business expense, can be written off as an expense against taxation.  The advertisers can claim tax relief.  I see no reason why the large organisations which do so much advertising should not be made pay for the increase and not the ordinary people whose only enjoyment is to sit at home watching television.  Why should they be further penalised for this one satisfaction in their lives?</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that the Minister speaks of an increase in licence fees.  We have seen many other increases in his Department.  Following the budget statement of the Minister for Finance there are to be increases in the postal and telephone charges. An increase in the licence fees is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> The Minister referred to the limit of 500 homes to be supplied with wired television from a single mast. I suggest waiting for the report of the Broadcasting Committee to see whether this figure should be increased. The figure of 500 is far too low.  I represent an area in Ballymun. For the benefit of those Members who are not familiar with the area I should tell them that it is divided into two sections, nine-tenths of which are a corporation development, part of which is in the county area, and a county council development in the centre of the corporation area. There are approximately 150 homes in this particular development.  It is of recent construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister represents part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister represents a little area in it.  I realise that.  Because of the restriction of 500 homes per mast we find that some county council residents are unable to get piped television.  At the same time, because their homes are surrounded by the towers of Ballymun the service, even for RTE, is appalling. This rigid regulation of 500 homes per mast should be stretched so that an area such as that of which I speak may be supplied with wired television.  The limit of 500 is too low when one considers the size of the residential community as envisaged in the development plan of the county council.  The development plan envisaged the units to include schools, shopping centres and play lots.  There would be 1,500 or 2,000 homes in one of these areas in a single compact unit.  The regulation should be changed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister represents a suburban area.  There are some estates in which the suppliers of piped television have approached residents associations and signed up the residents with promises of piped television within one to three months.  It is not unfamiliar to have delays of 12 to 18 months.  Such delay is not good enough.  The Minister might have discussions with the commercial interests involved with the provision of piped television to see if something <Col N="2138" /> could be done to improve the services provided at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the extended broadcasting hours.  He said that:</P>
    <P>extended broadcasting hours would serve relatively small audiences but the cost of making programmes to fill them could raise the licence fee for everybody.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with this.  There would be a demand for advertising time in these off-peak hours.  Many industrial workers throughout the country are on shift work.  Some are on permanent night work.  Some work irregular hours. All these workers miss some of their favourite programmes.  They miss football matches which they would like to see.  Surely extended broadcasting hours would not necessitate the making of programmes.  There could be re-runs of certain football matches or particular serials, as happens on radio.  This would give facilities to certain sections of the community without massive increases in the licence fees.  There would be enough advertisers interested in taking advertising time at various hours of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about colour television.  Having seen colour television one is not inclined to revert to black and white television.  Colour gives a completely new dimension, particularly to sporting programmes and variety shows.  I can appreciate the problem of the massive financial burden which would be imposed on RTE if they were immediately to buy extra cameras and equipment to provide full colour transmission from Montrose.  However, a large proportion of the television time in this country is taken up with the use of imported material and a certain amount of this at present is being transmitted in colour but much of it is being transmitted in black and white. Surely it should be possible for any programme bought from abroad at high cost to be transmitted to the Irish public in its best form, and its best form of course would be its colour form.  A rapidly increasing number of people have got colour television sets in their homes.  I have not, but there is still hope.  Many people like to visit <Col N="2139" /> a licensed establishment, especially on a Saturday night, to watch &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; or some other programme. RTE should transmit as much colour material as possible even if it is imported material.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>The Government have asked me to assume certain responsibilities in relation to the Government Information Bureau.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister is not capable of handling this responsibility. However, the Minister is a very busy man with a staff of approximately 23,000 under his command. There is a backlog of telephone and postal service problems which, if they were to be solved, would take every minute of the Minister's time and at least another 24 hours in every day. I suggest that the Minister should take another look at this job that has been given to him.  He should request the Taoiseach to take it back and give it to some other Minister who is not quite so busy.  I have no doubt the Minister, with his vast experience of the media, would be able, if he had the time to fulfil these duties but I fail to see how a Minister responsible for a staff of 23,000 and with a backlog of 32,000 applications for private telephones, with a telex service in the appalling condition it is in, and with all the other ills of his particular Department, can find the time to carry this extra load that has been placed on his shoulders by the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like, as a new Deputy, to thank the Department for the courtesy and help I have received.  I am very grateful to the staff of the Department. I should also like to thank the Minister.  I have received prompt replies to any letters I have sent to him.  I should also like to record my appreciation of the staff of RTE for the courtesy and assistance I have received from them at all times.  I hope that next year the Minister will be able to lay before this House a statement showing that a large proportion of those on the waiting list for public telephones have been supplied <Col N="2140" /> and that the demand for telephone kiosks has also been met as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House because I do not think it is necessary.  I shall only speak for a few minutes on some points which I have raised on numerous occasions in the past.  Unfortunately, some of my suggestions went unheeded for too long.</P>
      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be divorced completely from RTE and the Government Information Bureau.  RTE and the Government Information Bureau should be separate Departments.  I should like to see the Department of Posts and Telegraphs <i>per se</i> becoming a completely independent corporation and having a greater opportunity for development.  This is the only answer to the problems of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I am personally plauged by the problem of not getting my mail in time in the morning.  I make complaints and it is sorted out for a week or two.  Mail posted to me last Friday has not reached me yet.  This is wrong.  I complain over and over again and I do not get satisfaction.  I get innumerable excuses.  I hope the Minister will look into this.  In my area there are many complaints from business houses about the delivery service.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that postal costs have been increased.  This is regrettable. We had a major increase a couple of years ago.  Our postal rate is very high, far in excess of that in Britain. We will have to look seriously at this problem.  It will mean a considerable increase in business costs and it will also throw an extra burden on the telephone service because people will say it is not worth while sending a letter, that they might as well telephone. I would consider it more worthwhile to telephone a person than to write at the present high cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the telephone directory, I made a complaint two years ago, one year ago and I am making it again now.  I asked in relation to Subscriber Trunk Dialling if the areas could be set out in alphabetical <Col N="2141" /> order.  The Minister's predecessor scoffed at the idea, yet, on page 5 it is listed only according to code and not in alphabetical order according to the area.  I raised this matter during the Estimate debate two years ago and I raised it last year also.  I hope it will be rectified now.  I blame the officials in the Department who continue to ignore this point.  Alphabetical order is used in respect of the Belfast and London areas; but if I want to know whether Corofin is on an SDT dialling system it is necessary for me to go right down along the list. Whoever is responsible for this information in the directory seems to lack any sense.  These green pages should be reviewed as a matter of urgency and the emergency numbers as well as those for the sending of telegrams should appear on the front page together with directory inquiries, <i>et cetera.</i> Is it not logical that such information should be on page one rather than on page seven? These changes would not involve any great cost and the small amount of work involved by Department officials in rearranging the order of the directory would eliminate many of the irritating problems now encountered by subscribers.  I am confident that my suggestions and advice will be borne in mind now that we have a new Minister who is prepared to listen.</P>
    <P>In his brief the Minister did not pay a great deal of attention to any aspect of his Department other than RTE, but I can appreciate this because he could not have been aware of the numerous problems relating to his Department as opposed to RTE on which he made some policy statements. No new Minister would have been able to dwell at length on such problems as I have mentioned because it would take months to become fully aware of them.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is inadequate. At times it is difficult to understand how people keep their sanity because of the frustrations they endure while endeavouring to get connections.  Even from this House it is very difficult to get outside numbers.  Numbers in certain areas of the city are very difficult to obtain.  For instance, I have had <Col N="2142" /> continuous difficulty with numbers which start with the digit &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The increasing vandalism to telephone kiosks causes me much concern. It is difficult for those people who have private telephones to appreciate the difficulties which confront those who rush in emergencies to public kiosks only to find that the telephone has been taken away.  Recently I happened to see a bus conductor being assaulted. I rushed to a public kiosk to call the Garda but found that there was nothing left inside the kiosk.  Last year I suggested that the Department should consider the introduction of some type of mobile patrol of public kiosks in the city area to ensure that they are kept in order.  However, that suggestion was ignored.  In this regard the Department should seek the help of the public.  The television and radio media might be used to emphasise to the public the importance of keeping public telephones intact.  It would be helpful, too, if the Department of Education would have this matter mentioned in schools. Perhaps they might even have officials call to the schools about it.  Very often parents do not realise that their own children may be the vandals and that they themselves may be the victims in some emergency, such as having to call a doctor.  A positive programme on the part of the Department of Education might help to solve the problem.  In any case, the only solution can be by way of education.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we are to solve the problem of the backlog of applications for telephones.  There is a very shortsighted outlook in the Department in this respect.  They have not realised that this country has been making progress and expanding in business.  This fault of the Department goes back over a number of years.  For some considerable length of time it was known that we were likely to join the EEC but no effort was made to gear our telephone service for that event and, as a result, businesses are losing out and are at a disadvantage.  Nowadays a telephone cannot be regarded as a luxury because it is a necessity.  Massive capital investment is called for in providing an adequate and effective service.  Perhaps the introduction of special bonds might <Col N="2143" /> be considered as a means of raising the necessary moneys for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Post Office develop a more businesslike approach in so far as competition with the banks is concerned.  In this regard the provision of a cheque book service for depositors would be very helpful and would result in much more money being invested in the Post Office. During the past three years I have put forward this proposal but it, too, has been ignored.  Unlike the Post Office in Britain, we missed out on the Giro system and left it to the banks to operate.  I regret that the Post Office did not consider the system worth developing.  We could expand our Post Office savings immensely by introducing bearer bonds.  Such bonds were in existence at one time and I understand that they brought in a considerable amount of money to the Post Office.</P>
    <P>Having had experience of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs down through the years, I cannot be but critical of them.  I received from them recently an indecipherable card in Irish acknowledging letters that I had written to them.  Why should this be so? I want to receive these cards printed in English and all my constituents want them in English also.  I have a right to this.  Why should I be discriminated against if I do not wish to read Irish? The Department have no right to send out a card in Irish only.  While I like the Irish language I wish these cards to be sent to me in the English language which is my spoken language.</P>
    <P>Regarding our broadcasting service, I consider it a great pity that in the city people do not use the radio to a greater extent.  The radio programmes are very good and are listened to widely in the early part of the day but in the evenings that is not the case.  I would say that in the Dublin area radio is not listened to at all in the evenings.  One wonders why radio must have its own news service and news readers when the same news is read on television. Why must there be a special staff for each in the evening? We are talking about costs and here is one area where there is duplication.  There does not <Col N="2144" /> seem to be any reason why there should not be a recording or why the news on radio and television should not be transmitted at the same time.  It would not inconvenience people and I cannot see why it could not be done.</P>
    <P>I am all for piped television.  People have a right to it and to the British television programmes.  For too long we have been too insular, too narrow minded in our thinking.  We have not developed our outlook because we have never had much access outside our own little island.  This is the cause of a lot of trouble in our country.  I think it is due to the fact that we do not get an opportunity to expand our minds by contact with the outside world.  The greatest boon that could come to this country is to watch British programmes through piped TV.  I was in the United States and in Britain, and I do not think it was to my disadvantage that I made contact with outside people.  I think it broadened my mind.  Even if we only got the opportunity to hear the different viewpoints expressed in the news bulletins from the BBC and the Northern Ireland Television Service it would be to our advantage.  If we could establish closer contact with the people in the North through television, it would help us immensely.</P>
    <P>Television and radio will have to change in our country.  We have the problem that the cost of national television is increasing very much and the problem as to what pays for it: licence fees, State subvention or advertising. These are problems that any Government and any Minister must face.  I am demanding here in Questions that we take drink advertisments off television. At the same time we must be realistic and ask: if they take drink off what else will they advertise, or who will pay the money? I would like to see drink advertisements off TV.  It is a great danger to our youth that they may be conditioned to thinking that social events, social prowess and social achievements are all associated with the taking of alcohol.  I did campaign to get cigarette advertising off TV and I still want it off.  I would hope to hear a policy statement from the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I must look at the <Col N="2145" /> situation and ask: &ldquo;What about the poor woman in Drimnagh, Crumlin or Ballyfermot who has to try and pay for the cost of a television licence? The cost of a TV licence is a heavy burden on a person in poor circumstances.  They are putting away the few shillings every week to try and make up the cost, and they will say to me: &ldquo;It is a month overdue.  Will I get jail?&rdquo;  We can say: &ldquo;We can write in and get you an extension,&rdquo; but to them it is a big worry. Are you going to say to these people: &ldquo;We have increased your television licence.  You will have to worry a little more but you will not see any drink advertisements on TV&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The problems facing us are these: First, are the overheads too high? Secondly, is the advertising rate sufficient, and from the point of view of the dwindling viewers in the eastern area it would seem that the advertising rates are far in excess of what they should be, according to different industries and businesses.</P>

      <P>I know we will not be able to control it, but at least we will have stations in Britain that will not have advertising at all, the BBC, so we have that choice.  I agree with the Deputy we will not be able to control it, but I still think there will be benefit to our people from exposure to British television.  I like to hear the other viewpoint.  I would not object to my children watching BBC or ITV. They have a right to hear the other viewpoint and they should benefit from it.  I was just asking: are the overheads too high? Is it top heavy? Is the advertising sufficient or should the licence fees go up or should we consider a greater State subvention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the time, with cable television, when there will be local television stations.  As I said just a while ago in an interruption, in the United States they are going for these small community television stations with cable TV.  The Community are involved in this with small television stations for different areas.  The only answer to the challenge to British television is involving the community in the television station.  The British newspapers cannot complete against the provincial paper or the Irish paper; they have the local gossip, the local news.  The British newspapers have tried to get into the Irish market by having a small section incorporating local Irish news.  We must develop this policy of community involvement in television and radio.  It is possible.  It has been done with communities as small as 20,000 in the United States through cable TV.  It is possible to have direct involvement of the community. People can talk through television and have an interchange of communication.  It is being done and I do not see why it could not be tried in this country.  We could learn from this system.  If possible an official from the Department should be sent out to study what is happening there and how the community are able to control their own local television.  It is very interesting and instructive to see how it is done there.  A very interesting book has been published by the Nader organisation.  <i>A Public Citizen's Manual</i> by Donald Ross.  This book <Col N="2147" /> discusses community television and cable television and how communities can benefit from their local television once the safeguards are built in, once when the franchise is given for cable television, the community, the consumer, has the guarantee of proper service and development.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to learn from this.  I think it is the answer.  The national television may not be the answer but local television and radio is the answer.  The British system can never do this; it can never provide the local news and gossip.  National newspapers have not replaced provincial newspapers for the simple reason that the local gossip is in the local paper. I think we should look at this carefully.</P>
    <P>I think it is a failing of the national television that we have not succeeded in involving the local community. Even before we progress to the local television stations we should look at television programmes and see how we can involve the community a little more.  If we are to retain the viewing audience we will have to have community programmes.  This is something which we are not doing at present.  We hear, and see, the same people over and over on radio and television.  There is a creeping nepotism in television in that we see the same people running the programmes. This is a mistake and we will have to look at this matter again.</P>
    <P>While not casting any reflections on anybody in charge of programmes shown on television I think there is a &ldquo;father-son&rdquo; thing on these programmes. We need new blood and an infusion of new ideas into these radio and television programmes.  This would be to the advantage of television in general.  A lot of good programmes could be produced at low cost.  These programmes could involve the local community who would speak about their problems.  With the local community participating in these programmes they would be of great public interest and could be produced at very low cost.</P>
    <P>Last year, while on a visit to Washington, I saw a local community council discussing, on television, the problems <Col N="2148" /> in their area.  On the programme also was the head of the police.  They all participated in a very informal discussion which had a very high viewing rating due to the fact that it concerned the public.  I learned that this programme was produced at a very low cost.</P>
    <P>We have to look at piped television. I do not think we have a right to discriminate against people in certain areas of our country&mdash;for example Cork, Kerry, the south-west region and the west&mdash;from seeing British television.  We have a right to provide a service which will enable the people in these parts of the country to view programmes on the British networks.  This restrictive practice of 500 to the masthead is wrong and I hope the Minister will be courageous enough to make a rapid decision on this.  I had hoped that he would have been in a position to make an announcement about it during this debate because, in reply to a question of mine, he indicated that an interim report would be available to him at the end of May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by stating that any contribution I have to make to this debate is not by way of criticism of the present Minister or his predecessor. I have been listening to a number of contributions which have been made on this matter.  Most of the speakers who have spoken so far represent urban areas and they have been addressing themselves to matters such as piped television.  I should like to concern myself with matters of a rural nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> I should first like to refer to the Post Office services.  In the main, we can feel satisfied with the services which are being provided.  Indeed, when one considers the plight of the subpostmaster, the hours he has to work and the service which he renders to the public, one is obliged to express concern about the working conditions of these officials.  These sub-postmasters provide the facilities for the public, the light and the room free of charge, and all they are paid is a mere pittance.</P>
    <P>The best way to illustrate their plight is to quote the case of a sub-postmistress who came to me recently about her problem.  This particular individual receives in the region of £9 per week from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  For this she has to work 54 hours per week.  If my mathematics are correct this means that this person receives about three and one-third pence per hour for a service she is providing for the public.</P>
    <P>The postmistress's husband is in receipt of social welfare or unemployment benefit.  Up to the time that his wife was successful in securing the post office he was in receipt of £7 per week.  Recently this allowance was cut to 45p per week.  This is the income on which these people have to try to survive because they have this small post office.  Bearing in mind the responsibilities people of this type have&mdash; very often they have to take in very large deposits from the Department to pay out social welfare and other benefits&mdash;it is time that the Department had a good look at the position and did something on behalf of these people.  Very often these people are obliged to be in attendance at the office from 8 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening to operate the telephone service.</P>
    <P>In regard to the telephone service, I should like to suggest to people in the cities who complain about the inadequancy of the telephone service that they journey to rural parts to ascertain what exactly is happening there.  Quite recently I sent a letter to the Minister asking that a telephone Kiosk be provided in a parish where there is one public telephone and where people have to travel up to ten miles if <Col N="2150" /> they wish to use a telephone.  This is the reply I received from the Department:</P>
    <P>I am to refer to your letter of 30th April about the provision of a telephone Kiosk at Shranmonragh Ballycroy, Westport, Co. Mayo. Kiosks in rural areas are being provided on the basis of replacing post office call offices which are being used to a fair extent.  Those which are most used are not being dealt with first.  Kiosks are not being provided at places such as Shranmonragh where there is no post office.  In the circumstances it is the regretted that there is no early prospect of a kiosk being provided there.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to appear dramatic about this but my reason for writing to the Minister about that area was because of an experience I had about 18 months ago when travelling there. I gave a lift to a woman who had come out of hospital and she was going to inquire about her baby who had been kept in hospital.  She had to travel about eight miles from the point I have mentioned to the nearest telephone kiosk.  There was no hackney car in the village; she had to depend on getting a lift; she had no guarantee of a lift home.  Here, I have this letter stating that it will not be possible to provide a telephone kiosk in that area for a quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I know the Department try to balance their budget but social consideration arise here and I think the Minister must try to get funds from the Department of social Welfare or the Minister for Finance to provide these services.  It is all very well to talk about piped television and other amenities city people have but it is time rural areas got their share of the national cake and that services which are absolutely essential were provided in these backward areas.  A telephone should be provided in every school area at least.  I do not think that in 1973 we are asking the Department to do too much in asking them to provide that facility.  People are becoming more telephone-conscious and this is an absolutely essential service which is also necessary in an emergency to call a priest or a doctor. <Col N="2151" /> It is ridiculous that people have to travel so far to get a telephone.  I know of people who come to work in Dublin, go into flats and have to wait only about five or six weeks to get a telephone which is not really necessary: they would not have to go far to a public telephone.  When one compares the situation in rural areas with that in the towns and cities one must agree that it is time to stop thinking about Dublin where everything seems to be concentrated.  One would think that Dublin was the only part of the country that really matters.</P>
    <P>Services are completely inadequate in tourist areas.  Very often the subpostmaster will not get the help the seeks from the Department in the tourist season and has to stay up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. answering phone calls. He has to be satisfied with one or two lines to the nearest exchange.  The Minister should try to provide some funds to finance a crash programme to improve existing facilities.  Perhaps if some sort of Development board were set up in the Department it would be possible to improve the existing situation.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about television in the debate.  We should concentrate on programmes having a cultural or educational value.  Most of the programmes we are forced to watch are really geared towards American or English audiences and neither American nor English society has anything to offer; on the contrary, we have a culture and a way of life of which we should be proud and it is high time that some of our own artists who are capable of providing the type of entertainment our people as a whole wish to see should have an opportunity of doing so.  The Minister should ensure that our artists who have to emigrate because they have not sufficient reward at home should get the opportunity of providing entertainment at home and so help to preserve our culture and language and all that goes with them.</P>
    <P>Do dhein mé tagairt an lá eile do Radio na Gaeltachta agus dúirt mé nach raibh mé sásta le gnéithe áirithe maidir leis an Radio féin.  San chéad <Col N="2152" /> áit caithfimid anois a bheith sásta go bhfuil Radio na Gaeltachta ann; tá bród orm go bhfuil an stáisiún ansin. Tá cláracha anois, amhráin, ceol agus agallaimh atá ag tabhairt taithnimh agus sásaimh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Bhí seo á iarraidh acu le fada agus is maith an rud go bhfuil a fhios ag iomlán na tíre anois go bhfuil Gaeltacht ann agus go bhfuil brí agus beocht agus uaisleacht ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a bhí an Teachta Brugha ag caint ar na mallaibh luaidh sé cuid de na cláracha agus dúirt sé go raibh siad go leadránach.  Aontaím leis nach bhfuil na cláracha uilig chomh maith agus ba clóir iad a bheith ach lig dom an méid seo a rá.  Tá aithne agus eolas agamsa ar chuid mhór de na daoine atá i mbun oibre ins na stáisiún agus caithfidh mé a admháil go bhfuil suim acu ina gcuid oibre agus go bhfuil siad ar a ndícheall.  Gaeilgeoirí ó dhúchais a bhfhurmhór agus tá a gcroíthe ina gcuid oibre agus má tá locht ar bith ar na cláracha ní ar na daoine seo é. Sílim gur ceist airgid atá ann agus go bhfuil siad ag déanamh a ndíchill chun cláracha suimiúla a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile maidir leis na fóirne atá ag obair sna stáisiúin seo.  Sílim nach bhfuair cuid acu mórán seans le staidéar nó le cleachtadh a fháil ar an radio.  Iarraim ar an Aire chuile sheans a thúirt dóibh cleachtadh d'fháil ar an obair atá idir lámhaibh acu.  Má dheineann an tAire é sin tá mé cinnte go mbeidh siad in ann cláracha a chur ar fáil a bhéas níos suimiúla agus a thabharfaidh níos mó taithnimh do dhaoine.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister has a lot on his hands and we do not expect him to rectify everything at once but he will have the co-operation of every Deputy if he tries to effect an improvement in the matters I have mentioned.  People living in towns and cities have many amenties that are not available to those living in rural Ireland and, for that reason, I would appeal to the Minister to do his utmost to help the people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom traoslú leis an Aire agus beidh chuile dhuine ar an dtaobh seo den Teach ag déanamh a dhíchill chun cuidiú leis a chuid cláracha a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Is cuimhin liom dhá bhliain ó shin go ndearna mé tagairt don chlár céanna agus go ndúirt mé go raibh díomá orm go raibh an Béarla ag brú isteach air.  Anois, caithfidh mé a rá go mb'fhéidir go raibh dul amú orm. B'fhéidir go mb'fhearr beagáinín Béarla a bheith ann, go meallfadh sé sin breis lucht féachana.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and to wish him a stay there as long as he himself would wish it, as successful as he himself would have it, and to ask him to be prepared for comment and criticism from this side of the House in keeping with that which he so ably and eloquently delivered when we were in reverse positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with his opening speech.  I propose&mdash;as Deputy Gallagher said, gach duine agus a chiall féin aige: everyone to his own liking&mdash;to deal with that which in my <Col N="2155" /> opinion is the most important section of the speech.  As far as I am concerned the section of it which would engage my attention most is that which refers to administration&mdash;more than administration, perhaps, the philosophy of radio and television.</P>
    <P>In this respect I note that it is contemplated that changes will occur. It is contemplated that the 1960 Act will be changed, that certain alterations will occur, and I am concerned that in these alterations matters which were fundamental in the 1960 Act will not be changed.  I am fully mindful of the fact that the Minister indicated his intention to agitate the minds of Deputies with a view to getting their respective opinions on these proposed changes.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is my intention to devote my contribution practically exclusively to the part of his speech in which the Minister spoke about these changes as reported at column 874 of the Official Report for 10th May, 1973, in which the Minister gave an extract from section 17 of the 1960 Act beginning with the words &ldquo;In performing its functions&rdquo; and concluding with &ldquo;the attainment of those aims&rdquo;.  There is reference in that extract to the restoration of the Irish language.  When one reads column 875 one finds the Minister referring to that extract and it appears to me he creates a certain doubt as to whether the language to which we refer is the Irish language.</P>
    <P>You could have an academic discussion, looking at this, as to whether that is or was the case.  On the other hand, I would say that there would not be or should not be any doubt at all in the mind of the reader that the language referred to is the Irish language, admittedly not the language at the moment of the majority of the people but the language that was the language of all the Irish people, the language that we hope will one day be one of the languages of all the Irish people, the language which more than anything else gives an identity to the people of this island, which is not, as has been said, narrow or insular.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> If language, tradition or custom is narrow or insular, then that has been the position since the world began. There is nothing narrow, nothing insular about the pursuit by ethnic groups of characteristics peculiar to themselves, of a characteristics way of life which was of their forebears. There is nothing strange, narrow or insular about the rational pursuit of the traditions of their forebears by any living generation.  Far from it. It can be shown that if bigger, broader nations could have the traditions and the language which we have they would be very happy to exchange places with us.</P>
    <P>I would hope that in the matter of Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann making their contributions towards the restoration of the Irish language there would be absolutely no ambiguity, no doubt as to the language to which we refer.  Indeed it would be a very sad day for Ireland, and not a very useful day for us, if we decided that the language referred to there was the English language.  This in the ultimate is what is at stake. We can conjecture whether it is the Irish language because it is not the language of the majority of the people.  We can conjecture that what the people had in mind was the English language because that is the language spoken by the majority of the people of the island.  But, as I have said, that is only academic.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the language referred to in the extract in the Act, is the Irish language and I repeat that I hope there will be no departure from that.  I hope there will be no watering down of the objective. On the contrary, I hope that the efforts will be intensified and that perhaps there will be a new approach to find the best way of doing this.  As far as I am concerned there must be no departure from the objective.</P>
    <P>Each person here will interpret radio and television in his own way. As the Minister said, he will speak here on behalf of the people he represents. In certain matters&mdash;I do not know whether this applies to other Deputies&mdash;I would make a distinction. I do not claim that every time <Col N="2157" /> I speak here I speak with direction, or that I speak having been consulted by my constituents.  At all times, however, when speaking here I satisfy myself that anything I say, irrespective of whether it is the view of the majority of my constituents, I am prepared to defend before them.  That is an area in which I think the Minister's speech has not got the spirit or the core that I would like to see it have.</P>
    <P>I know that, as happens in the case of every Minister, every word in his speech need not necessarily be his own.  Later on&mdash;and here again I am talking about matters which could be claimed on the one hand, or dismissed on the other, as being philosophical&mdash; where the Minister would talk of giving people that which they want and also that for which they are able to pay, I am not too sure that I could say I would be in absolute agreement with that.</P>

      <P>Not unqualified entirely. I know we must all be always concerned about those two points. There seems to be too much of an emphasis on them and, perhaps, not enough on other matters which I would regard as equally important, and perhaps more important.  I share the Minister's view where he talked about opening windows.  On the other hand, we must bear in mind that, while it is important that we open windows, we must make sure that, if and when a draft blows, or if and when it is necessary to close windows, that will be possible.  If we are to preach a policy of giving people everything they want with one condition, that they can pay for it, and open up all the windows which they would want, we could find ourselves in the situation that, perhaps, it might have been better that the country never heard a radio or saw a television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this&mdash;and Deputy Gallagher has referred to it&mdash;I believe we have in Ireland material, personnel and artistes who can present programmes of the highest quality.  I was disappointed over the weekend, when attending the <Col N="2158" /> Comhaltas Ceoltóirí function in St. Stephen's Green, and also in the National Stadium last night, that I did not see the television cameras.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell has left the scene. It is a small point, but I wonder if, when speaking of the manner in which American television impressed him, he read the Minister at paragraph 879. I am certain of one thing: when the Minister and Deputy O'Connell were in the United States they were certainly not on the same deputation. They were certainly not on the same wavelength.</P>

    <P>I am disappointed there has not been an extension of &ldquo;Telefís Scoile&rdquo;. &ldquo;Telefís Scoile&rdquo; should be made available in our primary schools.  With the new curriculum there could and should be ample accommodation for <Col N="2160" />&ldquo;Telefís Scoile&rdquo; in our primary schools.  It is at this age that young boys and girls might be attracted to Telefís Éireann and we should have programmes of a character which would impress them.  If we do not have such programmes then we cannot blame them if they go elsewhere.  We should have programmes designed to attract them to looking at Telefís Éireann rather than at some other station.  I hope to see an extension of &ldquo;Telefís Scoile&rdquo;, especially in the field of career guidance.  An effort has been made in the schools to appoint career guidance officers.  That is all very well but we should not exclude the parents.  Children are in need of the counsel and advice of their parents.  Unfortunately, not all parents are familiar with the changes that have taken place and I would hope that Telefís Éireann would present programmes aimed at the parents to enable them to decide into what sphere of employment they should direct their children when they leave school.</P>
    <P>At the moment our educational policy is directed almost exclusively to the middle income class, those who do not need this guidance, and it has tended to exclude those sections for whom the possibility of their children availing of post primary education has come rather late.  These are the people who are most in need of assistance in the matter of how and where to place their children.</P>
    <P>I listen a great deal to the radio.  I am impressed by radio programmes. Years ago I had an interest in drama and production.  I do not know what the commercial difficulties are.</P>

      <P>I mentioned at the beginning that I assumed the Minister to be expecting, from this side of the House especially, certain comment and certain criticism.  I have referred, superficially at least, in a critical fashion to one or two sections of the Minister's speech.  Before concluding I should like to refer to another section of it where, when I read it, I was at a loss to know why the Minister should have spoken as he did.  I refer to the Minister's reference to the membership of the RTE Authority.  I see the names of the new authority.  I know one or two of these people personally.  I know others by repute.  I would be prepared to accept them, as the Minister has said, as the makings of a competent team, a team in which the people would have confidence. My confidence in them was slightly affected by the reference which the Minister made to the fact that there were other people whom he would like to have had on the authority.  The fact of his saying that there were other people&mdash;the Minister did not say whether there were one, two, three, four, five or nine other people&mdash; suggested to me that the people nominated here could be in part or in whole what might be described as &ldquo;the second nine&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clear up this point as to whether this is the best team available, or whether it is the best team except for one or two people on it.  Again I would like to comment&mdash;and I know I am ending on a critical note&mdash;on the fact that with reference to members of authorities who are gone for one reason or another, it was unwise, and perhaps indiscreet to talk about the loss of one as against the loss of others. By innuendo at least the Minister cast reflection on those who were not mentioned.  The Minister seems to be at a loss to understand what I am referring to.  I am referring to the fact that the Minister singled out Professor Moody, a member of a previous authority.  I have no doubt that Professor Moody is a scholar and was an excellent member of the authority, but in singling him out the Minister automatically cast some reflection on other members.</P>

      <P>Here we have the problem as to whether or not succeeding Ministers will aim at imitating previous Ministers, or whether we are going to stand over their decisions, or what the standard is.  I have not referred and do not refer to that which is gone.  I could, perhaps, say that which is gone might be with us again before very long.  I do not know Perhaps that is the way things are going.  Whatever Minister is in office at the moment is the Minister to whom I address my remarks through the Ceann Comhairle.  The Minister will see that last year and in the previous year I was possibly as critical of his predecessor as I am of him.  I repeat what I said earlier: if we are conscious that we are endeavouring to show sensitivity for the feelings of other people obviously when we single out one person for compliments we automatically cast certain reflections on the other people. If that was not his intention when the Minister is replying perhaps he will correct the false impression which I got.</P>

      <P>Most of what I meant to say has been said already by Deputy Gallagher.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I should like to congratulate him also on listening patiently to the various speeches today.  It shows that the Minister has an interest in his Department. I shall not repeat what has been said except for a few words of what Deputy Gallagher said.  There was a very famous man in your position at one time, a Cheann Comhairle, and he said that the people of the west were the aristocracy of Ireland.  They are very much neglected at the moment particularly in regard to the telephone service.  We hear a lot about the cities and of course a city Deputy is entitled to his point of view.  I know the Minister said that as a first priority he intends to provide a telephone kiosk wherever there is a post office.  That is fair enough, but there are various places where there are no post offices and where a telephone kiosk is badly needed so that people can telephone for a doctor.  People are forgetting too, that farming is becoming a business and the intensive farming which must be done in order to make small farms viable means that one should be able to get in touch with a veterinary surgeon. If one is engaged in pig production or milk production a telephone service is most important.  A farmer must be a businessman if he is to stay in farming and he must be able to make immediate contact with a veterinary surgeon.  I should like to endorse every word Deputy Gallagher said in that regard.</P>
      <P>I should also like to agree with Deputy Desmond on the question of post office officials not being allowed to take an active part in politics.  Everybody is entitled to his political views and the fact that he is a member of a political party need not interfere with his work.  Not to allow a person to express his political views is to deny him a freedom.  He has them anyway and he will express them in the ballot box.  It does not matter whether or not he expresses them outside that provided he is doing his job properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-postmasters in the country are very badly paid.  That is worth mentioning. With all the people who are waiting <Col N="2164" /> for telephones I do not envy the Minister his job but with the increased telephone and postal charges it will be expected of him that there will be a speed-up in the provision of private telephones and telephone kiosks.  I am particularly interested in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of broadcasting the proceedings of this House, I think if they are broadcast live many people will not pay their licence fee. They will be fed up listening to people repeating themselves.  If it is a question of an edited version it will be very difficult to get a balance.  If a person speaks for a time and just a few paragraphs are given out of context a completely wrong impression may be given..  Except for Question Time I would not pay the licence fee for long if I had to put up with an hour or two of this.  This is something that must be discussed very seriously.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the political commentators.  They are very good. They give a good, balanced account. People criticise interviewers on radio and television.  I have no criticism to make of them.  I have been interviewed a few times.  Of course, the men on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; try to make you say it their way.  If you are foolish enough to say it, good enough.  They are good interviewers and they produce an excellent programme.  On some programmes I would like to see a better balance.  If somebody who has very strong views on something is brought on to a programme there should be an effort made to balance the programme.  On the whole, programmes on television are fair.  I think there is too much violence and not enough Irish talent.  The view down the country is that there is too much violence and too much heavy drama.  Gone are the days when we had a bit of comedy.  After a hard day's work a person wants a laugh. We get very little laughs on television except for a few programmes and everybody watches those.  A number of programmes are very good indeed. If young people see too much violence they are indoctrinated and it is likely to affect them in later life.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question <Col N="2165" /> of the reception of RTE in England. I have had letters from exiles in England who want to hear Irish programmes, matches, <i>et cetera</i>, and they just cannot hear them because of interference from the BBC.  I would like the Minister to take up this matter and see what can be done about this interference.  It is very difficult to receive Telefís Éireann at all in England.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  The majority of the Cabinet are Dublin based.  I am not saying anything about that but I would ask them to take a look down the country.  We in the west need services as much as they are needed in the city.  I am glad that many of the things I meant to say have been said by Deputy Gallagher.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more Irish talent on television.  If we go in for all foreign material we will be showing the countries of the EEC that we are suffering from an inferiority complex, that we are not proud of our culture and of our language. These are the things we should be trying to project into Europe.  We should be proud of our culture, proud of our language and proud of everything that is beautiful and Gaelic in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The value of transactions handled by the Post Office in 1972, according to the Minister's speech, was approximately £268 million. On one of this evenings papers I see a headline: &ldquo;Armed Raid on Two Dublin Post Offices.&rdquo;  There is a report also of an armed raid on a mail van in rural Ireland. Increases in wages and salaries will mean that extra money will be handled in the coming year and, consequently, pay-outs may become targets for people of evil intent.  Banks and other groups who handle large amounts of money seem to be afforded extra protection but I wonder whether, if not extra protection, an extra eye might be kept on post offices and sub-post offices where this is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the news, as reported in the newspapers, that the sub-postmasters union, together with the Department <Col N="2166" /> of Posts and Telegraphs and the Garda Crime Protection Unit have devised a scheme whereby a closer watch will be kept on allowances, cheques, <i>et cetera,</i> that might be stolen and that these might be recoverable up to one year.  This will act as a deterrent against hold-ups but it will hardly be sufficient to prevent them. However, I wish those concerned with the scheme every success in their efforts.  Money that is being transported from one place to another needs a little extra protection because such mobility renders it a greater target than, say, money in banks.</P>
    <P>The postal service generally can be regarded as being adequate, thorough and prompt.  Of course, &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; is the keyword in relation to postal services.  From time to time we may see a letter to the editor of an evening paper stating that a letter posted at a certain time arrived some months later. These occasional letters only highlight the amount of post that is received on time.  While the volume of letter post has been approximately the same for the past couple of years, parcel post has increased.</P>
    <P>The personnel dealing with postal services in the Wicklow area are a courteous and helpful group of civil servants.  I am glad to note that 64 new motorised rural delivery services were introduced during the past year throughout the country.  The introduction of these services results in a decrease in costs but, the increases in remuneration to which employees are entitled increase the running costs of the Department and add to the capital costs.  Motorisation improves the service generally and makes life easier for the delivery men.</P>
    <P>This year more commemorative stamps will be issued.  No doubt these will be welcomed by philatelists.  They will result in increased revenue to the Post Office because there are many people throughout the world who, because they appreciate a good stamp, are prepared to purchase such stamps. In latter years the design of stamps has been very good and I join with the Minister in complimenting the people who have been responsible for the various designs.  Previous speakers have <Col N="2167" /> referred to the commemoration of certain individuals in stamps.  I suppose it is good to commemorate people in this way but, against that, a stamp should reflect the entire people rather than a section of the people.</P>
    <P>Vandalism in regard to telephone kiosks seems to be rampant.  In many cases I expect telephone kiosks are wrecked simply because they are a target for such wrongdoing rather than for the few pence that these vandals might obtain from them.  We must endeavour by way of education to discourage this practice.  People must be encouraged to respect public property.  Some people have the idea that property owned by the community is fair game for attack.  It is difficult to visualise a telephone kiosk that would be indestructible, but until such time as this may be possible we must do everything in our power to protect existing units.  Perhaps if kiosks were erected in places that are more in the public eye they might not be such targets.  Regarding their overall design I am glad to see the small glass panelling disappear and a large sheet of glass being provided.  This allows greater vision to those who use the kiosks and also of those who abuse them.</P>

      <P>A certain amount of conversation is quite audible in the Chamber.  This is not helpful to the speakers and, consequently, I would be grateful if those concerned would desist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The provision of kiosks of a more open design and their erection in brightly lit places might go a long way towards solving the problem of vandalism.  The structure itself is basic.  I often wonder if there could be a push-button system rather than a dialling one introduced into kiosks.  The Minister may have heard this suggestion before, but if those digits 0 to 9 were there with a push-button system flush with a panel, more built in units, would they be less vulnerable? Some say yes.  I do not know.  Again they may be just a target, and I suppose to a certain extent we will have to live with it, but <Col N="2168" /> unfortunately, living with it is quite difficult.</P>
      <P>Some people say that it is hard to read the print of the modern directory. It may be a little bit clearer but for people with limited sight the smallness of the print may impede their reading of it.  I am told the print has been improved. I myself find it quite clear, but as people have brought to my attention the smallness of the print, I wish to mention it to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Another point about telephone directories is that they are becoming quite bulky and so tend to disintegrate more easily.  I wonder if the time has come for a Dublin edition and a separate edition for the provinces.  That might add to the longevity of the directory.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom dul ar agaidh anois chun RTE.  Ar dtúis, i dtaobh Radio na Gaeltachta, is maith an rud go bhfuil sé á chraolú ar fud na tíre anois. Fáiltím roimh an cuireadh éisteacht le ceol, amhráin, dánta, seanchas is cúltúr na ndaoine.  Tá mé ag súil anois go mbeidh an caoi agam éisteacht leis na sean scéalta, An Táin, scéaltan faoin lucht sí a chuala mé fadó.  Tá an mheirg anois taghta ortha agus fáltaím roimh an seans chun éisteacht leo á gcraoladh sa teanga agus ó na daoine go bhfuil an Ghaeilge acuó dhúchas.

Bheidh mé ag súil freisin le héisteacht le muintir na Gaeltachta ag caint ar an saol a bhíodh ann, na nósanna agus na cleachtanna a bhíodh acu, agus ag caint mar gheall ar an saol atá anois acu.  Is mór an seans dúinn ar an gcósta seo breathnú isteach agus éisteacht leis seo.  Úsáidim na focail &ldquo;breathnú isteach&rdquo;.  Ní fheadar an mbeidh telefís na Gaeltachta ann sar i bhfad.  Tuigtear dom go bhfuil costas mór ann.  Ar dtúis nuair a thosnaigh RTE bhí bealach a seacht againn.  Ní fheadar i gceann cúpla bliain an mbeidh &ldquo;Telefís Éireann, Bealach a h-Aon&rdquo; againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discovered that quite a few people in the last few years seem to find the radio more attractive and entertaining than television.  Indeed. it is customary now to find people <Col N="2169" /> asking: &ldquo;Did you see such-and-such last night?&rdquo; and the answer is: &ldquo;I did not.  I was listening to the radio.&rdquo; It is amazing that the radio, which simply appeals to the one sense, can dominate that which appeals to two senses.  Is it that the radio is more natural, more reflective of our society? Is it that people are tired of these canned programmes which depict a life abroad which is not real? I admit straight away that a certain number of these canned programmes are a necessary form of relaxation after a hard day's work, for a woman a long time with children, a form of escapism which appeals to all of us at times.  It is not that I want to make Walter Mitty's of us all, but this form of escapism is necessary.  It eases the tensions and the strains of modern day living, and modern living brings more and more.  On radio programmes there is more of the Irish voice, the Irish intonation, not necessarily of Irish music but pop music presented by Irish disc jockeys, and these seemingly are enjoyed by more people. There is a lesson in this for television.</P>
    <P>We come back to the old question of resources.  I welcome wired TV for many reasons.  Choice is one, but also I find now that on these channels I have the opportunity to enjoy the expertise of many of our talented actors and actresses, stage personalities who have to travel, but not too far afield, to make a living.  One good thing in their going is that they are killing&mdash;and this is something most of us would welcome&mdash;the old image of the stage Irishman with his bouts of temper, laziness, drunkenness and rage.  These are the things we saw and we knew were there but we hope they will be limited even more.  Actors and actresses are like envoys of our nation abroad.  They keep the standard high, they are enjoyed and recognised for their wonderful talents. These are talents which we would like to keep at home but which are spread across the channel.</P>
    <P>Dealing with home programmes it is always difficult to please everybody.  As there are people there are choices and with one channel we must try to offer a choice that appeals to all.  At this <Col N="2170" /> time I should like to wish the authority and the Minister well in the discharge of their functions agus déanaim comhgháirdeachas gur ceapadh don Aireacht seo é.  Not alone must we please all but we must look after the well-being of all.</P>
    <P>This brings us to important points. I know the use of the word &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; is emotional, possibly too emotional, so I will use the words &ldquo;controller guidance&rdquo;.  A certain amount of controller guidance is necessary.  I have dealt with the aspect of a certain amount of escapism being necessary for the individual but this also must be reined in.  I do not speak alone of this control or those programmes which seem to debate the Christian way of life, which seem to undermine the morals and morality of the people, but also of programmes which portray vice and violence, including programmes on contract murder.  These programmes were, for a time, at the top of the ratings.  We had hints in a part of our country over the last few years of contract murder. These contract murder people may not have put their eye on it or recognised it as contract murder but that is what it was.</P>
    <P>We find that a number of countries in Europe consider that violence in its many forms is not alone degrading and humiliating but also might have a worse effect on our people and our society than immorality.  We will have to watch this and I know that the guiding hand of the Minister will be near and that the authority will keep a close eye on it.</P>
    <P>In considering television primarily as an entertainment we must bring in another word beginning with E. ducation.  A good balanced programme is one that links entertainment with education.  Formal education programmes may not appeal to all the people but if we could dress education up in the garments of entertainment this will give it its necessary appeal. We have had many of these programmes, programmes which reflect certain aspects of our life, nature programmes and those which dealt with historic monastic settlements.  These <Col N="2171" /> programmes were most informative and most enjoyable.</P>
    <P>Quiz programmes are very often shown for entertainment with very little of the education factor involved. I would like to see more of the education factor involved in them.  I compliment those programmes of the Macra na Feirme type which we have seen in recent months; they were most enjoyable.  The difficulty will always be, however, to try to link education with enjoyment.</P>
    <P>The menfolk seem to relax when watching a western.  If one wants to find the man of the house at home all one has to do is to check the programmes and see if a western is being shown.  This is an example that the western is so clean-cut and good and that people relax and enjoy it.  The old motifs might be there and we can be sure that violence will never be too violent, good will conquer evil and men are given an opportunity to recapture the days of their youth when they saw their heroes in full flight on horseback as they dodged the bullets. The western seems popular from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Before I move from the matter of restrictions I should like to quote from the Minister's statement of the 10th May:</P>
    <P>People in broadcasting who feel they want more of a free hand may well dislike the setting of explicit statutory limits almost as much as they dislike the potential arbitrary intervention which lurks in, and on at least one occasion has leaped out from the present section 31.  They would like no restrictions at all.  Yet some restrictions are inevitable and some are salutory, even under the greatest possible freedom of expression available.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  Again we are back to the balance.  Some restrictions are inevitable and some are salutory.  There is a time to step in and a time to turn a blind eye.  Freedom of the artist, the entertainers, those who claim a certain privilage: this is a privilege to which they may be entitled but which the <Col N="2172" /> Minister, and his authority, should keep under constant surveillance.</P>
    <P>Moving on to formal education I read that there was an increase not only in time but in the number of programmes in the &ldquo;Telefís Scoile&rdquo; series in the last two years.  Figures for this year, I believe, are not available. As one directly involved in education I find these programmes a tremendous help.  I have heard many teachers praise them not only for their content but also for their presentation.  Indeed, I have often looked at some geography programmes which dealt with various parts of the country with which I was vaguely familiar and felt as if I knew much more of them.  Mathematics teachers single out mathematics programmes for special mention.  Being involved in teaching mathematics personally I have a special eye for these programmes and find the programmes on modern mathematics are really wonderfully clear, produced by people who have all the aids available.  About four years ago a programme on sets merited an award in Madrid and more recently a radio programme won an award in Tokyo.  These are formal programmes.  Could they be publicised more? The ordinary man-in-the-street would probably say, if asked, that the television programme comes on about 5.30 p.m.: he may miss a wealth of knowledge if he is free and fails to observe that the Telefís Scoile programmes are on earlier.  These programmes are very well publicised through the schools and I know they are geared for and directed at the schools.  The notices and charts appear with great clarity and programmes are repeated which is all to the good, but I wonder if they might also be directed at the adult population who could find these are not childish programmes.  I have heard many adults say they cannot understand &ldquo;these modern mathematics, all squiggles and circles&rdquo;, and so on, but if they had an opportunity of watching some of these programmes they would find the basic concepts of modern mathematics clearly brought out and would realise that it was a pleasure to study them.  People might begin to study again and this would further the national well-being.</P>
    <P>Places in universities are becoming <Col N="2173" /> harder to secure.  In UCD I believe the limit has been placed at 500 for this year's higher diploma class.  Could the Minister consider some sort of link with the BBC in broadcasting some of these programmes and perhaps provide an opportunity for some people to participate fully and take the examination at the end of the course and possibly qualify? These are all different aspects of the matter.  I know the question of resources keeps cropping up but some agreement might be reached which would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>Many canned programmes from abroad must now be purchased in colour and RTE have been forced into purchasing these at the higher rate, perhaps before they envisaged doing so.  I also saw somewhere recently that producers and suppliers in Ireland could still only supply in black and white.  I wonder if the Minister could clarify the point for me: I understand that some people had obtained very expensive equipment but that contracts could not be obtained for the end products as colour items.  Obviously, nature programmes come over very well in colour and we must bear in mind that while these producers might produce in the hope of selling to RTE they do not produce solely with this in mind.  Naturally, they hope that when their expenses have been met they would have the opportunity of selling their products to some other channels. This is difficult for them if they must continue to supply in black and white.</P>
    <P>Sports programmes also look well in colour and sport seems to have become very much more popular on television and requires more television time.  People seem to demand more and more of it and it is good to see RTE branching out now not only into major sports events, those which have the greatest following and which are very important, but also into what are called minority sports.  It seems there is an abundance of sports programmes in the world and that these are welcome for the relaxation they provide.  Personally, I find that sometimes people spend too much time at television which, if it is not stimulating, <Col N="2174" /> educational or entertaining tends to make them rather static but one cannot remain static and thus one tends to go into reverse.  I welcome the return to radio of the gentleman who entertains so many people in the mornings, Tom MacCuaigh, and who has done so for so many years.  His programmes were missed.</P>
    <P>The urban dweller enjoys programmes which show the life of the farmer.  Programmes that can blend the various strata in our society still closer would be appreciated.  Farming programmes are most informative and entertaining.  I can appreciate that some people may think they are put on at the wrong moment but they must be presented at times when a large section of the community are free to enjoy them.  I saw a letter recently stating that Radio na Gaeltachta was distorting programmes presented by another station.  I imagine the people concerned with Radio na Gaeltachta have been given a certain amount of scope.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment about the televising of parliamentary proceedings.  I do not know if a survey has been undertaken to see if people are interested in this matter. However, there are some aspects that must be considered.  With regard to editing, there might be complaints regarding equal time for all.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the acquisition of the right to report parliamentary proceedings is an important part of the history, not only of the Press, but of democratic institutions generally. However, it might be the position that it would be better not to broadcast certain things.  Sometimes there are asides across the floor of the House and if they were broadcast it might lead to a decrease in certain votes.</P>

      <P>If the various rude interruptions were to enliven our screens or radios, it might not be very beneficial to the Deputies concerned. However, it might be done on a trial basis.  The Minister told us this was done in the 18th century in the Westminster Parliament.</P>

      <P>We wish to read only about our moments of glory, rather than the moments that were not so wonderful.  Sometimes Deputies may think they were good on a certain point and wonder why their contribution was not printed but, by and large, I find the reporting is fair. One might have favourites but we must put up with publicity; sometimes it is flattering and at other times it can have a sobering influence but that in itself could have a good effect.</P>
      <P>I agree television is distracting with all the lights.  Some people are very good performers but others, who might have a worthwhile contribution, might not have any screen appeal.  Perhaps Deputies would find themselves hastening to the Communications Centre, brushing up their diction and the delivery of speeches. All these aspects must be considered when we consider televising proceedings of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money needed for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will continue to increase.  The Minister will return to the House in search of more capital at a later date and I hope it will be available.  The communications business is very competitive and people need better and more effective means of communication.  One of the most frequent requests I receive from people is with regard to the provision of telephones and telephone kiosks.  I realise that as our cities and towns are enlarging the demand is increasing.  In addition, industrialists are accustomed to a good communications system and if they find our system inadequate they will be wary of establishing industries.  It is difficult enough to get people to set up industries here and we must facilitate them as much as possible by providing an efficient communications system. Demands for telephones flow in by the hundred to the Minister.  It is very easy for people to say &ldquo;That should have been done last year.&rdquo;  That is a negative argument which does not bring us any nearer to solving the problem.  Demands continue and will <Col N="2176" /> continue because people now do not regard the telephone as a luxury but as a necessity, part of the fittings.</P>
    <P>There will be delays in installing telephones.  I have figures stating that 21,000 and 27,000 new lines were set up but with this wonderful boost in building development these figures mean very little.  The Minister will simply have to have more capital to meet rising demands.  The vogue now in planning developments is to build schemes away from more settled communities. They are further away and the people in them are cut off unless they have this basic means of communication. One of the factors now involved in getting planning permission is to lay cables underground.  I welcome this because it means that our environment is not further tarnished. But this will add to the costs spiral and I do not envy the Minister his job if development continues along its present lines and demands for the service become consequently greater.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an efficient staff whom I wish to compliment.  A figure of 23,000 employees has been given, almost two per cent of the working population.  I wonder if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can now be classified among the principal employers in the State.  I believe they are. Then, as new wage agreements come into operation for these workers and as demands increase for capital equipment there will be greater need for new capital in the Department.</P>
    <P>There have been demands for multi-channel television.  People outside the areas now so serviced demand this as a right which other people enjoy.  It is very difficult to answer such an argument. We see housing advertisements including the provision of multi-channel wiring.  It has been said that the more multi-channel reception is extended the less revenue RTE will obtain because their viewing population may decrease and therefore their advertising revenue.  I read a report in a newspaper recently&mdash;I think it was <i>The Irish Press</i>&mdash;in effect suggesting that Telefís Éireann might become what one could call a regional service linked with the Independent Television Authority more or less as <Col N="2177" /> Wales and Scotland are.  One of the advantages of this would be the elimination of duplication and possibly an increase in the number of RTE advertisements.  It could be argued also that it would be beneficial from the point of view of opening more windows on our society.  I understand this is something the Minister is considering.</P>
    <P>However, would this be sufficient to satisfy people's demand? Would it mean that more of our people would adopt more of the customs of other countries? If they were to adopt the better customs I would welcome it, but I fear they would not.</P>
    <P>Referring further to the report I have mentioned, a drop in RTE revenue would mean a deterioration in programmes.  If programmes deteriorate it might mean still more canned programmes at a time when people are asking for more live shows, which are more costly.  Would it mean a rise in the licence fee? Broadcasting hours have been extended and there are demands for more extensions.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish the Minister success and I hope he will be able to continue the progress made during the last few years and accordingly be able to please more of the people more of the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate covers a wide field and I do not propose to repeat what has been said already today.  We have been told of the backlog in the supply of new telephones. There is another name for it: it is the legacy left to the present Minister by Fianna Fáil who did very little to cater for this need.  I agree with some of what Deputy Callanan said in regard to the telephone service. He mentioned it in connection with the agricultural community and spoke of veterinary surgeons.  You would imagine that only pounds were involved in the question of telephones. It is very important that telephones should be available as early as possible. Of course the Minister cannot wave a magic wand overnight and make up for the failures of the great <Col N="2178" />&ldquo;Fianna Failers&rdquo; over the past 16 year.  It reminds me of the words of the song: &ldquo;Sixteen years and what do you get?&rdquo; There is a great need to expedite the installation of telephones in a growing city like Galway where the demand is so great.  I would impress on the Minister the importance of this in our area.</P>
      <P>I notice that the names in the telephone directory are now in the centre of the book and we have to turn each page.  Previously we could flick over the pages and see them in the corner in alphabetical order.  We could get the number much quicker if we could return to the old system.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter and, if possible, to have the numbers printed a bit bigger.  Many people find it hard to read them because of bad sight or, at time, because of darkness.</P>
      <P>On the question of stamps, there are these machines and when you put a penny in a stamp might come out but, in damp weather, you would lose your penny and your stamp.  The Department should have some system of franking letters.</P>
      <P>I said to the previous Minister, and I now repeat, that the Department should have a bit of imagination on the question of telegrams.  You get the same sort of a telegram if you are getting married as you get if someone dies in the house.  Could we not have a card to wish the person well or to offer sympathy?</P>
      <P>Weather forecasts can have an effect on a tourist area.  I was watching the chart last week and I saw something like thorny wire coming in from the Atlantic.  That means rain.  If you see the letter &ldquo;L&rdquo;, look out.  If you see the letter &ldquo;H&rdquo;, it is all right.  The strand of thorny wire last week was hanging around the Atlantic and we were told we would have plenty of rain in the West.  We had the finest weather we had in the year.  This can have a grave effect on a tourist area.  It might turn people away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke about television. You cannot please all the people all the time.  If you were to please them all they would never get up off their fannies but would watch television all <Col N="2179" /> night.  That would give you a bad heart. It is good to get a break and go out when you do not like what is on.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  That programme is racy of the soil.  It has been on for years and will probably continue.  We see Minnie sticking her nose in somebody else's business.  Poor Benjy &ldquo;gets the works&rdquo; all the time.  That happens to all the sons around the country.  We get an overdose of canned television.  To make it worse there is some sort of a machine which produces laughter.  If you cannot see the joke you are supposed to laugh with the machine.</P>
    <P>Our cameramen should be sent out and around the country.  We have the finest scenery in the world and we have a lot of it in the West too.  This might help our tourist industry.  If it did not get across the Channel at least our own people would see it.  Many Deputies have not seen some of the beautiful scenery we have in the West.  We should see Ireland first.  Our cameramen are doing very good work on the racecourse, the football field, the hurling field and they can even keep up with the greyhounds.  Their camera work is excellent.  I should like to see less of the people with the guitars.  Some of their strings could be pulled a bit.</P>
    <P>Programmes from across the Channel may be good or they may be bad.  Many people along the East coast could be called &ldquo;spongers&rdquo; because they see those programmes.  We never see them in the West.  Maybe that is no great loss but, at the same time, there are many people who would like to see some of the matches.  I hope the talks the Minister is having with his counterpart will bear fruit.</P>
    <P>I should like to see time flashes superimposed on the actual picture on television.  I should like to see more civics programmes on television.  There is a great lack of civic spirit in this country and on this medium we could get across this very important spirit, especially to the young people.  We see a great deal of violence and we hear a great deal about violence.  It is all rather sickening, but I suppose it is news.  I often wonder what the <Col N="2180" /> reporters will do when the North is settled.</P>
    <P>We have the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;. It is condemned by some but most of us break our necks on Saturday nights in an effort not to miss it. We may not always approve of it or we may not always agree with the things that are said on it.  We do not agree with what Deputies on the Opposition benches say, but we come in here to listen to them.  I am sure the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; keeps us out of certain other places.</P>
    <P>I should like again to congratulate the Minister.  He is admirably fitted to his task and, by this time next year, I believe we will have great changes for the better.  I would like to pay tribute to his staff who are always most co-operative.  The only real complaint is that in regard to telephones.  There is a backlog.  Deputy Callanan mentioned the need for telephones for veterinary surgeons.  Doctors ought to have telephones also.</P>

Is eol domsa agus is eol don chuid is mó de na Teachtaí ón taobh thiar den tír go bhfuil an scéal go dona maidir le telefóin.  Is féidir glaoch telefóin a dhéanamh ón mbosca atá ar an dtaobh amuigh am ar bith san oíche.  Má chuireann tú ceist sa Teach seo i dtaobh cén fáth nár cuireadh suas bothán telefóin i mbaile beag nó i mbaile cuíosach mór gheobhaidh tú an freagra i gcónaí nach bhfhuil oiread glaoch guthán san áit sin a íocfadh as.  Ní freagra ar bith é sin.  Déarfaidh tú nó déarfadh Aire ar bith, b'fhéidir, go bhfuil go leor telefón sa cheantar beag sin agus go bhfuiltear ag baint úsáid astu.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil go leor telefón <Col N="2181" /> sa cheantar ceart go leor ach sa teach ósta atá said nó i dteach bia.  Níl mórán acu sin ar oscailt tar éis a haon a chlog san oíche.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh duine tinn agus an dochtúir ag teastáil láithreach ach níl tú in ann glaoch ar dhochtúir ar bith mar nach bhfuil aon telefón ar fáil taobh amuigh.  Ní chosnódh sé mórán, tá mé cinnte, chuile bhosca atá i ngach oifig an phoist ar fud na tíre a chur taobh amuigh.</P>
      <P>Ba cheart don Aire breathnú ar chás fhear an phoist.  Ba cheart cúig lá sa tseachtain a bheith ag na fir sin ar aon dul le muintir na mbailte móra.  An té a gheibheann litir ar an Satharn ní dhéanfaidh sé mórán leis go dtí an Luan.  Ba cheart éadach níos oiriúnaí a bheith ag fir an phoist.  An t-éadach a chaitheann said i láthair na huaire níl sé comh maith agus ba cheart é bheith.  Má bhíonn báisteach ann ligean sé an tais isteach.</P>
      <P>Tá rud eile ann, sé sin, na litreacha a chuirtear sa phost sa Teach seo nó sa chathair seo agus an mhoill a bhíonn ann.  Deirtear gur fán tuaith a tharlaíonn an mhoill.  Ní fíor sin.  Níl sé i bhfad ó chuir mé litir sa phost. Litir an-thábhachtach a bhí inti; bhí deifir léi agus níor shroich sí cathair na Gaillimhe go dtí tar éis am lóin.  Bhí oiread traenacha ag rith an lá áirithe sin go raibh neart ama ag na sortálaithe i mBaile Átha Cliath a gcuid litereacha a sheoladh iontu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh d'fhear an phoist.  Tá an chuid is mó acu sealadach tá mé ag ceapadh.  Ba cheart chuile dhuine acu bheith seasta. Ba cheart pinsean de shaghas éigin bheith acu.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil stampaí acu agus go mbeidh tairbhe na stampaí acu ar feadh cúpla bliain.  Ba cheart pinsean a bheith acu agus ba <Col N="2182" /> chóir don Aire iarraidh ar an Rialtas pinsean a thúirt dóibh.  Má dhéannann sé amhlaidh beidh mé buíoch de.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart níos mó Gaeilge a bheith le cloisint ar Thelefís Éireann.  Níl mé ag iarraidh leath is leath, ach má táimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a scaipeadh ar fud na tíre ba cheart an teanga a chloisteáil níos minicí ar Thelefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh Radio na Gaeltachta. I bhfó-mhír L a dó den Mheastachán tugaim faoi ndeara go bhfuil Radio na Gaeltachta gearrtha siar £124,000 i mbliana.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth.  An bhfuil rud aisteach ag baint leis? Ní ceart aon ghearradh siar a dhéanamh go h-áirithe i gcás radio nua sa Ghaeltacht.  Is amhlaidh a bheimid ag súil le breis airgid.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na h-amannaí craolta, ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh an radio ag obair níos fuide&mdash;óna 8 a chlog go dtí a 9 a chlog ar maidin nó go dtí a 10 a chlog; óna 12 a chlog go dtí a 2 a chlog, agus óna 5 a chlog go dtí a 9 a chlog.  Ar an gcuma sin d'fhéadfaí freastal ar go leor leor daoine.  Tá go leor leor gasúirí óga ag freastal ar an scoil náisiúnta.  Bheadh deis acu sin éisteacht le Radio na Gaeltachta agus cur lena gcuid Gaeilge. Bheadh sé ina chúnamh freisin dóibh siúd nár tógadh sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is assumed to be referring to provisional awards of disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme.  It is clearly desirable, having regard to the possibility of change in a claimant's condition which is implicit in a provisional award, that his medical assessment should be carried out near to the date on which the current award expires. With this in mind and subject to the necessity for arranging medical sessions throughout the country with due regard to the most efficient use of available medical staff, every effort is made to have recipients of disablement benefit examined by medical referees before the expiration of current awards of benefit.</P>

      <P>Dublin is considered the best centre for the central engineering workshops because of the availability there of the necessary skilled workmen and facilities for the transport of spare parts etc. to the various Office of Public Works and other centres throughout the country.  Furthermore Dublin is the distribution centre for the plant and machinery required at those centres. Accordingly the transfer of the workshops from Dublin would not be justified. I might add that there is at present at Trim a workshop and stores for the routine maintenance and minor overhaul of the machinery on the Boyne drainage scheme.</P>

    <P>Except as indicated, compensation is not payable in respect of the loss of unregistered or uninsured items.</P>
    <P>The principal conditions governing the payment of compensation are that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the loss did not arise wholly or in part through the fault of the sender, e.g. inadequate packing</P>
    <P>&mdash;compensation will in no case exceed the value of the article lost</P>
    <P>&mdash;compensation in respect of the loss of money of any kind in the inland service will be paid only where the envelope used for its transmission is one of the registered letter envelopes sold by the Department and the packet is handed to an officer of the Department for transmission by registered letter post</P>
    <P>&mdash;compensation will not be payable in respect of the loss of any packet containing a prohibited article.</P>
