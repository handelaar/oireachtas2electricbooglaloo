    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £17,067,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for <Col N="2" /> expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; for expenditure arising from damage to property of External Governments; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>

      <P>The amount being sought this year for Vote 8, viz. £17,067,000, is £3,886,000 greater than the total amount voted last year.</P>
      <P>There is a net increase of £375,000 in subheads A, B and C, which are the administrative subheads of the Vote.  This is due almost entirely to salary increases under the National Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision under subhead D is mainly to cover purchases of sites and premises for Garda stations and other Government services in Dublin <Col N="3" /> and the provinces and for the purchase of the fee simple of some existing leasehold properties.</P>
    <P>A list of the works for which provision is made under subhead E has been supplied to Deputies.  I will refer briefly to the more significant items.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made, following on a recommendation of the security authorities and with the concurrence of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who were specifically consulted in the matter, for the erection of a glass partition around the front of the public gallery.  To avoid disturbing the House, it is proposed to have the work carried out during the summer recess.  I am aware that many Deputies are averse to the idea but they will appreciate the need for the precautions being taken.</P>
    <P>Items 3 to 42, accounting for a total provision of £2,122,000, fall under the generic heading of &ldquo;Finance&rdquo;. They embrace a wider range of projects, including the provision, adaptation and improvement of accommodation for various Government Departments.  The most important of these are the provision of new buildings for computer units at Inchicore and Kilmainham; the new building at Dublin Castle for the Stamping Branch and certain other staffs of the Revenue Commissioners; the fitting out and furnishing of the new office building in Kildare Place for the headquarters staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and some staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce; the provision of a new printing building for the Ordnance Survey Office; the erection of new offices for Government staffs at provincial centres; the erection of a new building at Clonskea for the Institute of Public Administration and the Training Centre of the Department of Finance and the erection of new office buildings in Dublin for various Departments.</P>
    <P>Stage I of the computer building at Inchicore is almost complete.  The computer, which will serve a number of Departments, has, in fact, already started operations.  The planning of Stage II, which will involve the provision <Col N="4" /> of an office building for the staff who will be directly associated with the computer system, is proceeding. The computer at Kilmainham, which is being installed at present, will be completely devoted to Revenue collection work.  The Stamping Branch building at Dublin Castle and the office block in Kildare Place, both major projects, will be in commission before the end of this year.  Work on the new printing building for the Ordnance Survey Office, which will fill a long felt want, will, it is hoped, start about the end of this year.</P>
    <P>With the development and growth of Government services in the provinces, problems are continually arising over the provision of suitable offices for the staffs administering those services&mdash;the supply of such offices in practically every provincial town is completely inadequate.  In the circumstances, plans are at present in hand for the erection of offices at seven centres, namely Drogheda, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Roscommon, Tralee and Waterford. The offices at Drogheda and Tralee are already in course of construction; those at Letterkenny should start shortly, while the other four are at the design stage.  It may be assumed that the erection of new offices at several other provincial centres will be necessary during the next few years.</P>
    <P>The building at Clonskea for the Institute of Public Administration and the Department of Finance Training Centre is also at the design stage.</P>
    <P>Here I might refer to the general problem of office accommodation for Government staffs in Dublin.  It is unquestionably one of major difficulty.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, recourse has had to be had to a considerable degree over the past seven years or so to the renting of space in privately developed office blocks.  There was simply no alternative to this.  Invariably the recurring creation of new services has called for the recruitment of the staffs needed to administer them with the minimum of delay and has left no opportunity, even if capital and other resources had been freely available, of catering for those staffs other than by renting.  Ideally, of course, the State should design and erect all of its own <Col N="5" /> office buildings.  The provision of £500,000&mdash;Item 15 of the subhead&mdash;is intended to meet the start of such a programme.  The initial scheme which is now being planned will involve a total expenditure of the order of £2.5 million over the next three years or so and will include the provision of modern offices in the Dublin area for, amongst others, the Meteorological Office, the Geological Survey Office and the headquarters of the Garda Síochána.  It is to be hoped that it will be found possible to expand the programme and, in the long term, to bring the rents and rates Subhead of the Vote, which this year accounts for an anticipated outlay of over £1½ million compared with about £200,000 ten years ago, to a desirable low level.</P>
    <P>I will now comment on other items of the subhead.</P>
    <P>Items 29 (1) and (2) concern the restoration of Scoil Éanna, Rathfarnham, which was handed over to the State in 1970.  Stage I, which consisted of reroofing of the building, provision of drainage and public toilets, is almost complete.  Stage II will involve the complete internal rehabilitation of the buildings and it is hoped to commence work within the year.  A considerable amount of work has been done on the clearance and landscaping of the grounds and on the provision of playing fields.  The grounds are open to the public and constitute a valuable and desirable amenity, particularly for the Rathfarnham area.</P>
    <P>Due to pressure of urgent work, Stage II of the restoration of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham, has not got under way.  A special effort will be made to have the planning of the work undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>This provision is for improvements to the main landing place in Clare Island, County Mayo, which are being carried out in the interests of transport and communication.  The existing pier is narrow and inadequate.  The proposal is to extend and widen the pier, raise the deck level, extend the paved urea to provide a sloping quay, install a crane and provide a new winch and boat cradle.  A contract has been <Col N="6" /> placed for the work and, all going well, it should be completed by autumn 1974.</P>
    <P>The car ferry terminal on the East Pier at Dún Laoghaire was provided in 1965 as a temporary measure pending completion of the permanent facilities at St. Michael's Wharf.  In fulfilment of an undertaking given at the time of their construction, the temporary facilities are now being dismantled.  The car customs building. fencing, Bailey Bridge, link span and syncrolift have been removed and the remaining features, the approach bridge and the outer of the two stem dolphins, will be dismantled this year.</P>
    <P>This provision is for a new proposal. British Rail, who operate the mail boats and car ferries on the Dún Laoghaire&mdash;Holyhead route, propose to introduce multi-purpose ships to accommodate both passengers without cars, who are known as classic passengers, and those with cars.  The vessels will continue to use the mail boat pier since operation from the car ferry terminal at St. Michael's Wharf would involve major difficulties.</P>
    <P>To meet the new situation, it is proposed to construct a ramp at the mail boat pier for the unloading of cars and also a causeway connecting the pier to the car ferry terminal.  This causeway would be on the seaward side of one of the yacht clubs but would be at a low level and would nut interfere with existing amenities.  An opening would be provided for the passage of the yachts.  While the entire cost of the project would be met from State funds, there would be recoveries from British Rail by way of rents for shore facilities and tonnage and goods rates.  Preliminary consultations are in progress with the various interested parties, including the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation, in connection with the project.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to have the landing facilities on Inishbofin Island, County Galway, improved. Various possible ways of doing this were examined and these are under consideration.  A necessary prerequisite for any scheme is a detailed survey of the harbour bed and a sub-soil investigation. <Col N="7" /> The provision of £5,000 is for this work.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the provisions for major fishery harbours, for works in the fishing interest and for miscellaneous marine schemes were transferred to the vote for Fisheries on 1st April, 1972, but the commissioners will still be responsible for executing these works as is the case with works carried out for Roinn na Gaeltachta and financed from funds provided in the Vote for that Department.</P>
    <P>Items 34 to 42 refer to development projects undertaken by the Commissioners in the fields of amenity and conservation.</P>
    <P>A total provision of £25,000 is being made for various improvements in the Bourn Vincent National Park.  The park workshops need to be modernised to meet the increased work load; public toilets and an information kiosk are to be built at Torc waterfall; and a new park road is being developed for jaunting cars.  At present the jaunting cars return from Torc waterfall along the main Killarney-Kenmare road.  With the rapid expansion in motor traffic in recent years this is neither satisfactory for the motorists nor the jaunting car passengers.  The new route, which is being planned in consultation with the jarveys' representatives, will provide a safer and more interesting tour for horsedrawn passengers within the national park.</P>
    <P>Because of the very large numbers of people visiting Muckross House and gardens, the present water supply and sewage disposal systems are no longer adequate and provision is being made for the necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>Tenders for the restoration of the picture gallery wing of Kilkenny Castle have had to be re-invited as the outcome of the original invitation was unsatisfactory.  I sincerely hope that it will shortly be possible to have the work started.  I know that many visitors to Kilkenny are disappointed when they find that the castle is not yet open to the public.  As it will be a few years more before the picture gallery will be ready to receive visitors, the <Col N="8" /> Commissioners are exploring the possibility of allowing the castle dining room to be used for small theatrical presentations, lectures and musical performances as an interim arrangement.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, a public golf course is being developed at the Phoenix Park extension along the banks of the river Liffey.  Preparatory site works have been in hands for some time and the planning of the course is at an advance stage.  It is hoped to have the plans of the course lay-out and of the clubhouse facilities completed at an early date.  It is the intention to provide an 18-hole course, but it will be developed in two stages of nine holes each.  A sum of £30,000 is included for work in the current year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the golf course it is hoped to provide some other leisure and recreation facilities in this area and the Commissioners are in consultation with the National Council for Sport and Recreation in this regard.</P>
    <P>This year the Commissioners are stepping up considerably the provision for development of the Shannon Navigation.  Two years ago they embarked on a general scheme of improvements on the navigation to cope with the growing popularity of pleasure cruising and other recreational uses. This confidence in the future of the waterway has been amply justified by the continued expansion and success of the hire cruiser business over the last two years despite the general decline in tourist earnings during that time. My information is that overseas bookings&mdash;mainly from the Continent&mdash; are very heavy again this year.  It is clear that the money being spent on these development works is a worthwhile investment.</P>
    <P>Work is to continue on the building of new quays at Portumna and Knockvicar. It is also intended to build new quays at Hodson's Bay, Grange and Athlone and to extend the existing quay at Mountshannon.  The provision of automatic lifting gear for the bridge at Portumna to reduce road traffic delays when boats are passing through is under way.  The total sum being provided for the works referred to is £48,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> A sum of £16,000 is included for the building of a visitor centre at Dunmore Cave national monument.  County Kilkenny.  The water supply difficulties mentioned last year have at last been overcome with the co-operation of the Kilkenny County Council, and I expect that a tender will shortly be accepted for the building.  Arrangements are going ahead for the installation of lighting in the cave and for the carrying out of archaeological and biological studies there this summer. Unless some unforseen problem arises, the centre should be open to the public next year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2,000 is included as an initial instalment of the cost of a visitor centre at Clonmacnoise national monument. The growing number of visitors to the monument makes this step necessary and both Bord Fáilte and the county council are co-operating in the scheme.  When complete, the centre will contain a café, small shop, toilets, a caretaker's house and some museum accommodation.  It is hoped to make a start on the project this year.</P>
    <P>The sum of £5,000 included for the provision of a visitor and museum centre at Cashel represents an important development at what is perhaps our best known and most popular national monument.  The centre will in no way intrude on the scene as it will be provided by the roofing of one of the existing buildings on the Rock, the Vicars' Choral.  It is intended that the centre will be ready for 1975, which is Architectural Heritage Year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to establish a new depot at Killarney for the maintenance of national monuments in the Kerry and adjoining region.  This whole region&mdash;especially the Dingle Peninsula &mdash;contains a wealth of historic remains which it has not been possible to service adequately up to now because of other commitments and the shortage of money and skilled staff.  With the increased resources now available it is intended to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of national monuments in County Kerry I cannot let the occasion pass without expressing my appreciation&mdash;and I am sure the House will join with me in this&mdash;of the <Col N="10" /> very generous decision of Mr. John McShain, Killarney House, to present the island of Innisfallen to the nation. The island will be a cherished part of the Killarney National Park and the ancient monastic remains on it will, I believe, in time rival Muckross Abbey as a point of interest for visitors.  Mr. McShain has also agreed to place the historic Ross Castle in the guardianship of the Commissioners to enable them to carry out conservation works.  As a first step it will be necessary to arrange for a detailed structural examination followed by an archaeological excavation of the site.  Because of its condition the castle has for some time past been closed to visitors and it may be some years before it can be reopened to them.</P>
    <P>A sum of £498,000, representing an increase of £208,000 over last year, is being provided for works for the Department of Justice, mainly for the erection of new Garda Síochána stations and the improvement of existing stations and the erection of temporary courts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Planning is proceeding for a new central headquarters at Limerick and work is expected to commence early in 1974.  A large scheme of improvements is in progress at Store Street, Dublin. The new station at Waterford is virtually completed.  New stations are being planned at a number of other centres and it is hoped that work will commence this year on at least 19 of them, including Skibbereen, Castleblayney, Castlerea, Granard and Kanturk.</P>
    <P>Substantial works will be carried out this year for the Garda Technical Bureau.  These works will provide the facilities to enable the bureau to discharge its specialised functions more efficiently.</P>
    <P>Item 47 relates to a new building for the Garda Radio Communications Centre at Dublin Castle.  Construction work has been finished and the installation of equipment is now proceeding.</P>
    <P>The accommodation in the courts of justice complex is no longer adequate for requirements and the provision of additional space is a matter of urgency. <Col N="11" /> As an interim measure to relieve the severe and increasing overcrowding, it is proposed to provide as soon as possible on a site adjacent to the Four Courts temporary accommodatiton for the Circuit Criminal Court.  The Children's Court at present housed in unsuitable buildings at Dublin Castle will also be accommodated in the temporary building.  This will give a breathing space for the planning, design and construction of permanent buildings which it is proposed to erect on a site which has been acquired at Smithfield.  The new building, which will be a large and important addition to the State buildings in the capital. will house the District Courts, the Children's Court and other ancillary buildings including a Garda station. Because of the specialised nature of the complex and its significance as a public building, it has been decided to hold an architectural competition to obtain the best possible design.  Arrangements for the competition will be undertaken as soon as possible and details will be made public in due course.</P>
    <P>Items 51 and 57 are for the first stage of new office premises for staffs of the Departments of Education and lands at Athlone and Castlebar respectively. It is expected that a contract will shortly be placed for the Castlebar building and that tenders for the Athlone offices will be invited within the next month.</P>
    <P>The grant expenditure on the building and improvement of primary schools last year was £3,830,000 approximately. The amount included for school building and improvement in this year's estimate is £5 million, the largest amount ever provided.  It is expected that a large proportion of the money will again be spent on the erection of schools in new areas of towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The provision of special schools for physically and mentally handicapped children is continuing.  Works were completed last year on two new schools and on a major improvement scheme at an existing school.  Works are at present in progress at nine other such schools and 18 projects are at various stages of preparation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> The provisions for buildings for research, training and advisory services for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries amount to £107,000.  The main items are a regional veterinary research laboratory at Limerick, the performance testing station for beef bulls at Tully, County Kildare, and a district veterinary office at Carlow.</P>
    <P>New meteorological stations are to be built at Mullingar and Claremorris and £13,000 is included for the purpose this year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £344,000 is required for works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Deputies will welcome the provisions for new buildings at several provincial centres including Clonmel, Donegal, Dungarvan, Listowel, Longford, Mullingar, Shannon and Tipperary.  In the case of Tipperary the Commissioners of Public Works are sponsoring a competition for the design of the building.  This competition will provide an excellent opportunity for young architects to show their ability and will, it is hoped, stimulate them to think about the design of public buildings in provincial towns.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works referred to, the Office of Public Works will in the current financial year carry out for the telephone service works expected to cost about £1,180,000 which will be met out of the telephone capital account.</P>
    <P>Subhead F. 1 provides for the maintenance of State property including State harbours, the river Shannon navigation and the national parks. Approximately two-thirds of the subhead is spent on normal day-to-day maintenance of Government offices, post office buildings.  Garda Síochána stations, employment exchanges, Social Welfare offices and agricultural institutions.  It also covers all maintenance arising from storm damage or other causes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Phoenix Park the report prepared by the architectural students of Bolton Street College of Technology on its future use contained many interesting recommendations which, I am happy to say, provoked <Col N="13" /> widespread public interest. The Office of Public Works is currently examining the recommendations in consultation with all parties interested in the use of the park.</P>
    <P>Part of the Kenmare Estate in Killarney was purchased in 1972 and is now open to the public.  It is a valuable addition to the amenities of Killarney.</P>
    <P>During the coming season it is hoped to operate an information centre at Garnish Island.  Specially recruited and trained staff will be available at the centre to answer visitors' queries and to help them gain a better appreciation of this wonderful island garden. I hope that it may be possible at some later stage to extend the information service to include guided tours of the island.</P>
    <P>Scientific investigation of conservation problems in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park is proceeding under the sponsorship of the Office of Public Works.  Reports on the first research projects have been received and the findings are being considered with a view to their practical application to park management in the near future.</P>
    <P>Nature interpretation facilities for visitors to the various parks are being extended.  Arrangements for nature trails at Derrynane and in the Phoenix Park are almost complete.</P>
    <P>Subhead F2 provides for the supply of replacement furniture and additional items required for existing State buildings. The increase over last year's provision is due mainly to the continued expansion of the staffs of Government Departments and the increased cost of furniture and fittings.  The subhead includes the cost of running a furniture repair workshop and the furniture prototype unit set up in 1969.  Apart from prototype work, the unit provides furniture and fittings to a very high quality to meet special requirements and has been of particular assistance in raising the standards of furniture financed from public funds.</P>
    <P>The increase under subhead F3 is due principally to the continuing need of leasing additional office space to accommodate the expanding staffs of various Departments and to increased rents of existing premises.  Extra <Col N="14" /> accommodation has had to be rented for the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Fisheries, Labour, Local Government, Justice, Health, Foreign Affairs and Industry and Commerce, and provision has had to be made also for Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead F. 4, considerable increases have taken place in costs of fuel and light in Government premises. These increases, together with the provision of additional office accommodation and the demand for higher standards in both existing and new accommodation, account for the increase in the provision for this subhead.</P>
    <P>The opening of subhead F. 5 and the following subhead was agreed to under the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 8 last year.  It is required to meet the cost of compensation, <i>et cetera,</i> arising from damage to the property of external Governments.  The properties involved are the British Embassy, the British Passport Office, both damaged in February, 1972, the British Ministry of Health and Social Security in Cork and the German Embassy.  The present total estimated cost of such compensation is £130,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead F. 6, which is a new subhead, is required to meet expenditure by the Commissioners on repairs to Drogheda courthouse.  The Minister for Justice, acting under section 6 of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, directed the Commissioners to put the accommodation at this courthouse into proper order. The total estimated cost of this work which is well advanced is £8,000.  The costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners on the work are, under the Act referred to, recoverable from the Louth County Council.</P>
    <P>The G subheads provide for expenditure in connection with the arterial drainage programme which is being carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>Subhead Gl for which £49,500, or £19,500 more than last year, is sought provides for the carrying out of certain hydrometric studies and of the comprehensive drainage surveys which are a <Col N="15" /> necessary preliminary to arterial drainage schemes.  In view of the number of catchments which have now been surveyed it has been found possible to reduce the sum to be provided for drainage surveys from £5,000 to £2,200 while, in line with the growing awareness of the need for increased study of our water resources and the increasing demand for data in connection with them the sum required for hydrometric investigations has been increased and is now £47,300 as compared with £25,000 in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>Last year reference was made in the context of G1 to the matter of full scale cost/benefit analyses of arterial drainage.  The report on these studies, which are centred on the Maigue and Groody Catchments, should be of great value in the assessment of future policy.  The report should be available shortly.</P>
    <P>Subhead G2 provides for expenditure on works in progress; £1,026,000 is being requested this year, an increase of £148,000 on last year's provision.</P>
    <P>The increase is due to rising wages and costs and in addition provides for a start to be made this year on the Maigue catchment drainage scheme. There is demand for this scheme both by farmers of the catchment and various other interests.  The principal charge on the Subhead continues of course to be the giant Boyne drainage scheme now in its fourth year.  The money also provides for the completion of the Groody scheme in County Limerick and of the Corrib&mdash;Headford scheme.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.3 provides for the maintenance of completed drainage schemes and embankment works. £643,200 is sought this year as against last year's final figure of £515,000. This increase reflects increased costs and also the completion of further schemes whose maintenance is now being provided for under the subhead.</P>
    <P>I am asking for £518,400 for subhead H for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery, the purchase of stores and the payment of wages to the workshop <Col N="16" /> staffs.  It is intended to continue with the planned replacement of the fleet of dragline excavators with more modern and more efficient hydraulic excavators which will reduce working costs.</P>
    <P>Provision for coast protection works, under subhead I, has been increased to £79,500.  The schemes at Moville, County Donegal, and Strandhill, County Sligo, have been completed. The work at Youghal, County Cork, is nearing completion and it is expected that a scheme at Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, will also be completed this year.  The next scheme to be carried out is at Enniscrone, County Sligo.  The preliminary requirements which have to be met under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, are being fulfilled in regard to this project and to proposals at Ballyvoile, County Waterford, and the Maharees, County Kerry.  Deputies will appreciate that the procedures required by the Act are protracted; while the design of a scheme involves prolonged and detailed study with a high degree of specialised engineering skill.  In the event the period between the initial application by a local authority and the commencement of work could run into some years.</P>
    <P>Subhead J.1 provides for general expenditure on national monuments. The amount sought, £422,400, represents an increase of £108,400, on the amount voted last year.  As pressure on the environment increases, due to the accelerated rate of industrial and agricultural development, the need to protect our heritage of monuments and sites increases.  Monuments of national importance have to be afforded the protection of the National Monuments Acts, and more than 1,000 are already in State care.  Monuments of less importance which have to be destroyed to make way for development work have to be scientifically excavated and recorded.</P>
    <P>There is a growing emphasis on the proper presentation of monuments and this year it is planned to extend the guide information service during the tourist season to Clonmacnoise, County Offaly, Jerpoint Abbey, County Kilkenny and Aughnanure Castle County <Col N="17" /> Galway, in addition to Cashel, Cahir and Newgrange.</P>
    <P>I have decided to have Charles Fort, Kinsale, formally scheduled us a national monument and to have conservation works started there this year. A sum of £10,000 approximately will be devoted to this monument alone in 1973-4 in view of its importance as one of the best examples of a 17th-century military fort in these islands.  Its massive proportions and commanding situation at the mouth of Kinsale Harbour make it popular and interesting for visitors and local residents alike.</P>
    <P>The work force required to service the monuments in State care has been expanded to approximately 150 men. It is divided into five districts, each controlled by a clerk of works.  During the years a skilled team of stone masons, carpenters and general operatives has been built up, which means that the skills and careful workmanship required in this field are available.  I am allowing in the amount sought for further expansion by the creation of one further district this year in the south-west, Killarney area, as I already mentioned in connection with subhead E.  The creation of smaller and more compact districts leads to the provision of a better maintenance service.</P>
    <P>Each year a programme of works is undertaken designed if possible to ensure that every monument in State care receives attention.  This programme comprises major conservation schemes, minor repairs and routine maintenance.</P>
    <P>Major conservation schemes will continue this year at Portumna Castle and Clontuskert Abbey, County Galway; Ballyhack Castle and St. Selskar's Abbey, Wexford; Kells Priory, County Kilkenny; Trim Castle, Knowth and Newgrange, County Meath.  Conservation schemes were completed last year at St. Francis Abbey, Kilkenny; Kanturk Castle, County Cork; Creevelea Abbey and Parks Castle, County Leitrim; Claregalway Abbey, County Galway and Ardmore, County Waterford.  In the current year works are due to commence at King John's Castle, <Col N="18" /> Limerick; St. Mac Dara's Island, County Galway; Kilbolane Castle, County Cork; Ferns Castle, County Wexford; and the Casino, Marino, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Minor repairs are carried out each year at a large number of monuments. Last year these included Kilcooly and Athassel Abbeys, County Tipperary; Fore Abbey, County Westmeath; Monasterboice, County Louth; Straide and Moyne Abbeys, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Routine maintenance is undertaken in the summer months by travelling teams who visit monuments and undertake grasscutting, tidying, removal of wall growths and spraying ivy and weeds.  This service is being stepped up this year when it is expected that more than 75 per cent of all monuments in the Commissioners' care will be reached upon.</P>
    <P>Archaeological excavations at 23 sites were financed and either serviced or directly undertaken in 1972 by the Commissioners.  Eleven of these were excavations recommended for grant by the Royal Irish Academy for the purposes of academic research.  Two are rescue excavations being carried out by the National Museum in the High Street-Winetavern Street area of Dublin prior to building development by the Dublin Corporation.  These sites have proved exceptionally rich in artefacts and are of international significance, throwing much light on lifestyles here back to Viking times.  Two rescue excavations, one at Lisconly, County Galway, and the other at Breedogue, County Sligo, were undertaken to record monuments before destruction prior to agricultural development and road widening respectively. Six excavations were carried out at national monument sites as a preliminary to conservation works.</P>
    <P>The archaeological survey set up in 1965 to record scientifically and make a national inventory of all monuments will continue its work this year in Counties Westmeath, Longford and Cavan.</P>
    <P>The erection of information plaques in co-operation with Bord Fáilte at national monuments has been in progress <Col N="19" /> during the past year and many of our more important monuments such as, for example, Glendalough, Co. Wicklow; Trim Castle, County Meath; Boyle Abbey, County Roscommon; and Ross Errilly Friary, County Galway, have been so provided. The erection of further plaques is being arranged.</P>
    <P>Subhead J. 2 provides for a further grant-in-aid towards the cost of the restoration of Holycross Abbey, County Tipperary, for which special legislation was enacted in 1969.  The cost of the restoration work is being recouped by the Archdiocese of Cashel who make periodic lodgments which are credited to subhead L.  The cost of conservation works to the fabric of the monument is being borne by the State.  Good progress is being made in overcoming the many technical problems posed by the restoration of a 15th-century building. The project is of wide interest and accords with the growing international emphasis on the rehabilitation of ancient buildings.</P>
    <P>Subhead K covers the annual grant-in-aid for the operation and maintenance of the yacht <i>Asgard.</i> The <i>Asgard</i> is administered by a committee set up by the Government and is being used for the training of young people in the art of sailing.  Also, she has participated with notable success in a number of important races for sail training vessels, including international events.  I understand that the committee have quite a big programme this year extending from March to October, and that this will include international racing.</P>
    <P>My statement gives an idea of the widespread activities of the Office of Public Works.  If any Deputy wants further information on any matter I have touched on, or if I have omitted reference to any item in which a Deputy has particular interest, I shall be happy to try to give it to him in my reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no motion by me to refer this Estimate back, because so far as I can establish, except for some minor changes, it is almost identical to that which was in <Col N="20" /> preparation when I was in the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>First of all, I wish to congratulate Deputy Henry Kenny on his appointment to the Parliamentary Secretaryship. It has been a very good appointment, and in the years when he was sitting on this side of the House and I was sitting on that side, I think we had a very happy relationship.  I hope that this happy relationship will continue, and also that it will not be too long before we change sides of the House again.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Kenny was speaking here for the first time in the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance he expressed a view that the Office of Public Works covered a big enough field to justify it being a full Ministry.  This was in relation to the Devlin Report No. 1, where it was suggested that the Office of Public Works might be done away with altogether.  I think the only weakness in the OPW is that, except in relation to parks and monuments, it lacks decision-making powers. While it is true that many Ministers make the decisions, they make the decisions directly on the advice of the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the Office of Public Works.  Indeed, under many heads I directly influenced changes in Government decisions in relation to public spending through the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some things I did under direction, such as the instant translation system here.  The Minister of the day and myself did not agree entirely on the installation of this unit.  I had a small knowledge of Irish, and when we had voluntary classes among Deputies here every Thursday morning I found I could actually talk the native tongue once I got a little practice, not very well and not in public, but I could understand what was being said.  When somebody spoke in Irish in the House I took an interest in trying to follow what he was saying. Now it is too easy; you just plug in, take up the earphone and you do not have to try any more.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would ask the Minister to think about this again. It is not an obstruction in the House; <Col N="21" /> it just does away with space for two civil servants to help advise the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another proposal to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred in his brief, that is, the proposal to cage in the public gallery once more.  As far as I could figure out when I was Parliamentary Secretary, nearly every member of the Opposition was opposed to this idea, and I personally was opposed to it.  I understood the recommendation came from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and I think it was the present Minister for Local Government who said he did not remember it having come up there and that he would bring it back.  I said: &ldquo;Please do.  I do not think this should be done.&rdquo;  Then the Committee on Procedure and Privileges came back to me and said this glass cage was to be erected around the gallery.</P>
    <P>A new Committee on Procedure and Privileges were appointed yesterday and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would ask them to have another look at this question.  This matter arose two years ago when somebody threw a smoke bomb into the Westminster Parliament, and it was feared that somebody might throw a smoke bomb over the top here.  That is two years ago and it has not happened, and it is less likely to happen now than it was at any time before.  On matters of politics in relation to North and South and the United Kingdom I think the major parties are in general agreement, so we would not know who the offender would be trying to smoke out.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretory to consult once again with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and see if he can do away with what I think would be an unhappy development.</P>
    <P>It has also been mentioned that the new Stamping Branch is likely to be completed in the coming year.  I had an idea&mdash;I do not think it is on the files but it was a thought in my head&mdash; that when this Stamping Branch vacated the lower region of Dublin Castle that the area should be used as an historical exhibition centre.  It was my idea that we should have a Michael Collins room, a Seán T. O'Kelly room. a Douglas Hyde room, a Seán Lemass <Col N="22" /> room or one for anybody who has made a contribution to the national interest.</P>
    <P>I believe that in Dublin Castle the people of all nationalities who call to see the State Departments should be in a position to obtain some sense of our modem history.  Such items as letters or personal belongings of these people on all sides who made contributions to the State could be exhibited.  Not only would it be of interest to tourists but it would also be of interest to our own people and, in particular, to students. That area of the building seems to be ideal for it.  Dublin Castle is historically associated with our history and it amazes people from abroad when they visit the church in Dublin Castle to see that we still have the shields of the vice regal and our overlords over the years.  This is all part of our history but there is a gap from the time the English left and the modern time.</P>
    <P>I agree that some years ago it might have been difficult to do this because it might have aroused emotion.  Now we can pay respect in a historic way to the people who served the nation and it does not matter whether we agreed with them or not.  If we develop the lower area of Dublin Castle in this way it would be a tremendous contribution to our history and a great attraction for our tourists.</P>
    <P>I gather that there is to be no change and that the new building to be erected in Kildare Place is to be used to centralise the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and that the civil servants spread throughout the city are to be accommodated in it. I believe that even with the staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries moving into this building there will be room left.  If there is room left I suggest that it should be made available to the Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Rooms should be made available in this building so that the Shadow Cabinet could have private rooms.  It is close enough to this building and I feel sure that a link could be made with it whereby Members of this House could utilise it.  I am not just trying to get rooms for the Shadow Cabinet as such because, as the <Col N="23" /> Deputies now in Government know, when they were in Opposition there was pressure on space.  I have given up working here and carry out all my work at home because of overcrowding. I do not know what Members did before the new building was completed.</P>
    <P>If a floor in that building will not be occupied by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries it should be made available to the Members of the Oireachtas.  This will relieve the pressure that is being put on the Office of Public Works to make available the present Art school for use by Members. If the National Library is to be expanded the obvious way to expand it is into the Art school.  I understand that pressure is already on to permit the use of the Art school, when it is vacated, by Members of the Oireachtas. I understand that this pressure has come from Members of the Oireachtas, and even from the Ceann Comhairle's office.</P>
    <P>I believe that a floor of the new building for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries can be made available for the Members of the Oireachtas.  It should be remembered that this is one of the biggest office blocks to be erected in the city.  If that floor can be made available for use by the Members of the Oireachtas the pressure will be taken off the National Library and the library will be allowed to stay on its present site and extend.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Library, I believe that part of the basement area of the new building being erected on the other side of Kildare Street should be taken over by the Office of Public Works for the purpose of storing the records of the National Library.  If this is to be done negotiations will have to start immediately, because in order to preserve some old papers, it will be necessary to have some form of air conditioning installed so that these papers would not deteriorate.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if we could provide the additional accommodation for the members of the Shadow Cabinet more accommodation could be made available to the Government members <Col N="24" /> who, I understand, are not satisfied with the amount of accommodation they have.  The Opposition are not satisfied with the accommodation they have.  The changes I have suggested would solve a lot of the problems at very little cost.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has referred, in his statement, to the question of decentralisation of Government Departments. Unlike what a &ldquo;backbencher&rdquo; would have us believe it is not true that every time we talk in this House about decentralisation of Government offices that it is an election gimmick and that it is an indication that there is an election in the air.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the files and can see exactly what has happened.  There was an objection by the Civil Servants to a total moving of the Departments and a modified scheme was brought up.  The plans, I believe, were ready when the present Government took office.  It is on the record now, and I hope it is made clear so that certain correspondents will apologise for their accusations.  I know they have to try to sell &ldquo;copy&rdquo; but it is on the record now that this matter was being proceeded with as announced.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Kenny was on this side of the House he said he could see no development taking place in this regard.  At that time I drew his attention to the fact that trees had been planted on the sites as an indication that we were proceeding with this policy.  I believe that it is a good thing that there is to be a degree of centralisation and decentralisation.  In the case of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries it will mean that people will not have to take a bus, or use a bicycle, to travel from one office in the city to another to meet a senior civil servant.</P>
    <P>If you are to have the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Dublin it should be centralised in one building.  On the other hand, if you can move sections of the Department into rural Ireland to create activity and prosperity there this should be done and I am very happy that Castlebar and Athlone will benefit from this policy.  I am disappointed that <Col N="25" /> the original intention was so strongly opposed but I can understand that people were buying houses and had children going to school and did not want to move.  The scheme is now going ahead on this basis and this is the best way and I am sure that when staff move to the new offices in Athlone and Castlebar they will find life there so pleasant that their friends will want to follow them and be transferred to that part of the country as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>One matter concerns me here as it was a matter on which I was working for about three years.  Perhaps I should say it was the chairman of the Commissioners who was working on it.  I had asked the Commissioners to do a study on whether we should rent or build offices.  I must congratulate the chairman on having produced an excellent report showing the advantages of building over renting.  The original idea was that by renting you were conserving capital which could be used for other purposes but in the long term the State was losing money because of these four-year and seven-year clauses under which rents were changed.  From the time the chairman prepared that report for submission to the Minister and the Government to the time we got sanction to go ahead with the building some two years elapsed.  The magnitude of the problem can be understood when it had to be examined for that length of time.  As far as I know at least two contracts are already placed for the building of offices, probably three now.  A third one was pending which, perhaps, has now been placed.  Six or seven other projects were envisaged. In all, from memory, about nine projects were envisaged for the building of office accommodation.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to express a special word of thanks to the city manager, Mr. Macken, because in our discussions with him we found him most co-operative.  He indicated a number of derelict sites in the city and said that if the State were so interested the corporation would use their compulsory powers to acquire them and then pass them over to the Office of Public Works <Col N="26" /> for the development of office accommodation. I am very hopeful that the Government will see the wisdom of this change.  I can understand why renting was the order of the day at one time but inflation has been such in building that I think the report prepared by the chairman of the Commissioners proved beyond doubt that from now on the more accommodation built rather than rented by the State the better.  I hope that capital will be made available for this purpose in increasing amounts over the years.  I hope we can build to the extent that we can vacate some of the accommodation now rented.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulty we had in the case of a particular building which we were renting and which was extended. It was quite obvious to the owner of the building that it was very important for us to get hold of the extension and when he came into the Office of Public Works to discuss the matter, as far as I was concerned, he was holding the Department up to ransom.  We could not surrender the accommodation we had and we badly needed the new accommodation that had become available. It took prolonged negotiation to get any reasonable price for that accommodation.  So long as a building programme is going ahead I do not think developers will be able to hold the Office of Public Works up to ransom in that way.</P>
    <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell me what is the present position regarding the inscription on the back wall of the Garden of Remembrance? A competition for a suitable poem was held, as far as I remember, and a decision was made in that regard.  Personally. I had a different view as to what should be inscribed there but the Government decided on the poem.  Will that decision be carried out and if so, when?  Has the work already started? I do not know; I have not been along there recently.  That back wall must certainly be inscribed and I do not mind whether the inscription is what I think is the moat suitable or not. My personal view agreed with that of Mr. Dáithi Hanlon, the architect, that the wall should be inscribed with the Prologue to the Constitution in at least seven, or nine, languages, according to <Col N="27" /> the number of panels.  However, the previous decision, I understand, was that the poem which won the competition should be inscribed there and that every so often a new poem would be added to bring it up-to-date.  I should like to know what is happening in this regard.  As we know, the election came quickly and this was something that I should like to have had tidied up before leaving but I was unable to do so in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another project was the John F. Kennedy Hall.  The Minister for Finance in the previous administration took major responsibility for this. There is a site at Beggar's Bush which is probably worth £1 million if it were disposed of and perhaps the hall can be built there.  It seems a good location although it may cause some traffic problems.  I think the former Minister, by inference at least, was in favour of the proposal that the site should be somewhere between the Wellington Monument and Parkgate Street.  I think that would be a pity but I believe the thinking behind that was that the Phoenix Park will not, in fact, be on the outskirts of the city any longer but a park in the middle of the city as the city expands.</P>
    <P>My own view was that there was an ideal location in Raheny Park to which you could run a railway line. It is a matter of only three or five minutes by train from Amiens Street. Whatever happens, we should make a decision on this matter.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, modified plans were submitted by the architect since he left the Office of Public Works which would reduce the cost to the amount of the original estimate.  Whether we decide on the modified plans, on the full-scale magnificent plan envisaged by Mr. McGrath, or whether we decide not to have a concert hall at all, we should make a decision.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister promised a decision but the general election intervened. I gather a decision would have been made in connection with this year's budget had the previous administration continued in office. Members of the original committee <Col N="28" /> have died or are not Members of this House now.  Before the final decision is announced in the House, the allparty committee might be consulted in advance and their views sought. They did very good work and inspected concert halls in Germany, France and America.  Eventually they produced a magnificent plan and I assume the only reason it was not proceeded with was due to finance.</P>
    <P>Last year when I introduced the Estimate I announced that a statue to Roger Casement would be erected in Glasnevin Cemetery during the year. As far as I know it has not been erected although provision was made for it in last year's Estimate.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would explain what is happening with regard to this matter.  If the statue has not been erected, work should be proceeded with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to Scoil Eanna in his opening remarks but I do not think he gave us sufficient details.  I should like to know what progress has been made on work on the house and the grounds.  I know that the grounds are open and that there are temporary playing pitches.  I understand it was proposed to have discussions with the GAA regarding the laying of permanent playing pitches, and I should like to know when this will be done. The Parliamentary Secretary should tell us how long it will take to carry out restoration work on the house.  I understand some outbuildings were demolished and I do not know if these will be replaced but I understand that the wish of the Pearse family is that the house should be restored to its original state.  In addition, there is an orchard and gardens which will have to be restored as all the trees and plants will have to be replaced.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to go into details on this matter. The school was closed because it was dangerous for people to go near the house.  After the State inherited the property there were some demonstrations and walls were knocked down to make access available for the children of the area.  Now the situation has reversed in that although part of the <Col N="29" /> grounds are open to the public they do not seem to be aware of the fact.  The grounds could be utilised to a much greater extent; there are beautiful gardens and walks and there is a proposal to have a nature trail in the grounds. This is an important and historic house and grounds and the people should know about it.  There is a committee examining the personal papers of the Pearse family to decide what is of value; I have seen the papers and I found them very interesting.  It has been said that Patrick Pearse was not a businessman but when one sees his book-keeping one realises he was a good businessman as well as a patriot.</P>
    <P>Although provision was made last year in the Estimate for the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham nothing has been done about this matter.  At the outset of my term of office I found out immediately that the problem was money.  I agitated and eventually provision was made last year to start this work.  However, it appears from the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that work has not started yet.  He said that he hoped something would be done this year but that is not good enough.  Last year I hoped something would be done also but it was not done.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that there is a shortage of architects.  If the Office of Public Works have not a sufficient number of architects to start work on this job they should get outside architects who would be glad to do the work.  Kilmainham has some beautiful grounds and when I found work was not being done I suggested the gardens might be opened to the public.  However, the chief architect advised it would be dangerous to let people in to the gardens because the buildings were in a bad condition.  We have an advantage over European countries and America in that we have some green spaces and gardens where people can enjoy the reasonably fresh air we have.  Yet, these beautiful gardens are closed to the public because there is not an architect in the Office of Public Works to attend to this work.  The money was provided last year and is provided again this year <Col N="30" /> and I want an assurance that something will be done.</P>
    <P>The previous administration had proposals to have a folk museum at Kilmainham.  It was thought that cottages might be erected and many of our old traditions and cultures presented in a way that would show how the Irish people lived in former times.  This was a good idea and I should like to see it expanded.</P>
    <P>We have a statue of Queen Victoria somewhere in the basement in Merrion Square and we have a statue of Gough who was blown up in the Phoenix Park.  I think that statue could be repaired. There is another man in Stephen's Green.  There are many controversial statues locked in dungeons and cellars and I suggest we could collect all of them, put them in the gardens at Kilmainham as an exhibition of historical statues set up here by the people who oppressed our people for so many years.  Not only would we have an attraction for students of Ireland but we would have a historical park of interest to every age, every sex and every creed.  A sum of 20p admission could be charged to view the statues.  I believe this could become a tremendous centre of interest.  After all, they are part of our history.  The grounds at Kilmainham are lying idle and would be an ideal place for such an exhibition.  If somebody wants to blow them up he can have one good bang and they will all go up together. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give us his observations on that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some comments on the restoration of the East Pier at Dún Laoghaire.  A sum of £10,000 was provided last year for this work.  The lift has gone and the sheds have gone but it seems to me that since the general election results came in the work has stopped.  Not one stone has been moved since the change of Government.</P>
    <P>A firm commitment was given by the President-Elect when he was minister for Transport and Power&mdash;that pier would never have been built were it not for his commitment at that time&mdash;that the East Pier would be restored to the exact condition in which it had been. <Col N="31" /> That commitment was made in this House and was accepted by Deputies on both sides.  However, as soon as the general election results came in the work stopped suddenly, as far as I can see.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not be subject to pressure from some people in Bord Fáilte and in the Department of Transport and Power. They were putting pressure on me to try to have me renege on that commitment which was a firm one, one which I was determined to honour.</P>
    <P>The sooner the two unsightly lumps of concrete there are blasted away the better.  The restoration of the East Pier was to be done in three stages.  The first stage was to get rid of the ugly sheds.  They have gone, and indeed I think we sold them at a profit.  The second thing was to get rid of the synchro-lift and to take away the two blocks of concrete.  In my time I agreed with the views of local interests that, when stage two was completed, we would go and have another look to see if stage three was necessary or indeed if the bit of a platform there could be used as a car park or for some other amenity purpose.  I understand that to bring cars down so far on the pier would be a disservice rather than an amenity to the area.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Kenny has ever walked down the East Pier at Dún Laoghaire.  It has been a recreational exercise not only for local people but for people from Dublin.  It is a hell of a long walk but an invigorating one because there is the pure sea air all the time.  I should like to see the restoration of the pier proceeded with immediately.  The money to complete the work was provided last year but since this Government took office the work has stopped.</P>
    <P>A decision was taken by the previous Government&mdash;it does not mean I agreed with it&mdash;that multi-purpose ships are to come into Dún Laoghaire. This involves the building of a big causeway in front of the Royal St. George Yacht Club.  I went out there two weeks ago and I asked the people there why they had not kicked up a row.  They explained it was a sort of thing they inherited from the past. <Col N="32" /> They were allowed to be there with the consent of the Lord Lieutenant many years ago and if the Lord Lieutenant had not been made an honorary member they would have had their privileges withdrawn.  They felt, after the Board of Works had conceded part of the harbour to them to increase their dinghy berthing space, that to make any public protest against this development might do them considerable damage.  I said this is nonsense but I could not make my point of view felt with the Government unless there was visible public support for that point of view.</P>
    <P>To my mind the business of container traffic coming into Dún Laoghaire is a tragedy.  With the expansion of Dublin Bay, whatever one thinks about oil refineries and so on, Dublin Bay can be expanded fully to handle all container traffic.  To interfere with Dún Laoghaire as an amenity harbour is, to my mind, a sacrilege.  I hope that, as a result of my few words here today, local interests will make their views felt about it.  I have checked with them and I know they agree with my point of view, but they have not been as vocal as they were when the development was taking place for the car ferry terminal on the East Pier.</P>
    <P>I would point out that when the car ferry terminals on both sides are in utilisation 22 boats can be turned around every 24 hours.  Surely that is sufficient for that harbour until, after a few years, all the traffic will be by hydrofloat.  When the mailboat stops coming into Dún Laoghaire, as it will in the next few years, if I had a say in the matter I would demolish Carlisle Pier because it might easily become a second Blackpool Pier with hurdy-gurdies and all the rest of it.  It is a beautiful harbour which should be preserved as an amenity and I hope the decision to bring in multi-purpose boats alongside Carlisle Pier will be reversed.  I am most unhappy about it.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary did not say in his opening statement why restoration work has not yet started on the picture gallery wing of Kilkenny <Col N="33" /> Castle.  When this project was first put up for tender the man who we felt might be able to do a good job put in a tender considered to be too high.  The lowest tender was considered so low that it was feared the job could not be done properly.  It was then sent out for tender again and a man of particular skill tendered at about the price that was felt to be justified and acceptable by my advisers. While we were waiting for sanction from the Department of Finance, he got a bit fed up and accepted another commission.  He said this work would be finished about February and he would then be able to move into the picture gallery.  The advice tendered to me was that, rather than looking for somebody else, we had better wait until February since this man was an expert.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries about it and, although he was very disappointed, when I explained the situation to him he accepted it.  Now I find that the work is not starting after all.  This is a great disappointment because it must be a year and a half overdue. I appreciate that it is a very skilled job and that we must get an expert to do it.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell me what happened to the man for whom we put off the contract for so many months until he would be available.  Something must have happened to him.  He must have died or something.  I have no idea.  It is a tremendous disappointment to me to hear that once again this work has been postponed.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Castle has a tremendous potential.  If the development envisaged in conjunction with Bord Fáilte is proceeded with, and if greater publicity is given to the study made of it by the Bolton Street students, we can make Kilkenny a new tourist centre. Most people who get off the boat in Rosslare head over to Cork and out to Killarney and get on to that tourist circuit.  There is no reason why they should not go to see the ancient bridges, and mills, and monuments, and castles on the Kilkenny/Cashel circuit.  People coming up from Rosslare <Col N="34" /> can enjoy the navigation and the fishing on the Nore.  There are many things of historic interest in the area, because the Butlers who were responsible for the building of the castle somehow avoided getting involved in the major Irish wars, with the result that the historic monuments within that area are better preserved, probably, than anywhere else in the country.  I am very disappointed that this work has not started.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me how the Butler Society is progressing in the raising of funds for the restoration of what will be known as the Butler wing of the castle.  I should like to hear if the proposal to put a bar and restaurant in the main building is being proceeded with. As I say, there is a tremendous potential. To avoid bringing in legislation which might delay this work, we decided that it would be declared an extension of the National Picture Gallery; the pictures could not be brought down without legislation unless it was so declared.  This was all done to save time, and now we are told that for some reason or other the man whose tender was accepted has suddenly vanished from the face of the earth.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain this to me in great detail.  I have no idea how it came about and I should certainly like to know.  I was glad to hear that a visitors' centre is to be provided at Dunmore Cave in County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I am sure it will be agreed that the work done in promoting Shannon navigation has paid off very handsomely. In spite of the tremendous growth in the number of boats on the Shannon waters they are still what would be termed in any European country very uncrowded waters.  There was some difficulty from time to time between the Office of Public Works and the boat hirers.  Fortunately Messrs. Guinness in Dublin made facilities available to bring representatives of the Office of Public Works and the boat hirers together at a meeting.  At that meeting it appeared that the only difficulty was the order of priority.  I attended the initial meeting and then it was a matter for the officials, the technical <Col N="35" /> people, to work out what the priorities would be for 1973/74.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear if meetings took place subsequently.  Are the Office of Public Works working on priorities with the agreement of the boat hirers? Will the Parliamentary Secretary outline what work will be undertaken in the forthcoming financial year?  When you speak about the Shannon you must also refer to the river Barrow.  As I recollect, Bord Fáilte were carrying out a survey of the Barrow navigation.  I should like to know if it will be possible to link up the Shannon and Barrow navigation to a greater extent than was possible heretofore.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister for Transport and Power has legislation prepared&mdash;I imagine it is almost in final draft&mdash;to take over the Grand Canal which will be considered an extension of the Shannon navigation. I know that the Office of Public Works have some objection to taking over the Royal Canal because it can only be taken over for the purpose of reclaiming it.  It would seem that CIE, being the owners and having all the knowledge about the deeds and so on, would probably be able to do the job of reclaiming the Royal Canal more efficiently than the Office of Public Works.  Unfortunately, there is no possibility of including the Royal Canal in the Shannon navigation system.  I was pressing the previous Minister to bring in this legislation as soon as possible because at the moment the Grand Canal is full of weeds.  It is a most ugly-looking sight. Naturally CIE will not spend much money on it in the knowledge that the Office of Public Works will take responsibility for it as soon as the legislation passes through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I admit it took some time to finalise this matter and that the Office of Public Works and the Department of Transport and Power were not always in full agreement on what form the legislation should take.  Certainly we were anxious and willing to take over the Grand Canal because it is an integral part of the Shannon navigation <Col N="36" /> system.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to press the Minister to bring forward this legislation as quickly as possible because, the longer it is left, the bigger the problem of the restoration of the Grand Canal will become.  It has been neglected.  I have never seen it so full of weeds.  Obviously CIE are not anxious to spend money on it when it may become a national charge through the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I am slightly concerned about, and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could straighten me out on it.  It was proposed to establish a major fishery harbour in Galway.  Local fishermen decided that it should be established elsewhere, which is now being done. There is a site in the ownership of the Office of Public Works adjacent to the harbour in Galway city which is apparently being left lying idle.  I understand the harbour master could establish some industry on this site if it is made available to the harbour commissioners.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to do one of two things: either to say that he is going to establish another fishery harbour there or to say that he is prepared to dispose of the site for industrial development.</P>
    <P>There is no town, especially in the West, that does not want industrial development; that includes Galway, Limerick and Sligo.  If there is industry available for this site it would be a very short-sighted policy for the Office of Public Works to sit on the site indefinitely just in case they might at some time in the future need it for something.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the situation and to let me know what he proposes to do with this site originally purchased for the development of a major fishery harbour that has now gone elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In Killarney a great deal of untreated sewage goes directly into the lakes.  I intended to make a fuss about this and then I discovered that Muckross House was one of the culprits.  I got agreement to the provision of septic tanks for the treatment of all sewage out of Office of Public Works establishments <Col N="37" /> in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park. I should like to know if a septic tank has been installed in Muckross House. I would also like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary will do what I intended to do once our own house was in order, to pressurise the local authority into seeing that septic tanks are installed in all private dwellings in the area and thereby ensure that the lakes do not become polluted or, indeed, an open sewer.  The value of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park and the lakes is inestimable.  Anyone who has had the privilege of visiting the area appreciates that the natural beauty there is beyond description.  Exceptional steps should be taken&mdash;if necessary, the Parliamentary Secretary should exceed his portfolio&mdash;to ensure that the lakes and the area surrounding them are maintained and preserved to the maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Parliamentary Secretary in his tribute to Mr. John McShain of Killarney House. He has presented the island of Innisfallen to the nation.  I deeply appreciate his action.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that this island will be a cherished part of the Killarney National Park and the ancient monastic remains on it which, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, he believes will in time rival Muckross Abbey as a point of interest for visitors. I understand that Mr. McShain has also agreed to place the historic Ross Castle in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works to enable them to carry out conservation works there.  We can never sufficiently express our thanks to Mr. McShain.  He has been a friend of the nation for many years and his recent action demonstrates once again his great interest in Ireland and in the preservation of its natural beauty.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the previous administration had made provision for greatly extended works for the Department of Justice and I am glad to see that the estimate has not been interfered with and that these works are going ahead. They include police stations, jail improvements and so forth.  The Parliamentary Secretary made no specific reference to the female prison to be <Col N="38" /> provided in North County Dublin.  I should like to know what the position is.  I understand a site has been acquired and work will begin on the site pretty soon.</P>
    <P>I have had a slight conflict from time to time with the Minister for Education. So far as I am aware, the provision agreed to for national schools was £5,100,000.  The Minister for Education keeps assuring me it was only £5 million.  I cannot extract from the Minister where the difference lies and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me how this discrepancy comes about.  There may be a simple explanation and, if there is, I should like to have it.  I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>There are to be archaeological and biological studies this year of Dunmore Cave National Monument.  While there has been a great expansion in archaeological surveys I still think the resources for these are inadequate.  I am aware that in Cork University the number of archaeological students has increased nearly three hundredfold.  I imagine the interest in this particular science is also increasing in our other universities and so there is no longer the excuse that we have not enough sufficiently skilled people.  The students are being trained and what we must do now is give them an outlet for the knowledge they have acquired, thereby speeding up the archaeological programme. Once a bulldozer goes in on a site every artifact, everything of interest, is demolished.  It is a matter of national urgency therefore to speed up our archaeological activities and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to press the Government for more and more money for this important work.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to our national monuments.  If a monument is knocked down it is gone for ever.  It was always my very great regret, when I was Parliamentary Secretary, that I could not put preservation orders on very many more objects of historic interest.  It is also my very great regret that local authorities seem to be negligent in their responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Preserving our past for the future&rdquo; is to be the slogan of the Architectural <Col N="39" /> Heritage Year 1975.  We must preserve our past.  Probably until after the last World War we did not really appreciate its value.  I think everybody appreciates it now and one is pushing an open door where the public are concerned instead of putting oneself behind a blind political wall for fear of losing votes.  The public want to see their heritage preserved. They want this archaeological study to be carried out.  In Newgrange a civilisation has been discovered which is at least 6,000 years old.  These people did not hunt for food; they hunted only for sport; there is evidence of that. They grew grain; there is evidence of that.  They reared cattle, sheep and pigs.  They must have been one of the earliest civilised communities in Western Europe.  That is something worth finding out.  It is certainly something worth exploring.</P>
    <P>The last time I visited Newgrange a skeleton had just been uncovered.  The man must have died just outside the walls.  His teeth were worn down to half their original size.  This had happened because of chewing grain. There were no cavities in the teeth. There was no sugar available during his lifetime.  This demonstrates the damage done by sugar to the teeth. It has been established by the archaeologists that this was so.  Newgrange is one of the most interesting sites in the country.  A guide service is operated there.  The young people operating it are doing an excellent job.  I would like to congratulate them especially in view of the large numbers of people with whom they have to deal.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary hopes to commence the building of a visitor centre at Clonmacnoise national monument.  Hope is not good enough. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us that he intends to start the project this year.  The project is a worthy one.</P>
    <P>Another problem which causes me great concern is that of vandalism.  I did not find a solution to this problem. Perhaps my successor, coming fresh to the office, will be able to do so.  The vandalism at Cashel is disgraceful. Vandals came in and <Col N="40" /> smashed the floodlights and also used something like a heavy hatchet to cut heavy cables.  The floodlighting at Cashel is beautiful.  Anyone who has seen it will agree with that.  It makes the castle stand out at night and is a tremendous feature in that part of the country.  Guinness's, who provided the floodlighting and who in return were allowed to place a plaque saying they had provided it, are getting fed up.  As fast as the floodlighting system is repaired it is broken again.  Someone should be brought to task for this, whether it is the caretaker or the local police.  The amount of damage done must have taken some time to do.  It has been done deliberately, maliciously and apparently with immunity. I have not found a solution to this problem.  I have discussed it with local committees and historical societies.  I went specially to Cashel to meet these people and to ask them whether they could offer a solution. Certain suggestions were made to me. I cannot repeat them because they could be taken as slanderous.  I heard certain whispers and I will pass on the context of them in private to the Parliamentary Secretary.  His officials may be able to advise him about this matter. Whether the whispers I heard are true or not some way must be found to ensure that the floodlighting can be restored and maintained.</P>
    <P>I was happy to hear that a new depot is being provided at Killarney.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will proceed with this work with all haste.  I am happy also to note that the programme for special schools for the physically disabled is being proceeded with at an accelerated rate. These special schools were initiated on an experimental basis and they have proved to be most successful. They were one of the most successful experiments undertaken by the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works.  There is a growing demand for these schools.  I hope the programme will be further accelerated in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Children's Court in Dublin Castle.  I am happy to hear that this old Victorian-type building will not be used in <Col N="41" /> future.  I have been in it on a number of occasions pleading the cause of children who had just one small lapse; with one exception the children for whom I pleaded got into no further trouble.  Only one child found himself back in court again.  Perhaps the court served a useful purpose in that way.  It must have been a frightening experience for a child to go into that Victorian building and have a magistrate pronounce on his offence, even though the magistrate did not wear a wig.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary about the provision of national schools.  The Office of Public Works are responsible for providing more national schools at an accelerated pace.  In the three and a half years while I was in the Office of Public Works, if I did not get the money for that Office at the beginning of the year I made an effort to get it by way of supplementary estimate before the end of the year.  The amount of money was increased progressively, but last year it was with difficulty that I made sure that the full amount of money was spent.  The figure involved was £4 million.  This year the figure is £5 million.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to watch the monthly report on school buildings and to make sure that the £5 million is spent.</P>
    <P>A shortage of architects was mentioned last year as the reason for the delay.  That goes back to the question of whether we should provide more money for architects.  The architects in the Office of Public Works are dedicated men.  They are excellent architects who are determined to give the best service they can to the people.  With the new modern methods of building schools I have very little doubt but that it will be possible to spend the £5 million.</P>
    <P>The previous Government had a policy of amalgamating the smaller schools into larger schools.  This should result in a reduction in the total number of schools.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me whether there has been a reduction in the total number of schools.  Also, I would like him to give me an assurance that, with the exception of <Col N="42" /> schools such as the school at Dún Chaoin, the old schools which have been closed will not be re-opened and that the general policy of providing bigger and better schools for our children will be proceeded with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I respectfully submit that this is a matter for another Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some trouble with the Minister for Education.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to straighten out this matter for me.</P>
      <P>Another matter which arises, and which was not referred to at all in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, is our embassies overseas.  There is a great deal of improvement work to be done on some of these embassies. Some are rented which I believe should be purchased.  There is one in Lagos which the Parliamentary Secretary should see for himself.  The only thing to do with it is to knock it down and build it again.  No matter what files are there and no matter what recommendations I have made about that matter, when he gets an opportunity he should go and have a look at it.  I should like an assurance from him that there will be no neglect or pull back on the maintenance work carried out by the Office of Public Works on our embassies.  Some people regard our embassies abroad as a luxury but they are not.  We should preserve them and not neglect them.  The first embassy I visited after my appointment was the one in Paris and I was appalled by its condition.  It has been re-painted but because of the heating system the beautiful work that was done there has started to deteriorate again.</P>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me when the work at Dinish Island, Castletownbere, is likely to be completed? I believe it is proceeding according to plan but, perhaps, he can tell me what stage it is at now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary outlined a number of places where he is providing post offices.  A long time sore in my constituency is that there is no post office in Ballyfermot.  I wonder if next year he could get a few pounds <Col N="43" /> to rectify that situation.  Indeed, the post office premises in Inchicore could do with a great deal of improvement.</P>
    <P>There are many decisions that can be taken arising from the detailed report prepared by the architectural students of Bolton Street School of Technology. I understood one decision had already been taken but the Parliamentary Secretary did not advert to it.  I understood that in conjunction with the Department of Lands a programme for the replanting of all the trees in the Phoenix Park has been initiated.  The programme, I think, is to extend over 100 years but the fact that it would be agreed upon would be very important.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm whether this has been agreed.  I would also go along with the suggestion&mdash;this will depend on Corporation developments&mdash;that all motor traffic should be phased out of the Phoenix Park proper.  The park should be a place of relaxation.  It should be a place to which people could go with their children and let them run freely with no danger of being hurt.  Had I been Parliamentary Secretary I would have certainly made that one of my priorities over the next two years.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree to study, as a priority, the possibility of making the park a safer and healthier place for the citizens of Ireland to visit and relax in?</P>
    <P>As there is to be a change of President in the next few weeks, this might be a suitable opportunity to take part of the Presidential grounds for the purpose of an extension to the Zoological Gardens.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Zoological Gardens require more ground urgently.  It would seem to me to be bad planning to extend the zoo towards the Polo grounds.  It would seem to me to be logical to extend it down towards the lake in the Presidential grounds.  I understand from announcements I read in the paper that the Presidential grounds will be open to the public from time to time.  Nevertheless, we have one of the finest zoos in Europe.  It can compare with anything to be seen in Frankfurt or anywhere <Col N="44" /> else on the Continent.  They should be encouraged and their request for additional accommodation should be granted and this seems a very opportune moment for the Board of Works, which I believe owns both properties, to redraw the boundaries.</P>
    <P>There is one problem in regard to Garinish Island.  I was down there last summer or the summer before.  I was not on business, I was there for pleasure.  I stopped for lunch at one of the local hotels.  A luxury boat happened to pull in.  Aboard were American tourists on a world cruise. Garinish was their last stop before going back to America.  They were told that the fee to go out to the island and back would be 50p but when they got on the boat it turned out to be £1. I made inquiries afterwards and the fee for the two-way journey was 50p but because it was a luxury liner the local boatmen decided to rub it in on the poor, unfortunate tourists.  I do not think this is good enough.  This is a nationally-owned garden maintained by the taxpayers' money and I do not think private people should be allowed to fleece the innocent passer-by.  The Parliamentary Secretary can control this by a very simple amendment to the by-laws.  He can lay down that no boatmen can land passengers on the island unless they comply with whatever fees are laid down by his Department.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to give serious consideration to this situation.  I was ashamed on hearing the story while talking casually to a group of Americans because I knew they had been fleeced but I had not the courage to tell them so.  However, I did issue a memorandum in the Department at the time on the matter. I am sorry that I had not succeeded in taking some action in this regard while I was in office but I hope that the situation will be rectified now.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the brief to nature trails at Derrynane and the Phoenix Park.  There are three nature trails also in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, a short one, a fairly long one and a very long one.  These nature trails have been a tremendous success and I would be happy to see <Col N="45" /> them being introduced even in such small parks as St. Enda's.  There was a proposal to have one at Kilkenny Castle but I do not know whether it has been established.  Nature trails are of great educational value especially to our young people and leaflets are available which are very helpful.  This activity instils in our young people an appreciation of the environment and of what life is all about.  As the industrial revolution age of sweat, sleep and semi-starvation has gone and now that prosperity is coming quickly to our country, people have more time for leisure and we should ensure that they are provided with all the amenities possible to help them appreciate the environment in which they live.</P>
    <P>Regarding subhead F.3, the only comment I can make is that I would prefer to see an increase in respect of items 3 to 41.</P>
    <P>An item in the Estimate this year which, fortunately, is not in it regularly, is the restoration of foreign embassies that have been damaged. Regarding the British Embassy, I was directed by the previous Taoiseach to help in every way I could either to have the building restored or to help the British to acquire some other premises so the fact that they have not found a new embassy is no fault of the Office of Public Works.  I understand that when the British Ambassador decided on one place, his Government did not approve and that when the Government decided on another place, the ambassador did not like it.  Apart from paying for the burned embassy and providing architects for a new one, I do not know whether the Office of Public Works have any other function in the matter. However, that building should be restored urgently because, while it might be a tourist attraction for Americans, it is a cause of hurt to every English visitor who sees it.  I have met British visitors in hotels in Ballsbridge who have seen the site of the burned building and when they talk about it they ask themselves: &ldquo;What are we doing here?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While in office I had hoped that the cost-benefit survey of arterial drainage <Col N="46" /> would have been available before the introduction of this year's budget. However, I was told that it would probably not be available in time to be taken into account for the 1973-74 budget, but that, perhaps, it would be available in February.  We have now reached June and the Parliamentary Secretary says it is not available yet. Therefore, I would urge him to ascertain from the people who are carrying out the survey why it is now four months behind schedule.  Originally it was hoped to have the report by December, 1972.  Deputy Hogan O'Higgins has said that I was using the delay as an excuse but my reason for having the survey carried out was that the amount of money being allocated to arterial drainage by the previous Government was diminishing and I was endeavouring to have the importance of the work increased within the context of the national budget.  I was hoping that the survey would show the need for this but, of course, should it not do so, it would be clear to everybody that we were not getting a fair return for our money.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to have the report made available and published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, too, the Parliamentary Secretary may be able to tell me when the Maigue drainage scheme is likely to begin.  I am aware that some provision for this has been made this year but I have no indication of a starting date. Now that the Mulcaire scheme is nearing completion, there is anxiety among the workers lest there should be redundancy and that is why it is important that this other scheme be started.</P>
    <P>I notice that drainage surveys have been reduced in number from 5,000 to 2,200.  It would appear to me, therefore, that the Government are holding drainage in the same low regard as it was held by the previous Government and that is another reason why the cost-benefit survey should be hurried up.  We can only hope that arterial drainage work will qualify for a bigger slice of the national cake next year.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that the replacement of the drag line by the hydraulic excavators is continuing.  When there was a court injunction given against us <Col N="47" /> in regard to the Maigue scheme, I started the usage of hydraulic excavators and used for this purpose, without reference to my Minister, some surplus money I had.  I was told off afterwards for that.  However, the idea proved so successful that it is now agreed that the entire drag line must be replaced by hydraulic excavators.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would like to refer to an arrangement I had made, and which was agreed in principle, to make available an excavator, at a nominal rent, to Ballybofey council for the purpose of draining the river that floods that town from time to time.  I understand, however, that the Office of Public Works engineer involved is reluctant to make a decision as to how the work should be carried out because the execution of the work in one area may result in people who live in another area claiming that their property is flooded.  I sympathise with the engineer's point of view but this is a matter on which I got ministerial sanction.  Money has been provided by the county council and the work can begin as soon as the engineer makes a decision.  I happened to see the river from a helicopter but if one merely stands in the GAA grounds in Ballybofey, one will see readily where the problem is. Apparently when the Department of Lands were planting further up the county a lot of silage and mud came downstream.  It silted up, and all that is necessary is to take it up and then the river will follow its course.  When you get a big spill off the mountains in Donegal, instead of following its course the river goes through the towns and floods the houses.  It seems to me a simple straightforward job and I should like to see it carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the increased provision for coast erosion schemes, but I still think it is not enough.  I was pressing the previous Minister to do a crash programme on coast erosion work.  When the coast erodes and a house falls into the sea, it is gone for ever.  In Donegal local people clubbed together and built themselves a golf course and three greens are <Col N="48" /> now gone into the sea.  There is a certain increased amount projected for coast erosion over the next few years, but instead of having a progression of increased figures, the thing to do, to my mind, is to put a large sum aside initially for a crash programme and then progressively decrease the amounts spent on it. That is easier said than done.  I know the money has to come from somewhere. However, if the Parliamentary Secretary looks at his brief he will see that there are very many requests in.  Indeed, if the proposal put in by the Bray urban authority in relation to Bray promenade was to be dealt with, that money would not go anywhere near it, not even for that one scheme.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while I understand there is only one engineer with the highest qualifications&mdash;and I think he is on extension&mdash;engaged in surveying this type of development, I believe we should recruit additional engineers and press very hard for a substantial increase in the amount of money spent on coast erosion.  It is one of my disappointments in the years in which I was in the Office of Public Works that I could not get this message across to the Minister for Finance.  While I was getting progressive increases, an odd time a niggling £5,000 or £10,000 would be chopped off at the last minute, which annoyed me greatly.  Perhaps the new Parliamentary Secretary can persuade his Minister to take a more enthusiastic look at this matter.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length on national monuments in dealing with parks and other matters, but I am very glad to see an increase in subhead J.1 and I hope the increase will be proportionately bigger year by year.  I am very enthusiastic about the work being done in this direction.  It is gratifying to sec that Charles Fort, Kinsale, is formally scheduled as a national monument. The work force of 150 men that is there now is an absolute minimum, and I would hope to see this increased in due course.</P>
    <P>King John's Castle in Limerick raises a different question altogether. While I am aware there has been some vandalism, and that some preservation <Col N="49" /> work has been carried out and some more work will be carried out this year, I am also aware that there was a proposal by the Shannon Development Company to try to have King John's Castle restored in similar fashion to Bunratty Castle and to have banquets and festivals within it.  I understand that the reason this has not been proceeded with is that the local authority did not reply to the National Monuments Advisory Committee.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to get in touch with the city council concerned and ask them if they are genuinely interested in having this restoration work take place.  This is restoration work that the Board of Works have no statutory authority to do and which is well worth doing.  If private enterprise is prepared to carry out this work, as was done in Bunratty Castle, I know the Parliamentary Secretary will make the necessary technical assistance of the Office of Public Works available to such private people.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to pay special attention to this, because it would be foolish to have this work on King John's Castle done piecemeal if there is a possibility of having the whole job done with private funds.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Glendalough in County Wicklow.  As far as I am aware there has been no archaeological survey done there at all.  Surely Glendalough is one of the monastic centres of Ireland, and while, as I say, the most interesting of our surveys is in Newgrange, County Meath, surely Glendalough should qualify for attention for archaeological surveys.  I understand that some local people who have burial rights in Glendalough are pretty cross about not being able to inter their dead there at the moment. There is a threat from some of these people that with or without the consent of the Office of Public Works they will intern their dead there.  If this were to happen some very valuable artefacts would be destroyed and lost to us forever.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to start an archaeological survey here, because I think that once the local people see this activity taking place they will be restrained from desecrating <Col N="50" /> or interfering in any way with the present monastic settlement.  Perhaps after the survey has been completed the Office of Public Works might consider extending the graveyard so that the people who, for very obvious religious reasons, would like to be buried in this holy ground can have their burial rights restored to them.</P>
    <P>Another matter which disturbs me under this heading is the restoration work at Holycross Abbey in County Tipperary.  I saw in the newspapers recently an article to the effect that the money being collected by the Bishop would not be sufficient to finish the work.  If this is true I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to urge the Minister for Finance to make up the difference.  I am aware of the amount which the Bishop requested and that the amount he was given was somewhere between his figure and that suggested by the Minister.  The figure which I suggested was in excess of that granted.</P>
    <P>When I made this suggestion I did so after a mathematical calculation of what it would cost us to maintain this monument in its ruined state over a number of years.  I felt at that time that I could justify to the Government a figure in excess of that granted to the Bishop.  If the Parliamentary Secretary examines the submission I made at that time he may find that his Government will go along with the mathematical arguments I put up then.  If the Bishop is short of money to complete this work perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might persuade the Government to come to his assistance.  It would be an awful pity if the work was not completed because the building would deteriorate very rapidly.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the <i>Asgard.</i> I think the Parliamentary Secretary would agree that the committee and the captain of the <i>Asgard</i> have been doing excellent work during the last few years.  The demand for training facilities on the <i>Asgard</i>, and these must be very thorough, has been greater than the <i>Asgard</i> can cope with. The Parliamentary Secretary, for this reason, might consider purchasing a second vessel to continue with this excellent work.  However, congratulations <Col N="51" /> are due to this committee and the captain of the boat for the excellent work they have been doing.</P>
    <P>Last year I brought in a code of behaviour, a code of rules, to help provide easier access to public buildings for the physically handicapped.  I made it clear then that it was possible that this code of rules might not be everything that was required.  I should be pleased to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to what extent he feels that this code of rules has been successful and if he feels it is in need of amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like also to think that the O'Connell home at Derrynane is continuing in popularity.  Some developments were to take place there and some thought was to be given to the taking over and cleaning up of the old graveyard.  If there is to be any extensions or improvements at Derrynane perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will inform the House of these in his reply.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Boyne drainage scheme, which is perhaps the biggest arterial drainage scheme undertaken in this country, is continuing according to plan.  The only thing I am worried about in this regard is the future of fish stocks.  I should like to receive an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that any fish stocks destroyed during this work will be replaced in full.  The Boyne is a very valuable tourist amenity and for this reason I would not like to see anything happening to the fish stocks.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the Board of Works magazine, <i>Oibre.</i> I regret that it was not published as regularly as I would have liked it while I was Parliamentary Secretary but there are difficulties in regard to its publication. It is difficult because it places a strain on professional staff whose services could be better utilised elsewhere. I am aware that the staff in most sections of the Boards of Works are overworked, but the Parliamentary Secretary might consider the appointment of a public relations officer from his own staff for the express purpose of seeing that this publication appears at <Col N="52" /> least bi-monthly.  It is an excellent publication and one that is enjoyed by many people.</P>
    <P>I will let Deputy Kenny worry about the matters which he raised last year, matters in relation to Broadhaven and Corrib, Mask, Robe.  These are matters which are closer to him than to me.  I would like to make a passing reference to the proposed golf course in the Phoenix Park extension.  I am happy to see that work on this amenity is proceeding and I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that other recreational facilities will be available out of this extension.  It will improve the approach to Dublin. Instead of being confronted with an old dump those approaching the city will see this well laid out area of green. It is an amenity which the citizens of Dublin and surrounding counties will be able to avail of.</P>
    <P>Something which has worked out very well is the direct employment of the contractors' men in the Board of Works.  I am aware that it caused some difficulty to the person who held the contract each year, bar one, since the system started but I believe that the men who work in the Office of Public Works now are more likely to stay with us because they know that the pension rate available to them is better than that provided by the housebuilders' scheme.</P>
    <P>One matter which I was unable to solve and which I now throw over to the Parliamentary Secretary is the question of protective clothing for the workers at the central engineering workshop in Inchicore and in the Dublin area.  These overalls and dungarees should be given to all fitters, fitter-turners, welders, electricians, painters and helpers.  In all, approximately 80 men are involved.  They should be given these for full-time wear because of the dirty nature of the work.  One suit a year should be issued to those men on a personal basis and 50 per cent in excess should be available to allow for accidents and laundry.</P>
    <P>The Controller of Post Office Stores allows 24 overalls for a two-year period.  To say that 24 overalls should <Col N="53" /> be available for communal use to 36 fitters for a two-year period at the central engineering workshops is Victorian. No issues are allowed to other tradesmen or helpers.  The issuing of overalls and the retrieving of them after each dirty job would not be practicable and communal use of overalls is not acceptable to the workers for hygienic reasons.  I, as Parliamentary Secretary, would not have accepted that as a suitable arrangement and I do not expect that the men should be asked to accept it.  The chief medical officer, who was recently consulted, agrees that overalls should be issued on a personal basis.  The men object to the renewal period being as long as two years.  By that time the overalls are usually in a deplorable and tattered state.</P>
    <P>This is something that I inherited from the 1920's.  The central engineering workshop in particular is upset by this.  The trade unions believe the men should be issued overalls on a personal basis; I believe it; I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary believes it; the doctors and the officials in charge of the workshop believe it.  Everybody believes it except Post Office stores.  I was told shortly before&mdash;or, perhaps, after&mdash;the election that hopefully this matter would be resolved.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that pressure is not relaxed so as to make sure these workers will get personal issues of overalls.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has taken on a tremendous responsibility and I am sure he will do a very good job in the Office of Public Works. When you think about the parks, the environment, our national monuments and ancient heritage you realise the amount of direct responsibility he has apart from acting as agent for other Ministers.  I should like to wish him well in his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by saying that I thought Deputy Lemass's speech was a very constructive and useful one and speaks well for the concern he showed in discharging his own duties as Parliamentary Secretary.  I hope, therefore, he <Col N="54" /> will not take it amiss if I advert to a few points which he made himself and if I differ from him in the opinions which he expressed.  He referred to the intention to switch from a system of renting accommodation for the State to a system of building such accommodation. I took him as saying that he hoped the Government would see the wisdom of this change.  I hope Deputy Lemass will not think it is unduly partisan or controversial if I say that this point was repeatedly made by the parties on this side of the House when in Opposition.  I am not an expert on this but I have the clearest recollection that it was a matter of repeated criticism of the previous Government that they allowed their Departments to be housed in extremely expensive rented accommodation instead of building better accommodation and I recall that system being defended by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance for reasons which Deputy Lemass has quite rightly, characterised as inefficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mean to imply that he used the word &ldquo;speculators&rdquo; in an abusive way but he described as speculators people who have erected office blocks which were subsequently occupied by Government Departments. I think there was no element of speculation in their operation; they were not putting a penny at risk.  In many cases, so far as I know, they knew that every foot of accommodation they provided would be rented by the previous Government at a very high price.  While I recognise the honesty of Deputy Lemass in telling us of the builder who more or less held that Government to ransom when he provided an extension which he knew quite well the Department in question would need, I have to remind him and his colleagues that the system whereby the people's money was going down the drain year by year on rentals which were due to be revised every five or seven years was bitterly criticised from this side when we were in Opposition and it made little or no impression on the then Government.  As far as I understood from Deputy Lemass it was the chairman of the Commissioners who presented a report advising a switch from <Col N="55" /> a renting system to a system of building accommodation but&mdash;with every respect to the chairman&mdash;it did not require this report for the very evident points now accepted by Deputy Lemass to be perfectly clear.  They were clear to this side many years ago and we were not slow to advance them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the question of the old military hospital at Kilmainham.  He had suggestions which I thought rather bizarre about making a kind of mortuary of unwanted imperialistic statues in some corner of the garden where they would be conveniently demolished by a single explosion or where he fondly imagined people would pay money to see them.  My view about these monuments is that it is a disgrace to us that we are so slavish in mind that we cannot bear the sight of our own history in front of our eyes.  It is the truth that the British were here for 750 years and removing monuments, whether officially or by allowing the IRA to do it, or sawing crowns off bridges as was done at Kingsbridge 20 years ago will not change that history.  Let us be adult enough to face up to it as other people who were once colonised face up to it and leave these things where they are.</P>
    <P>If the Gough statue is in a condition to be restored let it be put back where it was, not, perhaps, in the middle of the thoroughfare because I realise that it might be an obstruction to traffic which moves faster now than when that monument was first erected.  Let us put it back where it can be seen by the people without having to go into the gardens of Kilmainham to see it.  Let us not be ashamed of a history, which if you like, reflects as much credit on those who produced a change in that history as anything else.  I think the idea that in some way it is discreditable to us to have relics of our past on full view in public thoroughfares is childish.  I do not use that expression in criticism of Deputy Lemass; I suppose he did not reflect sufficiently on the matter and I should have liked an opportunity, perhaps, to debate it <Col N="56" /> with him.  The safe rule in matters of this kind is to leave well enough alone and not try to represent things as different from what they really are by a demolition operation.</P>
    <P>The British or Norman invasion was not the first invasion of this country. All the monuments of an earlier time which the Deputy spoke about, the ecclesiastical monuments of the 7th, 8th and 9th centuries, the pagan burial sites at Newgrange were put up by people who had once invaded this island and yet we protect them with the greatest care.  I see no sense in discriminating between monuments erected 1,200 years ago and monuments erected 100 years ago.  They are all part of our history and should be left where they were erected unless there is some compelling reason of public convenience requiring their removal or adaptation.  I am sure the Deputy would see the sense of that if he were here to listen to that point of view.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not be moved by Deputy Lemass's plea to put Queen Victoria along with General Gough and the Earl of Winton into a kind of children's corner in Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>The problem of Kilmainham is not what is to be done with the garden there but with the buildings.  Perhaps it would be unfair to describe them as a white elephant but the buildings, although extremely handsome and occupying a very fine, commanding site, partake to this extent of the character of a white elephant in that we do not quite know what to do with them and we do not seem to be able to find a sensible use for them while we are put to the pin of our collar to maintain them.  An idea has been floating around for some years that Kilmainham should be used as a folk museum.  This is a big problem for which the Parliamentary Secretary is not responsible: the matter of a national museum generally is under the Department of Education but my own&mdash;perhaps uninstructed&mdash;reaction to this suggestion is one of scepticism. I do not think it would be a satisfactory solution for Kilmainham to erect replicas of white-washed cottages in the courtyard.  It would make <Col N="57" /> us a laughing-stock.  No doubt the inside could be gutted in order to erect the cottages inside the walls but that would be an even clumsier solution. The building is immense and all the spinning wheels in Ireland would not fill one per cent of the area, neither would all the iron pots and pothooks in the country.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Office of Public Works for entertaining this proposal but I think criticism could be directed in a general way at the lack of policy during the years regarding antiquities generally and regarding the National Museum in particular and its place in Irish life.  There has not been a real examination of what was needed, nobody has ever faced the question of whether it was sensible that the National Museum in Dublin should contain collections of Japanese armour and items like that, or whether we should have a centralised museum instead of spreading our resources throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Decisions should be made one way or the other but, so far as I am aware, no decisions have been made.  The idea that Kilmainham could be a folk museum has not been properly thrashed out in public, nor has it been the subject of recommendation by outside experts.  I do not think the outsider always knows best but this is an area in which a man from a country having a longer history of independent development in cultural matters might give us advice.  Until that is done&mdash;and I recognise it is not the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;to talk vaguely about using Kilmainham as a folk museum is a disservice.  No one knows what will be done about it and nobody has ever seriously thought about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned the Phoenix Park and the suggestion of siting the concert hall there.  My views on the concert hall are not relevant to this debate but I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not be swayed by anything Deputy Lemass said about erecting the concert hall in the Phoenix Park.  Deputy Lemass's argument in favour of doing this was that as the city grew the Phoenix Park would no longer be outside the city but would be <Col N="58" /> in the centre, but that does not seem to me a valid reason.  If in 50 years time the Phoenix Park is in the centre of the urban area it will be even more prized for its open area and to sacrifice any part of that space for a concert hall and ancillary service areas would be shortsighted.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary not to consider such a proposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred also to Kilkenny castle.  That castle shares several characteristics with the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  The building is of similar dimensions, it has the same maintenance problems and the same long-term destination problem in that nobody has really thought of a satisfactory use to which it could be put. The town of Kilkenny deserves the compliments paid to it by Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>The castle is part of a town that has built up a certain tourist potential even among Irish people, in spite of what Deputy Lemass may think.  I read recently that it was expected the beer festival there would attract 100,000 visitors.  If 100,000 people find it worthwhile to make Kilkenny their centre for a week's beer drinking, surely it must be possible to rake off a fraction of what will be spent there in order to maintain the castle.  I know many local business people in Kilkenny have contributed generously towards the maintenance of the castle but if there is this colossal &ldquo;beano&rdquo; with 100,000 people attending the festival I cannot see why a proportion cannot be taken, directly or indirectly, from the participants in order to maintain the features of Kilkenny which make it an acceptable site for this kind of festival.  I am not advocating any kind of entertainment tax on what has been free previously but if publicans and hotel owners are located in an area which contains a castle that is expensive to maintain, and when they have the added bonus of many thousands of people patronising their establishments at festival times, surely a certain amount could be used for maintenance of the castle.  This would seem the best thing to do until a sensible solution can be found in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> Deputy Lemass referred to the redecoration of the State Apartments in Dublin Castle.  I do not set myself up as an aesthete but I am always surprised when I hear people express admiration for the scheme of restoration of the apartments.  For what it is worth, my opinion is that the redecoration has not been a success although I may be alone in the House in thinking that.  I find the colours of the carpets and the walls garish and disagreeable. I realise it is a question of taste on which I could as easily be wrong as right.  However, before a major work involving the fitting of extremely expensive carpeting and of expensive paint-work and gilding is decided on, there should be a consultation involving more than the admittedly expert and devoted staff in the Office of Public Works.  If there had been consultation with competent people outside the Office of Public Works I think that result would have been more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not standing on anyone's toes when I say that.  I know that a lot of pride, thought and work went into the redecoration but I do not admire it.  Whether I am right or wrong about it, a major and expensive job like this should have been the subject of consultation going beyond the Office of Public Works, although I am not saying it should be the subject of an international competition.  I repeat I do not wish to give offence to people who have carried out their work in a dedicated manner.  However, if these matters are settled by a small staff who have other things to do in the Office of Public Works that is wrong.  Consultations should be had with people outside that office also.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works deserve to be congratulated on the work they carry out with limited resources on the maintenance of public monuments. I always find something to praise in the work they do in this connection.  The last time I visited a public monument was when I had a half-hour to spare before addressing a small crowd in Timoleague during the Presidential Election campaign.  I went into the abbey there, about which we had all learned at school, <Col N="60" /> and I was extremely taken with the very clean and tasteful way in which the place had been kept up.  The method of building of that abbey by no means lent itself to maintenance but it has been very well kept up. There are no more neantóg rua growing there.  As far as I could see, the interior has been tastefully gravelled and the nettles are not in evidence any more.  It is now a pleasure to walk through the place.</P>
    <P>Although I have mentioned Timoleague, the same can be said of all the public monuments in the charge of the Board of Works.  At the same time, a difficulty which Deputy Lemass adverted to is shared by the Board of Works with the Department of Education and perhaps with other Departments.  Deputy Lemass said he would like to see archaeological activities speeded up.  He mentioned the difficulty about Glendalough.  Of course it would be entirely wrong if people were to interfere with Glendalough before it had been properly explored archaeologically, but what Deputy Lemass is doing is simply pointing in a not too clear way at a very large problem.  That is only scratching the surface of it.  Merely to suggest that the Board of Works would have Glendalough excavated is only scratching the surface.  The truth is that there is no unified properly coordinated policy in this country in regard to the identification, preservation and study of antiquities generally.</P>
    <P>I know there is an archaeological survey section in the Office of Public Works, but my information is that it consists of a solitary archaeologist.  It was established with two, but as far as I know one of these gentlemen has been seconded elsewhere.  I may be wrong about that, but that is my information.  I do not think it is possible for the Office of Public Works to even pretend to do archaeological work or archaeological surveys with a staff of one man.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary more or less hinted that damage is being done to Irish antiquities with what the Parliamentary Secretary terms increased pressure on the environment because of the demands of industrial <Col N="61" /> and agricultural development.  My information is that every day on average one or two features of antiquity are swept out of existence in this country, be it a ring fort or the stump of an old castle.  They are being swept to destruction by bulldozers in order to widen a road, or whatever it may be, and the staff in the Office of Public Works, at the disposal of the National Museum and in the Department of Education simply is not adequate to make sure that this does not happen or that where it has not happened the sites are properly explored.  Professor McAllister estimated that in the 1920's there were 25,000 ring forts in this country and 5,000 of them have disappeared completely from the face of the earth.  That still leaves us with quite a lot of ring forts.  But if they are disappearing in a way in which the State cannot keep track of their disappearance&mdash;that has been the situation during the years&mdash;then we have to ask whether we have got a proper policy in regard to the identification and the preservation of antiquities. Obviously we cannot hold on to everything&mdash;I do not say that the stump of every old castle in Ireland should be maintained&mdash;but at least we should do something about first looking at it and exploring it before it is gone.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Parliamentary Secretary throw his weight behind a movement to try to get a single administrative unit created.  I do not like to see the endless spawning of administrative departments but I think there should be one unit which will take over the archaeological and preservation functions of the Office of Public Works, the National Museum and whatever functions local authorities may have in this matter.  There should be a single policy and a single unit in regard to antiquities and I do not think that new bodies should be allowed to spawn archaeological sections of their own.</P>
    <P>I am told that An Foras Forbartha have now developed an archaeological appendage of their own.  It seems to me that is wrong, so long as the Office of Public Works are not fully staffed in this regard and so long as the National Museum cannot do its job properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> This is no doubt a well-intentioned effort.  Even An Foras Forbartha can do this work only in a limited way.  What I am saying will not, I hope, be taken in any sense as being criticism of the excellent work which has been done by a fairly small number of people against great odds and with limited means.  It is not that at all.  I think a very high tribute is due to the people who are engaged in the work going on in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the High Street excavation.  That is a model excavation regarded by archaeologists as one of the most important sites in the whole of Europe. That has been made possible by a grant from the Office of Public Works and I think it ought to be acknowledged.  But more could be done.  Of course it is always possible to say that, but in this area more can be done by creating a single administrative unit with responsibility for the identification and preservation of antiquities.</P>
    <P>This is particularly relevant in the context of the plans of the Minister for Education to introduce a course on what is being called Irish studies.  I think it is pointless to expect children to take an interest in their country's heritage, be it the Abbey of Timoleague or General Gough, unless these things are kept up and made physically accessible to them and accessible to them in terms of description in printed matter.  The noble aspirations of the Minister for Education in regard to a course in Irish studies which will make Irish children understand their history &mdash;the history that makes us what we are, for better or for worse&mdash;cannot succeed unless there is the material evidence of that history.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is sympathetic to this point of view, I know he entirely shares the aspirations of the Minister for Education, but I wish to urge him to bring his influence to bear so that the task of the Minister for Education in this regard can be simplified and so that the antiquities, of which this country still has a large number despite the destruction, will be identified, preserved and made accessible to all the people but <Col N="63" /> particularly to the young generation, who are very often disgracefully ignorant of the country around them and the people from whom they have sprung.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment. I wish also to compliment him on the manner in which he presented his Estimate.  He has an excellent staff and I hope their period of work together will be fruitful.</P>
      <P>I am happy to hear that this Government intend to pursue the policy of their predecessors as far as decentralisation is concerned.  We should be more concerned today with decentralisation than we were ever before. We know that Dublin and the whole region inside the Pale is top heavy.  It is top heavy with offices and with industry. This has led to many housing problems, overcrowding in offices and problems relating to pollution.  The sooner we decentralise as many services as possible the better in the interest of the nation as a whole, and in the interest of the health of the people living in Dublin and the surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Government intend to proceed with the building of new offices in Castlebar and Athlone.  I should like to see the day when other Departments will be transferred to the country.  Unless the Government take the lead it will be very difficult to get private enterprise to move.  It is more important today than ever before that we should decentralise. With the development and growth of Government services in the provinces, problems are continuously arising over the provision of suitable offices.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the supply of office accommodation in practically every provincial town is inadequate.  That may be as far as the Departments are concerned, but I believe that, if they looked and shopped around for accommodation and for sites, they could be easily obtained in the towns concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a big problem so far as the provision of accommodation for Government <Col N="64" /> staffs in Dublin is concerned. The expansion of Government services down the years and the improvement of these services, involve the employment of additional staff to administer them.  This, in turn, means the provision of additional accommodation. The only answer to this problem, which the Parliamentary Secretary states is one of the major difficulties, is decentralisation.  In the long term, it would be far more advantageous financially, apart altogether from other considerations, to purchase or build offices rather than to rent them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that provision has been made for the spending of some £25,000 on the Bourn Vincent National Park in Killarney.  I should like to take this opportunity to compliment the Commissioners and the staff of the Office of Public Works, as well as previous Parliamentary Secretaries, on the interest they took in the development of the National Park in Killarney.  These people realised the value to the nation of this National Park.  It is important that it should be developed and maintained in a proper way, and the only criterion should be the national interest.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note also that it is proposed to have a new route for the jarveys on their return trips to Killarney in order to avoid traffic congestion and traffic hazards on the very busy Kenmare-Killarney road. This route will be planned in consultation with the jarveys' representatives. I am sure the Office of Public Works, having consulted these people, will have no difficulty in coming to a suitable arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note also that it is proposed to improve the present water supply and sewage disposal system around Muckross House and Gardens. In recent years I often wondered. with the rapidly increasing numbers of persons using the house and park, how serious was this water and sewerage problem becoming in the vicinity of Muckross House.  I am glad to see that the Office of Public Works have come to grips with this problem and that <Col N="65" /> arrangements are being made to solve it.</P>
    <P>For some time I have been advocating the setting up of a depot in Killarney for the maintenance of national monuments in Kerry and the adjoining areas.  I am glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government intend to set up this depot.  In that region we have a wealth of historic monuments which it has not been possible to service adequately because of the remote location of the team responsible for maintenance.  In the Killarney and South Kerry areas there are skilled workers and staff who will be trained to co-operate with the staff of the Office of Public Works in the improvement and maintenance of these monuments and historic places.</P>
    <P>I was informed recently that the Council of Europe intend to designate the year 1975 as a special year for the restoration, improvement and identification of ancient monuments in all countries coming within their ambit. The Parliamentary Secretary should apply to the Council of Europe for a special grant to help in restoring and identifying some of the ancient monuments and historic places in this country. If one were to choose a region for such an investment and such a survey, one could not find a better one than the Kerry region.</P>

      <P>I put this suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff.  I am also glad that the Parliamentary Secretary acknowledged the gesture of John McShain in presenting the Island of Innisfallen and Ross Castle to the nation.  The sooner Ross Castle is restored and reopened the better.  It is a fantastic castle in beautiful surroundings.  There is a beautiful view from the top of the castle and people who return to Killarney from abroad are disappointed when they discover they can no longer get to the top of the castle to enjoy the exquisite view.  Some measure of priority should be given to its restoration to make it safe for people to climb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to increase the money <Col N="66" /> allocated for work done for the Department of Justice, mainly for the provision of new Garda barracks and temporary courts.  The Office of Public Works should devise some standard plan for courtrooms in provincial towns so that these rooms could be used for purposes other than courts. It might be necessary to get private enterprise into this field of activity.  It might be possible to consult with people interested in the cinema business or the dancehall business thereby reducing construction costs and operational costs subsequently.  These costs can be heavy on both the Office of Public Works and the local authorities. I could never understand why the cost of erecting and maintaining courthouses should be a charge on local authorities rather than on the State.  I know that people in a town in which courts sit benefit to some extent financially but, on the whole, it is in the interests of the State that proper court facilities are provided rather than in the interests of the local ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Office of Public Works intends to develop the Kenmare estate.  The estate is open to the public.  Before any major development works are carried out or before any overall plan is prepared, the Office of Public Works should consult with the local urban district council and other local interests, such as voluntary organisations, as to the future development of this estate.  It would be in the interests of a great many people if portion of the estate were developed as a town park.  That would relieve pressure on the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, particularly at weekends. Because of the increased volume of traffic there is a tendency to overcrowding in this area.</P>
    <P>Derrynane should get a certain measure of priority as far as development is concerned.  Arrangements are being made for nature trails.  Derrynane could be used as a pilot scheme designed to prevent coast erosion.  It would be an ideal place for such a scheme because more and more of the land is being eroded every year.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the principle enshrined in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  It is better to do a major scheme rather than a number <Col N="67" /> of minor schemes.  However, I think about 10 per cent of the cost of improvement works and maintenance could be diverted to minor drainage schemes.  That would give a great boost particularly to areas in the west. Small rivers and streams could be drained into larger rivers without danger of flooding.  A certain amount of employment would be provided.  The scheme could be administered by the local county council.  Such schemes would make more land available for maximum agricultural production.  This would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider again extending the use of Muckross Abbey as a burial ground. Since the abbey was closed numerous representations about this have been made without success.  There is an abundance of land and I do not think a burial ground would detract in the least from the character of the abbey itself or the amenity value of the area. The burial ground could be confined to local inhabitants.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will sympathetically consider the suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works should have meetings annually with county engineers with a view to deciding priorities in regard to the repair and improvement of piers and slipways. Quite a number of these could be improved at comparatively small cost. There is a tremendous upsurge in the fishing industry, particularly at local family level, and any money spent in this direction would be money well spent.  The suggestion is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to a question I addressed to the Minister for Finance yesterday with regard to the workers in the national park in Killarney. They are no longer entitled to get a supply of milk from the farm at the price which they enjoyed for years past.  I do not know how this concession first arose.  I presume it arose from the old tradition whereby agricultural labourers got milk free from their employers.  This has been the practice for years at Muckross in the national park.  The fact is that the classification <Col N="68" /> of the employees there was changed some years ago.  They were very disappointed when the price of milk was increased recently.  They are more disappointed now since they have been informed that from 9th July next they can no longer get this concession.  This will impose a hardship on them because they will have to get milk at other centres, perhaps three miles away.  This will mean an increase in the cost of living for them.  I appreciate the reason which the Parliamentary Secretary gave yesterday in his reply, namely, that this was mainly for health reasons. I cannot accept the fact that a health problem should arise now at the national park due to the sale of unpasteurised milk when this problem did not arise for the past 40 years.  I would ask that this whole matter should he reconsidered to see if the position could remain as it has been up to now.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish the Parliamentary Secretary, the Commissioners and the staff every success in their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the Estimate which he has presented. His contribution was well prepared.  I would like to refer to the renting of office blocks.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that recourse has had to be had to a considerable degree over the past seven years or so to the renting of space in privately developed office blocks.  I raised the question of the renting of office blocks about three years ago and suggested that something should be done about building Government offices, and that in the long run this would result in a saving, The figures paid in rent are staggering, even in Dublin city alone.  A start is at last being made.  There is provision here for £500,000 intended to meet the start of such a programme. This is a good decision.  I am sure that all Members of this House will agree with it.  It is only a start on a long road.  The offices which will be built will be much more modern and comfortable for the Civil Service staff.  People in the Civil Service are entitled to decent office accommodation. There should be no over-crowding in the offices.  Some offices used by the Civil Service are over-crowded.  I <Col N="69" /> do not want to mention any particular office but one does not have to go too far from this House to find Departments where the office accommodation leaves much to be desired. This is at least a step in the right direction.  I hope that this promised £500,000 will be used to the best possible advantage.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us that tenders for the restoration of the picture gallery wing of Kilkenny Castle have had to be reinvited and that he hopes it will shortly be possible to have the work started.  This work should be started as soon as possible. Kilkenny has become a famous city in many ways and is visited by many people from other countries.  They are surprised when they find that the picture gallery wing of the castle is not open to them.  The Parliamentary Secretary said it will be a few years before this wing will be open.  I know the work must take some time but there should be as little delay as possible. I welcome the fact that the Commissioners are exploring the possibility of allowing the castle dining-room, which is a very fine room, to be used for small theatrical presentations, lectures and musical performances as an interim arrangement.  I would recommend that this should go ahead pending the completion of the restoration work on the picture gallery wing.  I appreciate that there are extensive repairs and restoration work to be carried out in this ancient building.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>A sum of £16,000 is included for the building of a visitor centre at Dunmore Cave national monument, County Kilkenny.  The water supply difficulties mentioned last year have at last been overcome with the co-operation of Kilkenny County Council, and I expect that a tender will shortly be accepted for the building. Arrangements are going ahead for the installation of lighting in the cave and for the carrying out of archaeological and biological studies there this summer.</P>
      <P>This is a very welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had made some notes on Killarney <Col N="70" /> but I shall not add to what Deputy O'Leary has said.  I notice the Parliamentary Secretary looking at me so I think I shall leave it to the men from that end of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I come now to something which is very dear to my heart and I am sure to the hearts of all Deputies.  That is the provision of special schools for physically and mentally handicapped children.  I notice this work is continuing but I would suggest that the tempo should be increased.  There are not nearly enough of these schools.  I know they cannot be built overnight.  We in Carlow are at last in the fortunate position where work has commenced on a school for mildly retarded children. Up to recently teachers were working in a pre-fab.  It took some years before we reached the turning of the first sod for this new school.  It is essential that these schools should be provided as soon as possible.  It was only when I became a Deputy 12 years ago and when mothers and fathers came to me to try to get their children into institutions or day schools that I began to realise the number of retarded and mildly-handicapped children in the constituency.  There is still much to be desired in this field and we should ensure that money is channelled in this direction and ensure that where these schools are necessary there is no undue delay in advertising for tenders and commencing work.  This is a continuing need all around the country.  The number of schools is grossly inadequate. More money should be made available for these projects which are of vital importance and an absolute necessity.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker referred to the question of courthouses.  It is many years since Carlow County Council passed a resolution condemning the practice of local authorities being responsible for the repair and upkeep of these buildings and I still hold the view that this charge should not be one for the local authority but should be the responsibility of the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> From time to time we hear complaints regarding the condition of courthouses.  Indeed, there have been occasions when justices refused to sit in them because of their unsuitability but that situation should be rectified by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I note that a sum of £107,000 is being made available for buildings for training and advisory services for the Department of Agriculture.  The main items involved are a regional veterinary research laboratory at Limerick, a testing station for beef bulls at Tully, County Kildare and a district veterinary office at Carlow.  I take it that these premises at Carlow are to replace the present premises which are used for the purposes of the bovine TB scheme.  This is very welcome because there is gross overcrowding in that office at present.  I do not know what stage has been reached in regard to tenders for this project but it is a matter that should be hurried up so that work can begin as soon as possible.  Because of the development of this branch of the Department down through the years, there is a necessity for extra accommodation but I would hope that when the design for the new offices is being drawn up, account will be taken of future needs and that planning will be carried out on a long-term basis so that it will not be found necessary after a short time to extend the new premises by, for instance, a prefabricated unit.  The staff in the Carlow office work under great pressure and there are many callers to the office so it is very important that all concerned have adequate accommodation but there is no point in the Office of Public Works being penny wise and pound foolish in relation to new premises. Building costs are increasing fast and that is another reason why adequate premises should be erected in the first instance.  As far as I am concerned, I will exert as much pressure as possible on the Office of Public Works in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>While speaking on the question of schools, I intended to refer in more detail to schools for mentally retarded and mildly retarded children.  The <Col N="72" /> accommodation that is available throughout the country for these children is inadequate.  In Carlow, work has commenced on the building of a school for such children but this whole question must be seen as a long-term one.  There must be no delay in inviting tenders for these schools and the necessary money must be made available for them.  Perhaps it is necessary that there should be a crash programme in this respect.  The parents of mentally and mildly retarded children are unable to have them accommodated in proper institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if there will be redundancies in the cheese factories this year due to the fact that it will be more profitable to manufacture skim milk powder and butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the EEC system the manufacture of cheese for sale at market prices is normally more remunerative than the manufacture of butter and skim milk powder for sale at intervention prices.  This position may be upset temporarily by market conditions, and at the present time export market conditions are giving rise to some difficulties for the cheese industry.  I am satisfied, however, that the long-term outlook for the industry and for employment in it is sound.</P>
      <P>With a view to mitigating the difficulties that may arise from time to time for particular dairy products due to changing market conditions, I have already suggested to the manufacturers concerned that they should consider establishing among themselves a pooling arrangement which would enable the stronger products at any one time to assist those which may be encountering temporary difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no good reason why any of these manufacturing industries should close because of the change in prices.  This is obviously a temporary difficulty because of the stocking up of cheese in Britain.  Only two days ago I spoke to the British Minister and asked him what way these stocks were going at the moment, and he said that they were being reduced substantially, and he does not see this difficulty lasting over a long period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a problem here, especially in the smaller factories, arising out of the intervention price.  Apart from the general operation of the intervention price, surely there is a case to be made for the smaller cheese factories, especially in the underdeveloped areas where there is a problem that cannot be solved by any suggestion that the Minister has made to the dairies and those engaged in other milk products? Should he not make a case for assistance under the regional policy in the case of factories which engage purely in cheese manufacturing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand the position, there is no case I can make for an individual industry in the situation referred to by Deputy Cunningham.  This is regarded as a very temporary difficulty which should be overcome in quite a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not an important matter, that a factory may close, and over and above the problem of factory closure, is there not the other one that milk suppliers to the factory have no other outlets and that there will be an enticement and encouragement to switch from milk? If the suppliers switch from milk where do the cheese factories stand if there is a temporary, six months or 12 months, bad price problem?  Should the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries not come to the rescue where it is clear that a factory which will go out of operation for six months cannot come back again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>Practice and procedure in regard to passport facilities are administrative matters derived from the general power to issue passports vested in the Minister for Foreign Affairs by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and specific legislation to govern such administrative practice is not required. Existing practice allows for the grant of adequate passport facilities for minors where it is satisfactorily established that either the father or the mother has completely severed connection with the home and has in practice abandoned his or her role as parent. For example, the fact that a deserted wife is in receipt of a social welfare deserted wife's allowance would normally be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's reply that we are working under an Act of 1924.  Surely we have come a long way since then and women's role in society has changed considerably.  I should like to ask the Minister if a mother of her own right. without her husband's sanction, would not in future be allowed to have her children included on her passport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear the Deputy has confused himself.  The Act which I <Col N="88" /> quoted in the reply is the Act which gives the authority for issuing passports; it is not the Act which governs the relationship of parent and child.  I was simply saying that legislation is not required to govern the issue of passports. That is a power which, under the 1924 Act, was conferred on the Minister, who may make administrative decisions in execution of that particular function.</P>
      <P>The Act that governs the relationship of the parent and children is an Act passed by Fianna Fáil in 1964.  It provides that the guardianship of children under the age of 21 years is a right and obligation that is enjoyed jointly by the father and the mother.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern about cases where, for instance, the parent who has neglected to care for the child should try to be awkward and withhold consent in the case of an application by the dutiful parent for a passport for the child or for the inclusion of the child on the other parent's passport.  The Department take a pragmatic approach in these cases and if evidence is furnished to the Department indicating clearly the genuine nature of the application and the fact that any objection by a non-consenting parent is an unwarranted mischievous act on his part, the Department will be agreeable if the law so permits to  arrange for the addition of the children to the applicant parent's passport. Each case is considered on its merits and if the Deputy has any special case in mind I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will deal sympathetically with it on the basis of the facts.</P>

      <P>The people in question have been subjected to the same legal processes as any American citizen.  They have also availed of all legal rights and opportunities open to them under American law and in no way have their rights been diminished or interfered with.  As the Deputy may know, they have had access to the United States Supreme Court and in May this year an application was made for <i>habeas corpus</i> which was not successful.  They have had full access to legal advice and they are very well advised by a most prominent American lawyer on their civil rights.  They have also had the assistance of the US Centre for Constitutional Rights.  The consular service the Deputy has in mind would arise only if these rights had been denied them but, in fact, they have the same rights as American citizens.  The position is that if they are at present deprived of their liberty it is as a consequence of their own unwillingness to give the assistance which the Federal Grand Jury has sought.  Any American citizen, or any other person, <Col N="90" /> Irish or otherwise, in America, is obliged to conform to the laws of the country&mdash;as would happen any foreigner in this country in relation to our own laws.</P>

Work had actually commenced on the project in April last when it was discovered that part of the ground on which it was planned to build the office block did not belong to the developer but was State owned.</P>
      <P>The developer has now applied for planning permission for a revised scheme.  He is also in consultation with the Commissioners of Public Works about the possibility of acquiring the State owned plot of ground so that the original scheme could proceed.  In the circumstances it is not possible to give a reliable forecast of when the sorting office will be available but the developer expects that it will be ready about eight months after work commences.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the present four year programme aimed at completing rural electrification by 31st March, 1975, will cost £18 million, towards which the Government are contributing £10 million.  This outlay will bring the total cost of rural electrification up to £67 million, including Government subsidy of £27 million. Rural consumers, in cases where special service charges apply, are paying fixed charges which are only about a quarter of what they would be if full economic rates were charged.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of where you are born.  It is the cost to the Electricity Supply Board of bringing a supply to the consumer.  This has often been debated in this House.  On one or two occasions it has been reduced.  At the moment the ESB are losing over £3 million on rural electrification. If the special service charge were to be eliminated, the ESB would have to bear the cost and that would reflect on the other consumers in towns like Killarney, Cork and Dublin.

      <P>The Foras Forbartha Report on Transportation in Dublin recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that suburban rail passenger services should be opened as far as Blanchardstown and Clondalkin, but did not envisage these developments until the 1980s in accordance with the anticipated rate of development of the areas.  The various recommendations in the Foras Forbartha report are under examination in the Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are maintaining close co-operation with Dublin Corporation to ensure that proposals for public transport for the Dublin north-west area can be effectively integrated with the corporation's overall plan for the area.  The extension of suburban rail services to <Col N="106" /> the north-west Dublin area would not be practicable at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>An Foras Forbartha were asked to have a look at the whole question of transport in the greater Dublin area and they came up with a number of recommendations which they spaced at various intervals and the year 1989 was the time they conceived this line would be opened. They also proposed a new Liffey Bridge and a number of other things. I do not know about 1989.  It is 15 years away and a great many things could happen in the interim which would show that such a line was needed much earlier than that.</P>

Is the Minister not aware that the Foras Forbartha report envisaged road construction, which is fine on paper but not feasible practically because of the vast amount of money involved in both the acquisition of the land and the construction of the road?  Judging by the position at the moment, the time is not far distant when traffic will just stop and never get going again.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty is to congratulate Deputy Henry Kenny on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary.  Of all the appointments made in the new Government there was no more popular appointment than that of Deputy Kenny and I wish him many years of success in his new office.  I say this most sincerely.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.  I am pleased by the reference to the provision of accommodation for Government Departments. It is well-known that various sections of a Department can be located in rented offices all over the city.  It would be better to have all sections of one Department under one roof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was very little in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech about the West of Ireland.  I am glad, however, that he referred to Portumna Bridge. This is a very important bridge.  The Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned the extension of the quay there. The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to drainage.  I see that provision is made for an increase of £19,000.  Most of that £19,000 will be absorbed by extra costs.  Before we entered the EEC we heard that substantial moneys would be forthcoming for regional development.  We heard that much money was to be expended on drainage in the West of Ireland.  The river Shannon is not mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief.  We should be fair and <Col N="111" /> if the Shannon is not to be drained that should be clearly stated.  Then we would not have public meetings and people asking: &ldquo;What happened the Shannon?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Years ago experts were brought from America.  They reported that the Shannon could not be drained but that it would have to be backed.  Surveys have been conducted since then and still nothing has happened about the drainage of the Shannon.  I am concerned about the drainage of four rivers&mdash;the Shannon, the Suck, Dromcollogher river and the Fergus.  These rivers are of vital importance to the farming community.  There are many small farmers in the areas around them.  The Dromcollogher river was a subject of a Parliamentary Question yesterday.  About 20 years ago, in the early days of Macra na Feirme, an engineer was paid by the young farmers to do a survey on the amount of land under water as a result of the overflowing of the banks of the Dromcollogher river.  The report was submitted to the Office of Public Works.  Surveys were carried out by their engineers and their reports corresponded with the reports of the young farmers' engineer.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the present occupant of the Parliamentary Secretary's office about this but it has been said that some reports are still awaited.  People who come to Dublin on deputations should get straight answers about their problems.  They should be told whether schemes in relation to Shannon drainage have been abandoned.  The Shannon is very important to the people of the west. The Suck, the Dromcollogher river and the Fergus are also very important. The Parliamentary Secretary has told us about the Dromcollogher river, but we have not heard anything about the other rivers.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the small amount of attention given to drainage in the Minister's brief.  The amount of money mentioned is only £19,000 greater than last year.  This could be absorbed easily by extra costs.  I was astonished to learn recently that there was a feeling in the <Col N="112" /> EEC that no more drainage of land in the west of Ireland should be done. If this is so, it could have serious repercussions on the farmers in the west.  We want to make their farms viable and we cannot drain and reclaim land without help.  If we cannot get money we can forget all about the west.  It is all very well to say that industry will expand.  Moving a number of people from the land to industry will not assist the expansion of industry at a rapid rate.  The idea we had was that we could develop a big area of land which is now unproductive but if drainage is not carried out properly this will be impossible.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might deal with this point when replying. Can we have our share of the Brussels cake for drainage?  We could not have got all the votes we did in support of EEC entry if we had not felt that money for drainage would be forthcoming from the EEC.  Money for drainage is a top priority.</P>
    <P>Minor drainage schemes have been carried out along some of our rivers, but it was found that we could not do anything under these local employments schemes because the levels of the outlets were wrong.  Land reclamation is held up because the outlets are not clear.  Major drainage schemes are looked after by the Office of Public Works and minor drainage works are looked after by the county councils, but the schemes in between these two categories are &ldquo;nobody's darlings&rdquo;. Regulations are laid down about local employments schemes.  If the estimate for a particular job is over a certain figure one is told that it is too big for the local employments schemes, but at the same time it may be too small for the Office of Public Works scheme. In one particular case 20 farmers were involved in a particular scheme.  The land project officials must be consulted before a job is carried out.  Perhaps the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team could examine this proposal to find out who should look after the 20 farmers involved.  The man who did the survey for the local employments scheme estimated the cost at £X.  Others said that the drains were not good enough for land project work <Col N="113" /> along the river.  The scheme was turned down.  On various occasions we submitted plans to the Department of Local Government.  The farmers' scheme was said to be a minor drainage scheme with some modifications in it.  The Department of Local Government deal with some schemes while the Office of Public Works deal with other schemes.  The Parliamentary Secretary might be able to tell us what schemes are too costly to come under the local employments scheme.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the preservation of national monuments.  I will say no more on it because I have said before that I will not be guilty of repetition.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Office of Public Works for having commenced the building of offices in Castlebar and Athlone for the decentralisation of the Departments of Education and Lands. The Parliamentary Secretary will have the honour of bringing the Department of Lands to Castlebar.</P>
    <P>Everybody is in favour of establishing schools for disabled children. Anyone with a kind nature must welcome such schools.</P>
    <P>I hope that the remarks I made about drainage will be examined carefully because I am perturbed about the situation in the West of Ireland. Having heard the Parliamentary Secretary I wonder will any serious look be taken in Europe at the regional development necessary in the west of Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Drainage is a first priority in my county at present, the drainage of the Corrib, the Robe, the Mask and the Lung.  The drainage of the Shannon has been talked about for the past 10 or 15 years by various Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries but nothing has been done.  I would not be so interested in the drainage of the Shannon if it were not for the way it affects the Lung in the east of my county.  There are thousands of acres of land flooded there because the Shannon has not been drained.  I am sorry that in this Estimate there is no mention of the Lung.  Thousands of farmers in that area have to go out year after year and buy expensive artificial manures and have them all washed away.  From the <Col N="114" /> Galway boundary almost to Ballyhaunis there is the finest virgin land to be found in this country.  We have land in the south of Mayo to equal any in Ireland.  Now that we have entered Europe land is so valuable that 10 or 15 acres properly drained and developed means quite an income to a farmer each year.  I am sorry that no allocation has been made to County Mayo.  I heard the former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lemass, last year mention a cost benefit survey.  I am sure the present Parliamentary Secretary could not do anything until this report came out.  This is what he is waiting for.  I should like to know what will be the result of this cost benefit survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an extensive drainage scheme in County Mayo, the drainage of the Moy.  I am sorry to have to say that millions of pounds were wasted there.  If the arterial drainage system was tackled properly there would not be a drain in County Mayo that could not have been dealt with with the amount of money spent on the Moy. It cost the office of Public Works from £500 to £1,000 to build a bridge over a little drain dividing a man's farm. This was a farce and a complete waste of money.  I speak as a farmer who knows exactly what drainage means and I say that if the Government are interested in arterial drainage the first thing they must do is to make sure that the main arterial drain is open.  If that is done the farmers will be prepared to avail of land project grants and to spend the necessary money to drain into the main artery.  More money should be allocated to county councils and local improvement schemes and the Office of Public Works should open up the main arterial links and through the local improvements schemes and the land project system thousands, if not millions, of pounds would be saved to the taxpayers and land would be properly drained.  It would not cost £1,000 to build a bridge over a small river.  If a grant was given to the farmer of, say, £30 or £40 he would build the bridge for £50 or £60.  It costs the Office of Public Works £1,000 to erect such a bridge.  This is where I see a waste of money.  I am speaking as a man who <Col N="115" /> knows a little about drainage, who lived from the land and if I left this House I would be prepared to go back and I would not be afraid to live from it again.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is a very short time in office and there was very little he could have done this year.  He had to take what was before him.  I would appeal to him next year, if this cost benefit scheme has been completed and a report issued, that an allocation for the drainage of the Corrib, the Robe and the Mask, together with the Lung, should be made available.  The costings of the catchments into the main artery should be cut out because that is only a waste of money.  The farmers of Ireland are well prepared at any time to do the necessary drainage if the main artery is opened.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I did not have much time to go through this Estimate but I heard it was about to conclude and I was anxious to say a few words. Arterial drainage is the thing that affects my county most.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make an allocation next year to my constituency. It is his constituency also in which he is certainly interested and gets very good support.</P>
    <P>There has been a big delay in relation to schools for the mentally handicapped. Were it not for voluntary organisations mentally handicapped children would not be looked after. Where the Department of Education has recommended that schools or extensions to schools or institutions for the handicapped should be built the Office of Public Works should provide the necessary money at very short notice.  This is the most urgent problem we have.  In the town hall in my own town women work in a voluntary capacity looking after from six to ten of these children.  I urge the Office of Public Works to give priority to any recommendations made by the Department of Education in this field.</P>
    <P>On the question of Garda stations, we are anxious that a new station be erected at Kilkelly.  I am aware that plans for such premises have been <Col N="116" /> submitted but I do not see any reference to the project in this year's Estimate. I had hoped that the new barracks would be erected during the year 1973-74.  There are some Garda barracks in my county that are no more than barns.  The situation is not good enough.  We have always had the highest regard for our Garda authorities and it is only right that the personnel of the police force should have proper accommodation.</P>
    <P>On the question of drainage, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that, next year, my constituency will be given an allocation in this regard.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is one that can be considered as being the bedrock of the constituency of each Deputy in the House.  It is an Estimate that is dealt with by Deputies more on a local than on a national level.  On that basis it is my intention in the first instance to deal specifically with the Estimate in terms of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Constituency.  It is interesting to note that the Office of Public Works are, perhaps, the greatest source of employment in that area and I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Commissioners of Public Works and to the employees concerned for the tremendous work that has been carried out in regard to the harbour complex in Dún Laoghaire.  However, much remains to be done in this regard.  Those of us who take a walk from time to time along the East Pier and, sometimes, the West Pier, are aware of the importance of this great amenity not only to the residents of Dún Laoghaire but to the people of Dublin city and county generally.</P>
      <P>Regarding the commercial use of the pier, as the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned, it was agreed that the East Pier would be restored to its original condition.  In other words, that meant that all machinery, <i>et cetera,</i> relating to the former usage of the pier, would be dispensed with.  The position is that the pier is at about the halfway stage of restoration.  It still looks somewhat ugly and people in the area are not happy that it has not been restored fully to its original condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> I am confident that the Parliamentary Secretary will make every effort to have the matter rectified.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to digress for a moment and to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment. He is a man who is held in high esteem by all Deputies in this House and I wish him well in his new role.</P>
    <P>There has bean a considerable amount of controversy regarding the entrance from the main thoroughfare across the railway line to the West Pier.  I have not been along that particular road for the past three or four weeks, the reason for this being that my main interest during that time was in people and in votes and there are not too many votes to be had down the West Pier.  Consequently, I am not aware of whether the position there has been remedied.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary will not have any responsibility for the railway crossing but he has responsibility for the West Pier which is availed of considerably. It is important that there be a proper entrance to it.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will communicate with CIE and ascertain what they intend doing in relation to their responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I tabled a question in relation to the general condition of the West Pier.  Some weedkiller could be dispensed with a certain amount of abandon on parts of that pier because it is covered with grass.  One way of getting rid of the grass would be to dig it up and replace it with a hard top of tarmacadam.  At any rate.  the condition of the West Pier is not as good as that of the East Pier.  Very few boats are moored there but.  nevertheless, it is important that the pier be maintained in good condition so that local people may avail of it.</P>
    <P>In this area there is an extraordinary amalgam of the type of development that I foresee in this country.  On the one hand there are such recreational facilities as yachting and fishing within the harbour complex, and, then, there is a commercial proposition in operation there by way of the car ferry and the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead line. However, that is as far as we wish to <Col N="118" /> go because we must maintain a balance between the commercial and the recreational facilities.  We should leave the commercial aspect alone now and concentrate on maintaining the recreational side of the area which acts as a lung to those who avail of such facilities as fishing, yachting and walking in the area.</P>
    <P>As the working week becomes shorter, it is becoming increasingly evident that greater emphasis will have to be placed in future on facilities for leisure and that the proper use of leisure time will be one of our greatest concerns in the future.  The Dún Laoghaire Harbour complex is a readymade recreational area and we must ensure that it is maintained as such. At this stage I would like to thank those responsible for the coal quay for having put it into proper condition and for having provided a proper hard top there for fishermen.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a national park in the Wicklow mountains is one that I have put forward here on many occasions.  This has also been put forward at Dublin County Council level but nothing has come of it yet.  There must be developed a fully serviced national park in the Dublin-Wicklow mountain area.  Again, this may not be the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility but the use that has been made of the wonderful forest walks in the Dublin-Wicklow mountains over the last two or three years is phenomenal. This, again, is a clear indication of the will of the people of the nation to use these recerational facilities.  This is a matter with which we must concern ourselves and an area we must ruthlessly protect for the benefit of our citizens.  That is why I say we must protect the Dublin mountain area in the same way as I would be in favour of protecting the Dún Laoghaire harbour area.</P>
    <P>On Sunday last and on a number of other occasions I was passing through St. Stephen's Green and I noticed&mdash;and again the Board of Works are to be congratulated on this&mdash;that swings, roundabouts and slides have been provided for children. However, due to the growing popularity of St. Stephen's Green <Col N="119" /> there are not sufficient of these available. There is only one of each and I saw children queuing up behind the slide.  I believe the city of Dublin and the nation can rise to more than one of these playground facilities for the children of our citizens.  There is plenty of ground available for more of these items to be included.  Again, St. Stephen's Green is a clear indication of the type of leisure facilities people want.</P>
    <P>The matter of Garda stations comes within the ambit of the Parliamentary Secretary's responsibility.  I believe there may be plans in the pipeline for Shankill, County Dublin, Garda station.  The mind boggles at how we can ask the Garda Síochána to dwell within and to operate from such a station.  It is a very primitive station, and that is putting it at its very kindest, apart from the fact that it is located on a very dangerous thoroughfare, the Stillorgan-ShankillBray road.  This must be a cause of concern to the gardaí, on the one hand, in the context of road safety, with people pulling up to go in and see them and, on the other hand, in the context of their having to &ldquo;survive&rdquo; in the station itself.</P>
    <P>Cabinteely Garda station is also a hazard from the point of view of road safety and the accommodation in the station itself is nothing to write home about.  As regards Blackrock Garda station, again one wonders how a Garda station could be erected in such a position.  The accommodation there is not good either.</P>
    <P>These are three Garda stations I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to take into account when he is drawing up his Estimate for next year, and in relation to any Garda station rebuilding he intends doing in the city and county of Dublin I would ask him to give priority to these three stations in Shankill, Cabinteely and Blackrock.  It remains for me to thank the House for bearing with me and once more to wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success in his new appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency which suffers very <Col N="120" /> severely from flooding, I should like to speak first of all about drainage. For a number of years past I have been saying what I am going to repeat now, but it has not had very much effect.  There are two schemes for drainage.  One is known as the arterial drainage scheme and the only other scheme I know of for drainage is the local improvements scheme. The arterial drainage scheme takes a long time to prepare, and the local improvements scheme does not cover the rivers and tributaries that fall between the arterial drainage scheme and the local improvements scheme. There are many rivers too expensive to be done under the local improvements scheme and too small to be considered under the arterial drainage scheme.</P>
      <P>I always thought there should be some scheme in between those which would cover what I have in mind.  In Sligo-Leitrim, some of these middle-sized rivers coming down from the mountains in wet weather cause very heavy flooding and do severe damage. The Government will have to get down to this question of drainage to cover a wider field than is already covered. In days gone by we had the Local Authorities (Works) Acts which did drainage and other works in between those two schemes I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department was quite generous in giving £100,000 to County Leitrim under the local improvements scheme. However, we must always remember the cost of machinery and increased wages, and when everything is taken into consideration £1,000 does very little in the line of drainage.  Therefore, it is not long before £100,000 is eaten up by a few large schemes. In relation to this £100,000, I asked the county engineer at a meeting what was the backlog situation and he said that it will take five years to reach any scheme which is submitted at this stage.  To have to tell a local farmer that it will be five years before a scheme is reached is something that does not give very much pleasure. Such a statement might do very severe damage.  The fact that there is such a great delay in carrying out these schemes is beyond the imagination <Col N="121" /> of the farming community in my constituency.  Something will have to be done to speed up these schemes and lead on to greater development.</P>
    <P>We must remember that we are not talking about conditions that existed ten years ago when livestock and land were not very valuable.  When I was first elected a Member of this House 12 years ago people were only too anxious to dispose of their land and their livestock.  They did not care if their land was flooded out of existence. Now, however, with land so valuable even in the most remote parts of my constituency, they have a different attitude.  Irrespective of where land is for sale there is always a very interested buyer who is willing to pay a great deal of money for it.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use his influence to have this problem of drainage tackled on a greater scale.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion to ask the Parliamentary Secretary about a small grant that is required to carry out a drainage scheme in the Ballintrillick area.  At the weekend a number of farmers made representations to me concerning this scheme.  The farmers are willing to pay the cost of the scheme but they are not in a position to do the work because they have failed to obtain approval from one of the landowners concerned.  I have been informed that the Board of Works has power to proceed with the scheme and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do everything possible to have it expedited because it would relieve the drainage problem over a vast area.</P>
    <P>The River Bonnet has always been a great source of worry to the farmers in my constituency.  Even a light fall of rain is sufficient to flood l h is river.  Farmers in the area have suffered great loss as a result and have been hampered in their efforts to improve their holdings and increase their stock.  Many meetings have been held and deputations have met Ministers but it all fizzled out after a while.  Twenty years ago the River Bonnet was pegged after officials from the Board of Works visited the area hut the river has still not been <Col N="122" /> drained.  It is my hope that before long something will be done about the drainage of this river and that we will see something more than pegs in the river.</P>
    <P>Many of the rivers I have mentioned only stretch for a distance of ten or 12 miles but the damage they cause when in flood is tremendous. They are very destructive particularly in wet weather.  One such river is that which stretches from Manorhamilton to Glencar lake.  This is a very low river which has not much of a flow and even the slightest flood causes a lot of damage.  No local group could possibly consider carrying out the drainage of such rivers under the local improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of drainage more money should be spent on it.  It is no exaggeration to state that farms which six years ago would have been sold for £1,000 are now realising in the region of £12,000.  Money spent on drainage is well spent.</P>
    <P>I should also like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary the great need to carry out repairs in primary schools.  In particular I should like to impress upon him the importance of providing wash and toilet facilities in rural schools.  At the moment there is a dispute between the Department of Education and the parents of children attending a school in my constituency.  This dispute concerns a grant which the parents are seeking to provide wash and toilet facilities.  The school was erected in 1947 and the dispute has gone on for the past five years.  The local people have provided a group water scheme in the area and, consequently, it would not cost very much to provide these facilities.  A local engineer estimates that the cost would be in the region of £500.</P>
    <P>I have referred this problem to the Department of Education who informed me that it was a matter for the Board of Works office in Sligo. I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to treat this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Col N="123" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Carney National School.  In spite of the argument which the Department of Education is putting forward that there is little use in spending £500 on this school when there is a proposal for a central school for the area, I believe that it should be spent in the interests of the health of the children.  There are numerous other schools in my constituency in need of similar improvements.  The parents of the children of school-going age are not asking for any elaborate improvements. They only ask that wash and toilet facilities be provided.</P>
      <P>On previous occasions I have drawn attention to the condition of Garda stations in my constituency.  In Sligo the accommodation is far from adequate and the same applies to the station in Manorhamilton.  These stations accommodate a big number of gardaí who are engaged in Border patrols.  Very little improvement has been carried out to them in recent years.  Both towns are calling out for new buildings that might make life much brighter and better for the men who serve the State so loyally.  For some years past the Garda have had a very active time in that part of the country, Sligo-Leitrim, which borders County Fermanagh.  They had to be very much on the alert. The best possible should be provided for those people who are doing such a good job, working night and day. It is only right that they should be properly looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem which should be dealt with without delay is the provision of schools for handicapped children. Since I became a Deputy I have been approached by parents who are most anxious to have a child placed in some suitable school.  On different occasions I got lists of those schools in Dublin and elsewhere and all were over-crowded. In Sligo we have a very fine school and hospital, Cregg Hospital. It began in a small way and was extended and the extension was officially opened some years ago.  I hope a further extension will be opened there in the near future.  This is something of which any Department may be proud.  But we must <Col N="124" /> remember that this hospital serves the needs of Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, parts of Roscommon and, I think, Donegal, catering for girls.  There are as many boys in the area for whom there is no suitable accommodation.  The demands on that hospital are unbelievable and whenever you approach the sister-in-charge you find there is a long waiting list for admission.  They are doing very good work.  They bring in nurses and train them in how to handle mentally retarded children, many of whom are unable to earn a livelihood on their own.  That entails great sacrifice on the part of the sisters and their nursing staff.  No amount of money would be too much to spend on such projects.</P>
    <P>We hear much talk of building hotels for tourists, but money spent on hospitalisation of the type I have mentioned is far more important than catering for people who might come for two or three months in a year. Those children are as dear to their parents as the brightest pupils in any school and it is a great consolation to the parents to know that their children are well taught and cared for in such a school.  I appeal to the Government to put special emphasis on the provision of those schools.  I have known boys who reached 14 years of age and it is a great source of worry to their parents to know that such a boy is approaching manhood when they have nowhere to send him.  This is a serious matter especially when such a boy could be given useful training.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Department on the amount of money spent on various national monuments.  In my own area alone valuable employment is given to people who are doing a good job.  It is a pleasure to see how attractive some of those old cemeteries and old castles have become and how well looked-after they are compared with their condition a few years ago when nothing was being done.  This is appreciated by many people and very useful employment is given.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and his staff have a difficult task because they have to spend so much money on the maintenance of buildings all over the country and maintenance today is very <Col N="125" /> expensive.  Wages, materials and travelling are very costly and I must compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the job that is being done.  I wish himself and his staff every success.  I should like to end as I began by making a plea that priority should be given to drainage in many rural areas that are seriously affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right and fitting that a Deputy from Mayo making his first speech in this House should congratulate Deputy Kenny on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary.  Those of us who had the pleasure of serving with him in Mayo County Council know well that he has the experience and, above all, the humanity to make a very good job of the post.  We also hope that he will be his own man.  We are proud of the fact that the one Ministry, either senior or junior, that came west of the Shannon came to Deputy Kenny. The influence of his Department reaches into every parish in the country.  It is a Department of contrasts: there are the ugly spoil heaps of arterial drainage in contrast to the magnificence of Garinish; you have the heavy reinforced concrete work of harbour construction in contrast with the delicate craftsmanship involved in the restoration of ancient monuments.  It is a Department which has considerable influence not only on the material life of any area but the talents and experience of its personnel have had major repercussions on the social, recreational and business life of the towns in which they have lived.</P>
      <P>I am a new Deputy in this House and let me say I should not like to see a glass partition extended to the ceiling in this Chamber.  That would be most undesirable.  I have sufficient faith in the majority of the people and in the security personnel of Leinster House to know that such work is not warranted and, in conjunction with Deputy Lemass, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision taken by the previous Government that office accommodation required for the Government be built by them.  I considered the policy of renting accommodation futile and unnecessary.  I have had conversations <Col N="126" /> with well-informed people on this subject and they told me the cost of the office block to the contractor would be returned to him in seven years.  The interest on the capital cost could easily be paid out of the rentals and, in the long run, the erection of office blocks by the Government for their own use would be much cheaper.</P>
    <P>As a country Deputy, one who suffers three days weekly in the city, I think Dublin needs all the additional recreational and amenity areas that can be made available.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consult with the Minister for Local Government to ensure that major housing developments include recreational facilities. Deputies Lemass and Andrews mentioned the works at Dún Laoghaire Pier.  Foolishly, one night I set out to walk the East Pier and when I got to the end I had to rest before I turned back.  It would be criminal to allow further commercial development on this pier and, as Deputies Lemass and Andrews urged, this area should be developed as an amenity harbour.  I stay in this area when I am in Dublin and I know the intensity of feelings of the people that the recreational facilities they have should be retained.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the landing facilities at Inishbofin, County Galway.  I would ask him to ensure that when any construction work is carried out on harbours or slipways, full consultation should be had with local interests.  I am an engineer and I realise that occasionally engineers are dogmatic about what is right and what is wrong.  However, I realise in this case the fishermen are the experts; they know the direction of the winds and currents and are aware of local conditions.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the fullest consultations be held with them.</P>
    <P>If I might be parochial, may I ask the Parliamentary Secretary the position regarding the revised scheme at Kilcummin.  After the election I attended a meeting of local fishermen with engineers from the Office of Public Works and from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, at which the provision of landing facilities at Kilcummin was discussed.  The <Col N="127" /> fishermen were adamant that the proposals submitted by the Office of Public Works were not adequate. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might visit the area with me.  It could be of use in the future if the rumours we hear are correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's speech dealt with the Kerry region to a large extent.  I spent a holiday there last year and, from the experiences of that holiday, I welcome the new route that has been developed for jaunting cars from the Tore Monument through the magnificent park.  It will be much more interesting and safer than the present route which is a long, narrow, winding and busy road and one of which I have not very pleasant memories.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying to know that the confidence of the former Government in the future of the Shannon has been proved correct and that, at a time when there has been a general decline in the tourist business, tourism in this area has shown a substantial increase. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might examine the possibility of linking Lough Conn with the Moy?  I understand that in the last century a plan was prepared that linked the Moy with Lough Conn and Lough Cullen.  I do not know where it is now, if any trace of it exists, but if Conn and Cullen were linked with Moy there could be an excellent extension of pleasure cruising in the western areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that £5,000 has been included for work on the museum centre in Cashel.  I would ask him to ensure that the roofing of this building will be carried out in such a way that it will not stick out like a sore thumb against the other buildings on the Rock.  It would be unfortunate if modern materials were used on the job.  As one who has a professional and particular interest in building, I am glad to see the allocation of money, started some time ago, is being continued and that at least the public interest in the maintenance and improvement of ancient monuments is being reflected in the increased allocation this year.  These ancient monuments are an important part of our past.  They are mirrors of the advanced stage of our civilisation at that time.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we be able to show to the world what we had in the past and that we would have reminders for ourselves of the difference in our building standards then and now.  They are a significant part of our culture and will be, as is the case in other parts of the world, an important asset to our tourist industry.  The Parliamentary Secretary does not need reminding of the richness of Connacht in these old buildings and I look to him to ensure that the best of these are restored.  He might get his experts to examine all old buildings, list those that it is possible to restore and take down the rest.  It would be kinder and safer to demolish those that will not be restored, after consultation with local historical organisations and development associations.  It is to be hoped that the example of John McShain, whom the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, will be followed by others.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned accommodation in the courts of justice complex and he specifically mentioned the Children's Court.  I have not had the doubtful pleasure of seeing that court but I have read in the newspapers that it is a very grim, foreboding type of building.  He has said that permanent buildings are to be designed and constructed.  I would ask him to ensure that the breathing space he has mentioned in this context will not become <Col N="129" /> the deep sleep of Sleeping Beauty.</P>
    <P>As a Mayoman, I am particularly glad to see vindication of the former Minister for Lands, Mr. Moran, and that work is to start shortly in Castlebar. The former Minister received much criticism for this project and I am glad to say it is finally coming to fruition.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that after the contract has been placed there will be no undue delay.  Knowing him, I am confident this will be so.</P>
    <P>It was to be expected that a large proportion of the money allocated to new schools would be spent on the erection of schools in new areas of towns and cities.  I would ask that a fair proportion of this money will go to rural areas.  I suggest that where there are very large housing developments the developer, as part of his planning permission, should have a surcharge placed on each house to provide a contribution towards the cost of new schools which become necessary.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to one or two schools in my constituency which have been on the mat for improvement for some time.  The first is the central school at Attymass.  It is hoped to start on this this year and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that this will be done.  There is a small school at Creevagh, about ten miles from Ballina, in which there is neither electricity nor toilets.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Education about this and I hope these facilities will be provided shortly.  Deputy McLaughlin mentioned one case in point.  It seems to be unreasonable that an estimate of £500 for a local job would have to be approved in the local office, then <Col N="130" /> in the regional office and then Dublin. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that when the local office get the required number of estimates it would be possible for the work to go ahead on that basis.</P>

      <P>It appears to me some misunderstanding arose today.  I am aware exactly what the Order of Business was.  It is in front of the Chair.  I have also given the Leas-Cheann Comhairle a copy of what exactly the Taoiseach said.  I understand the Standing Orders provide that questions on a Thursday shall be from 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. However, during the last three years it has been the practice of the House to finish questions on Thursday and then to resume whichever debate is in progress. I should like to ask you to draw the attention of the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle to this matter.  Several people today wished to contribute during Question Time; Question Time ended at 3.30 and this was not specified by the Taoiseach. He went back to a Standing Order which has not been applied for at least three years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that Standing Orders provide that Question Time be, as he has stated, from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. Unless arrangements for the continuation of questions have been specifically made, the Order of Business is resumed at 3.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 12th June, 1973.</P>
