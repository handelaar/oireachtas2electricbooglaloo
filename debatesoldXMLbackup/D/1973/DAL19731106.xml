      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of each of the years 1968 to 1973 the volume of exports of a company (name supplied) in the following ranges: (a) children's (b) infants to teens (girls) (c) infants <Col N="1216" /> to teens (boys) (d) ladies short and knee length wellingtons (e) men's wellingtons, size 6-12 and (f) men's galoshes, overboots and waders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy cannot be supplied. External trade statistics are not compiled in respect of individual companies and the provision of such data would, in any event, be contrary to accepted practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, is he aware that the company in question, which enjoyed a monopoly here for years and which was protected by tariffs and otherwise, have now sent out a circular letter expressing regret and saying that a particular range of footwear would not be available until 1974? Has the Parliamentary Secretary anything to add?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that I do not know anything about this firm. The question put down by the Deputy was in respect of exports.  The information about exports is not compiled in respect of individual firms.</P>

      <P>The price paid for EEC wines depends to a large extent on the price fixed under EEC regulations which are concerned with ensuring that wine producers receive an adequate return. The price fixed is based on price trends recorded within the EEC.</P>
      <P>From 1971-72 to 1972-73 wine prices within the EEC increased by amounts ranging from 17 per cent to 36 per cent depending on the type of wine.

In view of that, is there now discrimination in taxation against continental wines which accounts for the increase when everybody expected a reduction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the increase in price is due to factors outside excise duty and tariffs altogether.  There has been some control by continental governments on the type of wines that may be labelled in a certain way and this tends to reduce the quantity available and increase their price.  As far as I know, there is no discrepancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the increase was of the order of about 17 per cent but the increase on the market here is very considerably more than that.</P>

      <P>High quality French and German wines of a particular year are sometimes sold by auction.  It is really a question of supply and demand.  If there is a high quality wine, there is demand for it and the price tends to go up.  This has nothing to do with being inside or outside the EEC.</P>

    <P>The number of price increases recommended to me, including the number of (a) food and drink items and (b) non-food items, is available from the published monthly reports of the National Prices Commission which are in the Oireachtas Library and which are also circulated to each <Col N="1227" /> Deputy.  On the days on which the monthly reports of the commission for March, April, May, June, July and August/September, 1973 were published, I indicated in a Press statement that, with the exception of increases in CIE rates and fares, I had accepted the commission's recommendations for price increases for the firms concerned and that I would raise no objection to the implementation of those increases.</P>

I do not know if the Deputy is busy in other regards but if he cares to go out and question the housewives of this city he will find that increased children's <Col N="1228" /> allowances, increased widows' pensions and other increased benefits are of great benefit to the people of this city and of the country as a whole.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the Deputies to the statement which was made by the Taoiseach recently in an address to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and was widely reported. The Taoiseach made it clear that the Government did not intend to deprive manufacturers of the benefits of the export tax relief and had, in fact, <Col N="1237" /> authorised the Industrial Development Authority to give, on their behalf, an absolute assurance to manufacturers and industrialists that they regard the granting of this relief as a contractual obligation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation in this regard was passed in 1956 by a Government comprising both parties on this side of the House.  As was outlined by the Taoiseach last week to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, this Government have no intention of amending that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>At the recent Labour Party Conference I made a passing reference to the fact that more than a smelter would be involved in the spin-off industries from <Col N="1238" /> mining, natural gas and oil.  I had in mind that a natural further development  would be the establishment of metal using industries to utilise the unwrought metals produced from a smelter, but it is clearly not possible to be more specific at this stage.</P>
      <P>There have been no developments in regard to the establishment of a smelter since 5th July, 1973, when I answered an earlier question by the Deputy on the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the reasons for his continued refusal to take steps to control the roadside sale of goods by caravan traders, in view of the unfair competition which they constitute to established traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard roadside trading as inherently wrong.  I consider that the problem posed by this type of trading arises largely because of the extent to which stolen and smuggled goods have figured in it recently.  If these elements were eliminated, it is unlikely that roadside traders would present a serious problem.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the matter is one in which I can take direct action.  I feel that the problem can most effectively be dealt with by full enforcement of the present law with the interests of traders in mind and I have asked the appropriate authorities to continue to do everything in their power to this end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be surprised to hear that a figure of £1½ million in this connection has been mentioned?  Would the Minister not agree that effective steps should be taken immediately to end this system of unfair trading, particularly with regard to goods of doubtful origin and ownership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made at the end of the Deputy's supplementary question with regard to goods of doubtful origin.  However, I must point out that many roadside traders deal at fairs and operate under hawkers' licences and are legitimate traders.  The Minister stated previously that this problem can be dealt with most effectively by full enforcement of the present law and I agree with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to traders and hawkers at fairs.  Is the Minister aware that these people must be licensed and are under the scrutiny of the Garda at all times to ensure that the goods they are selling match the descriptions that are given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister state he was satisfied with the present situation where goods valued at £1½ million were sold?  The goods in question were mostly luxury items but the traders do not pay VAT, rents, overheads or the cost of hawkers' licences. Does the Minister consider that this is fair trading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the goods are stolen a stop should be put to this practice.  However, under the law the Garda have sufficient powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received many complaints from small traders who sell the same kinds of goods as roadside traders?  These people have suffered considerable hardship and loss of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a number of traders' associations have complained to the Minister and, as a result, he has asked the appropriate authorities to continue to do everything in their power to bring it to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will consider restoring the loaf of bread to its former size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent introduction of metric weights for bread is in line with established policy for the gradual introduction of the metric system in this country, the target date for the completion of the change over to metric being 1975.  The Deputy will appreciate that in these circumstances a reversion to the former imperial weights would be a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's reply that we are to continue to have the smaller loaf? Regardless of what way the Minister got around the issue by quoting metric and imperial measures, the fact is that the loaf has been reduced in size.  Can we take it that there will be no increase in the price of the loaf, either in sterling or in any other currency, during the next three or four months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Price increases are a matter for the National Prices Commission. Should the bakeries apply to the commission for an increase, their application would be examined and a decision as to whether an increase was granted would be based on whether there was justification for an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will give an assurance that the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1973, which prohibits bulk buyers from receiving special discount advantages by virtue of their sizeable orders, will not result in the general shopping public paying more for their purchases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make clear what the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973 does and does not do in the matter of quantity discounts.  The order does not prohibit a supplier from allowing reasonable discounts for bulk orders or deliveries.  What it does forbid is the granting of unreasonable discounts, over and above what is economically justifiable, which some large distributors were able to extort by reason of their purchasing power.  The overall cost of deliveries to distributors should not be affected by the order, and there is no reason to fear that it might result in the general shopping public paying more for their purchases.</P>

      <P>The exclusion took place in 1971-72 when a number of vocational education committees sought approval for the award of scholarships to second year students. The reason why it is regarded as inevitable that a change should be <Col N="1252" /> made is that it would be invidious if second year students were to be given scholarships at the expense of first year students for whose benefit the scholarship scheme was introduced.

      <P>There are in the Limerick area three major institutes of higher education&mdash;the National Institute of Higher Education at Plassy, the National College of Physical Education which will be expanded into an institute for the training of teachers of many specialist subjects, electronics, metal work, woodwork and so on, and, thirdly, Mary Immaculate College of Education, Summerhill, Limerick which offers training courses for teachers in primary schools and courses leading to the Higher Diploma in Education from University College, Cork.</P>
      <P>These three institutes, therefore, will provide, when fully developed, a substantial concentration of students in the Limerick area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the Private Notice Question and Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>I have already taken all reasonable steps open to me, firstly, to prevent the situation from developing to the stage it has now reached and, secondly, to minimise the effects of the action taken by junior hospital doctors against the advice of the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present dispute relates to new claims for improvements in remuneration <Col N="1267" /> and conditions of employment made by the Medical Union dated 3rd October, by the Irish Medical Association dated 11th October and by the Medical Union dated 18th October.  I met representatives of those two organisations on 10th October.  Representatives of my Department and of the employing authorities conducted negotiations with representatives of the two organisations, including some junior hospital doctors, at meetings on the 15th, 19th, 23rd, 25th and 30th October. At the meeting on 30th October, an offer was made.  The two organisations involved are at present conducting a ballot on the offer and, pending the result of it, they have requested the junior hospital doctors to continue working normal hours.  In accordance with the usual practice, I must await notification of the outcome of the ballot.  I should make it clear that the claim rejected, following arbitration, at the end of September had been made on a totally different basis to the new claims made during October.</P>
    <P>The offer made to the doctors on 30th October, was a responsible and reasonable one to meet the immediate financial aspects of the claims made. The increase in the case of interns was from £1,959 to £2,237 a year.  For house officers the existing salary range of £2,143 to £3,213 would go to a range of £2,487 to £3,710 and for registrars the existing range of £2,855 to £3,742 would go to a range of £3,315 to £4,294 a year.  The claims also related to other things including living out allowances and provision of telephone and I have conceded these.</P>
    <P>Perhaps most important in the long-term was a claim that there should be a better career structure for junior hospital doctors.  This, too, I have accepted in principle and I would see to it that the necessary studies to establish this career structure should be completed within a fixed timetable.</P>
    <P>My earnest desire to have this dispute resolved can best be judged by reference to the speed with which I dealt with the claims.  Complex claims were made between the 3rd and the 18th October; a realistic offer was made on the 30th October.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> On the 24th October, as a matter of prudence, I had a letter sent to all hospital authorities giving them the full facts of the position to date.  The authorities were requested to assess the situation which might arise after the 1st November as a matter of urgency with a view to their taking whatever steps they considered necessary to maintain essential and emergency services in their hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have been keeping in close touch with the situation in Dublin and throughout the country since Thursday last and medical officers of my Department have visited several of the major hospitals in Dublin to obtain information on the spot.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, hospital authorities have made arrangements with the consultants attached to the hospitals to provide services and cover in the light of the situation which had developed.  The facilities being provided inevitably involve some curtailment of normal services such as the deferment of the admission of non-urgent cases and the cutting down of out-patient activity.  The arrangements made will impose some considerable strain on those concerned and on the overall situation in the hospitals.  In the circumstances, I would appeal to the public not to seek attention at the out-patient departments of hospitals where it is not essential to do so but rather to avail of the services of general practitioners. I would like to make a special appeal to general practitioners to do all in their power to ensure that the minimum demand is made on the hospitals at this time.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of further discussion with the involved parties, I am willing to meet them just as soon as the situation regarding the offer already made has been clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to state whether, following investigation by officers of his Department at various hospitals, he is satisfied that the lives of patients are not being endangered by the present dispute? May I also ask if, in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="1269" /> he is aware that many hospitalised patients are not being granted their social welfare certificates and will, in consequence suffer serious financial hardship and what action he proposes to take to remedy this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been brought by the Deputy to the attention of the Department of Social Welfare and satisfactory arrangements are being made to ensure that these people will not be deprived of their social welfare benefits.  In regard to the other general question, I do not think the responsibility is entirely on me as to whether the patients are treated in the normal way.  There are two sides to this dispute, and I think I have done everything possible within a very limited period in order to satisfy, as I said in the reply, the financial claims by the doctors, career structure and all the other things that are involved. I said I would set up the necessary machinery in order to ensure that there would be a proper career structure and within a given period. I do not think it is unreasonable for me to ask, as it is not unreasonable for the two medical associations to ask, the junior hospital doctors not to take this precipitate action but to wait until the ballot is completed. When the ballot is completed, whatever the result is, there may then be the necessity for further talks, negotiations or conciliation.  I am prepared to go, as I have gone in the last four weeks, to the utmost extent in order to see that sick people in this country are properly protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that hospitals at the moment are only barely ticking over, that they are enabled to do this by the fact that the consultants are working enormously long hours, many of them in fact, working all night long, that the consultants say, quite reasonably, that they are not going to be able to continue this for more than a few days more?  Does the Minister realise what the situation will then be, and can he do anything at all, irrespective of the merits or demerits of this dispute, to ensure that people will not die, <Col N="1270" /> because that is what is facing us this week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst I regard the position as a serious one.  I do not think it is as serious as that suggested by Deputy O'Malley.  I do not say either that the hospitals are ticking over as normally as they would be in normal circumstances.  There is an emergency in the hospitals and the consultants have agreed to service the various hospitals by way of roster. As far as what I can do is concerned, I have been dealing with trade union problems all my life and, as I said in reply to Deputy Dr. O'Connell, I do not think it is unreasonable to ensure that precipitate action will not be taken until the members of the two medical organisations, the IMA and the Medical Union of Ireland, have given their decision.  Only then can I come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a well-known fact that the junior hospital doctors have voted already by a majority of about 100 to 1 approximately, something over 700 to 7, against acceptance?  Is it not also a fact that a great many of these junior hospital doctors are not members of either organisation and the strong likelihood is that the vote at the end of the week will be against acceptance?  Even if one or other of the organisations' members were to vote for acceptance the great majority of the junior hospital doctors would still withdraw their labour.  In those circumstances, and in view of the fact that the consultants have reached the end of their tether, would the Minister not do something, whether or not it is in accordance with usual trade union practice, to ensure that the suffering which is now starting and the deaths which, I am afraid, will inevitably follow will be avoided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>All the negotiations were conducted under the auspices of the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union and in these discussions the junior hospital doctors participated.  The two medical associations, the IMA and the MU, have advised on several occasions the <Col N="1271" /> junior hospital doctors to remain at work until the result of the ballot is known.  Maybe Deputy O'Malley knows more than I do about the result of the ballot.  I do not know officially yet.  As a matter of fact, I do not know unofficially what the situation is.  As far as the meeting in the Mater Hospital is concerned, I have had no communication from those who organised that meeting.  It is a fact, as reported in the newspapers, that the offer was rejected by 770 votes to 6.  The only comment I would like to make in that respect&mdash; I do not want to aggravate a serious situation&mdash;is to say that what I could not understand in respect of that meeting was the fact that the offer was made at six o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, this day last week, and there was rejection within 27 hours. Whether or not sufficient consideration was given to the offer I do not know.  The Deputy asked me if there is anything I can do.  What can I do? I might ask him what would he do in the same situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the responsibility. As far as meetings are concerned, I was approached by the junior hospital doctors' action committee on Saturday night asking me to meet them.  I said I would be prepared to meet them any time, even before the result of the ballot was known, provided that that meeting was arranged under the auspices of the two medical associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister now, as an emergency measure, to call the members of this action committee into his office with members of the medical union and the IMA in virtue of the fact that many of them are not represented by either body and to do it now&mdash;today or tomorrow, ask them to come in and see him to discuss the matter and refer contentious clauses to the Labour Court?  This is the answer to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not it is a complete answer because <Col N="1272" /> one of the parties may not want to take that course, but I have stated here today, as I stated to the junior hospital doctors, and the majority of them are in the two medical associations&mdash;there are some who are not&mdash; that I do not think it is unreasonable for me to say: &ldquo;Yes, I will meet you provided you come under the auspices of the people who conducted the negotiations on your behalf.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but would the Minister not meet them as a group representing the junior hospital doctors and try to come to a settlement that way?  I do not think this is the time to stick to what may be commendable in normal circumstances. This is a very unusual situation in that a great many of these men are not apparently members of either group and, because they are not, they should not hold up a possible settlement which might come about if the Minister would meet them.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company (General Meetings) Order, 1973, proposed by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 23rd day of October, 1973, under subsection 4 of section 10 of the Gas Regulations Act, 1920 be approved.</P>
      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas.  Modifications to the Special Acts required by the undertakings from time to time are made under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to make by order the required modifications.  Before an order of this kind is made it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications and additions. When such approval is given I may make the order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>In 1950 an order entitled Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company (General Meetings) Order, 1950, was made on the application of the company, which provided that the ordinary general meeting would be held annually instead of half yearly, and as soon after the 31st December of the preceding year but not later than the month of March as the directors by resolution from time to time determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> The company feel that this regulation does not allow adequate time for the preparation, audit and distribution of the annual accounts prior to the annual meeting.  They, therefore, proposed to me that I should make a Special Order under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which would allow them to hold the ordinary general meeting at a time to be determined by the directors but not later than 15 months after the previous ordinary general meeting.  As the proposed order would not be in conflict with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, and, following consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I agreed to the proposal. The order now laid in draft before the House for approval will give the company the necessary authority to fix the date of the ordinary general meeting with the degree of latitude which they require.</P>
    <P>The statutory requirements in regard to publicity have been complied with. Copies of the draft order were sent to the public and local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>No objection to the proposed order was received.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied as to the need for the order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable effect to be given in Irish domestic law to the Convention on Offences and Certain other Acts committed on board Aircraft, drawn up at Tokyo in September, 1963, and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft drawn up at The Hague in December, 1970.  Some of the provisions in the conventions can be applied administratively while <Col N="1277" /> others require legislation.  The enactment of this Bill will clear the way for this country to formally adhere to the conventions.</P>
    <P>The Tokyo Convention came into force internationally on 4th December, 1969, after the twelfth ratification was made and The Hague Convention came into force on 14th October, 1971, after the tenth ratification was made.  The Tokyo Convention is now in operation between 67 states and The Hague Convention between 57 states.</P>
    <P>The principal states with which we have regular air services, that is, the US, the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, have already ratified either or both of the conventions.</P>
    <P>The Tokyo Convention was intended to establish international co-operation with a view to ensuring that persons who committed crimes on board aircraft in flight would not escape apprehension merely for lack of jurisdiction; it made it clear that the state of registration of an aircraft had the authority to apply its laws to events occurring on board its aircraft while in flight in any place whatsoever; it provided the aircraft commander with the necessary authority to deal with offenders; it delineated the duties and responsibilities of the contracting state in which the aircraft landed including its authority over and responsibility to any offender.  It also dealt with hijacking of aircraft but in this regard it confined itself to requiring a contracting state to restore control of the aircraft to the lawful commander and to permit passengers and crew arriving in its territory to continue their journey.  It did not provide for the establishment of hijacking as an international offence and it did not call specifically for punishment of hijackers.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention of 1970 expands and strengthens the Tokyo Convention provisions in regard to hijacking by providing at international level for the definition of the offence of hijacking, the establishment of jurisdiction over it and its punishment by heavy penalties or extradition of <Col N="1278" /> the offender, where appropriate.  The convention makes hijacking an international offence in that, with some exceptions, it requires states to establish jurisdiction over the offence irrespective of where it is committed, the nationality of the offender or the state of registration of the aircraft.</P>
    <P>The purposes of the Bill can be grouped under three main headings. First, it clarifies the legal position in regard to crimes of a general nature committed on board Irish aircraft. Secondly, it empowers the commander of Irish aircraft and of aircraft of any other state party to the Tokyo Convention to restrain, disembark or deliver up to the competent authorities in the state where the aircraft lands, any persons on board who have committed, or are about to commit any general offence on board or who jeopardise the safety of the aircraft or persons on board.  Thirdly, it establishes hijacking as an international offence irrespective of the nationality of the aircraft, the nationality of the offender or the place where the offence is committed.  These are the main features of the Bill and I will explain each of them in some detail.</P>
    <P>In regard to the application of Irish law to Irish aircraft in flight outside the State, the present position is that, except for certain internationally recognised offences such as murder, an offence committed on an Irish aircraft while outside the state is not amenable to the Irish courts in the same way as an offence on an Irish registered ship.  This represents a serious gap in jurisdiction particularly in regard to offences committed when an aircraft is flying over international waters not within the jurisdiction of any other state.  In such cases there is a danger that an alleged offender may escape apprehension merely for want of jurisdiction.  The Tokyo Convention accords international recognition to the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction under the circumstances contemplated in the convention.  The Bill reflects this by providing that any act or omission which would constitute an offence if committed within the State shall <Col N="1279" /> equally constitute an offence if committed on an Irish aircraft in flight outside the state.</P>
    <P>As a logical extension of the provisions about jurisdiction, the Bill furnishes the aircraft commander with powers to deal with persons who commit offences on board or who by their actions jeopardise the safety of the flight.  In such cases the commander of an Irish aircraft, or of an aircraft of any other State party to the Tokyo Convention, is empowered to take such reasonable measures, including restraint of the person, as he reasonably considers to be necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft or of persons on board, to maintain good order or discipline or to disembark him or to deliver him to the competent authorities of the State of landing.  Provision is made to safeguard the rights of individuals and to ensure that they are not kept under restraint any longer than is necessary.  The Bill specifies limits beyond which restraint shall not be exercised and imposes on the commander the obligation of reporting to the appropriate authorities on any persons under restraint, disembarked or delivered.  It lays down penalties for failure by the commander to observe these.</P>
    <P>Section 11 establishes hijacking as an international offence by providing that an offence is committed by anybody regardless of his nationality who on board an aircraft in flight wherever it may be and regardless of its State of registration, unlawfully interferes with the control of the aircraft.  Attempted hijacking and other acts of violence connected with hijacking also constitute such an offence.  The offender will thus be amenable to Irish courts and subject to prosecution or extradition, as appropriate.  In this way hijacking, including attempted hijacking or other acts of violence connected with hijacking, is established as an international offence.  These provisions, taken in conjunction with the corresponding provisions in the legislation of other contracting states, are designed to ensure as far as possible that a hijacker will find no place of refuge.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention applies only <Col N="1280" /> if the place of take-off or the place of actual landing of the aircraft involved is outside the State of registry.  The effect of this is that a hijacking of an aircraft on a domestic flight within its own country is not covered by the convention.  A further limitation on the scope of the convention is that it does not apply to aircraft used in military, customs or police services.  In the interests of affording the greatest possible protection to all forms of aviation, the Bill goes beyond the Hague provisions by extending the offence of hijacking to all cases of unlawful seizure of an aircraft, including a state aircraft, where:</P>
    <P>(a) the act is committed by a citizen of Ireland or a person habitually resident in the State;</P>
    <P>(b) the act is committed in or over the State, or</P>
    <P>(c) the aircraft is an Irish controlled aircraft.</P>
    <P>For example, a hijacking of an Aer Lingus aircraft flying between Dublin and Cork will be covered by the Bill although it is outside the scope of the convention.  This will make for consistency in the application of Irish law and provide more effective and all-embracing legislative provisions to deal with hijacking.</P>
    <P>The convention requires that the offence of hijacking shall be punishable by severe penalties.  The Bill reflects this requirement and the enormous gravity of the offence by providing that an offender, on conviction on indictment, shall be liable for a term of imprisonment up to life imprisonment. It also provides that if a state does not extradite an alleged hijacker it shall without exception whatsoever submit the case for the purpose of prosecution.  Contracting states are accordingly afforded the choice between extradition and prosecution and no substantive change in our existing extradition law is called for. Section 15 of the Extradition Act, 1965 provides that extradition shall not be granted where the offence in question is regarded as having been committed in the State.</P>
    <P>In the case of offences committed within the territorial area of the State, <Col N="1281" /> therefore, we would discharge our obligation under the convention by way of prosecution.  However, section 11 of the Bill by creating hijacking an international offence automatically brings it within the jurisdiction, no matter where it is committed and section 2 says that the offences may for all incidental purposes be treated as having been committed in the State. Some might seek to establish that as a consequence hijacking is not an extraditable offence in any circumstances. To safeguard against this it is necessary to provide that section 15 of the Extradition Act shall not apply in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Extradition Act provides that extradition shall not be granted for an offence which is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence, and a hijacker may escape extradition if the offence is in that category.  It will be a matter for the courts to determine whether or not the offence is a political offence.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should perhaps, say a few general words on why we are taking the Tokyo and Hague Conventions together in this Bill.  The previous Government had a Bill prepared in 1970 to enable effect to be given to the Tokyo Convention which came into force in 1969.  Unfortunately, however, as history has shown, that convention did little to halt the spate of hijacking and it became clear that it would be necessary to expand and strengthen the Tokyo Convention provisions on hijacking.  The Hague Convention of 1970 did this by declaring hijacking an international offence.  Since then other forms of interference with aviation, not covered by either the Tokyo or Hague Conventions, have been devised and it became necessary to draw up a third convention at Montreal in September, 1971 to cover these unlawful acts&mdash;they relate mainly to armed attacks, sabotage and similar acts of violence, other than hijacking, against aviation and its installations and facilities.  It is proposed to ratify the Montreal Convention as quickly as possible but I have decided that the <Col N="1282" /> introduction of the Bill to enable effect to be given to the Tokyo and Hague Conventions should not be deferred any longer.  Consequently, I am having a separate Bill prepared to give effect to the Montreal Convention and I would hope to introduce it in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is clear that legislation alone is no panacea for the crime of interference with aviation.  Hijacking of aircraft and other attacks against the safety of aircraft continue.  The threat is as great as ever.  Our efforts as an individual member of the international community to improve the situation involve action on two levels; on the one hand we have developed practical preventive security measures at our airports and on our air services and on the other we are assisting through this Bill in the creation of a structure of international law designed to outlaw the hijacker.  However, until all countries are committed to ridding aviation of the scourge of interference, hijackers will not be entirely discouraged.  Committed states may, therefore, be forced to think in terms of multilateral measures against defaulting states.  A recent international conference on air law held in Rome considered proposals to this end but failed to reach agreement; these efforts are continuing and I will not hesitate to bring in any further legislation necessary to give effect to any further instruments in this field.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is not a contentious one.  We are seeking to give the force of law to the provisions of two international instruments designed to promote the safety of aviation and which have been signed or adhered to by all the major countries of the world.  The airline industry and the airline pilots associations have called for adherence to the conventions.  I commend the Bill to you in the assurance that all Deputies of the House will support it and in so doing make Ireland's contribution to a peaceful and safe development of civil aviation throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House support this Bill.  Like the Minister, we believe it to be very <Col N="1283" /> necessary at this time because of happenings in recent years.  We know there are other offences covered in the Bill but the most important offence covered is hijacking.  It is right and proper that such a Bill should be introduced to give effect to the international conventions of Tokyo and The Hague.  Centuries ago there was the offence of sea piracy and even in those days the nations were capable of getting together and reaching agreement with regard to laws to cover this offence.  It is far more important that we should get together now and deal with hijacking.  In the days of sea piracy it took a number of people to take over a ship with the weapons they had at the time.  Now a man can take over an aircraft with a hand grenade.  This sort of thing has happened.  It must be a terrible experience to be a passenger in a hijacked plane.  Almost always the passengers are innocent victims who have no connection with the country or the political beliefs of the hijacker.  It is high time the various countries engaged in air navigation got together to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives police powers to the pilot and this is a very practical approach. It also eliminates many court complications which exist with regard to extradition, which at present is a lengthy process.  It is good to see that the penalties provided for are severe enough to deal with this terrible offence.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether the Bill would cover an event such as occurred last week which could surely be described as an internal hijacking.  There are a few things that many people on this side of the House and elsewhere would like to know.  They would like to know whether armed security people at Mountjoy Jail were withdrawn last July with the exception of one man who is only on duty during visiting hours.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that we have very effective security on our airports.  Aer Rianta are training their airport police properly.  They try to ensure that there are not hijackers at the point of embarkation. I am sure that the measures taken are working effectively.  We hope the Bill will be effective and help to rid the world of that dreadful evil &mdash;the modern hijacker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is self-evident because of the spate of hijackings which have taken place throughout the world in recent years.  The conventions of the Hague and Tokyo are only attempting to tackle the problem.  I do not think they have gone far enough to satisfy the airline pilots or the world travellers with regard to safety.  Passengers and crews are entitled to safety.  I believe that the Minister should bring in a Bill to ratify the Montreal Convention as soon as possible, as promised in his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that 67 states have already agreed to ratify the convention.  We would like to know the names of the 67 states.  As the Minister is aware, the problem of hijacking has been peculiar to two particular sections of the world&mdash;the Middle East, with its Arab-Israeli conflict, and the US, with Cuba and South America.  What countries in these areas have ratified these conventions? There is no point in a country like Ireland ratifying them when countries like Libya, Iran, Arabia and <Col N="1285" /> Syria have not done so.  These nations have been involved in air piracy.</P>
    <P>Without many nations taking part these conventions are not worth the paper they are written on.  They are worth nothing unless countries which have been involved in air piracy are also members and have signed the conventions.  The pilots and passengers of Irish airlines are entitled to protection. Passengers and crews throughout the world are entitled to it.  We have responsibilities towards our own nationals and people travelling on our national airline.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the Minister intends to protect nationals against other non-nationals flying on our airlines and being involved in air piracy.  One of our airlines has leased a plane to Algeria or the Middle East. Much more clarification is needed on this Bill.  The airlines of the world should boycott international flights of countries harbouring hijackers.  We will never see a satisfactory solution to this problem until that is done. Through misguided views some countries may harbour hijackers.  At present conventions are being signed and agreements made but the problem of hijacking is continuing.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain the situation in regard to Irish crews flying Irish planes which are on lease to foreign countries.  At present there are two Boeings on lease to Siam. What is the legal situation with regard to the air crews?  What guarantees of safety have they?  What protection is being given to passengers on Irish flights or to Irish people flying on international flights on airlines which have air marshals on their planes?  Some of the American airlines have armed air marshals on board.  This is very dangerous.  Inevitably some innocent passenger will be killed as a result of the action of one of these air marshals.  Is there any protection in this Bill?  What is in the Montreal Convention on this?  Will the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Transport and Power bring this problem to the attention of the negotiators of the next convention? Many passenger flights on the international lines carry air marshals.  An <Col N="1286" /> innocent passenger could be involved because for some political reason concerned with the Middle East or Cuba or some such state trouble broke out. What protection is being given to our people who travel on business on such airlines and who cannot get other flights because of their schedules?  I would like the Minister to consider my point about air marshals.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to explain the extradition procedures involved in domestic flights, for example, a flight between Dublin and Cork, if the flight is hijacked and ends up in some middle-eastern oil sheikdom.  What protection is there in the Bill for our passengers and crews, national or non-national?  What protection is proposed in any other legislation for our planes and cargoes, crews and passengers?  This is a very important consideration particularly as regards extradition and I should like the Minister to explain the situation.</P>
    <P>The question of the hijacked helicopter has been ruled out of order and I shall not contest that ruling but this is the first time that we ourselves have become involved in an intimate way with hijacking or air piracy.  I feel it is really relevant to the Bill but I shall not go into it in view of the Chair's ruling.</P>
    <P>The relevant point on this Bill is: what 67 states are involved?  Does that number encompass states whose nationals are involved in air piracy? Does it include such places as Libya and Algeria and the other states I mentioned?  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten me in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I also commend the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House at present.  It is fairly wide in its scope and covers a very important facet of daily life and it is necessary to have it on the Statute Book.  Over a period it may not require any implementation but it is still highly necessary. When enacted it will fill a glaring omission regarding the jurisdiction of Irish courts in regard to hijacking of aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If offences were committed on an Irish aircraft outside the jurisdiction of <Col N="1287" /> the country, up to this, with the exception of some serious offences such as murder, Irish courts had no jurisdiction to try such cases.  The Bill closes that loophole and provides that offences committed on an Irish aircraft no matter where the aircraft may be flying at the time, can be tried by Irish courts.  As the Minister said, this is covered by the Tokyo Convention.  This is important because up to now there was quite a lot of legal difficulty when aircraft commanders had not proper authority to handle the situation when offences were committed on their aircrafts. This led to many legal entanglements which perhaps eventually allowed a criminal to go free because of a legal loophole.  The Bill is desirable and necessary as it closes such loopholes.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he would be introducing a further Bill in regard to air transport.  I am not clear as to what he has in mind but I would bring specifically to his attention the present position in regard to security at our airports and at all airports into which we operate.  He mentioned the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy and Spain and it seems they have ratified the Hague and Tokyo Conventions. I should like him to say in respect of our airports and at airports of countries to which we operate what is the position in all these cases regarding security, first, from the point of view of dealing with people carrying arms and endeavouring to embark on aircraft.  This is important.</P>
    <P>In some American countries there are mechanical detectors of various kinds and various methods are used to detect the carrying of arms, or any kind of weapon such as a knife, by those embarking on aircraft.  It is highly desirable to check whether passengers are armed when embarking. I had hoped the Minister would ensure that such detectors would be available at every airport in this country.  I should also like him to ensure under the conventions mentioned that our Government should consult with the governments of countries to which we operate flights so that airports <Col N="1288" /> in these countries would also have methods of detecting whether or not a passenger was armed when embarking there.</P>
    <P>This is something that may or may not arise; it is unforeseeable but it is something we must ensure against.  It is difficult to legislate against the chance in a million but the chance in a million does happen.  Therefore, it is important that such methods of detection be available at all our airports. The times we live in demand such protection. It is also important that as thorough a check as possible is made of the luggage of persons embarking on aircraft.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that security at our airports and at the airports to which we have regular flights, should be tightened up considerably. We are endeavouring to legislate against a remote chance, but we must do so if at all possible.  People might wonder what interest a rural Deputy from Laois-Offaly would have in a Bill of this nature. Nowadays from time to time everybody uses an aircraft.  That is why I thought I should mention those points.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House this evening.</P>

      <P>This Bill got the reception I anticipated for it.  It was welcomed by all sides of the House. The Deputies who spoke said that we have an obligation in an international sense to see that highjackers have no places of refuge.  As Deputy Barrett said, to really make highjacking impossible, every country in the world would need to sign and ratify these conventions.  We can only work towards this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said a recent international conference on air law in Rome considered proposals for taking multilateral measures against defaulting states.  Agreement could not be reached in Rome on that matter, but I am sure it will come up again at the next air conference and we will certainly be urging that something of this nature should be done.  We are very <Col N="1289" /> conscious of the necessity to eradicate hijacking from aviation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke wanted to know the number of countries who signed the convention and I can read them out to him if he likes: Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Burundi, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, the People's Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Holy See, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Luxembourg, Libyan Arab Republic, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Netherlands, Niger, Nigeria, Norway and Pakistan.

      <P>I did not.  They are probably in the same position as we were in until today, that is, that even though they had signed it they had not ratified it.  It is desirable that all states should ratify the convention. The more states who do, the more difficult it is for those states who did not, to avoid doing so.  It is up to us at international aviation conferences to stress this point and, if necessary, to try to bring in multilateral measures which will affect all countries.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke made a point about some of our people not being protected on international flights.  There is nothing much we can do about that.  This Bill makes hijacking an international offence, and that is as far as we can go.  We cannot go further than the Tokyo Convention which we are now ratifying.  It is up to every airline to introduce measures to secure their passengers but, as against that, hijackers will always manage to <Col N="1290" /> find their way aboard unless security at airports is tightened up.</P>
      <P>The three Deputies who spoke were concerned about security at our airports. At the moment it is costing £100,000 in the three Irish airports for security.  Deputy Enright asked about detectors.  They are now being used at the three airports.  On the ground we will do what we can to see that people intent on hijacking do not get aboard planes.  The Montreal Convention which we will be dealing with in a Bill later on, will ensure that aircraft on the ground cannot be attacked or sabotaged.</P>
      <P>This convention takes care of the actual in-flight position and gives power to the commander to apprehend people who are attempting hijacking. It extends the jurisdiction of Irish law into international law.  We will be continuously closing loopholes as they appear to prevent hijackers from having the free run they had for the past number of years.  This is closing a very big and very important loophole.  The Montreal Convention will close another and tightening of security on the ground will make it as difficult as possible for people with the intention to hijack to get on board aircraft.  In time all these measures will eliminate hijackers&mdash;to go back to Deputy Burke's analogy&mdash;as pirates were eliminated in the Middle Ages by concerted action at international level.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why agricultural workers are not included in this Bill.  In discussions on the previous Act there was criticism of the fact that agricultural workers were not included.  I know the Government have made an announcement to the effect that they intend to bring in legislation.  Would it not have been desirable to embody it in this measure, or is there any reason why it is not included?</P>

      <P>Agricultural workers are catered for under the Agricultural Wages Board at the moment but I have power to bring them in at a later stage.  As the Deputy is aware, an inter-departmental committee are examining legislation relating to the wages and holidays of these workers and they have recommended the possibility of including both agricultural and non-agricultural workers <Col N="1292" /> when future holiday legislation is being considered.  The Deputy is right to voice concern that agricultural workers are not included in this legislation but the decisions have to be made elsewhere in the agricultural community. However, as soon as circumstances are opportune I shall make the necessary order to include them.</P>

This matter came to my notice only in the last few days.  When we think in terms of social justice a case can be made for these teachers, some of whom spend perhaps 20 hours a week at their job, practically a full teaching week. However, they do not get any holiday whatever, whether bank, church or annual holidays.  Would it be possible to provide social justice for these people in this measure?  I realise I might have referred to this matter earlier and I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to give me the information now but if he can tell me that the matter will be considered I shall be happy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 49 and 50, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Annual leave shall also be equivalent to three working weeks where the employee works for the employer at least 1400 hours (or 1300 hours if under 18 years of age) during the leave year unless it is a leave year during which he changes his employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was introduced following representations by the organised trade unions.  One of the main criticisms of the 1961 Act, which this Bill supercedes, was that under that Act an employee had to work 1,600 hours in his employment year to qualify for two weeks' holiday.  There was no provision for proportionate leave for employees working less than 1,600 hours.  To meet this defect the qualifying month of service formula was adopted in this Bill so that over the year the person would get proportionate annual leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions accepted that the new basis was an improvement on the 1961 legislation but they argued that another problem was created as a result of this change in that some workers might not have the necessary qualifying number of hours in each month &mdash;I am referring to the improved basis where we agreed on the month being the unit on which we worked out the proportion.  Nevertheless they would qualify for full leave entitlement on an annual basis if the provisions of the 1961 Act were to apply.  To give them the best of all worlds, to provide for the worker who would have got this benefit under the old Act and those who would benefit by getting a proportion under the new legislation but who would not have received anything under the old Act, I brought in this amendment.  A person who has the hours under the old legislation and those who have them on a proportionate <Col N="1294" /> basis under the new legislation will also get their entitlement.  If a man changes his employer he cannot claim his annual leave under the hours criterion of the old legislation or under the annual leave of the new measure.</P>

Three weeks annual leave adds up to something which an employer will have to consider before refusing to comply with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to me to be a slight inconsistency in paragraph 3 of the Schedule.  We had in the earlier part of the Bill a provision whereby the employer should consult with either the trade union or the worker about when the holidays were to be arranged and, I suppose, any change in that arrangement.  Here we have the statement that an employer &ldquo;may substitute...&rdquo;  Down a little further it states: &ldquo;by giving to the employee notice of the substitution <Col N="1305" /> not less than fourteen days before the Church holiday...&rdquo;  I feel that is a little bit onesided.  I seem to remember vaguely that in the 1961 Act there was something about mutual consent between the employer and the employee about substitution.  There are parts of the country where people by tradition have the Church holidays off and work what are known as the bank holidays.  I think that no change in that situation should be made without both sides mutually accepting it, but it appears to me that under this paragraph a change could be imposed against the unanimous wishes of the workers who would not want to change.  I should like to have the Minister's observations on that, particularly having regard to the fact that earlier in the Bill there is provision for consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The consultation is about annual leave, and while there is this obligation to notify a substitution, the Deputy is right to say that the same consultation does not appear to hold completely in the case of the public holiday section here.  I agree with the Deputy that this would appear inconsistent, at least formally, but I would tell him it is the same situation as that which we had under the 1961 measure.  There is no change in that.  There is the obligation on the employer to inform the employee a fortnight before.  However, if there is any abuse of this section, I would come back to the House quickly for any amendment of it that might be necessary.  I would bear this in mind also because, as I stated the last day, I am giving an extra public holiday and there will be some discussion as to the day on which that public holiday should fall.  I would not like to see such an extra holiday subject to bargaining or change.</P>

However, I can assure the Deputy that if there is any case of abuse in this area built up at all, even in a short period of operation of the legislation, I shall have no hesitation in coming back to add necessary amendments.</P>

I said that the element of mutuality in agreement of transferring substitution, if it holds in the area of any relief in general, should also hold in this particular area.  I shall look at it at a later stage.  Deputy Pattison brought up this point.  If action is shown to be necessary in this area, I shall not hesitate to take action.</P>

      <P>On the general principle of casual workers who have not fulfilled the 1,600 hours, which were the iron law requirement of previous legislation, one got nothing. Under the present legislation based on the month as a unit we are giving a proportionate leave entitlement to anybody who comes within the ambit of the legislation and part time teachers would, therefore, qualify.</P>
      <P>I do not think commission agents would come under a contract of service and there would be difficulty there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The teachers are in a very special category because a <Col N="1307" /> teachers is part time in so far as he has not got the number of hours off time which would entitle him to a whole-time appointment.  Teachers generally have a shorter working year.  A teacher doing 900 hours off times qualifies for a permanent whole time appointment, whereas someone with 750, 820 or 830 hours is employed in a temporary capacity but is working practically a full week and there is no provision at all for him in the matter of holidays.  He would not be working them anyway, but, unfortunately, for him they are holidays without pay, and I am wondering if it is the intention or if it is presumed that provision can be made, as I think it should be made, for people in that category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty of legislation covering people in dual employment.  This is where the difficulty resides.  This legislation represents an improvement in the existing situation.  It would be a mistake, however, to suggest that it provides a formula for all part time workers.  It does not.  A great deal can become comprised under the heading of dual employment.  A part time teacher would qualify if he had, for example, 120 hours per month.  A worker can have one week's sickness in a month working a three week 40-hour week; he would be proportionately entitled to such a unit base in order to get annual leave based on that.  This is the smallest unit on which someone can claim under this legislation, taking into account the rough criteria permitted in certain situations where someone does not fulfill these particular requirements.</P>
      <P>There is a problem in the case of the commission agent because his contract of service would not permit him to come under this legislation. There is a genuine difficulty there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission agent is my second concern.  A stronger case can be made for the teacher who has been working practically a full week over the years.  Off times he is paid by the hour and his hourly rate can be in excess of that of a whole time <Col N="1308" /> teacher.  There is no provision for holiday pay and I am hoping that under this legislation regard can be had for that type of teacher.</P>

I accept, of course, the Ceann Comhairle's ruling that the amendments to the proposals contained in sections 2 and 3 were not related to the actual sections.  I think, however, that the Ceann Comhairle will accept that during the Second Stage debate we indicated to the Minister for Justice that we would be bringing forward amendments to restructure, as it were, the whole area of auctioneering.  Having given that undertaking, we come before the House on Committee Stage and we are told that, despite our best efforts, our amendments are out of order.

I ask the Minister to support me in the very near future when, with your permission, Sir, and his co-operation, we reformulate these amendments into a Private Members' Bill, thus indicating the desire of this House to bring about a proper structure of auctioneering.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to hold up the progress of the Bill.  The proposals in section 2 and 3 are socially desirable. I expressed myself at considerable length in relation to them on the Second Stage.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;I would not put it as bluntly as to make a commitment to the only Opposition party in this House&mdash;to give us his support when we propose that these amendments be contained in a Private Member's Bill.  Time allowing and with your permission, Sir, we propose to introduce this Private Members' Bill during this Dáil session.</P>

      <P>This section is, in effect, the Bill. The other sections cover peripheral matters.  By passing this section into law&mdash;I think I am correct in saying this&mdash;we will bring our law into line with virtually every other country.  It was a cause of astonishment to those who came from other countries to find that the position was as it is at the moment.  There appeared to visitors to be no justification for the existing situation.  When I examined it there appeared to me to be no justification either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July I was very glad to receive a letter from the Irish Auctioneers' and Valuers' Institute in which they stated specifically that their institute had no objection to the proposal in section 2 to make the vendor liable for fees or to the increase in the bond in section 3.  The bond, of course, is a less important matter.  What is of consequence <Col N="1311" /> here is the fact that the man who employs an auctioneer should be liable in all equity and justice to pay him.  I could never see why it should be otherwise.</P>
    <P>Apart from a small number of sales which were sold under the hammer by public auction, in Dublin the vendor, as the employer of the auctioneer, always paid him.  It seemed reasonable that that should be so.  Therefore I was distressed to note the reaction of auctioneers elsewhere to this proposal. The strength of their objection was unjustified because I could not see anything, in principle, which was wrong with this section.  I see a great deal which is wrong, in principle, with the existing situation so far as sales outside Dublin are concerned.  I am glad the Irish Auctioneers' and Valuers' Institute, as the premier of the two auctioneers organisations which exist at the moment, have supported the principle of this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the 26th November, 1970, at a dinner of the Irish Auctioneers' Association, as it then was, I suggested that certain changes be made so far as fees to auctioneers were concerned.  I felt that that situation could not continue indefinitely.  There was a hostile public reception by auctioneers to my remarks on that occasion.  I was heartened by the fact that a great many auctioneers then and a week or two following approached me and told me that privately they agreed fully with me and that the situation would have to be changed but that publicly they would have to take up a different attitude.</P>
    <P>I suggested in the speech I made at that time that there were a number of alternative possibilities to the present situation, which I felt would have to be changed anyway.  One of the alternatives which I posed was that which is now contained in section 2.  Another of the alternatives which I posed was a sliding scale of fees, because, particularly in an inflationary situation, it is very difficult to justify a scale of fees which has the same scale for some very small sale such as £500 or £1,000 or £2,000 as it has for a very large sale such as £100,000, £150,000 <Col N="1312" /> or £200,000.  Sales of that sort are not uncommon nowadays.  It is indicative of the prosperity which exists among the agricultural community today, as a result of our accession to the EEC, that land and farms should have reached this value within the last 12 or 18 months.</P>
    <P>The imposition, I always felt, that was made on the man who was always the weaker of the two, as between vendor and purchaser, the imposition that was made on the purchaser, was an onerous one; because apart from having to pay 5 per cent of the fees to an auctioneer he also had to pay the stamp duty and legal costs.  In addition, if the sale was one of registered land, he had to pay land registry fees. These can be fairly substantial nowadays unfortunately and they are very much a factor in the cost of property.</P>
    <P>I felt that the situation had to be changed and I posed more than one alternative as a possible means of changing it.  I suggested at the time that the more satisfactory way to make that change would be for the auctioneers themselves voluntarily to do it.  I said I felt that if it were not done voluntarily, by agreement among themselves, the day would come when it would be done by legislation, possibly without the consent of all of them and possibly without the agreement of all of them.  Unfortunately over the period of somewhat over two years that intervened between the time I made that speech in November, 1970, and the beginning of this year nothing was done by auctioneers themselves in this regard.  I felt at the end of last year, December 1972, that ample opportunity had been given for the position to have been rectified and that opportunity appeared not to have been availed of.  I felt the time had come for legislation and I instructed that a Bill be drawn up on the lines of section 2 of this Bill.  That was drafted and approved by the former Government at my request in February or March of 1973 before we went out of office.  I am grateful to the present Minister that he has not let this Bill dally, that he has brought it forward. I believe that, like myself, he sees the social need for this Bill and that he is <Col N="1313" /> as anxious as I am to see it enacted as soon as is reasonably possible.  I deliberately excluded from the operations of this section, at the time that I was having it drafted, the sale of personal chattels.  Personal chattels include just about everything other than land or houses.  They include furniture and also livestock&mdash;cattle, horses and so on.  Quite clearly the profit margin from sales of chattels such as that is a good deal less for auctioneers than the very considerable profits that are to be derived from the sale of house property or land.  It is only fair that it should be possible for them to charge a purchaser fees in relation to these personal chattels as well as the vendor, which I understand is the position in regard to a certain amount of these chattels at any rate at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister I note added to the draft, as it was when I left it, a specific power to recover as a simple contract debt any payment of fees which was made in contravention of this section or without knowledge of this section.  I am glad he did that.  It may be debatable as to whether it was necessary to do it because I think it would have necessarily followed in any event, but in so far as it makes the position perfectly clear it is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody, even those who are directly involved, can have any legitimate complaint about the principle enshrined in this section, namely, that the man who employs somebody to do a job for him should pay that person.  The position we have had up to now is that somebody else, who did not employ the auctioneer, has for the most part had to pay him. That does not operate in any other country.  We are only bringing ourselves into line with the practice in other countries and indeed bringing ourselves into line with reality, with common sense and with fairness.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any worthwhile auctioneer will be affected by this Bill. If they would be, there would be no worthwhile auctioneers in the city of Dublin at the moment because most sales in the city of Dublin at present are affected by private treaty.  There <Col N="1314" /> may be occasional spectacular sales by public auction which get a good deal of publicity, but the great bulk of sales are by private auction.  There are many reputable, well-established auctioneers in the city of Dublin who make an excellent living from their profession.  They have not been affected by the principle which is enshrined in this Bill and which has applied to them for the most part for many years.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance in the House before the Summer Recess for figures relating to the number of auctioneers licences issued in each of the last five years.  Unfortunately I have mislaid the reply and I cannot quote precise figures, but there was a very significant increase over the past five years in the number of auctioneers' licences.  I do not think that very large increase, which came, I think, to possibly 600 or 700 over that period, was in the interests of <i>bona fide</i> auctioneers as a whole.  I think you had many people recently coming into the profession because they suddenly discovered that there was an enormous amount of money to be made out of one or two sales and that the outlay involved was very little indeed.  I believe this Bill, and this section in particular, will frighten off such people.  Those sort of people will not bother in future to take out licences; and those who have in the past few years taken out licences with that in mind are now giving them up because it will be no longer worth their while.</P>
    <P>In many cases the licence was taken out by somebody whose brother, father, cousin or friend was about to sell a substantial property, and because the vendor did not have to pay anything and the purchaser had to pay everything, it was well worth the time of somebody who felt he could very briefly turn his hand to auctioneering, to take out a licence to sell that one property.  The amount of money was considerable because substantial farms worth £100,000 are not uncommon in this country in EEC and inflationary conditions.  Therefore, the man who took out a licence for one auction could do so at a cost not exceeding £50, but his income <Col N="1315" /> from that one sale alone would be £5,000.  The amount of work was not great and the profit was £4,950, or, perhaps, a little less if the advertising had not been paid for by the vendor. It was an attractive proposition financially for anybody who thought he could get a sale to apply to the courts for a licence.  Of course, he is entitled to a licence as long as he is a person of good character, financially solvent and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bona fide,</i> established and reputable auctioneers will welcome a section such as this which seeks to put an end to that unsatisfactory situation. It was unsatisfactory, I would suggest, not just for the general public, but you had people taking out licences for one, two or three sales and it must have been unsatisfactory for <i>bona fide</i> auctioneers who were well established and who had heavy commitments, who operated offices with staffs and who had other overheads as well as having to pay wages and so on.  Therefore, if the tendency in the past few years of a very sharp increase in the number of licensed auctioneers were to turn about the other way in the next few years, as I venture to think it might as a result of this section, it would be very desirable not only from the point of view of the public generally but from the point of view of auctioneers who give a genuine service to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>There is not anything further I want to say in relation to this section except to end on this note.  Because I conceived the section, as it were, and because I made the speech I did in November, 1970, allegations have been made against me, publicly and privately&mdash;not so much against me personally as against the profession which the Minister and I and others here practice now and again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear so that the allegation that is distressingly frequently made will be nailed once and forever, that whether there is an auctioneer involved in a sale or not, the fees which a solicitor, or barrister for that matter if he is engaged in a title issue, gets will not be affected.  This Bill has no bearing whatever, good, bad or indifferent, on legal fees of solicitors or barristers. Speaking as a practising solicitor of some experience, I would say it is very much easier from the solicitor's viewpoint to have an auctioneer involved in a sale.  If there is not an auctioneer involved and if it is the kind of sale that needs a lot of time to negotiate, an awful lot of time is spent by the solicitor in that negotiation.  It is not a matter he wants to get involved in but if he does the negotiating, he does not get anything more than he would get if he were not involved in the negotiating. The ideal situation would be that an auctioneer would walk into a solicitor with his client and say to the solicitor: &ldquo;Would you draw up a contract?&rdquo; It is much easier and the remuneration, which is a fraction of 1 per cent for the most part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not concede it was an idea which was in any way exclusive to them.  I give them credit for it.  In this life it is quite simple to have an idea.  The important thing is to translate the idea into action.  As Deputy O'Malley in his useful contribution indicated, the need for this change first became public following his speech to the auctioneering profession in November, 1970.  Here we are in 1973 and it is this Government which have the privilege of bringing in this Bill, in other words, translating the good idea into action.  This is the significant point on this occasion.</P>
      <P>It would be relevant for me to comment on the point made by Deputy O'Malley in regard to the practice which this section seeks to change. The Deputy was quite correct when he said that the practice whereby the purchaser has to bear the fees of the auctioneer is unique to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might also have commented that the standard rate, while it is not the legal rate, of 5 per cent, with the exception of the rate payable in parts of France, is the highest rate in Europe.  This is a matter which is being examined by the National Prices Commission. The fixing of the actual rates is not a matter for this Bill, or for me at all.  It is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and is having his attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be very relevant because auctioneers will still seek to charge a flat 5 per cent.  I have no doubt that the prices commission will find that particular practice needs <Col N="1321" /> examining.  As Deputy O'Malley has indicated, the auctioneers themselves feel in some cases that this flat rate is not justified.  In other cases it might not be sufficient.  I hope that the Prices Commission in their investigation will balance one situation against the other and come up with a scale which is equitable to the profession and to the public.</P>
      <P>This is a matter for another Department. This Bill is only concerned with the shifting of liability.  On a point of correction, Deputy R. P. Burke said that I accepted in principle the setting up of a board.  I did not.  I want to make that clear.  We will go into that in more detail because, as I understand it, he will raise this question of a board at a later stage in this debate.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat the debate we had on Second Reading in the course of which I gave my reasons for arriving at a figure of £10,000.  This was not a logically satisfactory figure, but it was a fair compromise in the difficulty at that time.  Possibly the situation pertaining to the solicitors' profession would be the ideal one and would give absolute protection to the public.  It is proper to point out that in the last five years there have been no claims against bonds of auctioneers.  This is the highest tribute that can be paid to the profession.  I would like to pay that tribute publicly.  The auctioneers have indicated that they think £10,000 is, perhaps, small.  It is not at their suggestion that I have put in that figure.  It is the figure which I personally prefer.  I think it is adequate, but no more than that.  It represents a properly proportionate increase to the previous figure.  For that reason it was decided on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested that some Deputies had made their first contribution on Committee Stage.  Consequently, I did not address myself at any great length to section <Col N="1322" /> 2 on the basis that I did so at considerable length on Second Reading. I do not intend to detain the House long on section 3 except to make the point that there were suggestions in our talks with a particular auctioneering group that the amount of the bond of £10,000 was not sufficient. The suggestion of £20,000 arose but the Minister introduced what can be described as a fair compromise which is acceptable to us.  On the question of a bond relating to a particular auctioneer, Deputy Barrett and I suggested on Second Reading that in the context of a restructuring of the whole auctioneering trade or profession the idea of a common compensation fund might be considered.  We could certainly support that.</P>
      <P>We also said on Second Reading that in the past five years, as an indication of the integrity of auctioneers in general, no claim had been made against the compensation fund.  That is a fact which cannot be refuted. There seems to be a sophisticated sense of doubt about the auctioneering profession but if it can be said in this House that no claims have been made against an auctioneer's bond in the past five years, at least it indicates a sense of integrity pervading the profession. We unhesitatingly support section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to support section 3 which increases the bond to £10,000.  I am also glad that it was noted on both sides of the House that it was never necessary to make any claim on the old bond.  For the past five years there was no claim against the old bond for misappropriation by any auctioneer of a client's funds.  This is praiseworthy and represents a very satisfactory situation. I see no objection to the increase to £10,000 because if the past record is continued there will never be a claim.  It is also noteworthy that the premium charged by insurance companies for this bond is, by current insurance standards, quite a reasonable figure and is only reasonable on the basis of lack of claims.  It is well that this fact be noted, that the much maligned auctioneers and house <Col N="1323" /> agents have not in the past five years given cause for any client to claim against the bond.  My personal view is that the bond should be increased somewhat so as to try to control the number of people coming into the business.  The low insurance premium for people coming into the business is but one facet of the matter but if the figure was higher than £10,000 it would probably reduce the massive increase in numbers entering the business.</P>

      <P>Around that. Earlier, Deputy O'Malley spoke of the number of people coming into the auctioneering business.  It was suggested that this was due to the very high profits being made but I suggest the main reason is the widespread belief that provision would be introduced in legislation which would limit the number of licences issued.  It was thought that if an individual had a licence prior to this limitation, the licence, like pub licences, would become valuable.  I think that is the main reason for the increase in licences in the last few years rather than high profits which are being made only by a very small number of large firms in Dublin and not as a general rule by the auctioneer on the corner in the country selling the odd bit of hay or letting the odd few acres. He makes just enough to get a decent living without exorbitant profit.  We hear of large sales but they are the exception.  I can assure the House that to my knowledge the vast majority of auctioneers and house agents are just about making a living.  There are some who make substantially more, just as in every business or profession.</P>
      <P>I support section 3 increasing the bond to £10,000 and I would even recommend that the Minister should look at this again when he introduces a board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister's statement which is a compliment to the profession of auctioneers that no claim was made in the past five years.  However, as somebody associated with one of the peripheral areas of property transactions, I should like to point out that this might be an indication that we are dealing with a sellers' market because I have no distinct recollection that the situation was otherwise prior to five years ago when there was a recession.</P>
      <P>It is understandable if you look at the position of an estate agent or an auctioneer selling property.  He can sell it as the agent for the vendor.  He can take the deposit in two capacities. Depending on what the deal is like, if it is a private treaty he takes it either as an agent or a stakeholder.</P>
      <P>It is well to bear in mind&mdash;because the public are often confused about it &mdash; that if an auctioneer or agent takes the money as a stakeholder and there is a delay on the completion of the sale, the person who takes the money as a stakeholder has the benefit of the interest on that money.  When fees, commission and other matters related to the auctioneer's profession come up for discussion, that matter is somewhat relevant.  This situation has arisen before where there were disputes about who was entitled to a deposit.  Every lawyer dealing with a dispute about a sale has to consider the capacity in which the agent for the vendor holds the money.  This has often given rise to some problems and difficulties.</P>
      <P>There may be an unwritten guideline in the auctioneers' profession as to how the interest on the deposit held by the agent is dealt with.  I know that in certain cases the benefit of the interest has been retained as the auctioneer or estate agent is entitled to do, if he wants to, as the law now stands.  That might have some bearing when it comes to the matter of considering further the size of the bond in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a narrow one.  It was designed initially by the party opposite to do what section 2 provides, but the scope of that section has been slightly changed and the legal position with regard to money paid by the State has been clarified.  In addition, we have added a clause to increase the amount of the bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was brought before the House as one of some social urgency and it was introduced here on that narrow base.  An attempt was made to criticise the Bill during the Second Stage debates here and in the other House on the grounds that it was too narrow and that the auctioneering <Col N="1329" /> business required a general structuring. Some amendments were proposed to achieve this but they have been ruled out of order on the grounds that the Bill is narrowly based and that the amendments were not related to the scope of the Bill but went much further.</P>
    <P>I indicated my sympathy with the point of view which inspired these amendments and the views expressed during the debates in the other House and here.  From my own knowledge, from public representations and, more particularly, from the concern of the auctioneers themselves, I am aware of the possible need to restructure the profession.  I can readily understand the disappointment that here there appeared to be a legislative opportunity to provide this restructuring but that it has been let go by.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of a profession as complex as auctioneering is not a simple matter.  I would regretfully have to say to Deputy Andrews at this stage that a Private Bill in the terms of the amendments as proposed would not be acceptable to me.  He indicated that the resources of his party were brought into play to produce his amendments and will be used to produce the projected Private Members' Bill.  His ideas are well intentioned but, regrettably, they are shallow.  What he proposes is a restructuring of the profession but the vehicle proposed for this appears to be a lift from some other Bill, where there is a board regulating a profession. For example, I think if the Opticians Act was searched we would possibly find his amendments, word for word, in that Act.</P>
    <P>In a submission to me the auctioneering profession indicated that, having regard to the matters that require to be studied in relation to their profession and its restructuring, it will take at least a year before the necessary legislation can be prepared. They have made preliminary submissions to me and I look forward to discussions with them from time to time.  This is what I meant when I spoke on Second Stage and referred to the demands on the resources of <Col N="1330" /> the Department.  These demands are heavy and if they can be eased by outside assistance I should be glad of that assistance and, also, assistance from the party opposite.  I would expect that the assistance from the party opposite, with their experience in government, would be of depth and of such a type that they would take cognisance of all the technicalities that must be involved in the legislative changes needed to restructure the auctioneering profession.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the motivation behind Deputy Andrews' amendments and his proposed Private Members' Bill but I regret that at this stage I would have to indicate my intention to reject it on the grounds that it is much too shallow and does not meet the problems that exist.  The Bill before us is, as agreed by all sides, necessary to meet an urgent social need.  It was designed on a narrow base to meet that need, and to meet it quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gives us the kiss of death with his compliment that the amendments were well-intentioned and then he states that they were shallow.  I wish to reject that statement by the Minister. In our submission, this is no way to meet what we consider were a well-considered series of amendments, <i>bona fide</i> to this Bill.  We did not look up the Opticians Act and pick out at random these particular provisions. As I understand the Opticians Act, it does not refer to auctioneers or house agents.  However, the Act the Minister has read may be different from the one I have read.  Incidentally, when we are proposing amendments to Bills, is there any reason why we should not look for precedents in other Acts? What is so regrettably shallow about referring to previous legislation that we consider reaches the standards and requirements of the present age?  I think perhaps the Minister may reflect on his remarks with some regret.  I hope he did not mean them in the sense they sounded to us.  As I understand it, the Opticians Act does not refer to the establishment of an auctioneers' board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reasons we introduced the amendments that have been ruled out of order by the Chair is that, while we absolutely and unequivocably agree with the provisions of this Bill, particularly of section 2 whereby the burden is transferred from the purchaser to the vendor, it is fair to say that it would be odd for this party to disagree with something <Col N="1332" /> they prepared when in Government. The reason we did not introduce this Bill is that we are not in Government to do so.  Next year we may be in Government to do other matters we do not now have an opportunity of doing.  That does not in any way prevent us as a responsible Opposition from supporting it, particularly the socially desirable section 2.</P>

I welcome also the increase in the bonds and I would have wished for further increases.  However, this is taking account of only one small sector of a very large business which at this stage is vital to the business life of this country.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have given serious consideration to and agreed with the amendments put forward by the Opposition, amendments which, in our opinion, would have rationalised this whole sphere of our business life by the appointment of a board, as suggested in our amendments.</P>

      <P>Now I am stymied.  The Minister is being too narrow in his outlook in regard to the auctioneering profession.  It is essential that he would reconsider the decisions he has indicated he is prepared to make in regard to this profession. He might contemplate seriously the suggestions made during the debate and having done so, might alter his decisions.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Andrews in thanking those interested parties who have professed their enthusiasm for the Bill and who, by their assistance and guidance, have helped us to debate the Bill here.  These are the people who are anxious that the Minister would widen the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I wish to raise in regard to the Bill as a whole.  First, I would refer to the reason given by the Minister on the last occasion for bringing forward the Bill.  On that occasion the Minister said in reply to Deputy Barrett that the reason for the Bill was that 5 per cent fee charged by auctioneers was too high.  I cannot understand the Minister's thinking on this because he must be aware that most auctioneers must reduce the fee to the purchaser in respect of big sales.</P>
      <P>We endeavoured to have accepted an amendment that would provide for the setting up of a board that would fix the rates of commission.  No doubt members of the legal profession, be they senior or junior barristers, lay down the fees that are chargeable by them.  This Bill is setting up a horse-trading outfit because the larger firms of auctioneers who can afford to cut fees will squeeze out the smaller firms. Indeed, this situation has been reached already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission will deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. The findings of the NPC will now be <Col N="1335" /> irrelevant because of the transferring of the onus to the vendor rather than to the purchaser. The Minister gave the social need as another reason for introducing this Bill but there is a far greater social need at the moment. We have the situation where a householder who has purchased an alternative house and wishes to sell his existing premises cannot obtain a loan to purchase the other house. He will also have to pay the auctioneer who sells his existing house. Such a person is losing both ways.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not give any professional touch to the auctioneering profession in general. Had the Ceann Comhairle accepted the amendments which my party formulated, this Bill would have gone a long way to straightening out the profession and giving the auctioneers some standing. In recent times three Acts have been passed relating to the auctioneering profession but none of them gave the profession any sound footing. They were all small pieces of legislation which did nothing to improve the profession.</P>
      <P>Had these pieces of legislation been amalgamated with the amendments proposed by my party, we would not have the position whereby the bigger firms would walk over and take over the men who are giving the service. It would not surprise me if we had a number of claims arising in the next five years because of the passing of this measure and because the Ceann Comhairle ruled our amendments out of order.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Education)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of complimenting the Minister because I do not feel the present Minister needs to be complimented. His work, appearances and decisions speak for themselves. He has proved to be one of the finest Ministers for Education this State has ever had. Listening to Deputy Faulkner, the former Minister for Education, I was surprised to hear him say this Estimate showed no change from the Fianna Fáil policy on education.</P>
      <P>I represent the biggest Gaeltacht constituency in this country and in my travels there nobody, either English or Irish speaking, condemned the present policy of taking compulsion out of Irish in examinations. The Irish speaking people feel they are getting two for the price of one. They are getting two honours if they obtain an honour in Irish. This gives them a great incentive to learn more of their native language.</P>
      <P>I agree we must preserve our precious Irish speaking communities but the Irish people will not take something being shoved down their throats as the previous Government did in regard to the Irish language. I should like to compliment the Minister on this decision and I have no doubt that in the years ahead we will hear far more people speaking Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter that needs to be highlighted in regard to the Irish language is the deontas system. At present the children must pass the deontas if their parents are to get the bigger grant for housing. In the Gaeltacht areas we are encouraging the people to return from England. Scotland and the <Col N="1337" /> cities. In a lot of these cases one of the parents is a native speaker but the other cannot speak the language. I do not think this should debar them from the deontas and I suggest that the Minister, with the Minister for the Gaeltacht, look into this matter and see if the children can be given a graded deontas so that as their knowledge of Irish progresses they will be given some marks to qualify them for the extra grant for housing.</P>
    <P>On the question of languages I believe we must be realistic. The Minister for Education should stress in post-primary schools the necessity for girls in particular to learn German and French. I am sure I do not have to tell the other Members of the excellent opportunities that will exist in a few years for those who are fluent in English, German and French. Such great opportunities will exist not alone in Europe but in this country.</P>
    <P>In Donegal we are fortunate in that we have four community schools passed by the Minister for Education. This type of education whereby the community will take a greater interest in the running of the schools is very good. The Minister segregated two schools, one in the parish of Gweedore and the other in the parish of Dungloe. He segregated Gweedore because he fell that the languages there should be taught through Irish and in Dungloe he established a second school because English is the spoken language and he felt continental languages should be taught through English. In my view this was a very good decision. The people in Gweedore are anxious to continue learning through the medium of Irish while those in Dungloe prefer learning through English.</P>
    <P>There is a third town in Donegal which lends itself to the establishment of a community school or a community of schools, Ballyshannon. Deputy Blaney has already made this suggestion. Ballyshannon has four schools, a Protestant school, a brothers' school, a technical school and a convent school. To me the community school means that the community get involved in the running of the school and, secondly, which is just as important, that both</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> Protestant and Catholic children are taught together particularly in post-primary education. I have stated on many previous occasions that I felt that part of the trouble in Northern Ireland today is that the children there are sent to segregated schools. Ballyshannon, in particular, lends itself to being a pilot area for this base. Being so near the Border, we ought to show the people in Northern Ireland that we are going to bring all shades together to learn and to trust one another.</P>
    <P>The Minister certainly should consider the question of giving grants to private people to start kindergarten schools, that is, schools for children before the age of four. It is recognised that on the Continent this type of school is coming on at a fast rate. So many parents go out to work now that it is a good thing that small children should have a place in which they can not alone be taught but also play and in which the parents can be satisfied they are safe.</P>
    <P>The school transport policy is far too rigidly enforced, especially in rural Ireland, where we see half empty buses passing by children on the road. I cannot see the sense in this at all. The Minister should ensure that those buses are permitted to lift the children who have to walk to school. There is a particular problem in regard to post primary education in that, we have a Protestant community, as I mentioned already, in Ballyshannon. The position there is that under the present set-up whereby we have not got a community school in the area, they have to travel to Raphoe, which is about 50 miles away, four days of the week to school. These people are getting no free transport whatever. I do not like to use the word discrimination but discrimination is being used against these people. Again, I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to remedy this situation. I am not an educationalist by any means, but some of these matters are very important to the rural people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if we have enough teachers in this country, and I am told by some people who seem to know that we do not have enough teachers. However, there are many <Col N="1339" /> Irish people abroad, particularly in England and Scotland, who have taught in those countries maybe for four or five years. They are properly trained teachers, but when they come back to Ireland they have to start at the bottom of the incremental scale again. I understand that teachers who come back after teaching in parts of Africa can start at a satisfactory point on the scale. If that can be done in respect of Africa, I see no reason why it cannot be done in the case of England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>Education is a lifelong pursuit, and people in Ireland are only beginning to realise that if they have not had the proper education up to now there are adult education courses open to them in the technical schools at night. We should be able to give the people who missed their first chance of education a second chance. The aim of education, to me, is to learn to compete, to learn to know one another, to learn how to work, and to learn how to trust one another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this important post. He follows in succession to many illustrious Ministers, and I do hope that, given time in that Department, he will live up to the leadership and to the example that is there for him.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed, however, in reading the Minister's speech-and I hope he will remedy this in replying to the debate-to find that he pointed to no innovations; indeed, his speech is notable more for what it does not contain than for what it does contain. Many of the important projects he introduced in his Department since he became Minister were, to a certain extent, in the pipeline as a result of decisions by the previous Minister. Nevertheless, I feel that the Minister, Deputy Burke, has the ability to make a good job of education, provided he does not yield to political pressures which, unfortunately, he has done in regard to reopening Dún Chaoin school. I suppose we can pardon him for this and hope that in the future the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> Minister will be his own man and will not bow to political pressures.</P>
    <P>Education will certainly play a very important role in the progress and prosperity of this nation. Nowadays people have fewer working hours and more leisure time. Adult education, which is an important factor of our educational system, must play a greater role in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more use made of our national schools and I should like to see them made available in particular for this type of education. These schools belong to the parish and they should be parish centres of education and not just reserved for a certain section of the community from 9.30 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day. I hope the Minister will ensure that these facilities are in future made available to the people.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months we have seen new guidelines introduced. I understand these are more or less ideas put forward by the Secretary of the Department last summer. We must not approach changes in education just for the sake of change. Where vocational education is concerned, in the past this was regarded as the poor relation of our educational system. The system has proved itself but I think an attempt is being made to downgrade it again. Control was at local level and it was exercised by the teachers and local representatives sitting together in committee. The system served the country well since its introduction in 1930. I should like to take this opportunity to express my admiration of vocational teachers who down through the years have produced pupils of the very highest calibre, well fitted for their roles in industry or agriculture.</P>
    <P>What are our educational problems today? What can we do to solve them? What kind of education does the youth of today need? What are the factors which should determine our educational policy? What say should the teachers have in shaping the policy of the future? Our educational system remains static for almost 40 years. Not until the 1960s was an attempt made to update it. But not enough is being done and our educational <Col N="1341" /> system is full of uncertainties. Whither are we going and how will we get there?</P>
    <P>The primary system of education had become stagnant and the new curriculum has put a certain amount of life into it. It should be constantly reviewed by experts from all branches of education. A very large percentage of our children finish formal schooling at 16 years of age-in other words, at the primary stage. One great defect is the fact that schooling has become synonomous with education. Nothing could be further from the truth. Formal education is for youth. Education <i>par se</i> is for life. Remembering this, there could be a certain compulsion towards change but, as I have already warned, change for the sake of change can be disastrous.</P>
    <P>Our vocational education system has served the country well since 1930. It did not achieve all that it set out to achieve but very careful consideration should be given before it is radically changed. Daily we are becoming more industrialised and a dynamic system of vocational education is essential if we are to meet the changing pattern in our lives. Changes must come. None of us doubts that. A system which does not or cannot change will certainly stagnate. On the other hand, too hasty changes will not succeed. Change must come about by a gradual process.</P>
    <P>The Vocational Education Act is under review and this is the time for careful scrutiny of this particular system of education, bearing in mind all the time our transition to a more industrialised state to which our vocational system must be carefully geared. What is suitable in other countries may not necessarily suit our country and, therefore, an independent study must be made on the spot. This is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal over the last few years about comprehensive schools. These schools may not be as comprehensive as that word implies. Subjects like music, art, physical education, culture and civics have yet to be introduced. These subjects must play an important part in our educational system. Examinations are a formidable <Col N="1342" /> hurdle for our young people. How can a student be expected to give in a three hour examination that which he has taken over a three or four year course? The grading system initiated some years ago is in operation and has led to some improvement in the system. There must be an end to this formal examination type assessment. Rather the assessment should be made and reported all through the child's years at school. In order to do this there will have to be more cohesion between the different branches of our educational system. Only in this way can we compete and have a fair assessment made.</P>
    <P>Our educational system must cherish all the children equally-slow learners and retarded children as well as our normal school goers. Voluntary organisations have played and in future will play a very big part in our educational system. More teachers and experts in the various fields of education are necessary in these organisations.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a well deserved tribute to Macra na Tuaithe. This organisation caters for the needs of our teenage children. It has many achievements lo its credit since its inception 20 years ago. I am glad the Minister and the Department have seen fit to continue the grant to this organisation which is vitally needed by it to continue its work for the education, on a voluntary basis, of our youth. I should also like to pay tribute to the many industrial firms who have, from time to time, sponsored competitions under the auspices of this organisation. I would ask the Minister to give deeper study and consideration to this.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a mention of the teaching of the Irish language in our schools. Language is a means of communication. Emphasis should be put on the oral aspect of Irish. The same can be said for the teaching of all languages. If a person cannot communicate in a language, he has wasted his time learning it. Modern visual aids are very helpful when properly used in the schools, but in untrained hands they become more of a hindrance than a help. The use of words is very important. At one stage it was suggested that &ldquo;An Nuacht&rdquo; on RTE should be reported fully in the following day's <Col N="1343" /> newspapers because these bulletins contained up to the minute words which would be very valuable in Irish language classes, more particularly in post-primary and adult education.</P>
    <P>Irish text books are very hard to obtain. The Minister should look into this.</P>
    <P>Career guidance is a very important aspect of our educational system. Not enough is being done by the Department of Education or any other public body in this sphere. This is left to a few of the more responsibly-minded individuals in our community. To prevent the ever-increasing danger of lack of job satisfaction, it is essential that the Department take a long hard look at career guidance and formulate a specific division to deal with it. Every county should have full time career guidance experts in their schools. Career guidance has been approached in a haphazard way for far too long. The Department should run courses for career guidance officers. On a voluntary basis perhaps more could be done by way of career guidance. Past pupils unions could play a useful role in helping present pupils of their old schools and colleges find their proper role and purpose in life.  Some unions are already researching this difficult field.</P>
    <P>When dealing with education one likes to speak on the part of the educational system with which one is familiar. Being a member of a vocational education committee, I should like to express some thoughts as to how the vocational system is operating at present. There is a certain discontent in regard to the slow progress that is being made towards the rationalisation of post-primary education in Limerick.  Although the rationalisation proposals which were put to the various bodies and the schools in the county in 1967 have to a certain extent the support of the County Limerick Vocational Education Committee, it is most disappointing that greater progress has not been made towards rationalisation of the post-primary system in the county. In 1967 and onwards to 1969 <Col N="1344" /> there seemed to be a great amount of activity. Hopes and expectations were high. However, the pace over the past couple of years has slackened noticeably and no meeting, no discussion and no dialogue has taken place since April, 1970.</P>
    <P>Although the situation with regard to the supply of vocational teachers has improved very much in the past couple of years, there is still a serious shortage in certain disciplines, notably in the practical disciplines and more particularly in typing and shorthand. Ordinary B.Comms. are not in short supply but the vast majority of those are not proficient in the practical aspects of shorthand and typing. The result is that many vocational pupils are denied instruction in those important subjects until the teacher becomes more proficient.</P>
    <P>This unsatisfactory state of affairs has obtained for far too long. Down through the years it has been the subject of resolutions at the IVTA Congress year after year, but it is still unresolved. I know the Department organise summer courses in shorthand and typing but those short courses, to my mind, are not the complete answer since one year is a long time in the formal education of an adult pupil and this is the minimum period in which a B.Comm. without shorthand and typing could hope to qualify in those subjects. I offer a suggestion, although perhaps it may have been made before. I suggest that a complete answer to this thorny question might be for the Department to train their own teachers in those subjects. This has been impressed upon me. This could be done on the same lines as woodwork teachers, metalwork teachers and indeed rural science teachers are trained.</P>
    <P>Here I am happy to have the opportunity to compliment the Department on the excellent quality of the Department-trained teachers. I know more of the rural science teachers, whose training period is three years in Cork, than others. Those teachers are first class. An important point I have frequently heard discussed is the unjustified expectation that a university graduate can walk straight from the college campus <Col N="1345" /> into a school and efficiently teach the subjects in which he has qualified. This is expecting too much. Studying a subject is one thing and teaching it is another. I do not accept that the short courses which the Department run are sufficient for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I have every respect for the universities but perhaps the function of training teachers lies elsewhere. It in no way suggests a lessening of my great respect for university graduates when I say that once they obtain a degree they are not, apart from the gifted few, yet ready to stand before a teenage class of average and below average pupils. I am a farmer and I would be last to admit that a fresh Bachelor of Agricultural Science, perhaps with a city background, would automatically be a good farmer. His chances of becoming one are high but he would need considerable practical experience and training.</P>
    <P>My recommendation in regard to university graduates in maths, languages <i>et cetera</i> is that the Department should organise a full year's training course for them in the skills of teaching and pay them the minimum teacher's salary during this training period. This would overcome the present difficulty. The future of our country lies, to a large extent, in the hands of our teachers and our teachers must be good.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's attention a matter which may not seem to be unusual but becomes unusual when it confronts a vocational education committee at a certain time. At the end of September, the beginning of the school year, one of our senior woodwork teachers died, but the committee were not allowed to fill the vacancy or to advertise for a replacement. I concede that the Department had a point in refusing permission to advertise in this instance because it would probably have meant robbing another committee of a teacher at a crucial time of the year when schools are getting under way.</P>
    <P>However, it could be asked is not this rather cutting the situation finely. Have the Department tailored supply and demand to such a nicety? I wonder can such fine <Col N="1346" /> tailoring be done, or is it right to attempt to do things in this way ? Surely extra teachers should be trained and recruited to meet such unforeseen circumstances. The extra few over and above the foreseen demand would find plenty to do looking after evening courses or relieving many of the existing woodwork teachers of heavy burdens.</P>
    <P>At any rate, the pupils of this centre are now suffering a serious check in woodwork, drawing and other such subjects because the entire timetable has had to undergo major revision and adjustment. I ask the Minister to bear this in mind particularly when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>I now come to another problem facing vocational education. It is the question of school gardens. There was a time when the vocational school garden played a vital role in rural areas. Perhaps school gardens are still meant to play such a role, but the emphasis there seems to have diminished. This is a great pity, a great loss to vocational education and to the pupils. In my view, there are three main reasons for this regrettable decline: one, over-emphasis on academic subjects following the introduction of the intermediate and leaving certificates to the curricula of vocational schools; two, increasing pressures on rural science teachers; and three, the greatest offender of all, the encroachment of prefabricated rooms on school gardens.</P>
    <P>All I can say in regard to No. I is that if the introduction of the intermediate and leaving certificates has led to a diminishing interest in practical subjects in vocational schools, including rural science, these certificates and their importance have been misunderstood in certain areas. In regard to No. 2, I should like to point out that many of our rural science teachers are headmasters or assistant principals or hold other posts of responsibility and have heavy burdens in regard to administrative as well as teaching duties. They, therefore, cannot devote as much time as formerly to practical gardening classes and other outdoor experiments. They could, of course, <Col N="1347" /> be relieved of some of their responsibilities, thus giving them more time for gardening activities, by relaxing the teacher-pupil ratio imposed by the Department, For those reasons I ask the Minister seriously to consider my final recommendation.</P>
    <P>I come now to point No. 3. The encroachment of prefabs is a most serious development. These structures have been condemned by nearly all educational interests, not least by the teachers. They may be acceptable as a temporary relief, but some of them have been there for a long time and there is no sign of that source drying up. I am particularly disturbed that in a number of our schools in County Limerick under the authority of the vocational committee, prefabricated classrooms have eaten drastically into school surroundings with the result that some school grounds, once a joy to behold, now look like army camps. I do not want this to be taken as a piece of preaching, but many of the prefabs I have seen are unattractive. Surely they could be made brighter and more acceptable.</P>
    <P>This encroachment on school gardens is a great if not the greatest drawback. Many of our best farmers, many of our industrial workers and many of our best teachers got their basic scientific training and their inspiration to high achievement in the well managed and beautiful gardens of our rural vocational schools and it would be a pity if this trend is allowed to continue. The sooner it can be corrected, the sooner prefabs are removed, the sooner we can regain lost ground in this vital sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, as a salute to rural science and to our vocational schools, I wish to quote from the first document on economic development which is to my mind one of the most important documents to hit the Irish scene and which has had such a leading role in generating economic progress. At page 112 it is stated :</P>
    <P>It is in vocational education there are best prospects for advance in agricultural education</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to page of the document and the quote is :</P>
    <P>If a concerted drive were made <Col N="1348" /> over the next five years to spread agricultural education among the rural population by improving the teaching of rural science in vocational schools the effect on agricultural productivity could be very significant.  Its secondary effects would reach even further afield in preparing the way for the shaping of primary and secondary education on an agricultural basis and in creating the much-desired love of the land which would discourage migration.</P>
    <P>I said a.t the beginning that I was happy to have an opportunity of expressing my views. I would ask the Minister to look as soon as possible into the question of post-primary education in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>That report was made in 1967. Many of the figures in it are now out of date. These figures should be updated. The present position should he studied. Post-primary education in County Limerick should be examined. After such examination negotiations should take place between the teachers, the school authorities, the vocational committees, the parents and all others interested in promoting education.</P>
    <P>I am happy lo have had an opportunity of expressing these views. I hope that the Minister and his Department will find food for thought in them.</P>

    <P>In congratulating the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary on the very important positions they hold in this Government I would also like to join with other speakers in congratulating the Minister's immediate predecessor and the other holders of office in the recent past. They all left a mark on the Department. Many changes were made. There has been much progress in education, particularly in the last decade. <Col N="1349" /> I happen to know more about primary teaching than I do about the other branches of education, although I have connections with vocational education having been a member and present chairman of the county vocational education committee. I spent some time on the governing body of Galway University. I have now retired from the active field of primary education, but I spent 37 years teaching, although on account of my involvement in politics my teaching years were interrupted. I have always been in touch with primary teaching. My mother was a teacher and I have children who also teach. I envy the present day teachers when I compare their conditions with those of the teachers who are now pensioned. They worked under great hardship and suffered trials and tribulations.</P>
    <P>I hope that full parity of pension will be given to pensioned teachers. It is not because I have joined their ranks that I am speaking on their behalf. Speaking on this Estimate on many occasions I have advocated their cause. On 1st October they got a. rise in their pensions. Others similarly situated got pension pay retrospective to 1st April or perhaps earlier. These people who have done so much for education should not be treated in this manner. I hope that when serving teachers get a pay rise the pensioned teachers will also benefit. Parity should be fully implemented.</P>
    <P>I have some advice for the young teachers. They should become members of the INTO. This organisation, together with the Minister concerned and the Department, have played a big part in the development of education. They have done a good job for their own members. Young teachers should also join the VHI scheme. Knowing they are secure in their positions and that they have provided against ill-health they will be able to devote their whole attention to teaching.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken on the amalgamation of schools and the closing down of small schools. I do not know how anybody can teach in a one-teacher school. I taught in a two-teacher school. It is very difficult <Col N="1350" /> to do. The principal teacher may teach children from third class to sixth class. He may have 40 children in his classes. At the weekend he could have 40 Irish compositions, 40 English compositions and 40 exercises in mathematics to correct. I personally favour amalgamation. I feel that the Minister may not be able to get young teachers to teach in small schools. They prefer to have one class each. I advise the Minister not to amalgamate schools hastily. There may be people who love small schools and who want to hold on to them. They should not be shut down hastily. They should be closed down only after consultation with the officials, the manager and the parents. I think that policy is now being promulgated, and I hope it will be the policy that there will be no forced closings. Eventually, I think amalgamations will have to come and we will have central schools and better education, better provision and full programmes in every parish. That is the thinking of the former Minister and, I believe, of the present Minister. I hope it will continue this way and that it will be for the better education of all our children.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to transport. Everybody knew that when the transport system was first introduced inevitably there would be snags. It operated for rural primary schools long before it was introduced for the post primary schools. Certain conditions and regulations were laid down at that time. If children were aged between four and ten they had to reside two miles or more from the national school and if they were aged between ten and the school leaving age of 14 or 15 they had to reside three miles or more away to qualify. When the post-primary transport system came in, it was run on a different basis. Catchment areas were drawn up and pupils within the area were brought by bus to the secondary school.</P>
    <P>I have a case in mind which may now have been remedied-1 brought it to the notice of the previous Minister-where in a national school two or three children went by bus because they were under ten; one or two of their older brothers or sisters because <Col N="1351" />  they were over ten and because the school was not over three miles away -it was two-and-a-half miles or two-and three-quarter miles distant-had to walk. There were one or two older brothers or sisters and these went by bus to the secondary school. That must be a very frustrating situation for the parents. It was a silly arrangement. When one of the younger children reached the age of ten he or she had to walk. I know that later such children were allowed on, if there was room on the bus, as fare-paying passengers. I think that if the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary sat down with a few reasonable officials from the Department and from CIE they would be able to untie the knots in this transport system which is now long enough operating so as to obviate situations such as I have outlined with some of the children going on the bus, some walking and still others going on the bus to secondary school and the mother having to have meals at different times for them.</P>
    <P>All this could be solved with a little commonsense if the people concerned would consult and make one set of rules covering all cases and so avoid the present frustration, particularly for mothers. I hope the transport problem will be resolved. Improvements have been made in the system and people formerly ineligible are allowed to travel on the bus if they pay something which I think is not too high. If there is one child, I think it is £1.50 and £1 each if there are two children, per term. That is much easier than if the father has to bring two of them bv car to school while two or three others can go by bus.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows a good deal about vocational education. If the officials in his Department read the minutes coming every month from Galway Vocational Educational Committee they will see that we have been waiting for replies for a very long time as to what will be done about certain schools. I think we have prefabs in every school in our county. We had consultations about having community schools and just when we <Col N="1352" /> thought we were getting one the policy was reversed and we found the secondary schools being allowed to proceed on their own while we are left in the cold. We had settled for a community school in Athenry; that is now abandoned. The same thing happened in Loughrea where we had purchased an 11-acre site beside the river and near the convent and the Brothers' schools. We thought we would have a community school there. Now we are told that some official of the Department has advised, according to our CEO-this is not in writing &mdash; that we should sell the site and bi&rdquo; another site near the vocational school so that we can expand there and get rid of the prefabs.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to buy a site in Ballinasloe for a number of years. We could not get it by agreement. It is beside a vocational school and all the attached prefabs. We asked the Department to let us have a compulsory purchase order covering this site but we have had no answer. We are prepared to buy the site and build the school if we get funds but we have had no reply.</P>
    <P>The same applies to Tuam where we also have prefabs. We want to buy a site there and we are negotiating for one. The secondary schools there have secured a site. The racecourse was sold recently to a developer but sites were given to the two secondary schools that are beside it. The vocational school is just across the road, We hope to get a site there and that when we send our proposals to the Department we shall not be held up again.  Otherwise, the secondary schools will be allowed to develop and vocational education will be left as the cinderella of education in County Galway.</P>
    <P>If a shortage of money is the cause of this situation we would be glad if the Minister would tell us so and not have us sending up proposals month after month and having no reply when the next meeting comes round and the same story being repeated month after month. We were to have three community schools. We have one in operation, which as the Minister knows is very <Col N="1353" /> successful. We were to have another in Clifden: the board of management was appointed. In the county vocational committee we opened the tenders. We accepted the lowest tender and we handed over all our work to the new board of management to sign the contract. Then we were told by the Department that the vocational committee should sign the contract and build the school. We are signing the contract with the contractors and later on, I suppose, we will have to hand it over although we have already appointed the board of management for Clifden school.</P>
    <P>I should like to sound a note of warning to the Minister and his officials about the position of these community schools. In the one we have in operation our CEO is the secretary. There are two members of our committee on the board of management. They have looked for the deed of trust which, to my mind, is a very important document. The school has been in operation for a year and, so far as I know, as the chairman of the Galway vocational committee, no deed of trust has yet been enacted for the only community school we have in County Galway.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed as a national teacher, the first thing I had to do was to sign an agreement with the manager of the school. We do the same with all our vocational teachers. We have them insured. They know where they stand if any accident happens. I should like to know what is the position now. Unless their own organisation have them covered, I do not know what is the position of the teachers in these community schools if the deed of trust has not come down to the other schools throughout the country as it has not come down to the only one we have in operation. People are very uneasy. The members of our board of management sent letters and requests to the Department for the deed of trust so that they could put their house in order. I would ask the Minister to look into this matter for the benefit of the Department, the teachers and the pupils. If an accident occurs in the science room, or if a pupil is injured in the playground, somebody will be <Col N="1354" /> in considerable trouble unless this position is straightened out.</P>
    <P>I join with others who have spoken about the Irish language, our culture and our history, in hoping that there will be no diminution of any of them by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary. The compulsory aspect is supposed to be taken away from Irish and two honours are credited in the leaving certificate for the purpose of a grant to the university only I believe. Whether that will further the use of the language I do not know. I had three of my own family in the Gaeltacht in an Irish college and I gather from some of the figures I saw that the numbers were not as high last summer as they were in previous years in our Irish colleges in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I hope also that there will be no watering down on the teaching of Irish history. I do not see why we should be ashamed of our past. We should be proud of our ancient heritage. I was always proud to teach the pupils under my care the trials and tribulations our forefathers had to endure for faith and fatherland. It is a good lesson for them. They should be proud of their past and they should hand it down to their successors. I hope that tradition will be kept. The famine, the Land League, the Gaelic League, the Young Ireland movement, Parnell, the founding of the Gaelic Athletic Association, Sinn Féin down to 1916, are all facts and should be taught to the pupils in our national schools and handed on to their successors. It would also be a good exercise in civics.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most important Estimates we have. I cannot recall exactly the definition of education which was given in de la Salle by the professor of education. He is dead now, God rest him. His name was Brother Stephen. He was a most peculiar man. He was fairly old when he was teaching us in 1933-35. He burned his notes every year and rewrote them. He was up to date with every innovation. So far as I can. recall it, his definition of education was to develop all the faculties of the mind and the body and the soul to the <Col N="1355" /> full potential of the pupil so that the full man could use all these faculties to the full for the greater honour and glory of the Creator.  That is a precis of his idea of what education should be.</P>
    <P>He impressed upon the student teachers the importance of the work they were about to undertake.  He said that the little child was like plasticine in their hands to be moulded and brought to his full perfection in mind and body and soul.  The man in the gospel who had five talents was expected by the Lord to have five more.  The man who had only two was expected to have two more.  The unfortunate person who got only one buried it in the sand.  Whether the child has five talents, or two talents, or is mediocre, or poor, or even physically or mentally handicapped, even if he has only half a talent or one quarter of a talent, the teacher should develop whatever potential he has to make him a better person and a better citizen.  No matter what we do, and no matter what is said on this Estimate the basics will still remain in education.  We can have all the aids and all the modern conditions and the new curricula.  The Minister can provide all these but we still have the parent and the child and the teacher who is <i>in loco parentis,</i> in place of the parent, for the time being and at the top the Minister and his officials.  He is the presiding officer over them all. They are all working together in harmony for the common good of the children, the future citizens.  I wish the Minister and his Department well in that role.  As I said at the outset, guím rath Dé agus beannacht orthu go léir agus ar gach duine atá ag cabhrú leis sa cheist thábhachtach seo &mdash;oideachas d'aos óg na hÉireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of free bus travel for school children arises on this Estimate and was the subject of questions in the House a week ago. CIE did a tremendous job in getting the scheme off the ground.  Certainly the original scheme needed some amendment and probably it still needs alteration but experience alone will teach us where the changes should be <Col N="1356" /> made.  With the closing of the single-and two-teacher schools and the introduction of larger centres which give the children a better chance of a fuller education, the transport scheme must be constantly altered to meet changing circumstances.  I hope the Minister and his staff will keep a close eye on this.</P>
      <P>When I was a backbencher and my party were in office I said I had always thought the scheme discriminated against parents and children in the Dublin city area.  There is considerable difference between three miles in an urban area and the same distance in a country area.  The Minister may point out that any three miles is the same when one has to walk it, but with the high density of traffic in the city areas, with the hard pavements and the complexity of traffic lights and intersections, a child who has to walk three miles in such conditions is taking a very serious risk, especially when we have the problem of failure of the electricity supply.  When the children go to school it is pitch dark.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his assistance in one case I sent to him.  I am referring to an instance where two girls in Ballyfermot who wanted to attend a certain course had to cross the city.  It was a vocational course but the vocational school at Ballyfermot did not have it on its curriculum.  After some letters to the Minister, eventually he informed me that free travel passes had been issued. I should like to thank him for that but I think this should be available to people as of right.  Perhaps this particular case would not have come to his attention or to the attention of senior officials had I not written to him about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special person or group of people should be available in the Department to examine all these cases.  I have met many parents, not only during the election campaigns but at places where I am available to meet constituents at the weekend, and there is a general feeling among these people that they are being discriminated against.  They also had this impression during the previous <Col N="1357" /> administration when there were very few Dublin Deputies in the Government. Now that there is a majority of Dublin Deputies in the Government, perhaps the matter might be considered again in an effort to demonstrate to the parents that there is no discrimination.  I have tried to explain this to them on several occasions but they have this conviction and there was nothing I could do to alleviate their worries in regard to this matter.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at the free bus scheme as it applies to urban areas, and particularly Dublin city.</P>
    <P>We should be grateful for the prefabricated school buildings because otherwise we would have outdoor classes in the greater Dublin area.  It may be contrary to the policy of all parties to have too great an expansion in the greater Dublin city area.  But whatever may be national policy regarding decentralisation, it is a physical fact that Dublin city and county with Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown are growing at a faster rate than ever before.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary in the Office of Public Works, I found it was not the Department of Education but the Office of Public Works who were blamed for the slow provision of schools, particularly on the north side of the city.  Each year I succeeded in getting a Supplementary Estimate when it reached the point where I had to call a halt in sanctioning the contracts. For three years I had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to keep the school programme at the level planned by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty here in that the Minister may sanction the erection of a school but there is little use in this unless the money is in the Office of Public Works.  When I left office the provision made for national schools was £5,100,000.  The Minister and I were never able to reconcile the £100,000 but that was the figure I recollect.  I asked for £5 million and I gather the Minister for Education managed to get the extra £100,000 when he was talking at Government level.  I realise that was not the absolutely final figure but I felt quite <Col N="1358" /> confident it would be made available to us.</P>
    <P>The provision of prefabricated accommodation is a good temporary solution but a problem I experienced was that when a permanent school was erected the prefabricated schools had to be transferred elsewhere.  At that time I found it cost nearly as much to transfer a previously erected prefabricated building as it did to buy a new building.  I know that experimentation and consultation were going on between technical officers in the Office of Public Works and the various system-building contractors.  I should like to hear from the Minister if this problem has been overcome, to know if prefabricated classrooms can be erected and subsequently transferred to another site at an economic price.</P>
    <P>When members of religious orders are given sanction for certain expansion works to their schools, they are told the work may be done in three stages.</P>

      <P>When the present Government took office they promised at the outset that during their term of office they would be a Government of consultation and negotiation. However, they are now faced with what is the gravest test of their creditability since assuming office.  At present the country is bedevilled by strikes for which the Government must take the blame.  During the past few weeks there have been instances of certain Ministers being absent from their offices at times of vital importance.  On this occasion it appears that we are suffering from inactivity on the part of the Ministers for Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce.  It is in these circumstances that you, Sir, saw fit to allow this debate to take place and I understand that this is the first occasion since 1947 that Standing Order No. 29 has been invoked.</P>
      <P>In common with most people in the country we believe that the Government have displayed a serious lack of any sense of urgency in regard to the present ESB crisis.  The situation has been allowed simmer for ten days or more while the Government took no steps to deal with it, at least, not until today when what seems to be involved is a curbing of some types of advertising, such as neon lighting in shops and other places.  Our whole economy is being threatened by this dispute and the lives of all our people have been affected by it.  The elderly have been left in a state of dire distress.  Some serious accidents have been reported, among them one which proved fatal. This involved an elderly lady who fell downstairs at her home in this city as a result of a sudden power cut.  The sick and the infirm, too, have been affected seriously by this strike.  Many of them are left in a state of complete helplessness.  Many sick persons are affected, too, because they are in their own homes at this time as a result of the junior doctors' dispute in the hospitals.  Indeed, many inpatients and out-patients of hospitals are being affected gravely by that dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> The dispute we are discussing here is of the gravest concern to the nation.  The crisis is one both for workers and employers alike.  I understand that there have been instances today of up to 1,000 workers being laid off because of power cuts.  A very serious crisis has been created not only in regard to industry but also in relation to agriculture which is now totally dependent on electricity because of such modern techniques as milking machines, <i>et cetera.</i> Therefore, productivity at all levels of our economy is being disrupted seriously.</P>
    <P>If the situation is not curbed very quickly it will lead to complete chaos throughout the country.  There will be further redundancies of workers in both rural and urban areas as well as further hardships for all our people. There is an air of complete frustration among the people because they know there is nothing they can do to help solve the problem.  The Country is being held to ransom by a small number of workers.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong when a situation like this can occur in a State body which has the monopoly of power and lighting for the entire country; but whatever is wrong should be rectified on this occasion in an effort to avoid a recurrence of a crisis such as we are now experiencing. From time to time there have been reports regarding the ESB.  There was the Fogarty Report, the Fletcher Report and others, but I do not believe that all the recommendations of these various reports have been implemented by the ESB, particularly those regarding management-employee relations.</P>
    <P>We should direct our attention very seriously to a semi-State body which, down through the years, has allowed crises of this type to develop.  I might say here that 1972 was a particularly good year in the ESB in so far as industrial relations were concerned. We all know that the 1960's were very bad in this regard, but at least it can be said that the Governments of those days took drastic action in an attempt to curb the trend that was developing increasingly within the ESB although <Col N="1361" /> there were many people who did not agree with those tactics.  However, that definite action had the desired effect at the time in so far as it curbed the industrial strife with which the country was then bedevilled.</P>
    <P>This Government must take definite action in regard to the present situation before it develops into a far more serious crisis which could lead to loss of life and which would be very damaging to our exports, <i>et cetera</i> especially now that we are in such a competitive market as the EEC.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister responsible to inquire in depth into the whole matter of management-employee relationships within this semi-State body.  The people are looking for this and are absolutely disgusted with the frequency of these strikes in the lifetime of this semi-State body.</P>
    <P>Today we had some curtailment of electricity throughout the country.  In regard to advertising signs some hurried measures were embarked on in an effort to conserve power.  The necessity for curtailment should have been highlighted in a better manner through the media.  Had this been done I believe there would have been more co-operation from the people.  However, during the day I saw the offices of the Department of Industry and Commerce, Transport and Power and Agriculture and Fisheries lighted to the full at a time when there was no necessity for it.  While this may not appear to be important to some people, it is an example of how we could conserve power better than it has been done during the day.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Government to look into these matters concerning their own buildings, buildings for which they are responsible, and to ensure that there is no unnecessary use of current while the present crisis lasts. The proposed methods of conserving power and current should be stressed more seriously and brought home to the public in a more definite way than has been done so far.  They could be embarked on in a more systematic way so that the people could be forewarned about sudden switch-offs and would not be left in a sudden state of <Col N="1362" /> frustration as has happened during the present series of cuts.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown a complete lack of any sense of urgency for the last ten to 14 days while this crisis was simmering in the ESB.  I understand that some consultation is taking place tomorrow, but something could have been done before it reached the present proportions.  It should have been obvious to anybody that unless something was done a serious situation would have arisen.  It should also be remembered that we are in what is known as &ldquo;the valley&rdquo; in regard to the use of current and that some maintenance is taking place within the ESB. Some people believe this is unnecessary, but whether it is or not the Minister should clarify this point in the interests of the public and the ESB.  There has been a lot of criticism about the overhauling that is at present in operation in the ESB and whether it was necessary or not should be spelled out clearly by the Minister. The Minister for Transport and Power should take a hard look at the entire structure of the ESB which has a complete monopoly over our lives with regard to power and to ensure that whatever fault besets this semi-State body will be eliminated thereby preventing any further recurrence of power cuts.</P>
    <P>It is time this was done.  In our time in office we took very unpopular measures but they had the desired effect at the time of curbing this type of strife.  It is up to the present Government to take whatever measures are necessary, popular or unpopular, to deal with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding Deputy Barrett's motion I agree that the panic that has set in amongst the members of the Government in the action taken in the last few hours is an indication of their failure to deal with this important problem.  The Government should know by now that their holiday period is over and that there are problems, and serious ones, affecting the lives of many people in the community.  I hope that the consultations taking place will be fruitful and that there will be a suitable termination <Col N="1363" /> to this unhappy event.</P>
      <P>I am positive that the ordinary decent workers of Dublin and the country would not wish to hold this country up to ransom.  There have been problems over a period leading to this unrest.  Information was available to the Government relating to this unrest.  This did not happen overnight and for this reason the Government must bear full responsibility for the situation that now exists.  We must ask ourselves what has gone wrong and why action was not taken before now.</P>
      <P>The bad industrial relations of the ESB is a factor that we all have been aware of over the years.  We have all been aware of the mismanagement in some sections of this semi-State body. In relation to the load-shedding by the ESB, this may have been done in some instances to transfer the blame from management to worker.  The development problems are problems that should have been tackled during the development stages.  These problems were treated with a great lack of urgency.</P>
      <P>It is heartening to know that tonight we have the Ministers here to deal with the problem.  For quite some time the country was without many Ministers to deal with almost any problem.  As was pointed out recently the Taoiseach had to bring the Ministers to the reality of the situation by telling them to produce some type of legislation so that this House could continue.  We have a serious situation in this House and in the Government.</P>
      <P>The country is at present in a state of confusion in relation to the ever worsening conditions in industry. Ministerial lack of action is a major factor in this regard.  Many of the Ministers have been travelling the world like a circus on parade, here today and gone tomorrow, but they should bear in mind that their place is in this country to deal with the serious problems that affect the lives of the workers in this state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The security factor is one of the serious aspects of this case.  This House discussed this matter recently <Col N="1364" /> and Members are aware that a serious situation exists at present.  We are all aware that it is necessary and desirable to ensure that every aid, particularly power, is available to ensure that there is an absolute security.  The question of the disabled and particularly of those who are sick and unable to obtain admission to the hospitals also arises.  Many of these people are being nursed at home in the dark.</P>
    <P>I am positive that if the power cuts continue many of the disabled persons who are unable to obtain admission to hospitals will be badly hit.  There should no need to highlight the necessity for heat and light for this section of the community. Our competitiveness in the export market is another factor that should be borne in mind.  The housewife is hampered in cooking meals for school children and many industries have been forced to curtail their operations.</P>
    <P>According to today's paper more than 15,000 workers in one country were laid off from seven factories. That is only a slight indication of how the country is affected.  These factories are without power when at the same time some of the ESB car parks are floodlit and many of the unoccupied buildings in the city and Government Departments are fully lighted.  The emphasis appears to be on neon-signs but they are only a very small aspect.  The wider aspects have been forgotten but the neon-sign gimmick will not blind the people to the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>An examination of the ESB will show the whole history of industrial unrest in the past.  It is an essential service which can put the nation at risk and, indeed, life in the nation at risk.  Deputy Barrett has pointed out the many reports compiled in relation to the ESB.  For instance, the Fletcher Report pinpointed some managerial faults.</P>
    <P>This is a priority area for the introduction of true industrial democracy.  We have heard much talk from Ministers when out of office, and some rumblings since they came into office about industrial democracy.  If there was participation by workers in <Col N="1365" /> the ESB and in other State and semi-State bodies, who should be model employers, then there would be a great improvement in industrial relations.  If workers had knowledge of the workings of the industry in which they are involved there would be a greater understanding of the problems on both sides.  I am positive that with this participation the workers' attitude to management and the management's attitude to workers would change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important aspect of this discussion, to ensure that we correct the faults of the past.  This question boils down to whether or not the worker and the employer decide on co-operation or antagonism.  We can point to many instances of participation of workers on boards which have led to improved industrial relations.  Mistakes were made in the past.  Some of the decisions taken by Fianna Fáil in the past in relation to the ESB affair were not satisfactory to my way of thinking, and they would not be taken in the future, if I had my way.  However, be it right or wrong, positive action was taken in the past.  I would not suggest for a moment that that type of action should be taken now.  In this enlightened age we should have this participation I have mentioned.  We should learn from the mistakes of the past.  We are now in a position to seek not just a temporary, stop-gap solution to this problem but a permanent solution.  I hope a solution will be found to this unfortunate affair, so that the nation is no longer left at risk.  By adopting a system of industrial democracy within the ESB, <Col N="1366" /> there would be greater security for this essential service and for the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion and also to express my deep concern about what is happening in our country at the present time.  The electricity cuts taking place at the moment are much more severe than is generally realised.  Certainly in one area electricity supplies were cut for a minimum of six hours.  This crisis has occurred at a time of a very cold snap in the weather.  There are many elderly people and very young children suffering very considerably as a result of it.  What worries me greatly is the plight of many of these people who cannot afford to buy fuel for fires.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett referred to security as one of the problems.  Deputy Dowling also took up that remark, but I would like to refer to the problem of insecurity.  There is a growing feeling of insecurity amongst the community because of the in action of this Government. We have one crisis after another. We have a Government who are afraid to act decisively.  In 1966 the Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill was introduced, and it was repealed in 1969. This measure, unpopular as it was with many people, was put into effect in order to protect the people.  I believe that what the people expect the Government to do is to protect them, not against workers but against the disasterous effects of a dispute between workers and employers.</P>
      <P>There are those who argue that if you have legislation similar to the 1966 Special Provisions Bill you do not have democracy for all.  However, I would choose to agree with the expressed sentiment that democracy would be a mockery if you could not protect the community against the disastrous effects of disputes between employer and employee.  I would further state that, if the strike weapon endangers the life of the community, then the rights of that sector must take second place to the rights of the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy, by its very nature, is a most difficult thing to defend, because the minute you begin to defend democracy <Col N="1367" /> you are accused of attacking it. We have a Government now made up of two parties, one of whom voted with the Fianna Fáil Government for the introduction of the Special Provisions Bill, and the other of whom, the Labour Party, voted against it, fought it tooth and nail.  Then we have a tug-of-war emerging, when what the people want is to feel a sense of security, that they have a Government that will protect their interests.  This situation should not be allowed to continue. There is too grave a responsibility on the Government to protect the vast majority of the citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>On the material side we have exports being lost.  We already have a very favourable balance of trade.  It is now getting worse.  We have, as Deputy Barrett said, the farming community highly inconvenienced by what is going on.  What we want to see is positive action by the Government. I am sorry the Minister for Lands is not with us at the moment.  He was with us a short time ago.  I want to quote for the House what he said in 1966.  I am quoting from the Official Report, volume 223, column 227:</P>
    <P>Why did they not in the past four or five months, when it became apparent that things had got out of control through their own fault, introduce a measure of some sort or take some steps to protect the lives and property and employment of the people?</P>
    <P>He was referring to the Fianna Fáil Government.  I want to ask the Ministers now what are they doing.  They are the Government now.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the lack of co-operation even in Government offices in response to the request to cut down on the use of electricity.  In our rooms this evening we were working with half the lights on.  I wonder how many Government offices had half their lights turned off. I understand the car park of the ESB was still floodlit as late as today.  I do not understand this.  There is an expression: &ldquo;Don't do as we do but do as we say&rdquo;.  It is no wonder people will not respect requests to go easy <Col N="1368" /> with their use of electricity when they see this request being ignored by the very people urging restraint.</P>
    <P>I admit there is some move now; they have said that no neon signs are to be operated.  There are many other ways in which electricity could be saved.  As I understand it, for every light that is on another light has to be turned off in another area.  There are shopwindows in which one light would be sufficient for security reasons.  There are many streets in Dublin in which, when the lights go on, the windows immediately light up. There should be some attempt to get the message across.  The message should be very strongly put.</P>
    <P>Today at Question Time we discussed the doctors' strike and pointed out that life was in danger.  Here there is another crisis in which life is also endangered and we have a Government seemingly very relaxed and calm about the whole thing, letting each day work itself out.  I have a feeling the Government are wishing away all the problems they are coming up against.  Last year, 1972, was one of the best years we had from the point of view of there being very few strikes.  This year will go down as one of the worst years for strikes.  We have a Government which seem incapable of doing anything.  We have a Minister for Labour whom I cannot believe is an adequate negotiator judging by the way things are turning out.  I have grave doubts about his competence.  I hope as time goes on I will be proved wrong but I have yet to be proved wrong.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems with which we are faced are due to a certain incompetence on the part of the Government. When we were discussing the Electricity (Special Provisions) Bill the Minister for Labour, Deputy M. O'Leary as he then was&mdash;and this is on the records of the House&mdash;asked were we going to fire the board of the ESB.  I wonder what his solution will be now that he is a Minister of State. Is he merely going to make irresponsible remarks from that exalted position or will he recognise that he has grave responsibilities?</P>
    <P>The people are looking for leadership <Col N="1369" /> from the Government and they are not getting it.  All the Government are capable of seemingly is jibing at Fianna Fáil, at their alleged discomfort in Opposition, but they are not getting any positive action from their Government.  They expect more.  In the minds of the people the Coalition have had a fair chance now and the people are calling on them to start getting on with the job they elected them to do.  So far they have failed miserably to do anything.</P>
    <P>I hope the talks tomorrow will result in a settlement of the strike. We all hope for that but, in the event that they do not, do the Government have a plan?  Are they going to do anything or will they just let the situation drift?  Will we have a situation in which we will have 200,000 workers out of work at a critical time of the year and old people dying prematurely? What are the Government going to do?  I hope when they come to reply they will be a little more positive instead of just referring to us and what we did.  We want to know what are they going to do.  What are they doing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. As Deputy Briscoe has said, it is time for this Government to stand on their own feet.  They have had a period in which most of the legislation coming before the House was legislation by the previous Administration and we were in a position of not being able to criticise it because we had prepared it.  The only new piece of legislation was a Bill introduced today by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I would like to ask&mdash; I have been asked it outside&mdash;is why this maintenance work now in progress is not carried out between the months of April and September.  I do not have to be an expert on electricity or power supply to realise that the time to carry out major repair or maintenance work is the time of least demand.  Instead of that we have a situation where our power supplies are at their lowest ebb while demand is coming up to its highest point.  The last few days were very, very cold.  No sooner did the cold snap come than <Col N="1370" /> we found out just how little reserve of energy we had in the ESB despite the millions spent on development, on oil producing, turf producing, coal producing, water producing sources of supply.  Like Switzerland we should never be short of electricity.  I believe most of our major rivers have been tapped.  Turlough Hill will not be on flow, I understand, until some time next year.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister for Transport and Power was aware that these repairs would be necessary. Was he aware that it was planned to have this maintenance work carried out in the late autumn and winter?  If he was not so aware, why not?  He is the Minister responsible for this State-sponsored body and he should be kept informed of all these matters.</P>
    <P>People who are contemplating strike action will strike when there is a minimum output of power at a time of maximum demand, because that is the time such action will have most effect.  The minute the cold spell arrived the demand for heating went up and we had electricity cuts of up to six hours.  Almost two-thirds of Dublin was blacked out last night.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers who said that there seems to be a great deal of Government inaction, not only in this regard but right across the board.  This is a matter of great concern. The fact that we had an announcement today about neon lights and heard that there will be a meeting tomorrow makes us feel that as a result of our effort this evening we have prodded the Government into action.  We will continue to prod them and make them take action under other heads.</P>
    <P>As has already been pointed out, legislation which was violently opposed by the Labour Party in 1966, was on the Statue Book until 1969.  If I remember correctly, part of the deal made at that time regarding pay agreements was the withdrawal of that Bill from the Statute Book.  It was withdrawn.  I cannot say for certain if that type of action is necessary now.  Most housewives and businessmen are asking: &ldquo;Why should this maintenance work take <Col N="1371" /> place at this time of the year?&rdquo; Was it because the Government were slow in granting price increases and the ESB could not afford to do it during the mild weather?  Perhaps the Minister for Transport and Power in his reply will be able to explain this to me and everybody else who is asking the same question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess to being somewhat intrigued when I heard of the motion on behalf of the Opposition which Deputy Barrett put forward.  I thought the Opposition had serious thoughts to offer on the ESB labour problems.  As Deputies are aware, we have had certain problems localised in the dock area in Waterford.  Impartial Deputies will agree that we have not been treated to any serious criticisms or suggestions by the Opposition. Speeches have gone from alarmist to panic.  Among the Members of the Opposition there was a feeling that we are wrong not to repeat their error of 1966 in their treatment of the ESB situation and espouse their particular remedies.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the theme of the various Opposition speeches.  The Minister for Transport and Power will discuss the technical aspects later.  There is a big responsibility on Members when a request is made to discuss any dispute in an on-going situation where negotiations are taking place.  Whatever about political motivation in any debate, there devolves on Deputies, given the opportunity of debate and discussing problems in that situation, the duty to be responsible.  I regret to say that in certain instances tonight the treatment by Opposition Deputies has been less than responsible in facing up to what the national interest requires of all responsible Deputies at this time.  It appears to be an Opposition feeling that the Government are even responsible for bad weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1966 ESB workers went on strike.  That led to the jailing of these <Col N="1372" /> workers.  The Government released the strikers, the ESB were forced to pay their fines and the people who had been jailed were sent home in taxis.  Soon after, the Government repealed that legislation.  That action embittered employer-union relations and has contributed in no small measure to the worsening of relations in the ESB.  The answer to the question &ldquo;why&rdquo; shines through in every carping criticism made by the Opposition.  Their desire to come back to power is so clear that they are ready to use any situation of industrial dislocation and exploit it to return them to office.  Sensible, honest people will see through any such stratagem on the part of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The facts are always different to what Opposition spokesmen would like us to believe.  The present situation in the ESB originated with the shift workers' desire to restore a loss differential of £1.70 with day workers. This has led to the work-to-rule measures.  The shift workers' claim when put to the board failed.  When it went to the Industrial Council of the ESB&mdash;the Industrial Council is the the domestic board for dealing with questions of this sort&mdash;the council ruled that that claim was not an anomaly.  Deputies are aware that there are clauses in the National Agreement for negotiation of anomalies. The Industrial Council ruled that the claim of £1.70 did not come within the anomaly definition.  They ruled instead that any differential must be based on productivity.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday the ESB presented to the union side a set of productivity proposals.  The union met on Friday to discuss them but, it could be said, the meeting was inconclusive.  We then had what is producing the present dislocation, a shortage of light, a work-to-rule. Anybody who has experience of industrial relations realises that the trap in any such situation is to think that there is a short cut by dramatic action to industrial peace.  That was the trap which the Deputies opposite fell into very often when in Government. It happened to them in 1966 in relation to the ESB.  It would be very foolish of a responsible Government to <Col N="1373" /> fall into such a trap at the present time. Since the weekend there has been a positive movement under the aegis of the Industrial Council.  Yesterday both parties referred the dispute to the Industrial Council, and yesterday I asked that the chairman of the council should give priority to such a hearing. He, as well as being chairman of the Industrial Council, is also a rights commissioner, a very busy and diligent rights commissioner, and I was anxious to ensure that his duties as rights commissioner did not inhibit him at the present time from giving his full consideration and attention to the question of his chairmanship of the ESB Industrial Council.  That hearing took place this morning and the result is that the council have given it as their view that there is still room for direct discussion between the ESB and the unions.  This recommendation has been accepted by both sides and the discussions are due to start tomorrow at 2.30.  Of course, tomorrow's discussions will aim presumably to keep in line with the national pay agreement.  I have always been anxious to emphasise that the national agreement is no constructing mechanism inhibiting justifiable wage demands.  If any demand is made, based squarely on the productivity clause of the national agreement, workers making such claim can get all they desire.  I accept Deputy Briscoe's criticism of my role. He may be right, and I very often feel most incompetent.  Time alone and events can say, and I am humble before whatever events tell of me, whether I have been competent or incompetent.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I would say that my role as, I would hope, a responsible Minister for Labour is, first, to understand the elements of the present situation.  I think that understanding the elements of the present situation will prevent me from rushing to absurd conclusions, a course which overtook my predecessors in this position.  To understand the elements of the situation is my <Col N="1374" /> first job and, having understood them, then to take care to ensure that the domestic procedures in the board are fully utilised.  That, I think, I have carried out and these are the events of the last few days.</P>
      <P>I do not think we will advance this situation by throwing about silly charges.  There is plenty for politicians to disagree about in this House, plenty matters of economic policy.  We do not have to, on the basis of an industrial dispute, attempt to score points over the Government of the day.  I suppose responsible Deputies opposite must feel in their hearts that it is a vain and silly chore for them to be taking on at this time.  It will not fool anybody.  I do not believe it fools themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no substitute for the steady handling of a situation of this kind. We must not give way to the panic that certain Deputies opposite exhibit. We must not give way to the possibilities of political opportunism and these possibilities are there.  I regretted today to see Deputy O'Malley lapse into such political opportunism in speaking of the problems in the health sphere to which the Tánaiste has been giving so much attention.  I regretted that Deputy O'Malley appeared to be exploiting that situation for what he conceived to be party political advantage.  My advice to Members of the Opposition would be that their own political power would not be enhanced or that their acceptance as a responsible party in the community would not be enhanced by such tactics.  There is plenty of scope for them to criticise the various Ministers of this administration on what they conceive to be their short comings in policy areas. There will be plenty of scope over the next four years for such criticism.  I would say the people will not really abide this kind of intervention where they base an attack on the Government's incompetence simply on an existing dispute, which has complicated origins, as everybody knows.  We have had difficulties in the board for a number of years.  It has been the subject of a number of reports and it did not start last week.  We will leave <Col N="1375" /> that matter at that point.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies in the remaining period of this debate to be aware of their responsibilities in this matter.  We have a delicate situation in which the parties are negotiating. Our remarks here tonight could either worsen or improve the climate for settlement.</P>

      <P>Deputies, whatever their political differences at election time, at this moment when we are very far from an election, could put aside the hatchets which they might wield on other less important occasions and bear in mind the national interest and consider squarely the problems there are before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned worker participation.  I agree with him that worker participation may have a lot to offer towards improving industrial relations, but I would say worker participation is misunderstood if it is seen as a sort of panacea for industrial ills. I am convinced of one thing, after the little practical experience I have had in this area, that really one is left with the final conclusion that there is no short-cut in this way and that existing institutions and structures, developed by both parties, must be strengthened.  No action of ours must override the efficacy of those structures.  That is why the idea of legislative shortcuts to industrial peace, dramatic gestures, do not advance the situation.  Instead it is an unremitting task of ensuring that the institutions set up by the unions and the employers are made truly effective. I have every confidence that the structures that exist within the ESB at the moment will over the next few days yield some benefit in terms of industrial peace.  There is no certainty, of course, that a solution is around the corner.  However, I think we can say at this moment that we are on course and that members of this Government are not giving way to any panic.  We realise the seriousness of the situation; we are giving it all the <Col N="1376" /> serious attention we think it needs; we think the steps we have taken are the correct ones and we would ask the Deputies opposite in the remaining portion of this debate to remember, if they have forgotten them temporarily, their responsibilities.</P>

It has been in existence for over 40 years and if there had been a history of lack of supply of current, if there were constant industrial troubles or the plant continually breaking down so that people would not expect the light to come on when they pressed a switch, then there would be no debate here today. A debate here on a lack of supply of power by the ESB is a very unusual thing.  I think Deputy Barrett said that the last time such a debate took place was 26 years ago. The best compliment we can pay to the ESB is that 99.9 per cent of the time when we press the switch the light comes on.  They have been very successful when one considers that the demand for electricity increases at the rate of 10 per cent or 12 per cent per year&mdash;in other words, it doubles every seven years.  They cannot decide this year to put in capacity to meet the increased demand this year.  They must look many years ahead.  We are all conscious of the time it has taken to bring Turlough Hill into commission. This forward planning has been successful on the part of the ESB.  They have been admired and indeed copied by many electricity boards throughout the world, particularly in the matter of planning ahead.</P>
      <P>This has been of great benefit to the nation.  There were many points in the history of the ESB when it was said that additional loads put on them by various Governments were not strictly what they were there for, or that they could have applied the work in a different way.  They did not do that because they accepted the fact that their job was to supply power to the country as a whole. They have efficiently carried this out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this year a <Col N="1377" /> series of things happened which brought about the present unhappy situation and I am disappointed that Deputies opposite seem to think that flood lighting near the ESB building and neon lights are a major concern of the people of this country.  They are not, but I will deal with that and other matters later.  I want, first of all, to come to what the position is in regard to power at the moment.</P>
    <P>The total ESB generating plant is capable of 1,789 megawatts and the peak load at any one time would be about 1,300 to 1,400 megawatts. Normal maintenance at this time of year would mean a reduction of 222 megawatts, because of plant out of commission at the moment for maintenance. Either Deputy Briscoe or Deputy Lemass said it is ridiculous to be carrying out maintenance at this time of year, that it should all have been done in the summer months.  In fact, ESB maintenance goes on for nine months of the year. It will be finished at the end of this month and will commence again on 1st March.  In summer, more plant will be taken out of commission.  In June there is three times as much plant down for maintenance as there is at the present time.  This is a continuing thing which must be done. Otherwise plant would break down.</P>
    <P>I began my remarks by speaking about the organisation of the ESB, which for 40 years have adopted this programme, brought plant out of commission, maintained it, refurbished it and brought it back in again without the people in general being aware of it.  There is another problem.  Last August, some people may remember, there was a disintegration of a 30 megawatt alternator at Ringsend generating station.  At the same time there was disintegration of a 60 megawatt turbine unit in England which was of the same manufacture.  The ESB have a further seven such units in this country and these, on the advice of the manufacturers, were &ldquo;grounded&rdquo; immediately because they also would have disintegrated. They were taken out of commission for maintenance and three of them are back in service.  The other four <Col N="1378" /> are not yet back.  This accounted for a further shortage of 270 megawatts. Therefore, 222 megawatts are short because of ordinary maintenance and there is a shortage of 270 megawatts because of emergency maintenance, leaving a shortfall of 492 megawatts. This means that the plant available at the moment gives 1,297 megawatts.</P>
    <P>The industrial dispute yesterday took out 218 megawatts&mdash;that is all. That is roughly one-sixth of the output of the total plant in commission.  This one-sixth has been evenly distributed, as far as possible, throughout the country.  Certain things like hospitals, sewage pumping, kidney machines, public lighting, airports and so on have not been affected at all and will not be.  Roughly two-thirds of the geographic area of the country is affected by power cuts at any one time.  When you subtract the essential services I have mentioned, the cuts are spread as evenly as possible throughout the country.  Today it was Dáil Éireann's turn.  We have to take our share and I think that is right&mdash; we should not have extra facilities above anybody else in the country. If there have to be power cuts in the country, TDs, the executives of the ESB and other such people in their own homes should be affected by power cuts as well as people in other businesses.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned agriculture.  It was Deputy Barrett.  The ESB are very careful that in agricultural areas power will be available when milking has to be done.  It may be impossible to make it available at exact times but the ESB have warned people who have milking machines.  They have given them advance notification and they have advised them to advance milking times to hours when the power will be there.  This has been done by the ESB and I have not had any complaints from the agricultural community in this respect.</P>
    <P>I think the Opposition thought this was a good stick with which to beat the Government.  Personally I am glad they did it because it gives me the opportunity to come in here to pay the tribute I did to the ESB and also <Col N="1379" /> to explain to the public the amount of power that is available and the shortfall there is.  Of course the present situation is aggravated by the fuel crisis, but the ESB hope to conserve their stocks if for no other reason than the fact that the price has trebled in the past few weeks. That is not a major contributing factor at the moment.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the plant will be back on 1st December and the first 70 megawatt unit at Turlough Hill will come into commission in December. Probably at the end of January or early in February, the second 70 megawatt generator will also come into operation.  That is an extra 140 megawatts beyond what we have, plus another 222 megawatts which will come into operation after ordinary maintenance.  Possibly some of the other generators like the one which disintegrated at Ringsend will be back in service.  Therefore, if there was not an industrial dispute it is possible we could just squeeze past in the next few weeks.  The amount involved because of the industrial dispute is 280 megawatts and the amount we have out for maintenance is 222 megawatts.  Even if there had been no industrial dispute it is possible there would have been some cuts.</P>
    <P>This morning, the plant in commission produced 1,297 megawatts.  Unavailable because of industrial relations problems is 280 megawatts, leaving 1,117 megawatts available.  The maximum load is 1,230 megawatts which means a shortfall of about 60 megawatts, which meant there was only load-shedding to the extent of 220 megawatts.  The position this evening was different because the demand had gone up and there had to be load shedding to the amount of 250 megawatts. That meant more extensive cuts this evening than this morning. If we had not the industrial problem at all it is possible we would still have power cuts.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of doing nothing as a Government.  The first intimation the ESB got of an industrial dispute was on Friday and the first Government meeting since <Col N="1380" /> Friday was at 11 a.m. today when I brought to the Government an urgent memorandum asking them to bring into operation section 2 of the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971, which, by the way, is exactly the same measure as the previous Government brought in last year when there was a dispute with the shift workers, except that I did not go as far as the previous Government. I did not include central heating, which I considered to be essential at this time of year.  What this covers is much more than neon lighting. Deputy Briscoe spoke about window lighting.  This order includes the use of electricity for advertising or display, the illumination of shop windows, flood lighting or the use of electricity for any other purpose which in the opinion of the Minister is nonessential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem and we are taking effective steps to deal with it.  Instead of making these futile points Deputies could have read the evening papers.  It has been said that the ESB did not issue warnings. There has been a warning system.  It has been in force for the last month. I heard it on the radio.  In the car this morning I heard the ESB giving <Col N="1381" /> notice of exactly where the power cuts would be and how long they could last.  The public appreciate the fact. Anybody can tell you what his zone is.  The people know the zones that will be affected.  The people take action to see that they have alternative fuel supplies.  The public realise the difficulties of the ESB.  They are sympathetic towards them.  Naturally, they want the problem settled as quickly as possible.  We are doing that.</P>
      <P>The last point is a rather petty one about which many Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke.  It is the floodlighting in the ESB car park.  Mention was also made of security.  This floodlighting is security lighting.  The offices of the ESB are the nerve centre of the whole supply system.  They happen to be adjacent to the car park.  The lighting is security lighting to protect this building.  That is as it should be. If that building was damaged there would be no light for anybody.  We are acting.  We have the situation under control.  The people appreciate the situation.  Apart from plant problems for the next three or four weeks we can be sure that the power of this country is in very safe hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain fellow-feeling for the Minister because of the difficulty in which he finds himself. At the same time, I have no difficulty in appreciating the case which the Opposition are making.  Too frequently I had to listen to what I would have considered unreasonable demands made by the Opposition when we were in office.  The ESB are in a unique position <i>vis-à-vis</i> any other industry in this country.  One man can throw the country into complete chaos.  Havoc can be wrought on the whole economy.  The economy of the country can be brought to a complete standstill.  Those who seek to take strike action in the ESB have always found themselves with a most formidable weapon in their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever criticism there was of the drastic action which our Government took in 1966 the public at large appreciated that it was possible to reach a position with regard to the ESB when drastic action could and would have to be taken.  The present Government could find themselves in the position <Col N="1382" /> where, if certain demands were not met and persistent industrial action was taken in the ESB, the whole country could be held up to ransom and every single industry, not to mention the hospitals, could be affected and action would have to be taken to ensure that the strike did not go on.  The Government cannot burn their boats in this matter.  The Government brought in legislation to bring the banks to heel. A bank strike is not nearly as serious a matter as a strike in the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that the movers of this motion were &ldquo;playing politics&rdquo;.  We will all leave this House tonight satisfied because this motion has done some good. It will have clarified many points.  We will have informed people of what is happening.  We will prevent the public at large from pointing the finger at the Opposition and asking: &ldquo;What are you doing about it?&rdquo; They could ask: &ldquo;Are we going to live from day to day wondering what tomorrow will bring?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know what the Minister has to endure at a time like this.  People may ring up his office and say: &ldquo;My mother is dying and she cannot have even an electric blanket.  Can you do anything about it?&rdquo; I got such calls frequently but had to avoid taking panic action.  There is something more fundamental involved than what one can do on the spur of the moment. Two examinations in depth of the situation in the ESB were made.  The Fletcher report and the Fogarty report examined the whole situation carefully and identified the cause of the trouble. Before I left the Department, action was being taken at all levels in the ESB to ensure that industrial unrest would be brought to a minimum or even eradicated completely.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister for Transport and Power who gave us much technical advice and particulars of the output of the ESB did not tell us what he knows about the extent to which the Fogarty report or the Fletcher report have been implemented in the day-to-day workings of the ESB? This is the fundamental thinking to prevent disastrous happenings.  However much we argue or &ldquo;play politics&rdquo; with a motion like this, this is serious <Col N="1383" /> enough for an Opposition to take notice of.  It is serious enough for us to put down a motion for debate here. If this strike is allowed to go on, the situation could be serious.  No matter how much we want to score points off one another, none of us wants to see the economy brought to ruin.  An ESB strike can do just that.  When I was Minister, I had to answer awkward questions from the opposite benches and listen to what I thought was unreasonable debate.  Many institutions have been set up by the Department of Labour for processing disputes in this country.  There should be no need for any group to take strike action at the expense of the public when all this machinery for settlement is available to them and if they are prepared to accept some reasonable solution.</P>
    <P>The ESB are good employers.  Every Deputy knows that there is demand for employment in the ESB.  They have a vast income and are spread throughout the country.  Sometimes I feel that they act in a rather dictatorial fashion.  We must make allowances for the fact that they are a far-flung organisation with many men in the field.  They are not always subject to the most strict supervision. They are a State-sponsored body which should give a lead in the matter of industrial relations.  It cost quite a lot at the time to have both reports to which I have referred produced and I should like to see better use made of them.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Labour to watch constantly what is happening in the ESB.  It would be no harm for them to get an occasional report.  The Minister has already revealed that the chairman of the industrial council is also a rights commissioner and in a position to report frequently and regularly on what is happening.  I do not accept that this dispute began only last Friday; this case for differential pay is going on for months and that cannot be unknown to either Minister or to the Government.  It is in the embryo stage that it could be dealt with most successfully. You are dealing with people who know they have a weapon which <Col N="1384" /> if they wish to use it to the extreme limit can extract from the employers anything they ask, unless they are dealing with a resolute Government that in the last analysis will be prepared to take even drastic action. Nobody wants drastic action taken, nor is it a suitable means of dealing with industrial unrest but when you are dealing with the very lives of the people, the economic life of the country, in such extreme circumstances no action can be ruled out. The people of the country would be glad to be assured that the Government are prepared to examine any possibility if circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>This situation is not to be compared with the banks situation nor with the mining industry or some other concern where prompt action can be taken overnight; this is something which calls for the best in any Government. Unfortunately, I fear the Government have led the people to believe that they have some latent genius that has not yet manifested itself.  They have done a perfect job in public relations.  I congratulate them on having the best public relations organisation that any Government ever had; they certainly have the news media in their pocket.  But that is no good if performance does not match it and the people are waiting to see when it will.  Spectacular ballyhoo is no use unless there is resolute action and firmness of purpose in taking the steps necessary in a time of grave crisis.  The present situation has not yet reached the proportions of a serious crisis but it could very rapidly escalate to that stage.</P>
    <P>We may be accused of being an irresponsible Opposition in putting down this motion but I think it has done good; it has cleared the air and let the people see the position and what is likely to happen.  I can assure the Ministers and the Government that if it comes to taking any action that will avert a serious situation whether by successful negotiation through the available machinery for settling such disputes&mdash;there is ample machinery there&mdash;or, if that fails and the Government have to take any other action to avoid disaster which <Col N="1385" /> could ensue as a result of this type of strike, we will support them.  That is the best assurance that can go from this House tonight to the people of the country: anything requiring to be done to avert the development of a serious situation will be done with the full backing of a responsible Opposition.</P>
    <P>We may be accused of being irresponsible, of not being competent. We are sitting back for the past few months watching the Government.  I do not envy some of them, particularly my successor in the Department of Labour, in the jobs they have to do. We have watched them opening the schools and factories we built and enjoying themselves generally, but we are also waiting for the time when their activity will measure up to the reputation that they have projected through their public relations efforts.  The public are also waiting to see this latent genius emerge in time of trial.  This is one of those times.  The EEC negotiations are another test.  So is security in the country.  These are testing times and these are the things that speak, not what is written by political correspondents or others.  The public are aware <Col N="1386" /> of what is happening; they are watching to see how this situation will develop.  I can assure the people that we will give the Government every possible assistance to avert disaster which could unfortunately result from a strike of this kind.</P>
    <P>We are not taking advantage of a political situation.  The public and the Press may ask: &ldquo;What are the Opposition doing?  If the Government are doing nothing they are not even being reminded by an inept Opposition accused of not doing its job.&rdquo;  On every possible occasion we shall bring to the notice of the people through this House every shortcoming we see in the Government as that Government did when in Opposition while we were in office.  I did not get much sympathy as Minister for Labour.  The greatest tribute that could be paid to my work was paid to it here tonight in the Government saying: &ldquo;We have no remedy other than what you were using when you were Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I expect that the Broadcasting Review Committee will deal with the question of local broadcasting in their final report and there should, therefore, be no need for a specific feasibility study.  I would be favourably disposed towards permitting the experimental distribution of local programmes through cable television systems.  I hope to make provision for controlled experimentation in this area under statutory regulations which are now being framed.  At a later stage, and in the light both of experience and of the Broadcasting Review Committee's recommendations, more extensive provision can be made for community broadcasting in the new broadcasting legislation.</P>
