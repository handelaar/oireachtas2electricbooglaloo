      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): I intervened in this debate yesterday to put the record straight on certain statements made in regard to the proposed constituency of Monaghan-Cavan.  I pointed out, clearly I hope, that the proposed constituency of Monaghan-Cavan was a much more workable unit than the two three-seat constituencies which it replaces.  For example, Cavan as at present constituted is a three-seater but it embraces&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister but I am very desirous that order and quiet should be restored to the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The constituency of Cavan as at present constituted is a three-seater but, in order to qualify as such, it has to take in parts of Meath.  I emphasise &ldquo;parts&rdquo; because it takes in a part of Oldcastle and district and it then leapfrogs Carnaross in the Kells district and goes over to Moynalty for another portion.  That surely is butchery and carving up at its worst.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that in the case of Monaghan it is even worse because to qualify Monaghan as a three-seater the former Minister had to take in pieces of Meath from Drumconrath and Kilmainhamwood to Nobber. Not having got sufficient there he went away up to County Louth and took in the town of Ardee and other areas there.  That was a very clumsy effort to create two three-seat constituencies especially when the counties of Louth and Monaghan have very little in common whereas the counties of Monaghan and Cavan have always had a great deal in common. They are Ulster counties.  They have had a joint hospital for as far back as anybody can remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The names of Monaghan and Cavan have been linked together in the sphere of health for many years.  I do not think, however, that the Opposition Deputies who are criticising the proposal to amalgamate Monaghan and Cavan and create a five-seat constituency are serious. Neither do I believe they are honest. If they are honest and serious they <Col N="1428" /> must have been out of touch with their Minister for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, because he had proposals last year, which he did not finalise, to revise constituencies and, strange as it may seem, one of the proposals was to create a five-seat constituency consisting of Monaghan and Cavan, the very thing about which Deputy Molloy and other Opposition Deputies are complaining now.  The sort of job he was going to do&mdash;the Minister will tell the House more about this later&mdash;was to create a five-seat constituency of, I think, all Monaghan and a part of Cavan and he was going to shift a part of Cavan into Leitrim.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Wait and see.  I would suggest to Deputy C. Murphy, if he has any doubts, that there is one man with whom he is probably very friendly&mdash; one would not really know who is friendly with whom in the Fianna Fáil Party at the moment, but I presume Deputy C. Murphy is friendly with the former Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and I suggest he should have a chat with him because Deputy Molloy can put the matter beyond doubt.  In those circumstances it is extraordinary that we should have Deputies on the Opposition benches coming in here now complaining about this proposal. I think the explanation for the reaction of the Opposition to the Bill is because it is a very traumatic experience for the Fianna Fáil Party to find themselves discussing the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973, from those benches.  It is a very traumatic experience and I am sure a great many questions have been asked within the party.  I am sure Deputy Lynch has been asked why did he not let Deputy Molloy revise the constituencies last year.  That is the first question.  I am sure the next question the poor man is being asked is why <Col N="1429" /> did he rush the general election in January of this year. <i>(Interruptions.)</i></P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If Deputy C. Murphy wants to help me to make a long speech, I have no objection.  I will not be annoyed.  At any rate, I have given the explanation why Fianna Fáil are so annoyed.  They just cannot bear to see someone else revising the constituencies.  I suppose that is understandable in a way because they revised the constituencies in 1937, in 1947, in 1961 and again in 1969. Surely they had a fair innings.  They made a fair, good job of it when they were at it.  There is no use now in Opposition blaming the Minister for Local Government because Deputy Jack Lynch did not get on with the job last year and did not delay the general election this year until he had an opportunity of revising the constituencies. There is no use blaming us for that.  There is only one man the Opposition can blame for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is no use now blaming Deputy Tully, Minister for Local Government, or me for the non-revision of the constituencies last year or for the general election early this year.  The only person Opposition Deputies can blame is Deputy Jack Lynch or those members of Deputy Murphy's party who were making things so uncomfortable for Deputy Jack Lynch at the beginning <Col N="1431" /> of this year that he had to take the plunge.  That is all I want to say about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is laughable, remembering the performance of the Fianna Fáil Party on the matter of constituency revision over the years, to hear them now criticising the proposals of the Minister for Local Government.  I spoke at length on the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I was at the time spokesman for Local Government in the Fine Gael Party.  The one county that stuck out like a sore thumb on that occasion was Leitrim.  In order to demonstrate clearly to the House that Fianna Fáil have no reasonable case whatever to make against this Bill all I have to do now is deal with County Leitrim and show how it was dealt with by the Fianna Fáil Administration in 1961 and again in 1969.  In 1961 they took a piece of Leitrim and put it into Roscommon. In doing so, they left out the town of Ballinamore, the idea being to make it impossible for a member of the Reynolds family to be returned to Dáil Éireann.  That was the object of that operation.  They put North Leitrim into Sligo, the hope being that Fianna Fáil would get two seats out of three in Sligo-Leitrim and two seats out of three in Roscommon-Leitrim. That operation misfired badly because the reverse happened. Fine Gael got two seats out of three in Sligo-Leitrim and two out of three in Roscommon-Leitrim.  In the 1969 revision they were determined to punish Leitrim, to use Deputy Leonard's expression, for returning two Fine Gael Deputies and no Fianna Fáil Deputy.  Good gracious, what a job they attempted to make of it! When Mr. Kevin Boland as Minister for Local Government in 1969 introduced the last Bill the name &ldquo;Leitrim&rdquo; as a county did not appear.  It was divided into three different constituencies, part in Roscommon, part in Sligo and part in Donegal.  The name of County Leitrim was removed from the Electoral Bill.  It was not as simple as that. They made sure that the towns of Ballinamore and Drumshanbo, where Deputy Reynolds would get his votes, <Col N="1432" /> were put not into Roscommon but into Sligo.  Deputy Reynolds had to drive about 17 miles in the Carrick-on-Shannon direction before he could get one vote.  That was calculated to put Reynolds out of public life and it did between 1969 and 1973 only.  They then went to North Leitrim and put most of North Leitrim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have dealt with the Roscommon-Leitrim constituency which was created by the last revision Bill.  I will now deal with the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  The previous Bill created the constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim.  It excluded Manorhamilton and Dromahair and put them into County Donegal to try to ensure that Deputy Joe McLaughlin did not survive.  That was the sole object of that operation.  They did not exclude him from Dáil Éireann <Col N="1433" /> in 1969 but they did exclude Deputy Eugene Gilhawley.  They put Glenfarron, Manorhamilton and Dromahair into County Donegal and created a monster of a constituency extending from Cavan to the upper end of Donegal.  The object of that disgraceful performance was to destroy the County Leitrim as a political unit, but more particularly to make it impossible for Deputy Reynolds and Deputy McLaughlin to get elected. It succeeded in 1969 because Sligo-North Leitrim secured two Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Fine Gael Deputy and Roscommon-South Leitrim returned two Fianna Fáil Deputies and one Fine Gael Deputy.  In 1973 the position was reversed.  The most spectacular return of the 1973 general election was the return of Deputy Reynolds to the House at the expense of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, now Senator Lenihan. In Sligo-North Leitrim we had a return of two Fine Gael Deputies and one Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am accused of repetition but I must answer when challenges are thrown at me.  As I pointed out yesterday, if one sought a cross-section of Irish public life one could not get a better example than the constituency of Monaghan, where there are conservatives, extreme Republicans, the poor land of Monaghan and the rich lands of Meath and Louth.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That all arose out of my saying that the most spectacular win at the last general election was the election of Deputy Reynolds at the expense of Senator Brian Lenihan.  That was an indication of the indignation of the people of Roscommon-South Leitrim at the carving up which was done in 1969.  The people of Sligo-Leitrim reacted in the same way.  They returned two Fine Gael Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to trespass much longer on the time of the House because it would not be reasonable to do so.  When one points out how the present Opposition dealt with Leitrim in the last revision of constituencies one answers completely, and utterly, any criticism Fianna Fáil can level against the present proposals of the Minister for Local Government. Opposition Deputies have complained <Col N="1435" /> that Leitrim had not been restored to a single unit.  It is laughable to hear such things.  I suppose a person can say anything.  The people who made three of Leitrim are now complaining that it was not restored to one.  There was always a north Leitrim and a south Leitrim and the Minister for Local Government has now restored it to two, one half of it going with Sligo and the other portion going with Roscommon.</P>
    <P>There has always been a lot in common between Sligo and Leitrim, especially between Sligo and North Leitrim.  For the southern portion of Leitrim to be put in with Roscommon is, in my view, a perfectly reasonable proposition and one which will appeal to the people.  Having dealt with Cavan, Monaghan and the three parts of Leitrim, I am satisfied, taking the Bill as a whole, that it is a vast improvement on what was done by the previous Administration.  There has been a shift of population from Connacht to Leinster and the present Government cannot be blamed for that but that necessitated a loss of seats for the west and a gain of seats for the east.  That is laid down in the Constitution and nothing can be done about it.  On a number of occasions Fianna Fáil tried to change the Constitution in this respect but the people did not give them authority to do so. That is all I wish to say on this matter.  I intervened to highlight some of the outrageous points made by Fianna Fáil and to shoot them down. I believe I have done so.</P>

      <P>The enthusiasm of Deputy Byrne will be satisfied in a few minutes because I have a very short contribution to make.</P>
      <P>One seeks a philosophy in a Bill of this kind and one is entitled to look to what a man said in the past to indicate, in some way, what his philosophy might be.  While the Minister for Lands was eloquent from time to time in a patchy kind of way on various constituencies, he did not enlighten us as to how the great change of heart came about from the time he was advocating that this House, or the Government, should not decide where the borders of constituencies should be.</P>
      <P>In 1968 the present Minister for Lands said it was desirable that an independent commission, presided over by a High Court or Supreme Court judge but subject to the control of the Oireachtas, rather than Dáil Éireann directly as at present should make these decisions.  The Minister gave as his reason then that he was convinced that it would be fundamentally undemocratic and against natural justice to entrust this to a Minister for Local Government. Now, five years later, he has turned his back on what sounded very good and sounded like something proceeding from conviction.  In this approach he had the backing of the present Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know why what looked like something basically held, an important tenet in a person's philosophy, could change so quickly and so utterly.  The fact is that it was only a game he was playing.  He did not have any conviction on the matter at all, at least the conviction did not last five years, nor did it last a change of Government.  I did think there was running through the whole conception in this Bill a philosophy that from now on only urban Ireland would count.  This is what it looks like to me.  Because of increased organisation generally in the world one could see, and one could regret, how a Government could come to this decision.  It is true that all over the world the people involved in agriculture and the people living in rural communities are becoming <Col N="1437" /> fewer and fewer and that urbanisation and industrialisation are the trends of this century.</P>
    <P>As a representative of a rural constituency, I regret this decision of the Government.  Looking at the lay-out, particularly of the Dublin constituencies, one could say that this is a possible reason for the way the constituencies are arranged.  The point has been made already that a completely different philosophy, a complete change of horses, a quick switch took place in regard to the constituencies in the second largest urban concentration in the country.  In fact, there is no philosophy except expediency; there is no effort to treat this in a rational fashion.  The attitude seems to be: &ldquo;They are my principles there if they suit me but I will change them if they do not suit me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have a different approach in Fianna Fáil.  People have stated that under a Fianna Fáil Administration the rural population declined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall.  As I was saying, this trend is a world-wide one. Our basic philosophy which is written into the constitution of the Fianna Fáil party is to maintain as many as possible in reasonable comfort on the land.  We saw the world trend and, needless to say, we could not hope to stem a world trend, but we did think out the best way to combine industrialisation with continuing residence on the land, with a continuing fairly stable population on the land.  We went about this by designating special <Col N="1438" /> areas for industrial development.  I am afraid that this Dublin-dominated Government has given up that idea. The indications in this particular Bill are that that approach, that effort to maintain a stable rural population, has been given up.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands spoke a lot about Monaghan and the by-election there but he did not refer to the fact that right in the middle of that campaign an indication was given that there was a possibility that the county development teams whose sole aim was to bring industrialisation to the rural areas so as to maintain that rural population were in danger from the Coalition Government.  The philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party is logical, persistent and, as usual, practical.  We set about doing something about this world situation of the trend from rural to urban areas. I hope that when the next Electoral (Amendment) Bill is introduced by a Minister for Local Government of a Fianna Fáil Government we will be able to set in motion again this move to increase the industrial capacity of rural Ireland and, consequently, to increase the population and that we will not then have to link up two neighbouring counties.  Cavan and Monaghan get on well together, and will get on well together, and will return three Fianna Fáil Deputies at the next general election.  I am as much entitled to my crystal ball as the Minister for Lands is.  Why&mdash;and perhaps the Minister for Local Government would refer to this&mdash;if he has such faith in a commission, and he said in all circumstances, no matter what Government was in power, this would be desirable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It refers to the procedure of having a commission decide the boundaries of the constituency rather than that well-known political <i>savant</i>, the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully.  As I said, my big complaint is the lack of a consistent philosophy, applying one set of principles where Dublin is concerned, another set of principles where Cork is concerned, running every way: the good old Duke of York who had the 10,000 men, he marched them up the hill and then he marched them down again.  That is the whole philosophy behind this Bill.  There was reference as to why we did not introduce such a Bill, why the constituencies were not revised by Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil were heavily engaged in legislation, in fact had as much legislation in the pipeline as has not been dealt with by the present Government even yet. This is the only child, the only fruit of their office so far, the only one that belongs to themselves alone.</P>

The Minister for Lands questioned why the general election should be called at that time and he talked about what happened.  I would remind him that 22,000 people more than in 1969 recorded their first preference votes for us, and if I were the Minister for Lands I would not go around boasting about a policy that was quickly put before the people and succeeded in getting 22,000 extra first preference votes for Fianna Fáil.</P>

I would appeal to the Minister for Lands and to the Minister for Local Government, who both represent rural constituencies and know the rural scene, and who at least have empathy with the problems of rural Ireland, to get behind the rural lobby and see to it that Dublin will not have a better representation than the rural constituencies, that they will not have more TDs per voter than rural Ireland has.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the Second Stage of this Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1973.  I was not here in the House when the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill was enacted.  However, one of the shortcomings I noticed in that when going for election in June, 1959, was the way in which the Ballymun satellite town had been divided into three separate constituencies: Dublin North County, <Col N="1441" /> Dublin North-West, and Dublin North-East, returning to represent that area 12 TDs <i>in toto.</i> I wish now to say a few brief words in connection with the division of the Ballymun satellite town area and adjoining areas.  I believe that no more urbanised area could exist in this State, and to include it in a county area could possibly be an error in respect of the increase in the onerous task the public representatives would have, and also might not do justice to the citizens of Ballymun satellite town who need the optimum ability and quality in their public representatives.</P>
      <P>Why this has happened I am not sure.  I do know that the total satellite town is now in the one constituency, but I am saddened to see that the constituency stretches as far as north of Balbriggan town.  I can only surmise that something has happened in County Louth and County Meath to take part of the proposed three-seater in North County Dublin, and perhaps in the end the victims of these two four-seaters will be the 23,600 people who live in the four borough areas making up the satellite town and adjoining areas.</P>
      <P>One of the many things we discussed in the last Dáil was the bureaucracy of the townland areas, and, particularly, the Dublin county borough line, which prevented Ballymun children from obtaining school meals, because they lived in a corporation area and within the Dublin county borough line, although their school was across the road in the Dublin County Council area.  Not much has been done to improve this. In fact, we shall be faced with a duplication in Ballymun, and once again a multiplication, whereby the representatives for the Drumcondra North County A and North County B areas of Ballymun will be county councillors, whereas the representatives for the Santry A and Finglas East E areas will be city councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard we have not advanced very far.  The population of Ballymun satellite town is gradually increasing as dwellings are being completed.  It would be very difficult at this stage for me to ask the Minister to consider steps to bring Ballymun <Col N="1442" /> satellite town back into the city representational area where it would have much more in common with the urban area rather than with the county.  It is not untrue to say that the next farm to the flat furthest to the north in Ballymun satellite town comprises 200 acres of very good farm land and from there on, as you go northwards, the farms are lush and valuable.  As recently as on yesterday's paper one saw where a farm in the Naul district comprising 450 acres was sold for £½ million. There is nothing in common between the type of farms in that area and a flat 14 or 15 storeys up in Ballymun satellite town.  There is very little in common between places like Brackenstown House and Ballymun satellite town.  I am quite familiar with the area having had the privilege of being associated with that area for a long time during my childhood and having been on holiday there as a child.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of changing in some way parts of County Louth or County Meath in order to make up for the population of North County Dublin which has been depleted in some way.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to compliment the Minister on the fact that he has made every effort to bring Ballymun satellite town into one constituency, where identification with public representatives can be more facile for tenants in the area.  At the same time, I think that these tenants might find it difficult to communicate with their public representatives if they were to live 18 miles away in the northern part of the constituency.  It is not for me to prophesy as to who they may be but certainly over the past four years I do not think the 12 public representatives at any one stage attended a public meeting in Ballymun and certainly not since the change of Government have the three Ministers for the area been in constant attendance.  Whatever has happened in the northern constituencies to have caused this, I do not know.  I have heard the Minister referring to what the previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, had in his Bill for a particular constituency <Col N="1443" /> but I wish to go on record as saying that I do not know or did not know at any stage what was contained in Deputy Molloy's Local Government (Amendment) Bill and I certainly did not at any stage know what was contained in this Bill, nor do I think that I should have known or that any Deputy should have known.  It is entirely a constitutional function which the Minister for Local Government and his Department must duly exercise, of balancing the number of public representatives per head of the population, with a variation of 1,000 either way.  That has been done.  In certain instances people have alleged political advantage to one party or another.  Be that as it may, the people who matter most are the electorate.  These are the people whom we must represent to the best of our ability.  No matter what may happen in a constituency, representatives will always be found and they will do their best.</P>
    <P>The Ballymun satellite town, now being introduced as one unit for parliamentary elections, will continue to be divided into two units for the purposes of local elections, That is very sad. Possibly the switching of the Finglas West A, B and C area and Finglas East A area, which comprises a population of 23,360, compared with the Drumcondra North County A and B and Finglas East E and Santry A area which comprises a population of 26,000 might be a fair swop and might help the people in Ballymun satellite town to return to the city for purposes of parliamentary representation.  If the Minister considers the matter and decides not to do it he will still have my support for this legislation; that goes without saying; but I would say that people from the Ballymun satellite town have mentioned to me that they are a little more than mildly concerned with the change envisaged and I do not think it augurs well for their morale. They are very fine people to have had the privilege of representing over the past four years.  I do not think that one could have wished for a greater privilege than to have represented them. Naturally, I will not be able to offer myself to them again in the future but <Col N="1444" /> I would ask the Minister to give that area and the people in it consideration. I am quite sure he will do that but possibly he could give them a little further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time that I have had an opportunity to speak on a Bill dealing with the revision of constituencies.  I was not a Member of either House when the 1968 revision was being debated. When the Bill now before the House was introduced I set about checking the Dáil Debates for 1968.  I found my name quoted by Deputy Clinton, who is now Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in the debate of 4th December, 1968, at column 1969 of the Official Report.  I shall not criticise the Minister, then Deputy Clinton, for mentioning my name at the time.  He was trying to make a case for the area known as Walkinstown.  He claimed that the Walkinstown area should have been included in the constituency to be known as South County Dublin. That is something that I feel I would have had to agree with if I had been a Member of the House at that time. That is water under the bridge now. The reason why I rose to speak on this occasion is that I have read the remarks made by Deputy Clinton as he was at that time in relation to Walkinstown and in relation to the No. 3 council area.  I should like to quote what Deputy Clinton said at that time:</P>

      <P>When you live in a constituency and you are intimate with what is happening in it you know the moves behind the scenes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the general election last February there were certainly moves behind the scenes in Walkinstown.  This matter was discussed in public houses by members of political parties.  They discussed how Walkinstown could be <Col N="1445" /> divided.  I want to say to the Minister for Local Government that it was neither himself nor his advisers who revised this area known as Walkinstown, which is part of my council area.  I feel that recommendations were received by members of different political parties in this regard.  During the last debate we heard about road boundaries and that the Naas Road and the Blessington roads were natural boundaries.</P>
    <P>I see that Deputy McMahon has come in.  I know I will have his support. We heard about the Naas Road being a natural boundary.  We still hear much about this road from the point of view of safety.  The Naas Road has been crossed three or four times during this revision of the constituencies.  In relation to the revision of the constituency concerning the whole of County Dublin, I would like to ask the Minister why the No. 3 council area was picked on in order to pick bits and pieces from here and there.  I referred to what the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, said during the 1968 debate in regard to Walkinstown being included in the constituency to be known as South County Dublin. That would have been a natural revision. This time the Minister has made quite sure to pick bits and pieces from here and there and to split the area of Walkinstown.</P>
    <P>We then look at the Naas Road which is part of my council area.  We come to Saggart, Rathcoole and Brittas.  This area was natural to South County Dublin and would be natural to Mid-County Dublin.  Nobody can deny that these areas would be natural to the new constituency to be known as Mid-County Dublin.  We now find they are placed in the constituency known as West County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The last time Deputy Clinton said that if he stood for the constituency of North County Dublin he would not be able to vote in the constituency in which he was living.  That is very true. At that time Deputy Clinton would have had a very safe seat if he were to stand for South County Dublin.  As a person who is involved in politics for some time and who has some <Col N="1446" /> knowledge of where support comes from, I know that Deputy Clinton would have had a very safe seat in South County Dublin.  It was well known that he had to move to North County Dublin to make way for the then Deputy Tom O'Higgins, later to become a Presidential candidate.  We heard much about natural boundaries during that debate.  We heard about the Navan Road, the Naas Road and the Blessington Road.</P>
    <P>In this revision the Naas Road has been crossed on many occasions.  We will look at the Drimnagh Road area. A piece is to be taken out which was part of South-West Dublin, Going out along the Naas Road, a cut was made into the little townland known as Kingswood.  There is Saggart, Rathcoole and Brittas.  In case there might be any doubt about what I am saying, and as Deputy McMahon is here, I would remind him that he had a resolution passed at the time in the Dublin County Council criticising the then Minister for Local Government about the manner in which the constituency of County Dublin was being revised and the fact that Walkinstown was to be included in North County Dublin.  That is on the records of Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>Coming back again to road boundaries, I find that the only real boundary which the Minister decided on in this revision was Cromwellsfort Road.  There is a particular purpose behind this.  It is well known in every part of County Dublin that this is where my greatest support comes from.  I suppose the Minister cannot be blamed too much.  He listened to his advisers from that area, and perhaps the people checking the ballot boxes on the day of the count.  I do not wish to be too critical of the Minister.  I know he has had some difficulty in his own area also.  As a person who stood in a number of elections, I was elected the last time and I must say now this would make my re-election much more difficult despite all the efforts made by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, during the debate in regard to the area of Walkinstown.</P>
    <P>During the Monaghan by-election <Col N="1447" /> we heard many speeches about the area of Meath and the fact that Ardee is being included in Monaghan.  I would like to know how the Minister could decide to include Leixlip, Maynooth and part of Kildare in the constituency of West County Dublin. As regards Mid-County Dublin, it starts at the village of Terenure and goes through Brittas along the Blessington Road.  Brittas is included in the constituency of West County Dublin.  The border into Wicklow is then crossed to get back to Mid-County Dublin.  I would like to know why there was so much talk the last time about the preservation of boundaries.  I appreciate that a number of constituency boundaries were crossed the last time.  I do not deny that.  I will not refer to sores of the past.  I want to refer to the present revision and to what I heard about the constituency of North County Dublin and the constituency of South County Dublin at the time of the previous revision.</P>
    <P>Nobody can make a case that the area of Maynooth and Leixlip is natural to the constituency of West County Dublin, taking in part of Walkinstown and Drimnagh.  At the same time with regard to Maynooth in the new constituency of Mid-County Dublin, starting in Terenure and going through Rathfarnham, Firhouse and Tallaght and then having to drive through the constituency of West County Dublin before coming back into Mid-County Dublin does not seem natural.  If anyone tried to make a case and say that the area of Blessington, Kilbride and Lackagh should be part of the new constituency of Mid-County Dublin he would need to be well-versed in the legal sense to do so successfully.</P>
    <P>I started by referring to my own council area and the area generally in County Dublin.  I admit that I am not very well-versed in regard to the corporation area of Dún Laoghaire or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  All the other council areas are within the constituency of County Dublin which is described as a full constituency. The No. 3 council area is the one the Minister chooses to pick bits and <Col N="1448" /> pieces from.  One finds one has to travel into Wicklow to get sufficient votes to make a constituency to be known as the new Mid-County Dublin constituency and then to travel into Kildare, Maynooth and Leixlip and some other parts of Kildare to get sufficient votes to have a constituency in West County Dublin.  These are the points I make.</P>
    <P>This is the first time I have spoken in this type of debate.  I am glad to be a Member of the House and to have had the opportunity to speak on this point.  I wish to refer to some of the points made by some of the speakers in regard to the area known as Walkinstown.  It was very much spoken about.  My name was quoted and it was said that I had put down resolutions which were passed at council meetings deploring the attitude of the then Minister for Local Government about the manner in which the people of Walkinstown were being treated.  I find it very difficult to understand why this area should be so mutilated on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  First, everybody knows that when a Bill of this nature is being introduced all kinds of political motives are attributed to the Minister, but anyone who is fair will agree that a Minister has a difficult job when he comes to introduce a measure of this kind.  My knowledge of the country in general is so limited that it would not be right or proper for me to speak of the different constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of play has been made about Kildare and for that reason I will say a few words about it.  Kildare has an unusual history in this context.  In the revision which took place before the previous one, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government at the time played a certain trick.  Representing my party in that constituency at the time was the Leader of the Labour Party, William Norton.  The Fianna Fáil Minister knew that the Fianna Fáil prospects of getting two seats in a three-seat constituency were nil and he decided that in the interests of Fianna Fáil Kildare would become a four-seater.  In order to do that he did the most extraordinary cutting up.  A <Col N="1449" /> small corridor was cut through Meath to take in some of Westmeath that did not even adjoin Kildare.  That stayed there until 1969 and the constituency was called Kildare.  Then, on account of a traitor having been elected for the Labour Party in Kildare, a man who had turned his back on the fine principles of his late father&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the 1969 Bill was being introduced Fianna Fáil said: &ldquo;Now with the problem solved in regard to the Labour Party, Kildare should be a three-seater.&rdquo;  Some of the people of Kildare were cut off and put into Meath and we had weeping and gnashing of teeth.  I am sorry to lose the areas that I am losing because of this Bill.  I made good friends in those areas and I got a substantial vote in them in the last election.  However, the Minister was faced with the problem either of adding 11,000 people or taking off 9,000.  One or other had to be done and anybody who studies the area will agree that Leixlip, which is an off-shoot of Dublin and in which 400 house have been built and are occupied mostly by people who would be living in Dublin, was one of the parts to be taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An article appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> stating that I have made representations to the Minister not to do this or that.  I want categorically to deny that I ever made representations of any kind to the Minister.  Knowing the Minister as I do, I know the short <Col N="1450" /> shrift he would give me.  My colleague, Deputy Power, was almost in tears about the fate of the second Fianna Fáil Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>He was shedding crocodile tears on that man's behalf. He said that the revision of the area was done in the interests of the Labour Party and he used the term &ldquo;stag party&rdquo;.  Most people did not understand that term but I did.  There is a man living in that area who is one of the greatest workers for the people.  He is a member of the Labour Party.  He did not have any influence on the drawing of the line and to say that he did is nonsense.  I would say that the Minister for Local Government does not know the &ldquo;Mr. Stag&rdquo; referred to by Deputy Power.  Nobody in the Labour Party or any other party had anything to do with the drawing of the line in Kildare.  As I have said, I am sorry to be losing the good friends I have in the areas cut off from me but I am not afraid to face Kildare as a three-seater.  I am confident now that we have restored the Labour Party in Kildare to what it was before the event of which I spoke and that we will continue to hold our one out of three seats.  I realise the Minister had a terrible job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  I congratulate the Minister on what I consider to be a good job.  He had to have a good look at all the constituencies and had to rearrange them which meant that slight alterations were made in many constituencies to justify the number <Col N="1451" /> of Deputies.  As for myself, in the next campaign I will be standing in a constituency which has been changed four times.  First, when Fianna Fáil were in power I was in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.  Fianna Fáil being disappointed at losing a by-election there decided to divide County Leitrim in two so that they could succeed.  Leitrim was divided into a Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon-Leitrim. On that occasion we succeeded in holding our seats despite the revision which was intended to deprive us of them.  There was another carve-up in 1969.  Leitrim was then in two parts while traditionally it had always been Sligo-Leitrim. In 1969 Fianna Fáil decided to make three parts of County Leitrim.  This was resented by many people.  They then had Donegal-Leitrim which stretched from the farthest end of Donegal down to Derry and up to Drumkieran in County Leitrim, although we were told that this was done to make it convenient for Deputies to represent their people.  You had Sligo-Leitrim stretching from Bunduff Bridge up to beside Boyle, County Roscommon, and a constituency stretching from the Cavan border at Newtowngore back to Enniscrone or convenient to Ballina.  We were still told this was in the interests of having closer cooperation between elected representatives and the people.</P>
      <P>It was done for one purpose only and it succeeded in 1969.  Deputy Reynolds lost his seat in Roscommon-Leitrim and Deputy Gilhawley lost his seat in Sligo-Leitrim.  But the people took a good look at it next time they went to the polls and reversed the decision: they gave two Fine Gael seats to Sligo-Leitrim and two more to Roscommon-Leitrim because they very much resented what had happened.  That is the history in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say thanks to the many people who helped to elect me under very difficult circumstances.  All North Leitrim which was beside where I lived and where many of my friends, relations and supporters were, <Col N="1452" /> was not free to vote for me; they were voting for people far down in Donegal.  I am very grateful to those good friends 50 miles away who rallied and gave me loyal support and worked hard for me and returned me and to the many people in Sligo and South Leitrim also who did such a trojan job in bringing back Deputy Gilhawley as a second member in that constituency.  That shows the people do not want gerrymandering; they want fair play.  North Leitrim should always have been left with Sligo if Leitrim were to be divided in two. That is why we have two seats&mdash;because the people took exception to it.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon-Leitrim it has been proved that when the people saw how they were being treated they decided to give two seats to the Opposition party and by doing so they returned Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Joan Burke for the one constituency.  The position as it is today shows some common sense.  We are on the way back to seeing Leitrim as a county with boundaries restored.  Nobody ever objected to Sligo-Leitrim being a constituency.  It does not interfere in any way with the boundaries.  The Minister has made the first move in bringing back North Leitrim and a small part of Donegal to make up a constituency which will prove to be a compact one because both Deputy Gilhawley and myself and Deputy MacSharry in Sligo town will be quite convenient to any part of our constituencies. That is how it should be.</P>
    <P>It was strange, after the 1969 election, to see how some of us were called to attend meetings to try to have Leitrim restored to its place on the map and identified as a county. It was strange to be called to these meetings to see what we could do about having this done when what had happened had been done by the Fianna Fáil Party for only one purpose. I attended some of those meetings and I said that we knew who had done it and why it was done.  However, the county is now on its way back and I think the Minister is doing a reasonably good job.  Let us hope we shall be alive to go into those matters again and achieve the best <Col N="1453" /> possible results.  The Opposition cannot find any fault with this change because it means a compact constituency; it does not mean carving a county into three parts.  No county deserves to be made into ribbons with a bit here and there.  I think the Minister is doing a good job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long but reading in the Dáil reports the various comments about the west of Ireland and the concern several Deputies expressed in that connection I felt it was my duty to say a few words on this Bill.  All of us were aware that this Bill had to be introduced. We knew it would be illegal to hold a general election until the Bill had gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Deputy Lalor has been concerned about the west of Ireland but, as a Deputy from a constituency that has lost 9,500 people, I would have asked him if he were present in the House who was responsible for that loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last ten years the north-west has lost 40,000 people.  If the Government who were in power were as interested then in the west at that time, there would have been no need for the area to lose seats.  In my county there are two constituencies, East and West Mayo.  The county was butchered in the last revision.  My constituency is 100 miles long, while the average throughout the country is 45 miles.  The last revision was made with one political motive in mind.  We had two Ministers from Mayo and it was quite clear they would not be elected in the south of the county if the area were not divided into east and west constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What is it now?  It is even wider now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Minister were put into two constituencies and, consequently, both were elected.  We should not fool ourselves.  That revision was for the benefit of a political party.  I appreciate the concern of the Minister for Local Government and the great problem with which he was <Col N="1454" /> faced.  He had to start from Donegal and go down as far as Clare.  The only two Deputies whom I think will be slightly affected are Deputy White and Deputy Loughnane.  Every other Deputy has been protected by the revision. I am convinced the Minister has made a thorough investigation into the entire matter and I am 100 per cent behind him in what he has done.</P>
      <P>We do not like to encroach on county boundaries but if Mayo wanted to retain seats it was necessary to have a movement across the border.  The portion of Roscommon that has come into Mayo is within 12 miles of my area.  I can attend to that area but, to be quite honest, not in the same way as a Deputy from that county.  A Deputy from a county can do far more than an outside Deputy. However, if I am elected and represent that area again, I shall do my best to represent the people from that part of Roscommon who have come into Mayo.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the speeches of Deputy McLaughlin and Deputy Reynolds.  I would ask the Deputy across the House why was Deputy McLaughlin put ten miles outside his constituency in the last revision, and why was Deputy Reynolds put 16 miles outside his constituency?  Was it to help them?  We must be realistic about the matter.  The last revision took place in order to ensure that Fianna Fáil would get more seats. Nobody could agree that it was an honest decision to put two Deputies from the Roscommon-Leitrim and the Sligo-Leitrim constituencies ten and 16 miles outside their constituencies. However, the present Minister has faced the situation realistically.  The people in the west do not want the sympathy of those who are crying about that area today.  It is too late for that now.  The Government are doing their best for the west and I am firmly convinced that when the next general election takes place the population in Mayo will have increased and we will not need any portion of Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the realistic way he has <Col N="1455" /> approached this problem.  He has dealt with the west in an honest way and I trust he will not have to make another revision of that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to make a few remarks on this Bill. For a start, we should bear in mind that the Government have been obliged to introduce the Bill because the results of the 1971 census showed a considerable shift in population within the country, particularly affecting the east and west.  It was not a question of the Government attempting to impose an electoral solution of their own choosing on the public.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we could forget for a moment the interests of the Government and Fianna Fáil and consider the general public.  One of the major advantages in this Bill, as opposed to the 1969 Act and the previous Act, is the fact that there has been a substantial decrease in the number of four-seat constituencies and a proportionate increase in three-and five-seaters. For example, we had 14 four-seaters as a result of the 1969 Act, which represented about 33 per cent of the constituencies in the country. Under the proposed 1973 Bill, it is suggested there should be ten four-seaters, bringing the proportion of such seats from 33 per cent to 23 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest that this is a very significant matter where the general public and political scientists are concerned because it is generally accepted that if you want swings, if you want changes, if you want a situation where the public might hold their own destiny in their hands to a greater extent than has happened, electorally, then you can achieve this type of situation with the odd numbers, the threes or the fives, which allow for effective change within constituencies.  It has been proved over the years that four-seat constituencies tend to allow for a continuation of the <i>status quo.</i> In that sense it would seem to me that members of the Opposition might even welcome aspects of this Bill from their Opposition viewpoint.  It is <Col N="1456" /> quite obvious that the strategy of the Fianna Fáil Party in previous Acts, other than their obligation under the Constitution, had been to insulate themselves securely in so far as was possible to continue in Government. This fact has since been admitted by the Minister for Local Government who was involved in the carve-up of 1969.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, in relation to the Dublin area where Fianna Fáil may bleat at present in relation to what they charge to be gerrymandering, that there was an extremely undesirable situation.  There was a high proportion of the vote of this country contained within Dublin but, to a great extent, that vote was impotent in the sense that there was an enormous number of four-seat constituencies and, statistically, we know that in four-seat constituencies a party with much less than 50 per cent of the vote can achieve two out of four seats.  This is precisely what happened in Dublin so the Fianna Fáil Party contesting a four-seater with, perhaps, only one-third of the votes came through with two out of four seats.  I do not think the general public would agree that this was an altogether fair situation.  By the same token, if Fianna Fáil chose to use this strategy in Dublin, it does not come very well from them to be critical of the present Bill.  Personally, while I might have some regard for the opinions of the general public or vocational groups representing elements of the general public, I have found the attitude of Fianna Fáil quite hypocritical in relation to this Bill because they are the party that carved the country electorally in 1969, obliged to do so under the Constitution but with the sole motivation of party political advantage, a fact which has since been admitted by the then Minister for Local Government, Mr Boland.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Opposition's present charges of gerrymandering fall on very deaf ears so far as I am concerned and, I believe, so far as many members of the general public are concerned.  Frankly, where the public are concerned&mdash;and this is <Col N="1457" /> probably one of the weaknesses of those of us who are politicians; we tend sometimes to underestimate their interest or lack of interest or intelligence when we are wrapped up in our own affairs&mdash;it strikes me that this whole question of the Electoral Bill is falling on fairly deaf ears.  The public at large are finding it a rather boring matter.  Among them I do not believe it is at all generating the sense of outrage which is sanctimoniously expressed by the Opposition.  Bearing past performance in mind in this area, I do not think the public are in sympathy with the Opposition's tactics.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are changes.  By the nature of things one cannot introduce electoral reform or proposed changes where constituencies are concerned without the changes affecting individual Deputies, prospective candidates and political parties.  Of course, there are isolated incidents of dissatisfaction from particular Deputies and in a sense from political parties.  You cannot possibly have change without effects.  The Opposition must also concede that there are undesirable effects in certain areas as a result of this Bill for individual Deputies and prospective candidates on this side of the House.  Obviously, the effects running across the country, in a particular constituency and in bordering constituencies in rural areas, create serious problems for all parties and most candidates.</P>
    <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Finn, who has just spoken and Deputy McLaughlin and Deputy Reynolds, I am amused at the extent to which Fianna Fáil spokesmen have referred to the west of Ireland in this debate and the effect on the west of reduced representation.  I am particularly amused that the expressions of concern have not been at all confined to western Deputies in the Opposition. We had Deputy Lalor, Deputy Colley, Deputies from the north, the east, the south, suddenly finding great concern for western population trends, western development and related topics. Deputy Finn spoke from his heart, living in the area, of the disastrous situation that had existed in Mayo for <Col N="1458" /> a generation in terms of population statistics and Deputy Wilson interjected to say that, of course, it was not their fault, that this was a world trend.</P>

      <P>It is facile to explain what is happening in parts of this country that have been denuded of people by inferring that what is happening is due to world trends.  We know there is depopulation in rural areas throughout the world; we know there is depopulation in rural areas of western European countries, but the point is that, statistically, the level of under-development and the loss of people in the west of Ireland bear no comparison with the areas mentioned by Deputy Wilson in Brittany or any other part of the EEC countries.</P>

      <P>I accept Deputy Wilson's point but it does not necessarily follow from that that what has happened in the west of Ireland bears any comparison to what has happened in what are termed the underdeveloped areas of other countries in Europe.

      <P>As Deputy Finn has stated, during most of that period the Fianna Fáil Government were in power and, consequently, they held the destiny of this country in their hands.  I accept that there were trends. I accept also that there is an extent to which a government can go but very much more could have been done. There could have been much more stabilisation in western areas but the last Government must bear some of the responsibility for what occurred.</P>

      <P>Therefore, it does not behave them to break their hearts here in talking of the depopulation of <Col N="1460" /> the west.  Their bemoanings will fall on deaf ears so far as the people of the west are concerned.  The change proposed in respect of the west is justified on the basis of statistics. Under our Constitution these statistics demand that there cannot be the same number of Deputies in the area as there have been.  In the same way, increased population in the east of the country demands increased representation.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the Opposition's viewpoint regarding this Bill to which I take considerable exception. The underlying reason for the Bill is the drastic population changes that have taken place.  Deputy Colley in particular alleged that the Government in introducing this Bill are attempting to be undemocratic and are setting out purposely to allow a greater number of people elect a Deputy in the west and a lesser number elect a Deputy in the east.  The Deputy was speaking of the tolerance factor and of the differential we have of about 1,000 per member but which, under the Constitution, we can use and he was suggesting that we should automatically allow the western representation to stand at the lower level in terms of population and the eastern part of the country to stand at the higher level.  I would like to take Deputy Colley to task in regard to these remarks and I do so for a very fundamental reason which should be noted.  In 1969 Fianna Fáil adopted this tactic of allowing, practically to an inch, representation for fewer people in the west and for more people in the east despite population statistics available then of which they were aware and which predicted future trends fairly accurately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the decisions of the Government in 1969 were based on the previous census of population and they knew that from the time of that census until the Act of 1969 there was depopulation in <Col N="1461" /> western areas and increases in the eastern areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy agree that there are more votes in the west because there are more children in the east than in the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a factor but a fairly minute one.  My point is that in 1969 the census of population had taken place and the Government, being aware of that census, arrived at conclusions which they thought were to their advantage politically and under which they allowed the minimum number of people in western areas to elect a Deputy and the maximum number in the east to elect a Deputy.  Nationally, this was very bad policy because between the time of the census and the 1969 Act there had been further depopulation in the west but further substantial increases in population in the east.  The result was that the 1969 Act was to become unconstitutional within a short time. Statisticians could have predicted very accurately for Fianna Fáil what would be the population trends for the next decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil took no account of these statistics in 1969 and for that reason this country only a short time later is faced with major electoral reforms.  Why should this waste of the people's money and of our time be necessary now?  I respectfully suggest that if the last revision had been enacted in view of future population trends it is possible that this Bill might not be necessary for another decade, thereby saving the public a great deal of time and money. To that extent the very poor approach of Mr. Boland and of the then Government <Col N="1462" /> resulted in our discussing this Bill at a time when there is much else to be discussed, such as Estimates and other Bills of importance to the nation.</P>
      <P>The particularly interesting aspect so far as the general public are concerned is that Dublin is becoming politically more significant.  It had been thought nationally that Dublin was extremely important in the matter of changing governments and of producing swings.  I do not think this was so in past elections due to the constituency arrangements; the reality of the last general election suggests that this was not so.  In fact, the reality in the last general election suggests that trends in rural Ireland, particularly in the part of Ireland from which I come, led to a change in Government.</P>
      <P>Again, in 1969 the re-election of the then Government was due to the situation in rural Ireland.  Dublin did not have all this influence nationally.  It was fairly impotent, as I have suggested.</P>
      <P>Of course, this situation has changed completely because in Dublin you are faced with 13 three-seat constituencies and this will lead to a substantial interest in political matters.  I would think this should be welcomed by the Opposition because of the fact that the public will be susceptible to individual candidates, to Governments and to Oppositions and, it would seem to me, that if we are to fight a fair fight this situation should be welcomed by any political party. With the much higher proportion of three-seaters and five-seaters representation is more prone to swings.  We welcome this as a Government.  If we were attempting to insulate ourselves we might move towards four-seaters throughout the entire country.  We will be glad to go to the public at a future election when the time comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to certain specific matters around the country.  The Minister had an extremely difficult job to do.  I do not envy him his task.  I am pleased, as a Mayo Deputy, that we have at least retained our two three-seat constituencies despite the fact that there was <Col N="1463" /> depopulation of the area.  We have managed to do that because of the fact that an area outside Mayo was brought into Mayo.  We are glad that we have retained our two three-seaters at least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy prefer east and west or north and south?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I prefer east and west.  I believe the Minister should take a look at the internal boundaries within Mayo.  For example, a not altogether desirable position has arisen where the boundary is concerned at the northern end of the constituency in that Crossmolina town is very much part of the Ballina area and is in the Ballina electoral area.  It is a town with a population of about 1,000 people.  It is only about seven miles from Ballina.  If you like, there is a great deal of commuting between the two towns.  There are many people in Crossmolina who work in Ballina. Their local newspaper is in Ballina and their major services are in Ballina.  They are very much part of that area.  There is a measure of dissatisfaction because of the fact that it is proposed to incorporate Crossmolina and certain other parts of that area in West Mayo.  The Minister and his advisers should look at this situation to see whether within the Mayo boundaries a certain change might be made which might be desirable and which would be welcomed by the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in Mayo is that, if you start bringing other areas into it, you are in an area of huge territory.  The constituency which I represent extends about 100 miles from Shrule to Blacksod.  Naturally, it is very difficult for a Deputy to service an area of this size and communications are difficult when you spend three or four days in Dublin.  I appreciate the problems the Minister had in Donegal. A five-seater seems fairly rational as a solution there.  I am pleased that the Minister did not find it necessary to alter Sligo-Leitrim or Roscommon-Leitrim in any substance.  I am not <Col N="1464" /> really qualified to talk about the Cork situation.  That seems to be another world within this country.</P>

I want to revert again to a fact which I mentioned which has not been brought to the notice of the public to the extent which should be possible, that is, the underlying fact that in 1973 an Electoral (Amendment) Bill is introduced by the Government although a major Electoral (Amendment) Bill was introduced in 1969 by the previous Government.  In this very short period of four years the fact that a change is again necessary under the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to say that I am grateful to the many Deputies who took part in this debate and remembered that it was a debate in Parliament on a serious subject. Most Deputies on both sides of the House did so but, unfortunately, a few seemed to forget that they were not at a church gate and indulged in some things which are not acceptable in ordinary Parliamentary circles.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I sat right through the debate with the exception of a few days when I was in Sunningdale. While I was listening to the debate, a number of people on the Government side made points which proved that they did not agree with everything in the Bill.  When a referee referees a match, if one side agrees with him on everything and the other side disagrees he is a bad referee, but if both sides find fault with him usually he is fairly fair.  There seemed to be an element of that in the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>A couple of people from the Fianna Fáil side not only made wild statements while I was here but also when I was over in Sunningdale the wailing of the lost souls in Fianna Fáil reached me there.  They were either terribly afraid of the outcome for some reason or other, or they were putting on an act.  I do not know which.  What amuses me about all this is that a number of people in Fianna Fáil, and particularly ex-Ministers, seem to have a persecution complex.  First of all, they accused RTE of being against them and showing them up in a bad light, then the Government Information Bureau, then the national newspapers, and now they have descended on me and are saying I am deliberately persecuting them and putting them on the cross, and God knows I would not do that to anybody.</P>

      <P>I suppose we may expect that sort of thing.  From some of the comments made by ex-Ministers it would appear that they are making a very bad mistake.  They are judging the Government by their own standards and, when they do that, they expect things to be done <Col N="1466" /> which we would not dream of doing. I suppose it is one of those things.</P>
      <P>One thing I resented very much&mdash; and unfortunately I was not present to hear it&mdash;was that at least one Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches took the opportunity to make an attack on the officials of my Department and on other officials.  I should like to say that anything in this Bill which is disliked by Fianna Fáil, or by anybody else, is my responsibility and I take responsibility for it.  The officials of the Department are an excellent group doing a good job irrespective of who is in power.</P>

      <P>It is very unfair that someone should take advantage of this House to make an attack on such officials, particularly as one of the people who made the attack was a rather senior member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is rather a pity that it should have happened.</P>
      <P>We had during the debate a remarkable statement by some of the Deputies opposite to the effect that, in order to make the Bill a good Bill, there should be a definite pattern of some kind.  Deputy Molloy seemed to go to town on this.  He talked about the three-seat constituencies and the five-seat constituencies.  Let me make something very clear, if it is not already clear to everybody in this House and outside it: nobody can guarantee an election result.  Nobody can guarantee in 1973 what the result of an election will be in 1977 or 1978 following a change in constituency boundaries. Is it not quite true that no matter what Government are in power, when there are a number of three-seat constituencies, as there are, particularly in Dublin, if the Government in power are doing well when the election takes place then the Government will benefit by three-seat constituencies; if they are doing badly then the Opposition will benefit.  For goodness sake, would people exercise ordinary common sense about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Molloy has graced the House with his presence because <Col N="1467" /> there are a few things on which I should like to comment, things I am sure in which he will be very interested. Deputy Molloy and a number of other Deputies said we had not brought in much legislation since we took office.  Where my own Department are concerned, I should like to point out that the following Bills were brought in by me: the votes at 18 Bill, the Bill to validate the reduction in the rates following the Government's decision <i>re</i> health charges and housing, the Bill for the local elections and this Bill.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the Bill in general, I should like to deal with a reference Deputy Lalor made when he was speaking.  Quite frankly, Deputy Lalor being an ex-Minister, I did expect a little bit more from him. Perhaps I expected too much.  I want to make it clear, in spite of the impression he tried to create, that in the 1961 general election I headed the poll in the Meath constituency.  I got 27 per cent of the valid poll.  In 1965, I got 29 per cent, again heading the poll with 1,000 votes over the quota. As a result of Fianna Fáil manipulation of the constituencies in the Electoral (Amendment) Act of 1969 the area in which I was born and reared was taken away from me and divided between two constituencies.  I then had a very reduced poll in the new constituency, a constituency which was drawn for the purpose of getting Fianna Fáil more support, and it achieved that result.  My vote dropped to 19 per cent, but I still got elected.  On the last occasion I got 19 per cent again and I still got elected. I want to put that on record to correct the impression given that I was a hind tit man who was dragged in at the tailend.</P>
    <P>Now what I am doing on this occasion is putting the areas taken away, back where they belong, back from Cavan and Monaghan and, because of something I shall explain later, I am also taking a portion of Kildare; this will comprise a four-seat constituency.  Frankly, I have no doubt at all but that there will be a fight between Fianna Fáil and the <Col N="1468" /> Coalition parties for the fourth seat and as of this moment I believe Fianna Fáil appear to have the edge. They were only about 1,000 behind on the last occasion and they should have a good chance.</P>
    <P>You cannot win against people like Fianna Fáil in a debate like this because, when you take away a portion they think will do them harm, they yowl and, when you give them a piece that will be of assistance to them, they also yowl.</P>

      <P>I have survived a long time in this House and if Deputy C. Murphy survives as long he will look at it in the same way as I am looking at it now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy suggested that this was something new and we had, in fact, started off something that he did not consider very important at this stage.  Drawing up the constituency changes, according to him, was not so very important.  Just to refresh his memory, I should like to remind him that in August, 1972, he started the procedure officially.  I do not know whether he himself was doing it or whether it was someone else but I want to make it very clear here that I drew up this constituencies Bill. I did not have anybody else, either a senior or a junior Minister, looking over my shoulder and saying: &ldquo;Do this&rdquo; or: &ldquo;Do that&rdquo;.  I drew up the Bill and I stand over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August, 1972, Deputy Molloy started to draw up the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I want to make that clear because of references made by him on a number of occasions, by myself and by others to the question as to what was left in the Department and what was not left when I took over.  I am now stating that the originals of a number of proposals were not in the Department when I went in and, since Deputy Molloy had them under his control, I assume he took the originals away with him. Now he was perfectly entitled to do that, if he wanted to do that.  I want to make that clear because suggestions have been made that I was inventing <Col N="1469" /> this.  The originals are really not so very important because everyone who has been in ministerial office is aware that copies are kept of everything. Deputy Molloy should have been aware of that.  I am sure he was aware that there were copies of what he suggested should be done which were left behind and which were made available to me when I asked for them, but not until I asked for them.</P>
    <P>In August, 1972, there were proposals. It was proposed to have 148 seats and to give Dublin three additional seats and North Leinster one extra.  There is no great change there. As I proceed with this I shall be able to show that by the time Deputy Molloy had finished with his proposals he had turned what was supposed to be a constituencies amendment Bill into a dog's breakfast.  He will understand why I am going through this.</P>

      <P>In August, 1972, he suggested that the county of Louth with a small area of County Meath could be made a four-seater. Monaghan with part of Cavan and the part of Meath already in the constituency of Monaghan would form a three-seater.  The balance of Cavan, including the parts of Meath presently in the constituency of Cavan, with approximately 9,000 additional persons from Meath would be a three-seater. The balance of Meath constituency together with a small additional area from Kildare was to be a three-seater.  The balance of Kildare would be within range for three seats and Longford-Westmeath would be within the range for four seats.  That was not so bad at all.</P>
      <P>No changes were proposed in relation to Laois-Offaly, five seats, and Wexford, four seats.  It was proposed that part of Wicklow county, three seats, be transferred to Carlow-Kilkenny. Carlow-Kilkenny, five seats, would remain otherwise unchanged.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area, it was proposed that the city representation remain unchanged, that is, six four-seat constituencies and one three-seat constituency, that three extra seats be allocated to the county and that a new three-seat constituency, called West County Dublin be created.  It also proposed that the overlap between city and county at Baldoyle be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Munster there would be no change in relation to North-East Cork, four seats, North Kerry, three seats, East Limerick, four seats, West Limerick, three seats, and North <Col N="1472" /> Tipperary, three seats.  Both Cork city constituencies, two three-seaters were to cede a small number of persons to Mid-Cork, four seats, which, otherwise would remain unchanged.  A small number of persons were to be transferred from South-West Cork, three seats, to South Kerry, three seats.  These constituencies would remain unchanged otherwise.  Finally it was proposed that South Tipperary, four seats, take in an additional part of Waterford, three seats.  So far so good.</P>
    <P>In the West all constituencies were to remain three seaters&mdash;each county boundary was to be breached. Donegal-Leitrim was to receive a small addition from North-East Donegal which would remain otherwise unchanged.  Clare-South Galway was to receive a small transfer from Clare, which again would remain otherwise unchanged, and cede the area of Roscommon currently in Clare-South Galway to Roscommon-Leitrim. It was proposed that a small number of persons be transferred from West to North-East Galway. North-East Galway would return to Roscommon-Leitrim a small part of the area of Roscommon currently in North-East Galway.  West Mayo was to be brought up to the required level by transferring persons from East Mayo.</P>

      <P>The balance of East Mayo plus part of Roscommon-Leitrim would form a further constituency.  Sligo-Leitrim, it was proposed, would give population to Roscommon-Leitrim.  Roscommon-Leitrim, which has now received population from Clare-South Galway, North-East Galway and Sligo-Leitrim and given population to East Mayo, <Col N="1473" /> made up the final constituency. Deputy Molloy changed his mind fairly quickly&mdash;he had alternatives. They were that parts of Wicklow were to be transferred to the proposed constituencies of South County Dublin and West County Dublin.  Do you hear that Deputy Murphy?  Parts of Wicklow to be transferred to the proposed constituencies of South County Dublin and West County Dublin. Does that sound familiar?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Each constituency would remain a three-seater.  Part of Wicklow was to be transferred to Kildare. Kildare in turn was to transfer population to Meath and all would be three-seaters.</P>
      <P>In September 1972 he again had a change.  Here he has some gems.  The counties of Cavan and Monaghan, plus part of County Louth were to form a five-seat constituency.  County Meath with some additions from Louth and North County Dublin was to become a four-seater, while the balance of Louth was to remain a three-seater. Dublin, less population to Meath and Wicklow, was to have 40 seats (ten four-seaters).  Wicklow with population from Dublin and Kildare was to become a four-seater.  The balance of Kildare was to form a three-seater. These were all in September.  He was working very hard at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In September, 1972, proposals for the west were reviewed.  The Minister indicated that the Oranmore-Annaghdown areas should not be removed from the West Galway constituency and that if possible, the part of Oranmore town, the new Kilraine estate which is not contained in the district electoral division of Oranmore should be added to the constituency. In the revised scheme which was submitted the townlands of Moneyduff and Oranhill, which include the Kilraine estate from the district electoral division of Clarinbridge, were added to the existing West Galway constituency. However, the previous scheme for the west envisaged that almost 3,000 people would be removed from West Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> As this could not be done under the revised proposals it was necessary to change the proposals already submitted for all of the constituencies in the area, except East and West Mayo and North-East Donegal, to bring them within the constitutional limits.  The changes envisaged were as follows&mdash; here we come to the real meat&mdash;I should not say &ldquo;meat&rdquo; because I called it a dog's breakfast and there would not be much meat in that.</P>
    <P>In relation to Donegal-Leitrim, in addition to taking population from North-East Donegal, it was proposed to transfer population to Sligo-Leitrim. Sligo-Leitrim plus the addition from Donegal-Leitrim was to give population to Roscommon-Leitrim and to Longford-Westmeath.  West Galway, as outlined above was to receive population from Clare-South Galway.  North-East Galway in addition to giving population to Roscommon-Leitrim was to take population from Clare-South Galway. Roscommon-Leitrim was to take population from Sligo-Leitrim, North-East Galway and Longford-Westmeath and to give population to Longford-Westmeath and East Mayo.  Longford-Westmeath, it was envisaged, would give population to Roscommon-Leitrim and take population from Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon Leitrim. Clare-South Galway was to give population to North-East Galway and West Galway and take population from Clare.  Finally Clare was to give population to Clare-South Galway.  He rested after that.  In December, 1972, he decided to change the west again. All constituencies were to be three seaters.  It was proposed that North-East Donegal in addition to giving population to Donegal-Leitrim would also receive population from Donegal-Leitrim. Perhaps Deputy Blaney would be interested to know why that was done.  West Mayo was to take population from West Galway and East Mayo and to receive population from East Mayo in return.  East Mayo, it was envisaged, was to take population from West Mayo and Roscommon-Leitrim and also to give population to West Mayo.  It was proposed that West Galway would give population to West Mayo and take <Col N="1475" /> population from Clare-South Galway and North-East Galway.  North-East Galway, in addition to taking population from Clare-South Galway was to give population to West Galway.  The proposals for Roscommon-Leitrim were a combination of those already submitted.</P>
    <P>In Munster no change was proposed in relation to East and West Limerick and Kerry.  Additional transfers were proposed from South-West Cork to South Kerry, three seats.  In the Cork region six three-seat constituencies were proposed as follows: South-West Cork plus transfer from Mid-Cork; East Cork was to comprise the southern part of the existing constituency of North-East Cork, together with a transfer of population from Cork City.</P>
    <P>Here I want to make it very clear that Deputy Molloy, in each of his proposals no matter what they were, proposed to take almost the same amount of population from Cork City to a county constituency as I did. If that is not true Deputy Molloy can deny it.  I am stating that this is what he proposed in all of his proposals.  I was amazed Deputy Molloy asked me the other day why I did not take from North City and put it in with North-East Cork.  He felt he might have some more backing if I embarrassed the former Taoiseach by going into his area.  I did not do that because I have too much respect for that gentleman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy the net result, complete with maps if necessary.  East Cork was to comprise the southern part of the existing constituency of North-East Cork together <Col N="1476" /> with a transfer of population from Cork City; North Cork was to comprise the northern portions of the present constituencies of North-East Cork and Mid-Cork.  The balance of Mid-Cork plus several thousand persons from Cork City were to form the new Mid-Cork constituency; the balance of Cork City was to form two three-seater constituencies.  Waterford, with part of South Tipperary, was to become a four-seater constituency and the balance of South Tipperary was to become a three-seater.</P>
      <P>In South Leinster the county of Offaly and part of County Laois was to become a three-seater.  The balance of County Laois plus part of Kilkenny and Carlow was also to become a three-seater.  The balance of Carlow and Kilkenny together with part of Wexford&mdash;as at present&mdash;was to become a four-seat constituency.  Deputy Lalor might be interested to hear of this because it was obvious from what he said in this House that he was not aware of what was going on.</P>
      <P>The county of Louth, less population to be transferred to Cavan-Monaghan which was to be a five-seater as previously proposed and to Meath was to remain a three-seater. The county of Meath, together with population from Louth and less population to be transferred to Kildare, was also to be a three-seater.  Kildare, with transfers from Dublin and Meath and less population to Wicklow, was to become a four-seater.  Finally, Wicklow, with population from Kildare, was to become a four-seater.  A scoop was put in in order to bring Deputy Bermingham's town into Wicklow.  I am sure that was purely accidental and I would not accuse Deputy Molloy of having any ulterior motive in this regard.  Accidentally his pen or the scalpel or whatever he was using, slipped.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy was putting back the portion that was taken from Meath and given to Monaghan and Cavan.  He was having a little narrow constituency of Meath taking in Ardee from County Louth and a bit beside it and making it a three-seater. We know why he was doing that.  He was then making a four-seater with the remainder of Meath, portion of County Dublin and portion of County Kildare.  He was then taking part of County Kildare, moving the town of Athy nearly across country and putting it into Wicklow and making Wicklow a four-seater, because he was trying to cut out Deputy Joe Bermingham.</P>

      <P>As far as the west was concerned, at one stage he was putting the whole town of Athlone into Roscommon-Leitrim, and a large tract of Leitrim was attached to Longford-Westmeath. This was a nice bit of doodling.  This area would be drawn partly from the Sligo-Leitrim constituency and partly from the Roscommon-Leitrim constituency.  The effect of this would be to divide the <Col N="1482" /> unfortunate county of Leitrim between four constituencies.  At least I have divided Leitrim between two, and there is a natural boundary between the areas where I have drawn the dividing line which has been recognised by the people who live there.  Deputy Molloy was going to divide Leitrim into quarters.</P>

      <P>It is on top of Deputy Molloy and he cannot scramble out from under it.  Part of West Galway around Leenane would go to West Mayo; a hunk of Roscommon would be added to East Mayo, and a further slice of Clare around Ennistymon would end up in Galway.  If the youngest child who could use a pencil was doing this sort of thing it would be considered that it was wasting paper.  Deputy Molloy seriously proposed this, and having done it had maps drawn to show what the result would be.</P>

      <P>As a further refinement there were to be two-way transfers of territory between the two Donegal constituencies and between the two Mayo constituencies, and I am not offering any prizes as to what Deputies would suffer under those exercises.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Mid-Cork would be made a five-seater.  He decided then that this might not be the thing to do, so he said: why not change every constituency in the Cork area and establish six three-seaters?  This is what Deputy Molloy probably meant when he talked about a logical pattern; <Col N="1483" /> he would make all three seaters around there, and under the arrangement Mid-Cork would include several thousand people from the city, including all the area outside Victoria Cross.  It is extraordinary to see people shedding crocodile tears about the reasonable proposal I made to put portion of Cork City into a five-seat Mid-Cork constituency, when Deputy Molloy was putting it into a three-seat constituency.</P>

      <P>The constituency of South Kerry was below the minimum for a three-seater and must get population from somewhere.  According to Deputy Molloy, there was a very simple way to do it: you transfer population from East Limerick to West Limerick; and from West Limerick to North Kerry; and from North Kerry to South Kerry.  What could be simpler than that?  I am sure Deputy Tom Kyne would be glad to know that he was not in for the knife this time, because the area which was to be included this time which was going from Waterford to Tipperary included Portlaw and Rathgormack. Again, there are no prizes as to the intention in putting that little area in. Again in South Leinster there was a very interesting proposal.  Deputy Molloy was going to break up the historic constituencies of Laois-Offaly and Carlow-Kilkenny.  The county of Offaly and a small part of Laois was to become a three-seater; the rest of Laois, with a large slab of Kilkenny and a somewhat smaller slab of Carlow, was to be another three-seater. What was left over from the counties of Carlow and Kilkenny would be tacked on to Wexford to <Col N="1484" /> make up another three-seater.  There is nothing like a logical pattern.  Deputy Molloy really was going about it in the right way.</P>

      <P>A number of people were very interested in what was happening in Meath.  It was said that as it was my area I was ensuring I would be elected.  I shall be elected, in spite of Fianna Fáil, as long as I am able to stand up on a platform.  I have proved that.  I took a seat from Fianna Fáil after 25 years and I shall hold that seat as long as God spares me to stand for it, whether it is a three-seater, a four-seater or a five-seater constituency. Meath was to lose further large hunks to Cavan and Louth, and half of Cavan was to go to Monaghan.  This was the original proposal.  Then an alternative came up.  Cavan and Monaghan and part of Louth were to form a five-seater, Meath, with a large part of Drogheda town and a strip of North County Dublin, was to be a four-seater. Wicklow, with a strip of Kildare and Dublin, was to be another four-seater.  The possibilities of this are still not exhausted.</P>

      <P>May I inquire from the Chair whether the Chair is serious or not in issuing warnings to Deputy Molloy and his colleagues or is the debate going to be continued in this strain so that the Minister will be prevented from making his case and Deputies who are interested in hearing what the Minister has to say are prevented from doing so by unruly interruptions?  Surely the Chair has the responsibility for maintaining order in the House.  If the Chair is to be taken lightly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am going to make one final comment in order to take them out of their agony.  While a number of their Deputies wanted to know why we did not bring in a commission, a number of Deputies who might not be here to hear it but who will read it in the Official Report, were very strongly opposed to a commission and said that it was the job of this House.  I have read up the matter since I spoke on Deputy Fitzpatrick's Bill and while I still feel that there is merit in having a commission dealing with this matter, apparently the Constitution as at present laid out does not so allow.  It has to be decided by this House eventually.  That is No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. 2, if Fianna Fáil are still as much in favour of a commission as <Col N="1489" /> they appear to be, as their Leader, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch was the night he lost the election&mdash; for the first time he thought a commission would be a good thing&mdash; would Deputy Lynch approach the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, in the new year and talk about it after I have straightened out the constituencies and made them so that they can be worked on in future in a fair way, not the way Fianna Fáil cut them up the last time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at this point that we have now agreed in a very short time to a total sum of many millions of pounds and the Minister will recall that on previous occasions when he and his colleagues were on this side they made great complaints about this and appeared in their complaints to be blaming the Government for the fact that it was necessary to pass all these Estimates without discussion and in a very short time.  I should like to point out on this occasion that very little legislation on the Government's initiative has come before the House, one of the consequences being that in so far as most of that legislation was legislation initiated by Fianna Fáil there was much less discussion from this side of the House than normally would have been the case on such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, the situation was easier for the Government this year than it would normally have been for any Government.  Despite that, we find ourselves passing these vast sums of money at this stage without any discussion.  I understand, as well as the Minister does, the reasons for this.  I understand the difficulties involved and the necessity for our doing <Col N="1502" /> it.  Nevertheless, it is legitimate for me to point out that the previous complaints by the Minister and his colleagues when they were in Opposition should be directed at them now with greater force because, as I indicated, the programme of legislation we have had this year under the present Government has not entailed anything like the same protracted discussion that would occur in a normal year under any Government. Consequently, criticism should be directed with even greater force at the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Colley was anxious to ensure that finality would not be reached on the Estimates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley overlooked the fact that as there was less legislation there was more time available to discuss the Estimates.  If more Estimates were not debated it was because the Opposition decided to spend an inordinate length of time discussing a few Estimates.  This is one of the areas in which we have already asked Committees of the House to see that the time of the House will be more evenly distributed so that important areas are not overlooked, and that every item of expenditure could be examined either in the House or at committee level.  It would be better that these areas of expenditure would be reviewed even in a short period rather than that they should be ignored or passed through in this very speedy manner.  But this is a matter which I think can be remedied by co-operation on both sides.  It is not something that can be cured by either side of the House scoring points at this time of year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I readily admit that we have learned from experience of both Opposition and Government and <Col N="1503" /> we think this is one of the most benign influences to follow as a result of the wise decision of the people this year, that those who are now in Opposition know what it is like to face the consequences of being in Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is more disappointed than the Minister for Finance that more of these areas of expenditure have not been closely examined in the House but, as I say, when there was less legislation than in other years there was more time available for Estimates and yet we arrive at the stage when we have to pass these allocations because the business has not been completed. Perhaps we can remedy the situation in the not-too-distant future by co-operation on all sides.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £30,200,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to reopen too many old wounds but I should like to say that the figure involved in this reveals very clearly that the Minister did have available to him the savings arising from our entry into EEC on agricultural subsidies.  In fact, if one extracts those from the figure here one finds that the Minister is spending less additional money in this financial year on social welfare <Col N="1504" /> than we spent last year at a time when we not only imposed no new taxation but gave some relief to income tax payers, unlike the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley is allowing his thoughts to be influenced by his wishes.  The truth is that the money which the country hoped to have available for social service improvements this year had already been allocated by the previous Administration in order to keep last year's services running at the same level so that none of that money was available to finance social welfare improvements this year.  It is interesting that the figure for which I now seek approval, £30,200,000, is about £3 million less than anticipated.  This is because we have fewer people unemployed. The only saving we had was on the unemployment vote and this is as a consequence of the deliberate, expansionist programme of the present Government who have increased the number of jobs and have substantially improved the economy. We make no apology for having saved money in respect of unemployment although the rates of unemployment benefit and assistance paid were substantially improved.  We have succeeded in having the necessary money to fund this vote reduced because the number of unemployed has fallen.  That is most significant and is proof that the economy is doing extremely well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to deal with this matter on the Adjournment Debate but how can the Minister suggest any money arising out of EEC membership was expended by the previous Government when it did not accrue until he came into office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said this again and again but I shall say it once more for the benefit of poor Deputy Colley in the hope that, through repetition, it will yet penetrate.  The opening deficit, had it not been for the EEC money would have been £49 million but because they used £29 million out of the EEC money to conceal the size of their deficit the opening deficit was only £20 million.  But you do not have <Col N="1505" /> £29 million to spend if you already have had to write it off in order to reduce the size of the deficit.  If anybody can prove the contrary to me I would say he would be enunciating a mathematical theory that has yet escaped all mankind.</P>

      <P>The Minister in taking these questions together included one put down by me regarding the glasshouse industry.  I appreciate that the Minister is aware of the problem but will he go the full way today and guarantee supplies at least during the winter period when they are so necessary for the glasshouse industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not guarantee a 100 per cent supply for the glasshouse industry or for the fishing or any other industry in the present situation.  My Department have been in touch with the horticultural section of the IFA and other people interested in the glasshouse industry. Every effort will be made to ensure that they will get an adequate supply but in the present situation I cannot guarantee everyone will have enough oil to carry him over the winter period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The main problem in the glasshouse industry is the <Col N="1509" /> continuity of supply.  If a glasshouse owner has not oil supplies for every single night, if he is deprived of supply on a night when there may be frost, his entire crop and all his work for the previous 12 months may be ruined.  Glasshouse owners could operate on a slightly less than full supply&mdash;what is vital is continuity of supply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishing situation is difficult.  There was a problem in Burtonport, Cahirciveen, Galway and another port but this has been resolved. There is a problem in that fleets that would normally be stationed at Burtonport may be fishing off Waterford and the Dunmore area.  The oil companies are looking into the feasibility of having supplies taken around the country in tankers for the fishing fleets. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are in contact with the oil companies and they are advising regarding the location of the fishing fleets on particular days. Efforts have been made to ensure that there will be oil available to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In April, 1971 Ireland was invited by the OECD to take part in the work of a joint <i>ad hoc</i> group which was being set up to carry out a <Col N="1518" /> study on pollution by the pulp and paper industry.  It was considered that, because of the small size of the pulp and paper industry in Ireland, this country would have little to contribute, and, accordingly, it was decided not to participate in the study.  The group reports to the industry committee of the OECD on which my Department are represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two opposite considerations here; one is the desirability of having all possible information available to us and the manning of every possible committee available to us while the other requirement is to take care to ensure that the work load on the existing civil service does not become unbearable. The Deputy will be aware that because of our new EEC commitments the work load has increased considerably. Also, there is the desirability of keeping the growth of the civil service within reasonable balance.  We endeavour to man every committee that is important and we make judgments as to which can be omitted.  On the basis that any serious decisions emanating from the <i>ad hoc</i> committee went to the industry committee on which we are represented, we made the judgment&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that we should not participate in the <i>ad hoc</i> group.  Of course, we would like to be represented on all committees but we have not enough personnel for this.</P>

I had a meeting recently with members of the board of the hospital who clearly represented to me the feelings of the board and of the staff and students concerning the existing situation.

      <P>I understand that the board of the hospital have the question of equipment in the hospital, particularly in the department of conservative dentistry, at present under urgent examination.  This is a matter in which the board exercise primary responsibility. The dental education grant which my department provide annually towards the current expenses of the hospital is earmarked only in respect of the remuneration of the teaching staff.  The remainder of the grant is, in conjunction with funds provided through the medium of the Department of Health, spent at the discretion of the board.</P>

      <P>There is a difference between happiness and justification. Of course I am not happy that I had to increase the fee but I will now proceed to show the Deputy that the increase was justified.  The last increase in these fees was in 1964.  Since 1964 the increase in the consumer price index was approximately 63 per cent.  The corresponding increase in the entry fees based on that percentage increase would have been £1.63, intermediate, and £2.03, leaving. These figures were rounded down to £1.50 and £2 respectively.  Approval was received from the National Prices Commission to introduce these new fees for the 1974 examinations.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy at (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) is given in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report together with a list of the centres in which community schools are being built and which are due to open in September 1974, and a list of the centres in which the establishment of community schools is being considered.</P>
      <P>My Department proposes in the newly developed areas of the cities to set up community schools or other agreed school structures to provide for the educational needs of these areas.  Where there are two or three small schools in need of replacement or major extension my Department's aim is for the development of community schools or of schools in close co-operation in these areas.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">COMMUNITY SCHOOLS.</P>
      <P>(a)  Number of Schools: 12.</P>
      <P>(b)  Where situated:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering this question I will deal only with the differences in concept between a community school and a comprehensive school that apply in this country. Comprehensive schools are intended to serve as experimental schools in addition to their ordinary functions and on that account the number will be strictly limited.  Otherwise the functions of the two schools are identical: they both serve a total community and are unrestrictive as to entry.</P>
      <P>One other difference between a community school and a comprehensive school is that I am represented on the board of management of the latter, whereas the board of management of the community school is drawn entirely from the locality served by the school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of reports (details supplied) concerning the placing of a young boy in an institution arising from court proceedings under the School Attendance Act, 1926; and the arrangements his Department have made to enable the parents to visit their child regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The School Attendance Act, 1926, provides that where a parent, without reasonable excuse, fails or neglects to cause his child to attend school and warnings and fines have no effect, the district justice may order the child to be sent to a certified Industrial school. The object of this measure is to ensure that the child receives the education which is his right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> I am advised that the case of the child referred to in the reports was before the local District Court on seven occasions between December, 1972 and September, 1973.  Between July 1st, 1971 and March 3rd, 1973, he had been absent from school 176 days out of 320 school days.  On the first court appearance the father was fined for failing to send the child to school.  On five subsequent occasions the case was adjourned to see if there would be an improvement in the boy's attendance.  As no improvement occurred, the court ordered that the child be sent to St. Joseph's Residential Home, Salthill.  The authorities of the home have taken special care of this boy, who is attending a local national school in Galway.  On arrival he was found to be very far behind educationally and was placed in a special remedial class.  I am glad to say that, according to reports, he is making excellent progress in his new environment and it has since been found possible to place him in an ordinary class.</P>
    <P>My Department considers it most important that the link with the parents be maintained in the case of children in care in residential homes and special schools.  To that end free transport is provided once a quarter to enable the parents to visit their children.  The parents are quite free to visit more frequently at their own expense, if they so wish.  These arrangements apply to the child referred to in the Deputy's question.  I may add that the parents have also been invited to take him home for the Christmas holidays.</P>

This was unfortunate in many ways because it brought the boy's name to the attention of the public in a way that was not in the best interest of his education.  It is very important that children be given an opportunity of attending school regularly.  This is not possible due to various factors in some cases outside the control of parents and in some cases it is due to parental neglect.  I do not wish to make any comment on this particular case but I would counsel everybody not to use individual boys cases as a means for gaining publicity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Committee on Industrial and Reformatory Schools recommended that the terms &ldquo;Industrial School and Reformatory&rdquo; should be replaced respectively by the terms &ldquo;Residential Home and Special School&rdquo;.  These terms are now used by my Department except where use of the older terms is necessary for statutory reasons.  I propose to use the new terms in this reply.</P>
      <P>I should like to apologise that this answer is so long.</P>
      <P>Measures taken since the issue of the report may be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  As a result of the initiative of the Minister for Health, 40 additional posts as social worker have been created in the health boards since March last and the Minister has asked the boards to expand the home help service with special emphasis on families in stress situations.  In addition, the welfare service of the Department of Justice is being very rapidly expanded from 20 officers last year to 46 this year and it is expected to have 70 by next year. These measures are helping to give effect to the first major recommendation of the report which was that &ldquo;the whole aim of the child care system should be geared towards the prevention of family break-down and the problems consequent on it&rdquo;.  The second part of this first recommendation urged that &ldquo;admission of children to residential care should be considered only when there is no satisfactory alternative&rdquo;.  It is of interest to note in this regard that the number of children in residential care in institutions under my Department has fallen from 2,565 in 1968 to 1,608 at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The second major recommendation of the Kennedy Report urged the <Col N="1548" />&ldquo;institutions system of residential care should be abolished and be replaced by group homes&rdquo;.  The first specially constructed group home was opened last October in Moate.  Four other homes&mdash;in Drogheda, Cappoquin (2) and Limerick&mdash;Good Shepard&mdash;are under construction and plans are well advanced for a number of others.  In addition, private houses have been purchased as residential homes in Rathdrum, Killarney, Kilkenny, Booterstown, Limerick, Good Shepard, and Sligo and existing buildings have been converted to the group home system in Waterford, Sunday's Well, Cork, Whitehall, Limerick, Mercy, Mallow, Lakelands and Dundalk. This recommendation also said that &ldquo;children from one family and children of different ages and sex should be placed in such group homes&rdquo;.  This is being done.</P>
    <P>(3)  A new special school on entirely modern lines has been built at Lusk, County Dublin, and will be ready for the reception of boys referred by the courts within the next few weeks. With the provision of this new school, St. Conleth's Reformatory, Daingean, has been closed, thus giving effect to the third major recommendation in the report.</P>
    <P>(4)  The fourth recommendation of the report asked that the remand home at Marlborough House be closed and replaced by a more suitable building. Marlborough House was closed in August, 1972.</P>
    <P>(5)  A new children's centre has been opened at Finglas, which includes a special school and a remand and assessment unit.  The objective in these new types of special school is the rehabilitation of the children concerned through a programme of education, using the term in its very widest sense.  The purpose of the remand and assessment centre is to ensure that no child is admitted to a special school without a full examination&mdash;medical, social, psychological and, if necessary, psychiatric.</P>
    <P>(6)  The fifth recommendation in the report was to the effect that the staff in the institutions should be fully-trained. <Col N="1549" /> In pursuance of this aim, a one-year residential course in child care has been in operation in Kilkenny since 1971.  Intensive in-service courses are at present in operation in Golden-bridge in Dublin and in Waterford and my Department is actively examining the further training needs of residential staff.</P>
    <P>(7)  The grants system for residential homes now enables children in care to be paid for by the State while they complete their education up to third level if required.  This gives effect to the intention in the sixth recommendation that &ldquo;all children in residential care should be educated to the ultimate of their capacities&rdquo;.  The children in residential homes attend ordinary local schools and special education is provided as appropriate. As regards the special schools, I have already indicated that a special intensive education programme is in existence.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Kennedy Report, in its seventh major recommendation, stated that &ldquo;after care ... should form an integral part of the child care system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the case of the residential homes, the homes themselves increasingly maintain contact with the young people who have been in residence. Special after-care hostels have been provided in homes in Dublin and Cork.  I expect the health authorities, social work services, to which I have already referred, to participate in this work.  In the case of the special schools, the welfare service of the Department of Justice, to which I have also already referred, is providing an after-care service closely integrated with the schools.</P>
    <P>(9)  the eighth, ninth, tenth and twelfth major recommendations urged, respectively, that administrative responsibility for child care be transferred to the Department of Health, that there should be a new, up-dated Children Act, that the age of criminal responsibility be raised to 12 years and that an independent advisory body with statutory powers be set up.  These four recommendations <Col N="1550" /> require new legislation and interdepartmental consultations are at present being actively pursued with a view to tackling the issues in question.</P>
    <P>(10)  The eleventh major recommendation was to the effect that the special schools and residential homes should be paid on a budget system rather than by capitation grant.</P>
    <P>In making this recommendation the committee of inquiry was concerned to ensure that the financial support to the schools and homes was sufficient to cover all costs connected with the maintenance of the children. The new special schools at Finglas and Lusk are, in fact, being paid in this way and a similar arrangement will be introduced in other special schools according as modernisation plans are completed.  While a budgetary system has not been introduced in any of the residential homes, the need to ensure that they have an adequate income has been met by increases in the capitation grant.  This grant has been increased by 300 per cent over the past five years.  In addition, extra grants have been made to a large number of homes for works involving the maintenance, renovation or modernisation of the buildings.</P>
    <P>(11)  The final major recommendation of the report was a plea for continuous research in this field.  As I stated in the Seanad recently, I have asked officers of my Department to prepare a list of subjects on which research is necessary with a view to taking action on this recommendation.</P>

The teachers in these special schools avail of these courses.  I should also point out that there is a very favourable teacher-pupil ratio within these schools.  But, as to the specific point made by the Deputy, I would need to have it investigated further before I could give a definite reply.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £10 chun íochta an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníochta i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1974, le haghaidh tuarastail agus costais Roinn an Taoisigh.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Probably the most important events affecting our country over the past year or so have been developments on Northern Ireland, our entry into the European Economic Community and on the domestic front, the social welfare increases and the way in which inflation is affecting our economy.  I propose to deal briefly today with these subjects, as well as reviewing developments in the economy generally and organisational changes in the public service.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for the laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas copies of the agreed communique on the conference at Sunningdale on the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th December between the British and Irish Governments and the parties involved in the Northern Ireland Executive-designate.</P>
      <P>The communique is the result of approximately four days of close negotiations between this Government, the British Government and members of the Executive-designate for Northern Ireland.  The wording of the communique is I believe clear and I do not think it necessary or useful to enter here into a detailed commentary on it, or interpretation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing now is to make what was agreed at Sunningdale work for the benefit of all the people of Ireland.  Not merely do we want to see the power-sharing Executive, and the Council of Ireland, come into being early in the new year, we also want to see them come into being <Col N="1553" /> under the best possible auspices; that is to say with maximum growth in mutual confidence between the different groups and interests which will make up these institutions.  This process would not, in my Government's view, be helped if each party to the agreement were to enter into detailed exposition of its own particular interpretation of the communique, or of any part of it.</P>
    <P>The Sunningdale agreement opens out a new prospect of hope for peace and reconciliation and co-operation in this island.  But we cannot just take the realisation of that hope for granted.</P>
    <P>We, all of us had to work hard at Sunningdale to bring about the agreement recorded in the communique. We shall, all of us, have to work even harder in the months to come, and to show a great deal of patience on all sides, if we are to build on that agreement the living reality of co-operation in mutual confidence and mutual respect.</P>
    <P>The Sunningdale agreement, and all it represents, are threatened by violent men on two sides.  These men play into one another's hands; both their language and their actions are increasingly similar.  They are trying to keep hate and fear alive in this country because they feed on hate and fear.  They are likely to seek, in the months to come, to wear down the patience and the nerve of those who reached agreement at Sunningdale.  I am confident that they will no succeed in this desperate enterprise.  They will not succeed because there is at last coming into being, on a firm basis, a working understanding of the centre, representing the united strength of the sensible elements in this island, drawn from both communities and both traditions of allegiance.</P>
    <P>There is good reason to believe that by a very great majority the people of this island approve of what was agreed at Sunningdale and will support the institutions deriving from that agreement. Here I would like to express my appreciation of the constructive response of the Press here, irrespective of party, to the Sunningdale agreement. <Col N="1554" /> I hope and I believe that this debate also will strengthen the Sunningdale agreement by showing that there is a strong consensus in the Dáil in favour of this agreement.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that many persons reading the agreement will criticise parts of it in isolation from the remainder.  That is not the way in which it can be read.  This agreement is a unit.  No one part of it can be taken in isolation from the other parts. Those who say they do not want the statements on the status of Northern Ireland must also say that they do not want a Council of Ireland.  The policing, human rights and law reform proposals are equally part of the totality of the agreement.  In particular, anyone who contemplates rejecting the agreement should remember, that without that agreement&mdash;and I mean the whole of that agreement&mdash;the power-sharing Executive in the North, could not come into being.  I would ask Deputies and the people of Ireland to regard it in the light of these remarks &mdash;which is the way in which it was negotiated and accepted by the two Governments and three other parties at the conference.  And I would ask, in particular, that when debating it Deputies should remember that lives depend on the way the agreement is interpreted and implemented.</P>
    <P>The next stage&mdash;the more formal stage of the tripartite talks will take place early in the new year.  In the meantime the Northern Ireland Executive will have been appointed and power will have been devolved by Westminster to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Council of Ireland will be constituted following the resumed tripartite conference at which a formal agreement will be reached between the sovereign Governments concerned.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I think it is generally agreed by most of the public that the outcome of the historic Sunningdale negotiations was an encouraging one.  What was even more encouraging for all of us who were present there was the spirit in which the negotiations were conducted and in which the outcome was received.  In the course of the very close negotiations, <Col N="1555" /> including one negotiation that went on all night, the parties concerned showed remarkable patience, as well as a tenacity that put the patience of their partners also to the test.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr. Heath, showed his sense of the importance of these proceedings by the assiduity with which he took part in the conference, and the notable personal contribution which he made to them.  The three partners to the Northern Ireland Executive&mdash;Mr. Faulkner's Unionists, the SDLP and the Alliance parties&mdash;constituted in effect the key-stone of the Sunningdale agreement.  Without their previous historic agreement to share power in an Executive, nothing which subsequently took place would have become possible.  In the proceedings at Sunningdale they showed the same resource and the same combination of firmness and flexibility that had enabled the Executive to come into being.</P>
    <P>My own delegation also played its full part in the negotiating process that led to agreement.  But the most encouraging thing of all about Sunningdale was the reaction of all delegates when agreement was finally reached.  All delegations, and I believe every member of every delegation was genuinely and spontaneously happy at the outcome, and this was visible and audible around us on the afternoon the agreement was signed.  There were, as I had hoped there would be, no winners and no losers.  But something had come about by which we can all stand to win; that is an increase in mutual confidence and mutual respect.  On that we intend to build effective co-operation in the future.</P>
    <P>Following the sluggish performance of the economy in the three years 1970-1972 when the growth rate averaged only 3 per cent&mdash;a figure well below national productive capacity&mdash;activity has speeded up and the growth rate this year is likely to be of the order of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>This improvement has been due mainly to the vigorous fiscal policies <Col N="1556" /> of the Government designed to take up the slack that had been allowed to develop in the three preceding years.  The Government have injected into the economy substantial sums on both capital and current account to give a boost to growth.  Estimated current expenditure for 1973-74 stands some £141 million above its level in the last fiscal year and at the same time capital expenditure has been increased by £43 million.  The financing of these large additional expenditures has been so arranged that the net borrowing requirement at £193 million is some £72 million above its 1972-73 level.  The addition to purchasing power brought about in this way is bringing about substantial increases in output and investment.</P>
    <P>The value of retail sales rose by 19 per cent in the first eight months of the year while the number of new private motor cars registered rose by over 20 per cent in the period January to October.  Exports rose in value by about 34 per cent in the first ten months of the year.  Tourist receipts have also been increasing.</P>
    <P>Consumer demand generally is estimated to have grown in volume by over 7 per cent in the period January-September. This expansion is welcome for the increase it means in living standards and general well-being, but it can take place safely only when it does not unduly encroach on the resources available for investment or cause an immoderate external deficit. These dangers are not at present manifest, but it is worth bearing in mind that we can enjoy high levels of consumption only as long as they are accompanied by high exports.</P>
    <P>The increased pace of economic activity has generated higher imports. The major increase was, however, in materials for further production and in capital goods.  This augurs well for economic activity over the coming months.  At the same time, exports are also running at a high level and the prospects are good for an acceptable out-turn to the balance of payments for the year.</P>
    <P>A disquieting feature of the economic situation is the incidence of inflation. <Col N="1557" /> The extent of our inflation is reflected in the very high rise of 11.2 per cent in the consumer price index in the year to August last, following 11.7 per cent at mid-May and 10 per cent at mid-February. While there was a slight easing in the rate of increase at mid-August, inflationary pressures both at home and abroad are still strong and no significant improvement is likely for some time having regard to the impact of higher oil prices on a wide range of goods and services.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between the external factors and the domestic factors behind the increase in the level of our consumer prices. Food prices have accounted for the major share of the increase, and while this has been partly due to domestic reasons, the dominating factors have been the world shortage of meat and other basic foods which led to an exceptional rise in prices.  In fact, import prices have generated more than one-third of the total increase in prices.</P>
    <P>As to the non-food items, the main source of the rise in prices has been the excessive increases in non-agricultural incomes.  Two main categories of income are concerned here &mdash;profits and pay&mdash;and the aim of our counter-inflationary policy is to ensure that their contribution to inflation is moderated.  The Government's price control policy is making an important contribution to that end.  We are determined to ensure that excessive price increases do not occur. We expect firms to absorb as far as possible, through increased productivity, increased costs whether for labour or non-labour items.  The National Prices Commission lay special emphasis on this principle when considering applications for price increases, and there is a clear obligation on both management and employees to ensure that the potential for improving productivity is fully exploited.</P>
    <P>The House is also aware that the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently made a number of statutory orders controlling prices and profit margins for a wide range of goods. <Col N="1558" /> These affect retailers and also importers and wholesalers.  In addition, the period of advance notice required for proposed price increases has been increased from one to two months. The list of goods, whose prices must be displayed in retailers' premises, has also been extended so as to assist housewives in price comparisons between shops.</P>
    <P>These measures strengthen the price control machinery significantly.  To ensure that they will be strictly enforced, the number of price inspectors in the Department of Industry and Commerce is being increased.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is keeping the situation under constant review and will not hesitate to introduce any further necessary and practicable measures.</P>
    <P>Apart from price control, other steps to protect the consumer are being taken.  A National Consumer Advisory Council has been established and further legislation on consumer protection is envisaged.  The views of the National Prices Commission on this matter will be given full weight.</P>
    <P>As regards wages and salaries, increases since 1970 have largely been determined under the terms of the national agreements of 1970 and 1972.  The Government are committed to complying with the terms of these agreements, and they have been complied with in the determination of the increases in pay awarded to the public service members of the judiciary and to the Members of the Oireachtas.  The agreements reflect collective decisions by the vast majority of Irish workers and employers and it is in the national interest that they be maintained and supported by all, and not undermined by the actions of sectional interests.  This principle prompted the Government to introduce the legislation to control the remuneration and conditions of employment of banks staff which received unanimous support in this House.</P>
    <P>The Government favour the voluntary negotiation of a further national agreement.  Like its predecessors, this should facilitate an orderly development of incomes and <Col N="1559" /> the achievement of the important social aim of improving the position of the lower-paid.  It is doubtful whether free collective bargaining, without the framework of national agreements, would do as much to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>The negotiation of a further agreement which will contribute to the achievement of both economic and social objectives is a vital element if the community is to achieve continued economic growth with more employment, a slowing down in the rise in prices and better industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The management of monetary policy will require care and continuous review in order to maintain a reasonable balance between the diverse forces at work in the economy. Last year the total amount of bank credit increased by £320 million. While the measures introduced by the Central Bank in February had a moderating effect, the demand for credit remains strong.  The present aim of policy is to ensure a moderate rate of credit expansion sufficient to meet the reasonable needs this year of the public.</P>
    <P>Interest rates have moved strongly upwards during the year and now stand at historically high levels.  Our preference would be for lower rates but we are not immune from international movements and the openness of our economy means that there are strong influences tending to equalise rates between this country and Britain.  Our policy in this situation is directed at ensuring that rates here are no higher than is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>Our external reserve position is strong and is not expected to cause concern.  The seasonal fall in the early part of the year has been reversed and it is expected that our reserves will show little overall change for the year as a whole.</P>
    <P>Economic and other problems continue to cause uncertainties and upsets on the international monetary scene.  They have generated large movements of funds putting pressure <Col N="1560" /> on exchange markets.  These difficulties show no prospect of diminishing and will, in fact, probably be accentuated by the likely increased balance of payments of oil-producing countries and large deficits elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Twenty of the IMF are continuing their efforts to find a reformed monetary system to replace the existing Bretton Woods system, which has proved inadequate to meet the changing situation in recent years.  Progress has been slow, but this has to be expected, given the complexity of the issues involved. However, the Committee of Twenty, meeting in Nairobi on the occasion of the annual general meeting of the IMF, in order to give an impetus to the work, fixed 31st July, 1974, as a deadline for settling the issues of reform.</P>
    <P>Predicting future economic trends is at all times a hazardous business. This year the hazards are multiplied a hundred-fold by the uncertainties about the effects of the oil situation on our economy.  I would here like to add my weight to the appeal of the Minister for Transport and Power for moderation in the use of oil to which the public now seem to be responding well.  The Minister will keep the public informed of developments in that regard.</P>
    <P>The present position was fully covered by the Minister and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Dáil yesterday.  Up to now we have had a shortfall of about 15 per cent in supplies.  The reports now coming in to us put the shortage in oil supplies as high as 30 per cent. A shortage of this magnitude would give rise to serious problems.</P>
    <P>In addition to present difficulties about oil supplies, Deputies will have noticed that some of the world's economic prophets have recently been forecasting a substantial down-turn in economic growth in the developed world.  The scale of the reduction in oil supplies in the years immediately ahead could accentuate the down-turn to the point of &ldquo;non-growth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We here cannot insulate ourselves from the effect of major world economic <Col N="1561" /> trends.  In fact we have one of the most open economies in the world and we are subject to the effects of all major world economic trends, for example, the steeply rising cost of finance over the past year.  The Government, however, have no intention of sitting back and allowing things to happen to the country&mdash;in the economic sense.  We have set up a Cabinet Sub-Committee on Energy and the Economy consisting of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This subcommittee will keep the overall economic and growth position under review in the context of developments in oil supplies and other major economic trends.</P>
    <P>We hope that the situation will not become so serious that jobs will be threatened, the expansion of the economy halted and, indeed, our standard of living reduced.  However, it would be unrealistic not to recognise now that all the possibilities may have to be faced and to make proper provision for them.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, already given the ESB the green light to make the initial moves to provide the country with a major new energy source&mdash;a nuclear power station.</P>
    <P>I may add also that I will be discussing the oil situation, among other topics, with my European colleagues at the summit meeting in Copenhagen later this week.</P>
    <P>Since so little concrete information is available at the present time it is necessary, in any review of the likely trends in 1974, to leave the oil situation aside as an imponderable.  Provided it does not become unduly serious, the picture for 1974 is reasonably optimistic. In agriculture, we will continue to enjoy a competitive position; our agricultural stocks are at a record level and we can hope for a further marked rise in agricultural exports and incomes.</P>
    <P>Of course, the trend of our unit wage costs will be of paramount significance. The rapid increase in industrial output <Col N="1562" /> which appears to have taken place in 1973 has increased productivity considerably and reduced unit wage costs. If income increases in the coming months are kept at a moderate level, this beneficial trend will be reinforced, with all that this implies for increased employment and real incomes for our community.</P>
    <P>What has been achieved during 1973 has been noteworthy and living standards have been significantly raised. We must make every effort to consolidate and improve upon these gains in 1974.</P>
    <P>In general, I may summarise by saying that the Government's approach to the management of the economy will not be either inhibited or over-cautious but it will be watchful for the emergence of unwanted side-effects to its policies from home or international events.</P>
    <P>Developments in relation to the supply of oil have increased the Government's desire to secure the thorough exploration of our Continental Shelf for oil and natural gas.  The present position is that about 30 per cent of our shelf is held under exclusive licence by one company and detailed exploration and drilling are being carried out in this area.  The company have made a discovery of natural gas off the Cork coast in the Kinsale Head area and discussions are taking place about the possible utilisation of the gas should the field prove to be commercially exploitable. The remainder of our shelf area is being explored by about 50 holders of non-exclusive exploration licences and policy and procedures for the granting of exclusive facilities for this area are at present being formulated. Surveys carried out to date show that there are many promising structures in our shelf area which provide a strong basis for the hope that substantial oil and gas deposits will be found.  Very extensive prospecting and drilling is, however, necessary before the presence of oil or gas in commercial quantities can be established and it takes three to four years to develop any commercial discovery made.  In the long term, the discovery and development of a commercial oil or gas field could be of considerable help <Col N="1563" /> in easing our energy supply situation, but no relief could at present be expected from this source, having regard to the time taken to discover and develop a field.</P>
    <P>The pace of economic advance is reflected in particular in the number of new industrial projects.  Projects approved by the Industrial Development Authority in the financial year 1972-73 generated 14,139 jobs which was just over the target of 14,000 for the year.  The total approved in the seven months period ended 31st October, 1973, was 7,900, that is, 49 per cent of the targeted 16,000 for the year.  It is expected that by the end of December, the authority will have approved another 4,000 jobs and will have reached just short of 75 per cent of the target for 1973-74.  The authority is confident that the job creation target for 1973-74 will be met, subject to all the uncertainties on the international front, which I have mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>One of the welcome features of activity in 1972-73 was the increased proportion of jobs created in existing industry.  Out of the 14,139 jobs approved, 44 per cent were from domestic sources.  The commitment of the Industrial Development Authority to the restructuring of Irish industry is demonstrated by the approval last year of £11 million in re-equipment grants to Irish firms.  This trend is being continued this year, and during the period 1st April, 1973, to 31st October, the authority approved re-equipment grants totalling £9 million.</P>
    <P>A second welcome feature of the year's outcome was the growing number of high technology industries coming to Ireland and opening up new opportunities for graduates, technicians and skilled workers.  This is evidenced also by the greater capital investment per worker which was 70 per cent above the investment for the preceding year.</P>
    <P>A further satisfactory outcome of the year's activities was the much better distribution of new industry across the country.  The Industrial Development Authority regional plans see a marked shift of new job opportunities <Col N="1564" /> in favour of the four less-developed regions of Donegal, northwest, west and midlands.  Job approvals in these areas during 1972-73 accounted for 29.2 per cent of new jobs approved compared with a targeted share of 20.6 per cent over the five years plan period.</P>
    <P>Ireland's enhanced attraction as a manufacturing basis in the European Community has been the central theme of international promotion. The prospect of EEC entry stimulated the rapid acceleration of 60 per cent in job approvals by the Industrial Development Authority in new industry from the recession level of 1971-72.  The decision of the Commission of the European Community earlier this year not to designate any part of Ireland as a central or developed area has removed uncertainty about our ability to offer the present package of industrial incentives throughout the State.  Positive community decision has come at a good time, as there is now a notably greater European interest in Ireland as an attractive location for their projects, without the problems of congestion and labour shortages experienced in many of the major European industrial centres.</P>
    <P>The industrial drive in the United States where the Industrial Development Authority is seeking projects to provide 6,000 jobs this year has been threatened by uncertainty deriving from the US Treasury tax proposals. The Minister for Industry and Commerce went to Washington last June and put the case for modifying the proposals to key figures in Congress and the Administration.  It now seems unlikely that there will be any significant changes in the US foreign investment tax laws during the next year or so.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding US tax and our incentives during the summer months, the authority is now confident that US investment will continue to be a major component in overall industrial development in Ireland during our present five year programme.  I may add that American projects accounted <Col N="1565" /> for 38 per cent of the jobs approved this year to date under the new industry programme.</P>
    <P>During the three months ended March, 1973, there was a marked improvement in the level of inquiries from United Kingdom industrialists interested in establishing in Ireland. This was coupled with a major promotional campaign by the Industrial Development Authority at the end of the financial year 1972-73.  During the seven months of the current financial year the authority approved 16 new United Kingdom projects involving a job potential of over 3,000 and an investment of £40 million.  This, I may say, includes the Courtaulds project with potential employment of 1,800 and a capital investment of £35 million.  I hope that the agreement reached at Sunningdale in the last week further improves the climate for investment by industrialists in our country.</P>
    <P>For many years the basic problem in agriculture was to improve the economic and thus the social position of farmers and their families to enable them to share in the country's growing prosperity.  Government intervention was necessary to support farm prices, reduce the cost of inputs and provide incentive schemes to promote increased production and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The great improvement in farm prices which has taken place since our accession to the European Economic Community has greatly reduced the burden on the Exchequer and has enabled farmers to secure better incomes directly from the market.  The operation of the EEC price system and the general advance of prices for agricultural production on world markets means that farm production can now be expanded without the traditional risk that increased production would result in reduced prices to producers or new restrictions in export markets.  Farmers are feeling the effects of this in their pockets today and, in fact, their prices have been rising even faster than was anticipated.  Fortunately for the country, they are taking advantage rapidly and wisely of these new prices and opportunities.  They are reinvesting a high proportion of the increased <Col N="1566" /> earnings in their own farms for productive purposes.  Of particular importance is the fact that they are extending their breeding herds at an impressive rate, a development which augurs well for future production of meat and milk and it is in such products that we expect our comparative advantage over other Community countries will lie.</P>
    <P>Agriculture's remarkable progress is reflected in the figures.  The volume of agricultural output last year increased by almost 4 per cent.  The cattle breeding herd expanded by almost a quarter of a million.  Agricultural prices were up by some 20 per cent and the increase this year is expected to be even higher.  Agricultural exports were up by £36 million and a further large increase is expected this year.  Farm income last year increased by more than one-third and it is projected that a further substantial increase will be achieved this year.  This rise in income as well as improving the standard of living of the rural community as a whole, will greatly augment the resources available to farmers for new investment in their own holdings.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Lands, working with the European Economic Community will be particularly concerned with farm structure and development aspects of agriculture. In these sectors some of the more important objectives in the years ahead will be to direct new investment as far as possible to potentially viable and developing farms and to ensure that, as our agriculture becomes more intensive and more exacting, as much of our land as possible will be transferred to younger qualified farmers.  Schemes which have been drawn up in pursuance of these objectives are at present being discussed with the authorities in Brussels and will be introduced very early in the new year.  The Minister for Lands has announced recently the basic features of his proposed pension scheme for farmers under EEC directive 160.  It is proposed to provide a life pension to farmers over 55 years of age who surrender their lands for the benefit of developing <Col N="1567" /> farmers.  The pension will be £600 a year for a married farmer and £400 a year for a single farmer over that age.  In addition, a substantial premium will be payable to all farmers who give up their lands for the same purposes.  Another objective is to promote measures to sustain the viability of mountainous and other less favoured areas in accordance with the proposed programme recently approved in principle by the Council of Ministers and on which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries displayed such extraordinary energy and determination.</P>
    <P>The common agricultural policy of the EEC has been the subject of some criticism during the past year and of speculation as to how it might be reformed. We have firmly supported the decision adopted in the context of the multilateral trade negotiations that there should be no change in the basic principles of that policy and this remains the Government's view.  This will also be our approach to the EEC Commission's recent suggestions for amending the policy which are at present being examined by member states.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the people who benefit most immediately from the new agricultural situation are the farmers themselves, the community as a whole also stand to benefit immensely in our increasingly integrated society.  It is Government policy to help and encourage this development in every way.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me on this occasion to omit mention of the increases in the rates of social assistance and benefit announced by the Minister for Finance in his first budget.  These increases granted in accordance with the Government's programme were larger in scale than any similar increases granted before in this country.  Since then the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has announced further improvements and advances.  In many instances they brought the rates of payment up to a level equal to, if not greater than, <Col N="1568" /> those operating in Northern Ireland and in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Public Service was established as from the 1st November, 1973.  Generally, the Department will deal with the terms and conditions of service and numbers of civil servants, automatic data processing in the public service, the pay and allowances of members of the Defence Forces, the terms and conditions of service of the Garda Síochána, teachers, civilian employees and industrial employees.  It will also deal with fees and remuneration generally, for example, for consultants and members of the boards of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I need hardly mention that apart from work on the proposals of the Public Services Organisation Review Group, the Department, like many others, will have a considerable role to play in the measures to be taken for the establishment of a Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The general function of the Government Information Services up to now has been to receive and process Press queries, requests for Ministerial interviews, and to distribute Government statements and ministerial speeches.  There have been complaints from the media about delays in answering queries, and in the general availability of immediate authoritative comment on matters of current importance.</P>
    <P>During the year 1972-73, the information services in my Department were seriously understaffed.  This, in part, explains the delay and other difficulties which the media experienced.  Another reason for the general position was that information activity as part of the Governmental process was not given a high enough priority, and, indeed, tended to be relegated to a peripheral position.  Since assuming office, the Government have been reviewing the whole communications process with a view to the effective dissemination of Government policy both within Government and to the general public.  We have decided that the employment of public relations services is not the most desirable way of dealing effectively with the making known of Government <Col N="1569" /> policy decisions.  A communications process must form an integral part of Governmental structures.  This process requires co-ordination and direction; co-ordination as between the Government Departments and direction from the Government.  It is for this reason that, as I have already indicated, the general direction of Government information and publicity has been assigned to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is logical, however, that as the central information area, the Government Information Services should be situated close to the centre of Government, proximate to the Government secretariat.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an Assistant Secretary in my Department to act as head of the Government Information Services is in line with this thinking.  This will ensure a constant flow of information from the centre out.  The positioning of the information services within my Department allows for the necessary co-ordination between the informational outputs of all Departments.  The establishment of this co-ordination is currently in progress and, in relation to the foreign Press, there is a close working relationship between the Information Services and the Information Section in the Department of Foreign Affairs, an advantageous one let me say.  The two Departments are currently examining how best our point of view can be disseminated abroad.  As a result of a public advertisement some months ago, we have now filled the existing vacancies in the Government Information Services and have brought the service up to strength.</P>
    <P>My Department have recently installed a telex service to facilitate the communication process, and a service is also available for journalists to file stories.  We have also installed the services of the Press Association Wire Services to monitor world news.</P>
    <P>The Government Information Services have been involved in a new approach to Government advertising, and an information manual will shortly be introduced within the public service which will be of assistance to civil servants in the preparation of material for distribution to the <Col N="1570" /> public.  The whole question of the amount and type and efficacy of Government advertising is being looked into.</P>
    <P>Our information policy is based on the belief that we must make our policies and decisions known as quickly and effectively as possible&mdash; it is part of our commitment to &ldquo;open&rdquo; government.</P>
    <P>On an occasion like this when the major political and economic trends affecting our lives are being debated it has not been usual to turn to cultural affairs.  Deputies will be aware of the proposals I have put forward for the reform of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, contained in the Arts Bill, 1973.  The proposals in the Bill have been debated fully by both Houses and I do not intend to go in detail into them here.  It will, I think, suffice for me to say that I intend the reconstituted council to be large enough and sufficiently representative of the different interests to make a worthwhile contribution to the development of the arts in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the subject of reform of parliamentary procedures.  This is a matter to which the Government have been giving particular attention since we assumed office.  As Deputies are aware, an informal committee of the Dáil reported in December, 1972, on the reform of Dáil procedures.  The recommendation of this committee relating to the rotation of the order of Ministers answering questions has been implemented already.  The Government are in favour of the implementation of the other recommendation contained in the report.  Two of the recommendations contained in the report are of particular importance. In order to ease the pressure on the time of the House, the Committee recommended that more Bills should be taken in special committee, these committees to be established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The report stated that the Bills to be referred to special committees should be selected by the Whips.  The Government would be anxious to see that, as a matter of principle, all Bills would be sent to <Col N="1571" /> special committees unless there was some valid reason to adopt the present practice for the Committee Stage of proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government have been considering suggestions which have been made in recent years that the establishment of more specialised select committees of the Dáil and Seanad should be proceeded with, with a view to giving the Oireachtas a greater role in certain areas of the economy.  The Government would, for example, be disposed to favour the establishment of such a committee to examine and report on the activities of State-sponsored bodies.  Members would, in this way, become more familiar with the operations of these bodies but there would be no question of parliamentary interference with their day-to-day management.  These committees would have power to send for papers, persons and records, to take evidence in public and to employ expert advisors.</P>
    <P>The other recommendation of the informal committee to which I would like to refer relates to the procedure to be followed for debating matters of urgent public importance.  The criticism has been made in the past that, when urgent matters arise, the Dáil cannot readily address itself to them because of its pre-occupation with legislative and financial business and that, when these issues are widely discussed in the Press, on television and radio, it may appear to the public at large that the House is not concerned about them.  The committee recommend that the Standing Order governing debate on such matters should be amended to facilitate, more readily, debate in the House on such issues.  This amendment might also allow a Minister to make statements in the Dáil on matters of public interest or importance. The Government are anxious to see this recommendation implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the present system of election to the Seanad.  Clearly, the system could be reformed in a number of respects and the Government would be anxious to see the matter examined.  I do not <Col N="1572" /> wish to suggest that the reforms I have dealt with are the complete answer to the problems that confront a democratic institution such as ours in modern times.  The Government believe, however, that these reforms are moves in the right direction. Their detailed implementation has been referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>This has been a good year.  A great national step forward has been made in the Sunningdale agreement with the sole purpose of enabling Irishmen, no matter of what religion, to run their affairs.  The agreement was made by putting aside past prejudices and refusing to allow illusory day dreams of the future to prevent all concerned from dealing with the realities of the present.  The realities of the present are what matter.  We cannot change the past, no more than we can form the ultimate shape of the future.  We can and must do our duty in the present.  I hope it will be possible in the future to say the same as I have said about the past year, that is, that it has been a good year.  I hope it will always be possible to say the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My first reaction is, and I am sure that of very many people throughout the country will be, one of grave disappointment at the Taoiseach's speech, especially that part which deals with the Sunningdale talks.  In view of the great interest which the country North and South expressed in these talks one would be excused for expecting to get, to say the very least of it, much more information from <Col N="1574" /> the Taoiseach than he was prepared to give this afternoon.  I say that genuinely and in no sense of carping criticism.</P>
      <P>It is rather paradoxical that in a 27-page script the Taoiseach used only four pages to deal with the Sunningdale talks and the agreed communiqué coming from there.  At the same time he used almost three pages of that script in referring to the need for better dissemination of information about Government activities.  I certainly cannot reconcile the sentiments expressed in the part of the speech dealing with dissemination of information and the improvement of the means whereby information on the Government's activities can be given to the public and the amount of information he has given us on the very crucial subject of the Sunningdale talks.</P>
      <P>I have certain comments to make. They will be constructive.  I want to say at the outset that I hope to see the practical proposals agreed to in Sunningdale implemented.  This party will facilitate their implementation. There are matters to which I should like to refer in the first instance.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that we in Fianna Fáil welcome any acceptable arrangement which fosters co-operation between Irishmen of different political traditions.  We hope to see emerging from the Sunningdale talks from the agreed communiqué, institutions which will guarantee the same civil rights to all Irish people, institutions which will outlaw violence directed against any section of the Irish people and which will develop the economic, social and political progress of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also want to see a new framework which will accommodate people of different political aspirations and which will be capable of evolution by agreement.  Subject to some reservations to which I will refer in a moment, we see in the agreed communiqué from Sunningdale the possibility of such development of such institutions which will promote the objectives to which I have referred.  I do not want to make any narrow political party point or try to take any <Col N="1575" /> political advantage out of the subject matter of this debate, or out of the subject matter of the Sunningdale talks and the objectives and the aims they were established to attain.</P>
    <P>We have supported the main practical proposals that have come from them, and they are proposals at this stage.  I am not saying this to try to take credit, because we appreciated the approach of the then Opposition on this question and in maintaining it to be above party politics.  That has been our attitude in Opposition as well.</P>
    <P>We advocated long before the Northern Assembly elections that there should be an administration in the North to replace Stormont which would have in it representatives of the minority tradition in Northern Ireland, with power-sharing as an important ingredient of it.  In my talks with Mr. Heath, and they were many, I consistently advocated the establishment of a Council of Ireland, a Council of Ireland that would have executive functions, a council that would be capable of evolution.  These two things are the positive proposals coming from the Sunningdale talks, even though the one is already established, that is, the Northern Ireland Administration, but the actual appointment of the Executive of that Administration is dependent on the outcome of these talks, dependent on the formulation of the Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to say that I fully recognise the difficulties which faced each party in the tripartite talks.  I know that their task was not easy and I for one was not impatient by any means that after four days, even with an all-night session, there still seemed to be some doubt that agreement would come from the talks.  It is very difficult in four days to solve the problems built up over many hundreds of years before.  Of course, the Sunningdale communiqué did not solve all the problems.  Many remain to be solved but I appreciated that no side could expect to get agreement <i>in toto</i> to <Col N="1576" /> what it proposed, to the points it made, to the hopes it had and especially when in these tripartite talks there was one part of that tripartite set-up which in itself was a tripartite delegation.</P>
    <P>I am saying this in recognition of the difficulties which I know faced the delegates but, notwithstanding that, we were assured by the Taoiseach that none of them was asked to compromise his position, no attempt was made to compromise any other and I think I can quote at this stage from the agreed communiqué which I think is important. It is recorded in paragraph 3, in the first sentence that the Taoiseach said the basic principle of the conference was that the participants had tried to see what measure of agreement of benefit to all the people concerned be secured and&mdash;and this is the part I want to refer to in particular: &ldquo;none had compromised and none had asked others to compromise, in relation to basic aspirations&rdquo;.  That is a statisfactory statement.  The paragraph goes on:</P>
    <P>The people of the Republic together with a minority in Northern Ireland, as represented by the SDLP delegation, continued to uphold the aspiration towards a united Ireland. The only unity they wanted to see was a unity established by consent.</P>
    <P>I agree with and accept wholeheartedly these sentiments.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to mention the first reservation which I have already mentioned in public.  Paragraph 5 was presented and laid out in the newspapers, as we read them on Monday and before those of us who were here in Ireland had any opportunity of receiving the official communiqué or a copy of it, one line following another.  People read it naturally in the context of its lay-out as we saw it in the newspapers.  The first sentence of that paragraph referred to the Irish Government's acceptance and solemn declaration that there could be no change in the status of Northern Ireland until a majority of the people of Northern Ireland desired a change in that status.  Following immediately on it came the British Government's declaration that it was and would remain <Col N="1577" /> their policy to support the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, and then came the sentence &ldquo;The present status of Northern Ireland is that it is part of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;  Following that came what, I think, was admittedly an advance on the British situation as it has obtained hitherto: &ldquo;If, in the future the majority of the people of Northern Ireland should indicate a wish to become part of a United Ireland, the British Government would support that wish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, Sir, is an advance on the previous position which emanated only in recent years&mdash;that they would not oppose it; but taking the paragraph as it read in the newspapers, one sentence following under the other, one immediately asked what was the interpretation of status in the Irish declaration when one read further down in that part of the English declaration the statement that the present status of Northern Ireland is that it is part of the United Kingdom&mdash;that genuinely concerned many people.</P>
    <P>The next day, Tuesday, some of us at least had an opportunity of seeing the official text and paragraph 5 was then laid out in a way different from that in which it was laid out in the newspapers&mdash;the Irish declaration on one side and the British declaration on the other.  That was reproduced in one of our daily papers so that I imagine many people who had not seen the official copy of the communiqué will have seen the layout. It would seem that these are two separate declarations.  To what extent one binds the other is a matter for clarification, but taking the Irish Government's acceptance and declaration that there could be no change in the status of Northern Ireland, one could accept this as stating the position, the factual position, that has obtained over many years.</P>
    <P>It has been the common policy in this country of all political parties represented here that the reunification of the country can come about only by peaceful means and that implies procuring the consent of all those who would subscribe to that objective, and <Col N="1578" /> if that is a statement of that objective, a statement of the position as it is in order to obtain that objective, then it would seem to be consistent with what has obtained and what has been accepted hitherto.  But the question is asked and must be asked: Taking the contrary interpretation, would it and if so, how does it impinge on Article 2 of the Constitution which declares the national territory as being the whole island of Ireland?  A reasonable interpretation could be, as I indicated, an acceptance of the factual position that has obtained hitherto, that is, that we want to unite our brethren in Northern Ireland but the unity we want is by peaceful means, thereby and therefore implying their consent to that unity in peace and in justice.  There, Sir, is I think, a genuine and serious reservation which very many people in the country have, one that I would have expected some clarification of and one on which, indeed, people will expect some clarification.</P>
    <P>We proceed then to paragraph 6. Here it is necessary for the benefit of the public to indicate, I think, that we here in this House are seriously concerned about the implications of the agreement.  Paragraph 6 says:</P>
    <P>The conference agreed that a formal agreement incorporating the declarations of the British and Irish Governments would be signed at the formal stage of the conference and registered at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>That paragraph coming immediately after paragraph 5 and the very wording of the paragraph&mdash;&ldquo;that a formal agreement, incorporating the declarations of the British and Irish Governments&rdquo;&mdash;would seem to imply that in so far as any document could be registered with the United Nations it would be limited to the declarations in paragraph 5.  That raises other questions to which I shall refer in a moment.</P>
    <P>I understand that the interpretation intended was that not only would this declaration contained in that paragraph of that agreement be registered but the other part of the communiqué as ultimately reduced to an agreement <Col N="1579" /> would also be part of the document to be lodged in the United Nations.  What was the purpose, one might ask, of having the document lodged in the United Nations?  If a document comprising an international agreement is so lodged there are two courses: one, the agreement so lodged must be laid on the Table of the House and, secondly, it must be approved by the House.  That is referred to in Article 29, paragraph 5, subparagraphs (1) and (2) of our Constitution. Article 29.5.1º reads:</P>
    <P>Every international agreement to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>If only that part of the agreement comprised in paragraph 5 is laid that would seem to preclude the need for approval by Dáil Éireann.  On the other hand, the other parts of the agreement to which I shall refer later, the parts of the agreement which would set up the Council of Ireland and in connection with which there would be the obligation on the Exchequer to make payments to that council for its workings, these too would have to receive the approval of Dáil Éireann.  Subparagraph 2 of paragraph 5 of Article 29 reads:</P>
    <P>The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Since it has been agreed to lodge a document with the United Nations I expect&mdash;I would be surprised to be informed otherwise&mdash;that any agreement so lodged must have the approval of this House.  It must certainly have that approval if it imposes a charge on public funds. Therefore, if an agreement as a whole is to be lodged, then that agreement, when it is agreed to, would have to be approved by this House.  That is worth pointing out and it may be an answer to the question raised just before I commenced speaking as to whether a debate would be possible on the agreement when ultimately it is come to in this House.  On my interpretation, <Col N="1580" /> that the entire agreement would be a matter for international agreement, then it must be debated in this House and at that stage, if not before it, we will perhaps have the necessary clarification as to what the terms of the agreement involve.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go through the agreement in absolute detail, but merely to raise&mdash;I hope in an objective and responsible way&mdash;matters on which I should like some clarification. Paragraph 7 deals with the Council of Ireland.  This is one of the very important parts of the agreed communiqué. There is there a clear commitment that a Council of Ireland would be set up, that it would have a council of ministers&mdash;that is, an Executive&mdash;which would have executive and harmonising functions.  That is what we advocated and that is what we support.  As well as that, there will be a consultative assembly which will have 30 Members from the Northern Assembly and 30 Members from here to be chosen by proportional representation. I take it this would be a choice, not an election.  It is important that there should be some indication as to who will make the choice.  If it is to be a choice by election we should be told that.  These are important matters and, because they are, I am all the more surprised that we have not got any clarification of them.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Executive itself, it will be comprised of seven Ministers from each State and they will be bound by an unanimity rule.  I mention this in the context of the executive functions that will ultimately be assigned to the Council of Ireland. I think it is paragraph 8 which says that the functions which will be assigned to the Council will be studied by the parties to the agreement; these studies will be on various matters but, in particular, on social, economic and cultural matters.  As I understand it, these studies will be carried out expeditiously and will be agreed at the formal conference scheduled to take place early in the New Year and, following on that, certain executive functions will be assigned to the Council of Ireland Executive or to the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> Because of the unanimity rule it is important that these functions should be assigned in advance, not that I suspect that once they have been assigned the functions of the Council of Ireland will be delimited by what has been done from the beginning because there is provision&mdash;it is clear from the last sentence of paragraph 8 &mdash;for evolution.  It is envisaged that the Council of Ireland will be capable of evolution; in other words, the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly would legislate from time to time as to the extent of the functions to be devolved on the Council of Ireland and, where necessary, the British Government will co-operate in this devolution of functions.  I read into that&mdash;I think there is no other interpretation&mdash;that the evolutionary capacity in the Executive context is built into the last paragraph of paragraph 8.  I am accepting that.  I think it is a reasonable assumption.</P>
    <P>When one comes to paragraph 10, however, there is no certainty whatever as to what functions under that paragraph&mdash;that is in connection with enforcement of law dealing with crimes of violence&mdash;will be assigned to the Council of Ireland.  Various proposals were put forward during the conference and it was agreed, because they were so complex, they should be examined by a commission. This is separate from the study groups which are being set up.  The study groups are being confined to economic and related matters.  Apparently the legal functions of the Council of Ireland will be examined by the commission, in the first instance to find out what, if any, legal functions it should be given, to what extent and to how they could be exercised.</P>
    <P>Here I come back to the unanimity rule because it would appear that the commission will take a long time to examine these complex problems.  The Council of Ireland, one could reasonably expect, would have been set up before the commission would have reported.  Therefore, one is entitled to ask if recommendations are to be made by the commission will they be accepted by the Council of Ireland <Col N="1582" /> because the commission has been asked to deal with a number of subjects. First of all, it must deal with law enforcement, whether or not that will be done by way of a single court under the jurisdiction of the Council of Ireland or separate courts operating in separate parts of Ireland. Extradition is also one of the matters which has been referred to this commission.</P>
    <P>On extradition certain people in the North have accused our Government &mdash;when I say &ldquo;our Government&rdquo; I am not referring to the Coalition or to Fianna Fáil&mdash;of being dilatory or non co-operative in this matter.  It is worth pointing out again that there is no question of the Government exercising a choice in this area.  This is a matter, firstly, of an international convention to which we are a party and under the Constitution we are bound by the normal procedures in international agreements.  I do not think I need refer to the section. Secondly, our courts are charged with certain responsibilities in relation to extradition proceedings.  If a person against whom an order for extradition has been made so wishes he can ask the High Court for an order of <i>habeas corpus</i> annulling an extradition order made by a lower court.</P>
    <P>I am talking of political crimes or crimes relating to political matters. Invariably those who have been charged with such crimes have had recourse to the <i>habeas corpus</i> procedure.  It is well to point out at this stage that even without specific law which would enable a person to refer his case to the High Court in the event of an extradition order being made against him that person has, under our Constitution, and it was so decided by the Supreme Court in 1956 in a case, Quinn against Ryan, the right to go to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I say all this to indicate that the Government had no room to manoeuvre in this matter.  They then, naturally, proposed other alternatives, the main one being a special court. However, because of the complexity of that matter the Government undertook to do certain things, that is, to enforce existing legislation be it <Col N="1583" /> common law legislation or statutory legislation dating back to 1861 to have brought to justice a person who, having committed a crime of murder in another part of our territory, has been found within the jurisdiction so that he may be charged within the jurisdiction. I do not want to go into any detail about that except that, as I have already suggested, this will raise practical difficulties in relation to the bringing forward of witnesses to give evidence against such a person for the simple reason that our courts do not have jurisdiction in the North of Ireland. Therefore, any order of subpoena they would make would not be binding against a witness living in that part of the country.  There are many others.  I do not have to go into them here.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that it will be found by this commission on examination that there are so many difficulties that it will be very hard to enforce that particular piece of legislation in the manner suggested.  That comes back to what I think, and in this regard I agree with the Government, was the most practical suggestion made, that the court should be formed under the aegis of the Council of Ireland, that that court should have jurisdiction over the entire country in certain scheduled areas and that it should not only be a court with criminal jurisdiction but should be a court which would have civil rights and human rights functions.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the communiqué a reference to the possibility of the European Convention on Human Rights being made applicable in some way or the other to the entire country as it is to the Republic.  I would suggest ultimately that this court would be the proper court to enforce human rights that might be alleged to have been breached under the European Convention for Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Under the same section comes policing.  This is a very difficult area, I accept entirely, whether it comes under a single united Ireland court or separate courts operating in two separate jurisdictions.  Much clarification <Col N="1584" /> and much information is required about the matter of policing, but again I suggest it would be much simpler if the police north and south are a single police force responsible to the one court in respect of scheduled areas of criminality and certain areas of human rights.  That court need not be confined to one or other part of the country.  It would be far better that that court would be mobile, mobile to the extent that its jurisdiction would extend north and south.  I believe that this commission, when it does report, must inevitably agree with that contention.  Again I raise the question, if the commission makes that recommendation or an otherwise workable recommendation with the unanimity rule already established in a Council of Ministers already in existence, will it be possible to empower such a court to function or even to establish it at all.</P>
    <P>These are some of the practical problems and some of the other difficulties that this agreement, as we read it, raises for us, and, indeed, for many people throughout the country.  There are many other matters that I could talk about but what I have said is a clear enough indication that the communiqué as it stands needs to be explained to the people.  If my earlier contention was right that this matter will have to come before the Dáil then, of course, it will have to be explained and examined in detail.  I hope that contention is right so that at least we will be bound to have that opportunity of approving whatever international agreement is made.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points I intended making.  I want to repeat at this stage that I recognise that each party to the conference, to the talks in Sunningdale, could not have expected all their proposals to have been implemented.  We in Fianna Fáil would have wished that the agreement would have been more acceptable to us.  The positive proposals that are in the agreement we want to see implemented.  We want to see that they will work.</P>
    <P>There are some who would wish to see the agreement upset and set at nought for a variety of reasons.  It <Col N="1585" /> may be easy for them and, perhaps, for others who may be less well disposed to pick holes and to find fault. But, there are many people of goodwill who are seeking some reassurance, at least some further information, on some of the points and, perhaps, others that I have raised.  I have mentioned only some of the areas which need clarification, particularly with regard to paragraph 5 dealing with status.  I know I speak&mdash; I do speak&mdash;for very many people who genuinely and sincerely want this agreement implemented, who want to see solid progress made out of the talks and, who, therefore, would like to have the real interpretation of the agreement made clear to them.</P>
    <P>This is no time for an irresponsible approach.  I have put forward on behalf of this party and I believe on behalf of very many people outside who have no affiliations to this party what I regard as a responsible approach.  It is no time, certainly, for irresponsible brinkmanship.  We do not want to see the northern problem perpetuated to our children and our children's children.  We are dealing with people's lives.  We are dealing with a serious situation that has existed in Northern Ireland over the past four years.  We want to see the end of this bloodshed, most of it unnecessary bloodshed, in fact, all of it unnecessary bloodshed.  When I say &ldquo;most of it&rdquo; I refer to the unfortunate people who in one way or another were innocent victims, people who had no direct responsibility for whatever activities were taking place in Northern Ireland.  We want to see that bloodshed ended.  We do not want to see it perpetuated.  Certainly, we do not want to see it extended.</P>
    <P>We are dealing, therefore, with lives and we are dealing with the peaceful development economically and politically of our country, of our entire country, when we are dealing with this serious matter.  I hope, Sir, I have approached it in a responsible way and, again, may I express my disappointment that we have been given so little information about this vitally important matter by the Taoiseach in the course of his opening speech?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> I now come to the general trend of the debate that has obtained in recent years.  The debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach usually deals with economic matters, with a review of the Government's activities over the previous 12 months and, indeed, perhaps, over the previous period of years.  I was rather taken aback by the assertion by the Taoiseach, as if it was an achievement by a performance by his own Government, in his opening paragraph of the economic part of his speech:</P>
    <P>Following the sluggish performance of the economy in the three years 1970-1972 when the growth rate averaged only 3 per cent&mdash;a figure well below national productive capacity&mdash;activity has speeded up and the growth rate this year is likely to be of the order of 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary run of the cycle of economics, I should like to ask the Taoiseach in all honesty and all seriousness does he not regard this as being due to the activities of the Government which preceded his? Things do not happen overnight, especially in the economic process and I hope to demonstrate in the remaining part of my remarks that much has been undone and not only has progress not been made but we have been going in many instances in the opposite direction and at this stage I want to give notice that we are going to vote against this motion, leaving aside that part of the Taoiseach's speech which dealt with the Sunningdale conference.  That is not in issue.  I want to make that perfectly clear at the outset that our vote against the Taoiseach's Estimate is a vote against the economic performance of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I see some stirrings in the benches over there.  Do the two Labour Ministers in the House seriously suggest that there is anything wrong with the statement I have just made?  We have made no attempt whatever to suggest that we are opposing the agreed communiqué, <Col N="1587" /> opposing what it is hoped to achieve from that agreed communiqué from the Sunningdale conference.  I want to make that perfectly clear and let nobody say hereafter that Fianna Fáil when this debate was over voted against the agreed communiqué from Sunningdale.  We do not propose to. There are certain matters that we should like explained and we hope we will have explanations of them but at the moment I am dealing with our opposition to the Government's progress and with our disappointment with their performance.</P>
      <P>Their incompetence has become particularly evident in their handling, and I would say their mishandling, of economic matters.  This incompetence may not yet have become apparent to everybody because as we left office the economy for 1973 was set fair and, indeed, as the Taoiseach's figures have indicated, we left it in good condition. But, even with the Coalition Government the time has not been long enough for them and the economy was too buoyant as a result of our efforts to preclude their doing any damage to it at this stage but this is possible. By reason of their handling of the matters now it is possible that our economy will retard in the years to come and I am leaving aside altogether the difficulties now facing not only this country but the countries of western Europe and, indeed, Japan and the United States of America in relation to the fuel crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices are the most glaring example of this ineptitude and I might say this change of tune.  We remember, though I am sure the Government would wish us to forget and would wish the country to forget, the promises they made before the election to do something positive about prices, something positive about stabilising prices and their commitment to immediately introduce strict price control.  We knew then and we know now that their statements were meaningless and empty.  Unfortunately, there were many voters who were deceived into believing that the Coalition would do something to stop the prices spiral. What happens?  They did something <Col N="1588" /> all right.  They did something in the last budget.  They removed VAT and they increased taxes otherwise.  The tax increases alone in that budget accounted for almost 2 per cent increase in prices but, more than that, because of its spendthrift capacity, having to borrow an increase of some £100 million, it had the economy swamped by a wave of paper money and credit which has impinged further on the upward trend of prices.</P>
    <P>This is not all.  The other distinction that this Government earned for themselves in the field of prices is that some of their recommendations went even in excess of the amounts suggested or recommended by the Prices Advisory Commission.  It is difficult to say with what precision the overall increase in prices can be attributed to Coalition action but taking the 2 per cent increase as a result of direct taxation and the inflationary trend contributed to in the meantime by this spendthrift activity, one could put it at roughly 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the Government have been responsible for contributing to the inflationary process by at least that amount. Naturally, they tried to suggest that they have done what they set out to do and point to the fact that in the first period, May to September, while they were in office, prices were actually reduced.  They took credit for that even though anything they could have done in that period could not have affected&mdash;or only to a very limited extent&mdash;price rises.</P>
    <P>In the next six months the picture is completely different.  Then they blame international trends to which the Taoiseach referred in his opening statement today.  This is not merely an irresponsible approach but is childlike, taking credit for what is good and blaming what is bad on something external, world trends.  World inflation has been in operation for the past seven, eight or nine years but no credit was given to the Fianna Fáil Government because of the impact of world conditions on our economy. In their attempt to claim credit for the changes they made in VAT they said these would reduce prices by <Col N="1589" /> .6 per cent but in the process they increased taxation from VAT by £5 million.  Can they suggest that increase in taxation has not an impact on the .6 per cent reduction in VAT?  Of course, it has.  Nobody can explain a miracle of reducing prices and increasing taxation without one having an effect on the other.</P>
    <P>Whatever happened to the legislation the Minister for Industry and Commerce was to introduce to deal with mergers and takeovers?</P>

      <P>Very well if the Minister will not tell me, I cannot read the record now.  I was not in at Question Time and so I shall make my case and the Minister can answer later on.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they introduced draft proposals in this connection.  When the Coalition came in the Minister for Foreign Affairs told some Fine Gael merchant tycoons there was nothing in any legislation they proposed that would have any effect on their activities. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was telling his Labour supporters at the same time that he would withdraw the Fianna Fáil Bill because it was too weak and introduce a really effective Bill.  I do not know where the balance lies between these two Ministers.  Is there to be a Bill?  I take it there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At least that will reduce the two red faces to one red face if the Minister can justify his promises.  The Minister and his party were vehement about mining taxation. He had a different tune to play when he addressed the Labour conference some three months ago.  He did say he would introduce new legislation. I shall not go into it in any depth: I have spoken about it before but we are waiting for this new legislation <Col N="1590" /> while Fine Gael are telling their friends not to mind Justin Keating, that they would look after them.  The depletion allowances would ensure their profits would be maintained.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that in order to utilise fully our resources it will be necessary to have a smelter. I wonder what the prospects of a smelter now are and I should like the Minister to elaborate when and if he deals with this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has provided other examples of incompetence and inconsistency. First, he adopted a hard line, even a rather hostile approach to building societies.  Later, he subsidises them and again&mdash;although, perhaps, he felt rather guilty about this&mdash;he issued further threats about the longer-term future position.  He followed that up by giving them a loan of £6 million of which we have not yet heard the terms and details although we would like to know them.  This £6 million came from some source.  The building societies have it but we have not yet got much indication as to where it came from or what terms were attached to it.  We are supposed to believe that all this adds up to a housing policy.  When the Coalition came into office I believe they were quite happy with the rate of progress envisaged of 17,000 to 20,000 houses per year.  What, in effect, happened?  Last year 21,000 houses were built and this year, under the Fianna Fáil programme, it was intended to build 24,000 houses.  The Coalition decided to do an &ldquo;Annie get your Gun&rdquo; act&mdash;anything you can do I can do better.  They picked the next convenient figure over 24,000 and said they would have 25,000 houses.  Then we were to have a crash programme.  I do not know what a crash programme is or the juxtaposition of the two words but it seems to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a crash programme or a housing programme that has crashed?  So far we do not know by what means the 25,000 houses will be built.  If they are built, will we have <Col N="1591" /> disruption and will we again have this peak and valley sequence in house building?  For many years we wanted to ensure steady progress to avoid valleys and peaks.  The building industry had confidence in us for that reason.  They had not confidence in previous Coalition Governments.  The Coalition Government would be better served if, instead of talking about crash programmes in housing, they would ensure that there would be a steady level of growth as we had planned and without any crashes our target of 25,000 would have been reached.  One now wonders when it will be reached under the Coalition.</P>
      <P>Industrial relations, perhaps, provide another example of the contrast between the Coalition in office and out of office.  Free collective bargaining was sacrosanct to members of the Labour Party.  Indeed, we all hold it dear but those of us responsible for Government activity felt there were certain times when Government intervention was necessary.  Even then the Labour Party raised their hands in horror, no person more so than Deputy O'Leary, Minister for Labour. He was forced to introduce what he would have called &ldquo;repressive legislation&rdquo; against workers' rights when he legislated recently against bank officials.  How can people reconcile this kind of approach from those who put forward contrary approaches in what appeared to be an honest fashion?  Obviously they cannot be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to refer to the contrast&mdash;and I suggest the dangerous precedent created&mdash;in the handling of our EEC affairs by the Labour and Fine Gael members in the European Parliament when they voted against each other on what appeared to us a vital matter affecting the interests of our country.  I do not think the Coalition have much to boast about after their months in office.  We have been accused of not being a virile Opposition but we have not had much opportunity to display our talents. Almost every piece of legislation that has been introduced has been legislation fully prepared, or almost fully <Col N="1592" /> prepared, by Fianna Fáil with the single exception of the Electoral Bill introduced by the Minister for Local Government.  I will say nothing about that because it has been debated at length&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not going to elaborate on what I have said other than to say that this Government have given way to propagandising themselves rather than achieving solid performances and adopting a realistic approach to the nation's needs.</P>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, the Taoiseach's statement had three pages dealing with the activities of the Government Information Services, as against four pages of a script on the vital and important issue of the Sunningdale communiqué.  Apparently more money is going to be spent, but let it be spent in a fair and honest way.  If the Government want to propagate themselves, let them do so warts and all, and not try to pretend that everything that is going well is to their credit but everything that is going badly is not their responsibility. When the time comes again when we are in Government we will take the credits and the responsibilities, but at the rate they are going the Coalition will find that the responsibilities far outweigh the credits.  When we get back the credits will be on the credit side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement that was reached at Sunningdale has been described by commentators as a truly historic step in the internal history of this island. I was sorely and grievously disappointed by the reception given to it by the Leader of the Opposition. Not once did he say: &ldquo;I welcome this historic development in the relations between Irishmen.&rdquo;  Instead, we had carping, parsimonious parsing of <Col N="1593" /> some of the legalistic content of the agreement.  One would never think that for generations Irishmen of different persuasions, cultures and traditions have been seeking desperately towards that consensus which the power sharing in the North recognises and which is now recognised to a further stage in the plans for the setting up of a Council of Ireland. The reception given to the agreement by the Leader of the Opposition was carping, small and, I regret to say it, was mean.</P>
      <P>The agreement was reached after many hours in Sunningdale but, in fact, those hours do not represent the actual time taken to reach the agreement. It has been the fruit of many months, indeed many years, of agitation, agreement and discussion within Northern Ireland itself.  It was an historic achievement because, for the first time, representatives of the differing aspirations, aims and ideals of this country sat down together and, recognising each other's position, reached a consensus.</P>
      <P>I am certain that when news of the agreement came to this country it was received with welcome and relief that, at last, there appeared to be a way of ending the tragedy of this island forever.  One would have thought that an agreement with such momentous potential and possibilities would be welcomed in the spirit that went into its making, a spirit of reconciliation and patriotism; one would have thought that spirit would be reflected and echoed by the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the party that claim to be the repository of all things republican.  Instead we had a carping, mean reception.  This is ironic when one considers that this party make annual pilgrimages to Wolfe Tone's grave at Bodenstown, the man who first uttered the dictum that Irishman means Protestant Catholic and Dissenter.  For the first time for centuries Irishmen of that label were able to sit down and reach an agreement.  Yet the party that describe themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no enthusiasm expressed for this new concept, this idea of Irishmen sitting down and working together to end past tragedies.  That is the real tragedy of this debate.  However, it is not too late; perhaps other Members from the other side of the House may be able to make up for their leader's defects.  I doubt it, but we can only hope.  It was indicated at the opening of the conference that the parties there represented different traditions, aspirations and ideals.  The Taoiseach said that perhaps in the past we had been too obsessed by our catch-cries and our devotion to abstract ideals, without having true and proper regard for the realities of life in this island.  He said we had now <Col N="1595" /> learned to accept that short of mass conversion or mass repression of one or other aspiration in Ireland there was no simple, one-dimensional solution to the problem of Northern Ireland. He went on to say that to get the solution of the problem there would have to be a growth in different directions, a movement in different directions from the past, that there would have to be a settlement which would foster trust, a settlement in which a political concensus could develop so that all these differing aspirations would find room to exist side by side.  He made the point that the trouble in Northern Ireland stemmed from the lack of real political concensus there but that that unhappy situation now appeared to be ending due to the establishment of the power-sharing concept.  We have to remember that consensus does not mean the imposition by the majority of its will on the minority and the ready and constant acceptance of that will by the minority.  It is something more than that because the minority must be involved in making the concensus. That involvement has now been achieved in Northern Ireland. The next stage is to have a consensus on an all Ireland basis and we hope that the Council of Ireland will prove to be the vehicle for such an all Ireland consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated in his opening remarks at Sunningdale that there were certain things necessary in order to achieve this state of affairs, to cement the consensus in the North and to promote consensus in the island as a whole and that, first of all, there would have to be political institutions which would promote and encourage the growth of this consensus; secondly, that there would have to be a sincere effort to ensure that all those instruments of Government which affect people in their daily lives would not present any positive obstacle to identification with these basic institutions; thirdly, that these institutions would be so constructed that within them there would be scope for differing aspirations to exist so that the <Col N="1596" /> essential conflict would be eased and, perhaps, forgotten about in pragmatic discussions of day to day realities, and fourthly, that when these institutions would be fully working there would be a resolute and determined effort by political leaders on all sides to accept them and give them their full support.</P>
    <P>I think those requirements summed up the needs of this island in relation to the problems facing us.  I think that the agreement in Sunningdale has been an immense step forward towards achieving these objectives.  The political institution has been set up which, by its nature, will promote and encourage the growth of consensus. This political institution is the Council of Ireland.  Within it there will be equal representation from north and south and there will be a rule of unanimity, again specifically built in to promote this idea of consensus because bear in mind that while there will be equal representation from north and south the fact that some of the northern representation share a common aspiration with the entire southern representation means that there will be, in regard to that particular aspiration, an automatic minority in that institution.  Consequently, in line with the spirit of reconciliation and the spirit to achieve consensus, it was agreed that that minority would be protected by the existence of the unanimity rule.  I think that was a wise decision and an essential decision if progress is to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress will have to be made step by step, little by little. For progress to be made it requires not merely the legal machinery.  It requires a national spirit as well. While the Leader of the Opposition supported this rule of unanimity he must surely agree with me that for the spirit which it represents to really work and to be really implemented the Council of Ireland must get under way knowing that it has the wholehearted and joyful support of the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> It is important that these institutions would leave within themselves scope for the differing aspirations to co-exist until such time as, by consent, change in those aspirations is achieved so that during that period the material well-being of all the people of this island can be fostered and improved and so that the processes of administration and discussion will be facilitated within these institutions.  Above all, what we need in this island is peace and it is significant that the outright opposition to the agreement at Sunningdale has come from two extreme and diametrically opposed wings.  One of these is the so-called republican wing, the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>It was common case at Sunningdale between all the parties from this island, and those parties represented far and away the vast majority of the inhabitants of this island, that violence must be ended.  Much thought and much discussion was given as to how this might be done effectively at the same time recognising that what was being attempted in Sunningdale was only a beginning and was setting up institutions which, of themselves, represented only a half-way house towards an evolving and differing constitutional position.  Nevertheless, it was agreed that there has to be effective measures on an all-Ireland basis to end violence because there was the explicit acceptance by all at that conference that the men of violence were the enemies of this entire island.  Consideration was given as to how effective means be brought about to achieve this end.  We made it clear, and again this exemplifies the spirit of the conference in which there was respect for each other's position, that the laws on extradition as they at present stand, because of their international connotations, could not be altered by us to provide an easy solution to this problem.  So long as there were two jurisdictions on this island that had to be the position. While parties of other allegiances would have liked us to change it they, nevertheless, accepted our position in regard to this.</P>
    <P>There was then discussion of this <Col N="1598" /> idea of a common court and how it might become effective and how it might be merged with the domestic jurisdictions of the two areas so as to provide a tribunal to deal with the people guilty of violence against the people of Ireland, in whatever part. This was an idea that had acceptance as an idea but the discussion of the implementation of it threw up complex legal problems and it was decided that these should be put to a commission for solution.  What eventually the commission will advise we will have to wait and see but, having regard to the spirit of Sunningdale, I certainly see no difficulty in the recommendations of that commission being implemented if for its implementation the confirmation of the council is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition mentioned the possible difficulty of the application in that context of the rule of unanimity but if this commission proposes ways for dealing effectively with the men of violence, then that Council of Ireland, which will be composed then of people dedicated to the eradication of violence, will surely endorse the commission's recommendations.  It would be contrary to the spirit of searching for agreement, of meeting each other's point of view that was so prevalent and prominent at Sunningdale, if that spirit did not imbue all the activities of the council and any subsidiary commissions or bodies.  In the meantime as a measure of our goodwill and of the genuineness of our desire to see that men of violence do not escape in any part of this island, because these men are the enemies not only of the people where they commit their crimes but of the entire people of Ireland, we have undertaken to implement that piece of our law which will enable us to try for murder persons who might have committed that crime in Northern Ireland.  I am advised that this is something to which immediate legal effect can be given. The Government undertook at Sunningdale to do that and this undertaking will be honoured in the spirit and in the letter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>However, I want to make it clear <Col N="1599" /> that it will be honoured only from now on, that any persons who may have come into this jurisdiction and who may be sought for this heinous crime in the other part of the island will not be affected by this change. It is our opinion that it would be oppressive and inequitable to apply retrospectively such a dramatic change in the law.  Furthermore, some such persons may have involved themselves in the extradition process and it would be oppressive to interfere with and terminate that process once a person acceded freely to it.  I take the point of the Leader of the Opposition with regard to the Quinn case which provided essentially that no person could be removed from the jurisdiction without having the right of access to the courts within this jurisdiction. The idea of a common court has been put forward but this would not impinge on this principle.  It would allow that principle to stand because it would sit within this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>These are some of the ways in which the fight against violence is to be carried on forthwith.  I would hope, though, that this fight might not be necessary.  Maybe that is a wasteful hope especially when we read of the continuing acts being perpetrated in Northern Ireland and of the intransigent statements that have been made. Neverthelesss, there has been such widespread welcome for this agreement that there is genuine hope and a sense of relief that at last a way has been found that can bring peace to this island, that this widespread and national feeling might begin to impinge on the conscience of these men of violence and might begin to make them look again at their policy, to make them realise the utter futility of their actions and how they can never be successful.  It might bring them to the realisation that they can only continue to bring harm, horror and sadness to all of this island.  A number in excess of 100 of those men of violence have themselves met with violent deaths.  It is to be regretted that this should happen to any Irishman. Surely these people who have a sense of dedication, albeit seriously <Col N="1600" /> misguided, will realise that their role in this country would be far more fruitful and constructive if they lived for their country rather than commit themselves to untimely, unnecessary and violent deaths to be commemorated in silly ballads and lugubrious graveyard parades.  I would hope that this agreement might call some halt to the activities of these people, that it might persuade them to look again at their activities and reconsider their place in this island.  It might bring them to the realisation that they are an invalid and tiny minority.  They are invalid in the sense that they inflict on the majority actions for which they have no mandate.  Some time ago one of their leaders stated that it was not their policy to seek a confrontation with this State, that to look back in history showed that all such confrontations ended in favour of the State.  These were wise words and I suggest that the man concerned would repeat them to the rank and file of his members so that they might come to realise that their activities are utterly futile.  They might bear in mind also that with this concept of a Council of Ireland, the idea of a confrontation being limited to this State is no longer so, that because of this all-Ireland dimension which we now have within our affairs, a confrontation, in whatever form it should take, whether it be bombing or the murdering of Irishmen of different allegiances in the other part of Ireland, becomes to all intents and purposes a confrontation with this State.</P>
    <P>As that spokesman said all such confrontations end in favour of the State.  I would hope that this new dimension in Irish affairs might cause those people to think again.  It must be said, though, that if they refuse or fail to think again and if they maintain this confrontation, bearing in mind that we are now talking in an all-Ireland context, that the manifestations of that confrontation, regardless of which part of the island it takes place in, would have to be regarded down here as a confrontation with this State.  All I can do is to warn those people that such a situation will not be tolerated because that <Col N="1601" /> type of situation inhibits peace and militates against a good future for this island.  Any of us who has power to prevent such a situation must use that power.  It would be my sincere hope that this would not be the case. Consequently, I make the point that these people, taking a lesson from history, should now begin to accept the futility of their actions and that any of their leaders who have the perceptivity to understand their position in Ireland and in the history of Ireland and to appreciate what has now happened in this country, consequent on Sunningdale, might persuade their more frantic followers that the time for a change has come.  A final word to these people is that if they are not prepared to change their way they can be tolerated no longer in any part of this island.</P>
    <P>The principal way in which these people will have to be tackled is through the courts but in order to bring them before the courts they must first be detected and arrested. This operation will have to be carried out by the police service in this island. This is a difficult area and one that led to long and protracted negotiations at Sunningdale.  The problem was compounded by the failure of many of the minority in Northern Ireland to be able to identify with the police service in that area.  Ways were sought by which the Council of Ireland could be identified in some way with the police force in that area so that that section of the population who saw in the Council of Ireland an acknowledgment of their position and their aspirations might begin to realise that, on the other side of the coin, they would have to identify with the institutions which they had up there.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that for our part in the Republic to assist in bringing about a situation of identity between the minority population in the north and the police service, we would introduce a parallel structure here, that we would set up a police authority, and that the Council of Ireland would be involved in the setting up of it, in that the Government before appointing its members would consult with the Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> Parallel with this the British Government, who have reserved to themselves powers in the field of policing, agreed that in appointing the police authority for Northern Ireland they would consult with the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland, the Executive, and the Members of the Executive designate undertook that they in turn would reciprocate our consultation with the council.</P>
    <P>One would hope then that the the members of the authority in each part of the island would represent the consensus wish of the Council of Ireland and would thereby introduce the common element of policing to which the Leader of the Opposition referred as being so desirable.  Possibly one may say that at this stage it is far removed legally from a unified police force but, as I said earlier, we have to progress by small stages and this is a small but very significant stage.  I would hope that this step would enable the minority in the North to identify with the police service in that area.</P>
    <P>There are other reforms to be introduced into the northern police service, reforms designed to get away from the unfavourable image of the past.  These reforms are not necessary in our jurisdiction because, happily, there is no problem of identification as between the population here and the gardaí.  Nevertheless, if it is felt that as a reciprocal measure and as a gesture of goodwill on our part, and as something which can assist in this pretty difficult problem, of course we would be prepared to consider reciprocal action here.</P>
    <P>It was recognised, as the communiqué says, that the two parts of Ireland are inter-dependent to a considerable extent in the whole field of law and order and that the problems of political violence and identification with the police service cannot be solved without taking account of that fact.  As I have outlined, this is the way in which that fact has been taken into account.  The Council of Ireland will be involved, perhaps, in too tenuous a way and more of us would <Col N="1603" /> have liked a more direct involvement, but the spirit of Sunningdale produced this agreement and we accept it in that spirit and recommend it in that spirit.</P>
    <P>I can say, too, that it will be in accordance with that spirit that the activities of the police, North and South, in the fight against men of violence, will have to be looked at with a view to their co-ordination to ensure that that fight is effective and successful.  I have no doubt that it will be so but, as I indicated earlier, we would prefer not to have to wage that fight.  These are the ways in which, within the basic institutions, the council and the Executive, the pragmatic steps will be taken to improve the situation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the law and order element of these steps because they will come within my Department and will be of more concern to me than the steps which are being taken in economic and social areas.  These will be of equal significance because they will bring practical benefits&mdash; benefits in the pockets, benefits in the standard of living&mdash;to all the people in this island.  To that section of the northern community who feel that their standard of living might be depressed or weakened by having to be in some way associated with this part of Ireland, I would say that it is important that this council and this Executive will be able in measurable material terms to reassure those people that such a fear would be misplaced.</P>
    <P>What is needed now above all is for all the people on this island to trust these new institutions to work and to remember that in themselves they do not constitute a full and final and satisfactory solution to all the problems of Ireland, that they are a step on the road towards the eventual solution of these problems.  This Council of Ireland is a new concept. It is a delicate political baby which must be allowed to grow in an atmosphere of great care and attention. There will be many areas of sensitivity attached to it.</P>
    <P>It behoves us as the larger and <Col N="1604" /> stronger party in the Council to be at all times careful to be sensitive towards the evolution of this body, to refrain from making extravagant claims, and to be careful to appreciate the difficulties of our partners in that Council.  It behoves us as the stronger party to be generous in giving when it is possible to give, so that in giving we may reassure the people on the other side of the divide that, if they came closer to us, they can be assured of a generous reception.</P>
    <P>From my contact with people in my constituency since my return I sense that there is a real welcome for this agreement.  It was because I sensed this so strongly and experienced&mdash;&ldquo;euphoria&rdquo; is not too strong a word &mdash;the hopeful euphoria that followed from it that I was sorely disappointed by the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition here today.  At this stage I would ask the other side of the House&mdash;and it is sad that it is necessary even to make the request&mdash;to look on this agreement as a momentous step forward, as bringing with it hope of peace in this country, a hope that all the horrible and tragic acts which have dirtied our name internationally may begin to come to an end and to look at it not in any terms of the political past, or any terms of political catch cries, but as a new deal and to bring to it a spirit of real patriotism involving charity, involving recognition, involving giving. If all the politicians in this House can bring that spirit to what Sunningdale has provided, peace and happiness for this entire island will be here very shortly.</P>

      <P>I was not aware on coming into the House that this was to be a debate on the communiqué issued as a result of the talks at Sunningdale.  I thought it would take the ordinary course of a debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate to mark the Adjournment in which every aspect of Government policy could be covered.  Assuming that, I was of opinion that another opportunity would be provided when as the leader of this party rightly pointed out, the communiqué and all that it involves and the agreement which will <Col N="1605" /> ensue from it would be explained to this House, before it would become a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
      <P>The last speaker chose to speak on nothing but the Sunningdale communiqué and it reminded me forcibly of the 14 points issued by the Government which started off by saying that Fianna Fáil were so preoccupied with events in the North that they had scandalously neglected the economy of the country, had allowed prices to soar and everything to go wrong. He was disappointed that we did not stand up and cheer when the Taoiseach referred to this communiqué. He referred to it as a historic occasion but he later described it in his own words when he said: &ldquo;We have to progress by small steps and this is a small but significant step&rdquo;, and he referred to it as a delicate political baby.</P>
      <P>The leader of this party asked many questions with regard to what is likely to ensue and nobody has made any attempt to explain the communiqué in its most significant form, and it remains to be seen, however much we would welcome it if it worked in the way the hopeful talk of the Minister would have it work&mdash;we would stand and cheer for it&mdash;whether it is a step forward or a step backward. I sincerely hope it is a step forward.  It contains most of the elements of what we have been looking for for a long time but does it commit us to something from which we cannot retrieve ourselves?  Has unification become a dirty word in this country?  Has it become something nobody wants to mention?  Have we got ashamed of it or afraid of it?  We all talk about peace and the desirability of peace.  Peace at any price &mdash;is that what it means?</P>

      <P>There is a division in this country.  I would love to stand up and cheer if I thought that this <Col N="1606" /> communiqué contains the elements of all the last speaker says it does. I have listened to Mr. Brian Faulkner on television.  He believes he has won. He believes he has sealed the partition of Ireland in perpetuity and that he has got for the first time, as he says, a solemn declaration that we will not interfere with the status of Northern Ireland and its constitutional position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will get an opportunity to speak.  I am making a point as to why we did not stand up and cheer.  I am completely in support of a step, even a small step as the last speaker has said, towards bringing about conciliation which to my mind means ultimate unification. If it has that element in it let us all cheer, and it is possible, quite possible, that it has.  I sincerely hope it has.  If it has not, the historic event will not be what it is said to be.  I thought the leader of this party gave it a most suitable and most responsible reception and I would expect speakers on the other side to stand up and congratulate him on his responsible approach to it because it does, in fact, embody what we have been seeking to achieve and what we have, in fact, set going in our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this brings about the ultimate end of the cause of trouble in the North, it does not matter whether it is Brian Faulkner, Jack Lynch, Liam Cosgrave or whoever brings it about, but we have to be told a few things about it before it can be given an unequivocal acceptance by this party.  We are rather accustomed to agreements being completed in past history where both sides came home declaring that they had won and we have rather painful recollections of the ultimate outcome and I would hope that a repetition of these things will not be the possible outcome of anything that happens now.  It is a historic step but I hope in the right direction.  Anybody at any time, if he concedes enough can bring about a suitable situation, but, what I see most acceptable to everybody is the fact that two factions <Col N="1607" /> who have been diametrically opposed have come together to work in the North.  This is something we always wanted to achieve&mdash;that at least they will learn that it is possible, that religious denomination has no part in nation buildings and they can work in harmony for peace, success and nationhood, but there are other things which must be considered seriously in that context.  The ultimate unification of this country is of paramount importance in any agreement which anybody concludes on behalf of this country and if there is anybody who thinks he can denigrate that aspiration or relegate it to oblivion, I am afraid that we would be very much wasting our time.</P>
    <P>These are facts.  We have been talking about realities and the reality of the situation is that everything that can possibly be done to achieve unification by peaceful means should be done.  That means we go forward and not backwards.  When this communiqué is properly explained and analysed, it could, I believe, contain the elements of even greater progress than the last speaker, the Minister for Justice, outlined when he referred to it as a &ldquo;delicate baby&rdquo;.  There is to be a Council of Ireland and a commission which will deal with matters falling on that council, that council which will have executive powers.  As I understand it, the council's decision must be unanimous.  If the commission propose certain powers unacceptable to even one individual, then the proposal is just not on.  I may be wrong in this and I would like to hear an explanation from Deputy Harte on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining some of the things that must worry anybody who seriously reads this document and would like to debate it in a serious manner.  We have not had a breakdown. The decision of the council must be unanimous.  Unanimity is referred to in the communiqué.  There is a commission which will decide those things that should be part of <Col N="1608" /> the powers of the council; if, however, any individual is not in agreement, then it is not acceptable to the council.  This is as I interpret the communiqué.  If the commission proposes some executive function which would raise the council above anything other than a mere parish pump talking committee one individual can prevent that being accepted as part of the powers of the council.  As I say, I may be wrong in that.  I hope I am.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has and it has no relevance to what we are debating here.  The leader of this party was entitled to question that which we do not understand.  He was also entitled not to be criticised by the Minister for Justice immediately afterwards. He had given a most responsible reception to something that has not been explained to the House or put before it in a proper way, something assumed to be before the House on the Adjournment debate for the Christmas recess, a debate which covers every aspect of Government policy, and he is told that he was carping.  I think Deputy Lynch gave this the only kind of reception a responsible Opposition Leader could give it, acknowledging all the difficulties that lay in the way of getting it off the ground, the possibilities that were there and stressing the fact that it should be given a chance.  Because he did not stand up and cheer he is told by the Minister for Finance that he was carping, irresponsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In that he is different from some of his colleagues. I should like an opportunity of having this agreement and the significance of its registration with the United Nations explained.  Is Mr. Brian Faulkner correct in what he says or is the Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, correct in what he says?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be questioned by the Deputy.  Like the Leader of my party, I am not prepared to give an unqualified welcome or unqualified support until I get some explanation as to which of the two political leaders is correct, the two leaders who hobnobbed in the negotiations, shook hands over the agreement.  One tells us he has got an unequivocal and solemn pledge of the constitutionality of the Northern Ireland state for the first time in history and he brings that back and sells the agreement to his people on that understanding and we here are expected to stand up and cheer for another reason, the opposite reason, and Deputy Harte asks me pathetically what do I think.  What could I think?  A couple of years from now Deputy Harte can ask me that question. I would not mind if it did not put us back.  I go that far.  I would support it if I were sure that we would not find ourselves a century back instead of a century forward.  If anyone can guarantee the position or give a reasonable assurance as to the position, I will not condemn; on the contrary, I will support it in every possible way.  It is possible that that is the case.  But the elements of doubt are there.  It has not been explained or analysed.  We have not been told whether the Taoiseach or Mr. Brian Faulkner is correct.  Who is codding whom?  The last speaker claimed that we were indulging in political carping. I believe we have received this in the way a responsible Opposition should receive it.  When the parties opposite were over here they always opposed everything we did.  They did it for the <Col N="1610" /> sake of opposition.  Our attitude since the Coalition took over has been one of support when the parties on the Government benches continued the policy we advocated.  That is our position.  If Deputies on the Government benches think that this communiqué relating to an agreement that has not been analysed or put before the House in a proper way will get them out of their difficulties as a result of their misdeeds over the past eight or nine years they are wrong.</P>

      <P>We have a right to highlight what we think is wrong. Deputy Lynch has covered the economic aspects.  The period on which we can look back now is not sufficiently long to permit us to deal with the Government's conduct of affairs.  When one takes an overall view of the position one finds that there is not one iota of policy change in the economic programme, or lack of programme, of this Government. Sometimes one is led to believe that there should be or that there is.  Like the child riding the bicycle who calls out to his mother: &ldquo;Look Ma, no hands&rdquo;, there seemed to be amazement that the Government could continue where Fianna Fáil left off.  There was infatuation and everybody held his breath waiting for something radical to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That old cliché is not even applicable now.  It does not even fit.  I have not spoken very often in this House because I feel it is premature. The Government Ministers have opened our schools, opened the factories we built, made long speeches and spoken about the future.  However, that is as far as they got.  The budget was a testing point for the Government who promised to remove VAT off food in their 14-point programme, <Col N="1611" /> and a reduction in prices. The Government dilly-dallied on the VAT question until September, and by the time it was removed prices had gone up more than what was taken off food.  There has been no change and that is obvious.</P>
      <P>On the other matter the Government threw up their hands and did nothing.  When the Minister concerned was questioned he replied that he would do what Fianna Fáil did. That is virtually the answer to everything in relation to the problem. Many of the new taxes in the budget had the effect of further aggravating the inflationary spiral on which the Government blames everything.  No relief was given to the worker in his income tax allowance, a very necessary prerequisite to preparation for the national pay agreement.  Congress virtually advised us to do it on the last occasion when we were asked to withdraw the legislation we had intended bringing in.  We complied with the request of Congress by not creating any new taxes in order to have a proper environment and climate for a new national agreement. This Government has done nothing about it.  They have gone in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>The Government saw their mistake so well that in the Monaghan bye-election they told the people this would be done in the next budget. That was the first time I ever heard a budget proposal announced at an election meeting.  The Minister for Local Government, in my own presence, announced that in the next budget there would be an adjustment of the income tax allowance for the workers.  I never heard a statement of that type made six months prior to a budget.</P>

This man made an agreement that the patient would go to work for him on the following Wednesday but when he was leaving he was struck on the head by a brick thrown by the patient who shouted after him not to forget Wednesday.  That is typical of what is happening here.  We have a day-to-day effort.  From day to day one wonders if the Government have forgotten what they promised the previous day.</P>
      <P>The Government think they can hide behind what the Minister for Justice called a &ldquo;small step in the national affairs in relation to the Six Counties&rdquo; and forget about everything else.  They think they can turn this into a debate on the communiqué from which an agreement, to be signed at some future date, will issue in relation to a Council of Ireland.  I promise constructive support, as much as any front bench member of this party will give, for what emanates from this communiqué if we are given some analysis of it.  If we are told that it would not suit to give this analysis for fear of revealing something confidential I will accept that.  I do not say that in a facetious manner. It is probable that there is something good in this which the Government do not wish to talk about because it might have the wrong effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> I can recall many times in the past when the present Leader of the Opposition, as Taoiseach, was asked embarrassing questions which he thought better not to answer in the interest of progress.  The Minister for Justice attacked the leader of my party for the carping reception he gave to this communiqué.  Anybody who reads the speech of the Leader of the Opposition tomorrow will come to the conclusion that it was a most responsible reception to what is a delicate issue and about which the people do not know enough.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the ineptitude of the Government.  That word, ineptitude, has been used so often in this House that it sometimes loses its significance but the stock in trade of the publicity campaign that has been in operation for the last seven months gave us to understand that an extraordinarily efficient and highly qualified Government had taken over. That is a correct interpretation of what has been churned out by the media, but there is nothing on the record to substantiate that image.  We have had one crises after another since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>The Government handled the fuel crisis in an inept manner.  The announcement that we were going to be short of oil must have sent everybody out collecting in cans.  When we reached the stage that the panic eased off the Minister concerned spoke of the serious situation existing in the country and that if the crises continued every aspect of the economy would be hit.  However, the Minister did not try to get the private consumer of fuel to economise so that the essential services could receive their full requirement.  The action of the Ministers concerned in this regard was childish.  It was not in keeping with the high standards we were told we could expect.  Fianna Fáil could do better than that.  They could not do worse. Irrespective of political outlook everyone must have an interest in the welfare of the country, no matter who gets the credit for it or who brings it about.  I would hate to see anything going wrong.  I <Col N="1614" /> sincerely hope that nothing will go wrong.  It does not inspire confidence when one hears the Taoiseach claiming that something that happened in the last three months has led towards increased exports and better economic outlook.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the Deputy did not listen to the speech the Taoiseach made.  It is really interesting. Having generalised in regard to the communiqué, he made no attempt to explain anything.  There has been no reference so far to paragraph 5, which worries people.  Noticeably, nobody has made any reference.  It is conspicuous by the absence of mention. This is the one on which the assurance should be given.  The Taoiseach said, while talking about the present state of the economy in relation to rate of increase in exports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He could not point to one single thing he did that has created anything in the way of improved exports.  It is just talking nonsense.  This is something that does not happen overnight.  It develops over a long period.  Action could be taken that would overnight have a serious effect on it.  It would be just as correct for me now, to read the latest figure issued in regard to the balance of trade and, to say that the increase in imports has considerably exceeded the increase in exports to a far greater extent than in the corresponding period, and I could say that that is due to Government action. These things do not happen overnight. They develop as a result of long-term organisation and work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I commence my speech I should like to take Deputy Brennan to task.  The whole theme of his speech was whether or not Brian Faulkner's interpretation of what transpired at Sunningdale is the correct version or whether the version put forward by the Taoiseach is the correct one.  Surely Deputy Brennan must agree that all people of moderate opinion, having the normal amount of intelligence, have come to the conclusion that reunification of this country is not on until such time as we can persuade one million people north of the Border that we have a society on this side of the Border which they would like to join and surely Brian Faulkner realises that when 51 per cent of the people of Northern Ireland say: &ldquo;We are now prepared to discuss reunification of the country&rdquo; this is tantamount to saving the same as what the Taoiseach is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> What disappoints me is that while the divisions between people in the North of Ireland are so great, while there is the hatred, the misunderstanding, the death and destruction there, yet people of different facets of Irish life are prepared to sit down and work out an agreement and the Fianna Fáil Party are reluctant to give their consent willingly to the Sunningdale agreement.  I sincerely hope that the speakers who will follow the former Taoiseach and the deputy leader of the Fianna Fáil Party will be more magnanimous in their appraisal of the situation in Sunningdale and will rise above the level of Irishmen south of the Border who have refused in the past to recognise realities.</P>
    <P>I want to ask Deputy Brennan one question: If the British Government in 1916 had offered Pádraig Pearse a Parliament internationally recognised, our own defence forces, our own police force, our Civil Service, the right of self-determination, instead of death and destruction, instead of long years in penal servitude, what would Pádraig Pearse and his comrades have done?  They would have accepted the settlement that was ours in 1922.  The settlement of 1922 had in its being an Irish dimension&mdash;Irish dimension being a modern way of calling what Collins called a steppingstone. It was never used.  That honourable divide between Irishmen in 1922 was a genuine mistake between people who believed in one strand of republicanism and others who believed in another way of national reunification.</P>
    <P>I, as a member of this generation, am prepared to forgive completely the mistakes on both sides at that time but I fail to see any reason why I should even attempt to understand people who 50 years later are still dilly-dallying around that bush.  There is no excuse for it.  The traditions of Irish life, the mistakes of the past have made us understand that the only way to reunification is by consent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan was a member of the Government here from 1957 until 1973, for 16 years, and until the civil rights movement started in 1966 in <Col N="1618" /> Northern Ireland&mdash;and, indeed, for a couple of years afterwards&mdash;the Government of the day here paid no attention to the Northern situation. Deputy Brennan now talks of reunification. The Fianna Fáil Party, having been 40 years in Government, all during my lifetime, are now finding solutions to national reunification from the Opposition benches.  Do they think the country is dumb?  For 40 years they sat there doing nothing but paying lip service to it.  At election times they brought out the drums and beat them.  They blew the horn and talked about reunification.  They sent spokesmen to the United Nations at times of crisis.  They made nice noises in the Council of Europe.  Platforms at general elections in the south of Ireland spurted with nothing but hate for the Northern Unionists, instead of understanding.  What were they doing but creating counter-productive politics, pushing the Unionist people into a corner into which some of them did not want to go and not trying to understand them?</P>
    <P>I, as one of a generation of Irishmen who have listened to the stories of the past, readily confess that my idea of reunification was very much along the lines of what Deputy Brennan said in his speech.  I am prepared to say that I was wrong.  It is just as dearly my wish to reunify the country as it is Deputy Brennan's. The Fianna Fáil Party have no monopoly of ideas for reunification: they have no monopoly of wisdom.  They have what all of us have got from God, simple common sense and if they used it now and again we might have a better society.  I have spent some &mdash;perhaps not as much as I should have&mdash;of my time north of the Border and I have gone into the camps of those whom we did not call our people, into the Shankill Road and east Belfast to talk to people who possibly would have cut my throat only that people had introduced me to them saying: &ldquo;Will you at least listen?&rdquo; On the first occasion that I met these people there was hard argument but after an hour's debate we discovered that we had married the same type of girls, had the same <Col N="1619" /> type of families, the same problems and the same identification.  The only thing we disagreed on was our political belief.  I do not know whether Deputy Brennan is smirking at my remarks or at some joke he is thinking about.  But if Irishmen who hate each other's politics can sit down together and agree that they have so much in common, surely we should try to develop the things we have in common and explain away political differences.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party in office repeatedly&mdash;the former President, Eamon de Valera, the former Taoiseach, the late Seán Lemass and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, and every other leading spokesman of Fianna Fáil&mdash;and time without number have said: &ldquo;We will not coerce you; we will seek peaceful means; we will not use force&rdquo;; and in the same breath they said: &ldquo;We will not give <i>de jure</i> recognition to Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  I have yet to find out what the Fianna Fáil stand is because they never have a policy; they do not yet know if they have one but whatever the situation is, I want to make it very clear that my intention in my remarks in this House is not to be critical in order to score political points over the Fianna Fáil Party.  My speech will be hard and factual because only by clear speaking to the people across the floor of the House can we really understand each other.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have given assurances to the Northern community time and again that they will not coerce.  What do they mean&mdash;that they will not force?  That is my understanding of it. If you say you will not force surely you are saying: &ldquo;We are giving you the right to decide.&rdquo;  If you give the right to decide surely you are recognising their right to stay out instead of coming in with us.  If that is not <i>de jure</i> recognition they had better be more selective in their phraseology.</P>
    <P>We say we will not use force but we have repeatedly committed the offence of allowing people to use our name in using force.  We have oscillated from the position of having internment <Col N="1620" /> to encouraging them.  Deputy Brennan need not shed crocodile tears about this because he has been a member of a Government who used internment to put these people down and he has also been a member of a party who have encouraged people to use violence against the northerners.</P>
    <P>We come then to the last and most condemning statement of all: &ldquo;We will seek peaceful means.&rdquo;  In what way have we tried to understand the Northern community, to seek peaceful means?  Have we ever tried to understand why the Northern Unionist does not want to join us?  If we have, it has been done secretly because I am not aware of it.  I am tempted to say that in September, 1969, four weeks exactly after the day of Bogside which began this recent trouble in Northern Ireland, I was party to a document presented to the Fine Gael Party for adoption and it makes very interesting reading at this time and I would like to put it on the record of the House.  This is a document compiled by the late Michael Sweetman, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, as he then was, and myself.  It sets out ten points of policy and it is the first time that any political party put down in writing what their attitude is to the Northern problem.  It may be boring to Deputy Brennan but I will attempt to read it to him.  The first point is that development in the Republic of policy with regard to Northern Ireland should be carried out in consultation with those democratically elected representatives in Northern Ireland who are opposed to policies of privilege and sectarianism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>After Deputy Seán Lemass went there and opened up the talks.  The Deputy is talking a lot <Col N="1621" /> of rubbish.  He is trying to escalate acrimony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to escalate acrimony.  The second point is that the Government here should concentrate their diplomatic efforts on securing maximum British support for the creation of normal democracy and a just society in Northern Ireland and for initiating greater co-operation between the three Governments.  That has happened.  The third point is that towards these ends the Government should press the British Government to reconstitute the RUC as a civil unarmed police force, similar to the Garda Síochána, recruited from all groups in the community and confined to normal police duties.  It should also support the disbandment of the B Specials and press for the maintenance of order by a genuinely neutral force.  The document goes on:</P>
      <P>4.  The Government should press not alone for the immediate implementation of the one-man one-vote principle in local elections, but also for the creation of electoral areas with boundaries fairly and impartially drawn, and for guarantees that gerrymandering will not be possible in future in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>This has also happened.</P>
      <P>5.  The Government should, after appropriate consulation with Northern opinion, press the British Government to ensure representation of the minority in the Northern Ireland Government as the sole means of reassuring the minority as to the full and continued implementation of the proposed reforms, and fair treatment for this minority.</P>
      <P>That has happened.</P>
      <P>6.  The Government should initiate discussions with the British and Northern Ireland Governments for the creation of a body similar to the Council of Ireland envisaged at the time of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to state that that was the first time the Council of Ireland had been mentioned since the Treaty times.  Some people are giving credit to the former Home Secretary, <Col N="1622" /> James Callaghan, as being the person who first mentioned the Council of Ireland as a means of settlement. That is not so.  The idea was mentioned three or four months in advance of that.</P>
    <P>7.  The Government, and the political parties in Dáil Éireann, should assert formally their rejection of force as a solution to the division of Ireland, and should clearly state their intention to work towards a voluntary reunion of the people of both parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That has happened.</P>
    <P>8.  The Government and the political parties in Dáil Éireann should, in consultation with representatives of all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, initiate a study of the changes necessary in the Constitution and laws of the Republic in order to make them acceptable to the widest possible spectrum of opinion in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is being done.</P>
    <P>9.  The political parties in the Republic should pledge themselves to work together to create in the Republic conditions of economic prosperity and social justice, including social welfare arrangements comparable with those in Northern Ireland, so as to eliminate any economic or social obstacles to the reunification of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that is one of our aims.</P>
    <P>10.  The Government should immediately establish an all-party committee for Northern Ireland affairs to secure the implementation of the above policies.</P>
    <P>I take pride in the fact that I was one of the three people who drew up this policy document.  Last week when I re-read it I wondered what inspired the three of us to spell out clearly for the first time the direction towards a settlement in Northern Ireland.  I hope the three people will receive just recognition.  Two of us are still alive; unfortunately one, a young man, with tremendous promise in Irish politics, lost his life in very tragic circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> I would ask Fianna Fáil if Ted Heath last Sunday in Sunningdale had said to the Taoiseach and those who accompanied him: &ldquo;You have got a united Ireland&rdquo;, would they have advised us to take over the legacy of bombing, murders and deaths that are taking place in Northern Ireland?  Do they think we could do any better than what is being done at the moment?  I want the reunification of this country.  I have said that here in repeated statements; I have spoken at university gatherings, at branch meetings, and in different parts of Northern Ireland&mdash;my choice is reunification under one Parliament but that is not possible.  It is not possible because we have not yet found a political system that could be controlled by one Parliament, to which Irishmen of different traditions could give consent.</P>
    <P>The only way to reunification is to unite the country under two Parliaments, each giving full recognition to the other, each having its own political system to which the people under its control would give consent.  We are heading in that direction&mdash;under that umbrella, the Council of Ireland will harmonise traditions on both sides of the Border and give Irish people an opportunity to identify and relate to something that is theirs.</P>
    <P>We must be clear about this.  This Parliament could never give recognition to the Stormont that was, not because it was a Northern Ireland Parliament but because it was a sectarian parliament with sectarian structures.  I, for one, could not condone that kind of thing.  However, we are not now being asked to do that. We are being asked now to give recognition to a northern assembly, an assembly set up by Irishmen, in the hope that the people elected to it will be given the opportunity to run that part of the country in the way they see best for the people there so that in the long term we can find a political system to which the Northern Unionist or Loyalist will give his consent.</P>
    <P>Our choice is this: If we want reunification, do we accept the Northern Protestant Unionist, Loyalist as <Col N="1624" /> he is, or do we try to convert him into a Southern Catholic Republican? If we can succeed in converting him into a Southern Catholic Republican. then we do not have to find a political solution.  We do not have to change our Constitution or our way of life; he will come into it because he will identify with us.</P>
    <P>We know that the Northern Unionist, Loyalist Protestant will not become a Southern Catholic Republican, no more than we will become Protestant Unionists.  If we want those people to come into our way of life we must accept them as they are.  It would be unnatural for them to come in any other way, just as it would be unnatural for us to join in their way of life.  I do not want to be other than I am and I do not want anyone else to have to change either. It is unfair of us to create a society south of the Border that is alien to the thinking of Irish people born into the Protestant Unionist tradition.  It is unfair of us to try to create conditions on this side of the Border that will make it impossible for them to join us while, at the same time, forcing a united Ireland down their throats.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions for two or three years with people of the different extremes.  I hope they have the opportunity of reading my speech because I want to pay a compliment to them. The conversation is always similar, there is no difference.  The difference is, with the Provo Republican in the South, in that he wants a united Ireland to solve the problems while I want to solve the problems to have a united Ireland.  That is the difference between us and I speak from the middle ground.</P>
    <P>The only difference between the Provo in the South and the Loyalist in the North is that they have been born into different traditions.  I am convinced that had Bill Craig been born a republican in Cork he would now be preaching the merits of republicanism. Equally I am convinced that had my colleague from northeast Donegal, Deputy Blaney, been born into the Protestant Loyalist tradition in north Antrim he would not hold the views he holds today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> The accident of birth decides most, if not all, of the attitudes that are adopted.  There are the odd exceptions; occasionally a person will not go the way taken by his parents, but that is the exception.</P>
    <P>I imagine the reason Fianna Fáil have not given a warm-hearted welcome to the Sunningdale agreement is because they have never, as a party, come to terms with giving recognition to the Northern Ireland State.  They give <i>de facto</i> recognition but they will not give <i>de jure</i> recognition.  As far as I am concerned that is meaningless. To the people in the Border areas, and very particularly to the people in the Six Counties who have to live with car bombs and shootings and indiscriminate murder, <i>de jure</i> recognition means very little.  If <i>de jure</i> recognition in the short term can lead to an Irish settlement, and an Irish settlement must mean reunification of this country because that is what ultimate settlement is, but settlement on conditions acceptable to our Northern brothers, in a society in which they have a part to play, in a society of which they are a part, if that is what <i>de jure</i> recognition means, I am prepared to give it.  I do not see any justification for a person in this Parliament, or living far enough away from the scenes of murder, to stand up and say he will not give <i>de jure</i> recognition just because of the loss of pride.  Mostly it is a loss of pride, for some people because of very deep prejudice.  I question his right to say that he will not give <i>de jure</i> recognition because of these simple facts when children are being killed, when fathers and mothers are being killed, when property is being destroyed, when the whole fabric of society is disappearing.  We will have Deputies here engaging in semantics, trying to justify themselves and we will have people in simple conversation in public houses, at street corners or at firesides saying they would not be prepared to do this or to do that.  With respect to those people, peace among Irishmen must be paramount and it is in that tradition that I stand.</P>
    <P>Anything that will bring about peace among Irishmen I will support. <Col N="1626" /> I am not interested in the legal phrases <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> because they mean nothing to me.  Let those people who start defining nationalism or republicanism as being a brand of politics of which they have a monopoly understand the meaning of the words. Nationalism means nothing to me if I do not have the right to live and support my wife and family and have a friendly relationship with my neighbours and have that applied to other people.  If you do not have this, nationalism means nothing and republicanism means nothing either.  The same applies to the people who believe that loyalism is the be all and end all. It means nothing to them if they do not have the right to provide for their wives and children, if they do not have the right to earn a living, if they do not have the right to live.  The sooner we give those words their true meaning the better.  One Irishman said that Ireland meant nothing to him without its people.  I am saying it in different ways.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies, particularly Deputy Brennan, laboured the question of reunification.  What was Deputy Brennan's party's contribution to reunification?  They prostituted the Irish language.  They made it impossible for people who did not have an opportunity of learning the Irish langauge to become members of the Garda Síochána or of the Defence Forces.  If a young Protestant boy from across the border in Northern Ireland wanted to be patriotic and came across to become a cadet in the Irish Army he could not do so unless he could speak Irish.  However, as has happened, he could become a Member of Dáil Éireann without knowing Irish.  He could become a Parliamentary Secretary without knowing Irish. He could become a Minister without knowing Irish.  We have had them. He could become Tanáiste without knowing Irish.</P>

      <P>This is the contribution Fianna Fáil were making to reunification, creating ultra-conservative notions south of the border that made it virtually impossible for northerners to come south.  They tried to create the super green Irishman, the mythological Irishman that nobody knew of south of the border, that nobody wanted south of the border, that did not exist south of the border, but in the minds of the Northern Protestants he was there and they did not want him and they would not be part of him.  This was Fianna Fáil's contribution to reunification.</P>
      <P>Now when we have a settlement that is definitely a vehicle for peace, they are not big enough to say they will support it enthusiastically.  Even if it has flaws, even if we have not got everything we want at Sunningdale, we have achieved something and we have lost nothing.  Indeed the merit of Sunningdale is that while every person there or every group there did not get everything they wanted they lost nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The divisions in Northern Ireland are so great that it is just simple stupidity for Members of this House to disagree.  I have spoken many times in this House as an Opposition Deputy.  In fact this is my first time to speak as a Government Deputy.  I have tried in Opposition to be as responsible as a Deputy could be from the Opposition benches.  I do not know whether I achieved that or not.  I do not want to be the judge of it myself. The Fianna Fáil Party have a very important role to play in the years that lie ahead, whether in Opposition or in Government&mdash;and that decision rests, as far as I am concerned, with the people.  If this Government do not live up to the promises they have made, if they fail to govern the people in the way the people want to be <Col N="1628" /> governed, then the Fianna Fáil Party are there to be the alternative Government. They now find themselves in Opposition.  I would appeal to those in the Fianna Fáil Party who are making loud noises.  I would say to them as Irishmen and in the interests of other Irishmen who find it so difficult to sit down and talk to each other: &ldquo;Settle your differences. Do not rock the boat.&rdquo;  It means nothing at all south of the border if a half dozen Deputies of any one political party step out of line and rock the boat, whether it is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, but it can make a lot of difference north of the Border.  You have people like the Reverend Ian Paisley trying to scare the Northern Protestant into believing that the Council of Ireland means that members of the Garda Síochána will be going north of the Border to police, and then we have Deputy Blaney saying, as he said in Milford on Friday last, that members of the RUC will be coming this side of the Border to do likewise.  Here we have two men, coming basically from the same social backgrounds but born into different traditions, each using the same weapon for self preservation. It is my honest assessment of the situation that Deputy Blaney is motivated by a desire to rock the Fianna Fáil boat and that he may wish to unseat the present Leader of that party.  I am sorry that the Deputy is not here to hear me, but if I am wrong in my interpretation of his approach to the present political situation I apologise to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Deputy is making, but I wonder if he could convince Deputy Blaney and his supporters in Donegal that they are not in Fianna Fáil.  The Reverend Ian Paisley is being motivated solely by a desire to destroy Brian Faulkner.  Far be it for me to <Col N="1629" /> be a defender of Mr. Faulkner, but he is the democratically elected representative of a section of people in the North, and if we cherish democracy we must acknowledge that he speaks for those people.  I would ask the Irish people to assess carefully the issues at stake because there is no alternative to Sunningdale or, if there is, no one has come forward and said so.  There is no alternative to a conference table other than the alternative of the bullet and bomb. I have no wish to be executed in any vain effort to re-unite this country and neither would I wish any members of my family to lose their lives in any such efforts, and in saying that I have a right to say that these standards should apply also to other people.</P>
      <P>There is a great danger in mad, out-of-line speeches at this time.  To the back-benchers of Fianna Fáil I would say that, if they have anything to say to their Leader, they should go to his office and say it to him; but let them be loyal to him at a time of crisis.  The issue at stake is much more important than the question of who leads what or where south of the Border.  I am confident that the Taoiseach can do an excellent job of creating a new society in this part of the country.  I know also that members of Fianna Fáil, many of whom I have had the pleasure of serving with on Committees of this House, are sincere in their efforts to create these conditions, but there are Members of this House, who, for personal reasons, are interested only in party political gain.  The odds are too great north of the Border for anyone to indulge in politics of that type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall speaking here about 12 months ago and referring to a traumatic effect which a certain incident had on me immediately after the shootings in Derry on Bloody Sunday. I was speaking of what I saw in St. Mary's Church in the Creggan when the remains of those who had been killed were being received at the church.  The fourth coffin to be taken into the church carried the remains of 17-year-old John Young.  I told of <Col N="1630" /> how one of his three brothers who were carrying the coffin broke down physically and of how the coffin would have fallen to the floor if some people standing close by had not gone to the assistance of the other people carrying it.  I saw many men, including cameramen and reporters, crying unashamedly at that sight.  I asked myself what had happened to Irish politics to allow this tragedy to happen and I wondered whether in 15 years' time there would be a repeat of these tragedies.  I wondered also whether, in 15 or 20 years' time, my sons might be carrying the remains of a younger brother and I asked what is the purpose of all this.</P>
    <P>The next occasion on which I saw four brothers carrying the remains of a dead brother was in my own county in January of this year.  The remains being carried this time were those of Oliver Boyce who, with his girlfriend, had been killed.  Again, I wondered whether I might witness such a sight again but, regrettably, this happened again in Donegal when a young Protestant boy, John Cunningham from Carndonagh, was shot by Protestant extremists as he was returning from Belfast.  His remains, too, were carried to the grave by his four brothers.  Once again I witnessed four other brothers carrying the remains of a dead brother.  This time the remains were those of John Doherty, a young RUC constable, who had been shot.</P>
    <P>What has gone wrong with Irish society to have allowed such things to happen when people's lives are taken away for no gain, while we in this Parliament are arguing among ourselves as to whether we should give <i>de jure</i> recognition to Northern Ireland? As regards Deputy Brennan, who gives a damn whether he gives <i>de jure</i> recognition to Northern Ireland?  But it is important that a responsible Opposition party should recognise the issues at stake here.  I did not know John Young; neither did I know Oliver Boyce, but I knew his family. I did not know John Cunningham, but I knew John Doherty.  I had seen him grow up.  He came from a very poor family who lived in a county <Col N="1631" /> council cottage.  Their father got work on, perhaps, only four or five days each year and lived on unemployment assistance for the remainder of the time because he could not get work.  John Doherty wished to join the Garda Síochána but because Fianna Fáil said that one must have Irish in order to qualify for the police force, he went away and joined the London police.  However, when Cardinal Conway appealed for more Catholics to join the RUC after Sir Arthur Young came to Northern Ireland, John Doherty came back to Ireland&mdash;not to a 6-county Ireland but to Ireland&mdash;to become a police officer. But there were misguided boys who set a trap for him and shot him.  It might be argued that he was indiscreet in entering the Republic but no one had a right to take his life.</P>
    <P>In what cause have these four young people gone to their graves?  How many other young people and children have been killed or maimed, but yet Fianna Fáil fail to rise above their own level and say that they will accept the agreement and will back it most enthusiastically.  To the people who do not make a contribution to the peace of this island I would say that on their shoulders must lie the responsibility for the deaths of these people and for the lives of the people who may be killed before a settlement is reached.  The young soldiers who shot John Young on Bloody Sunday did not know what he stood for or what it was all about.  Nevertheless, they shot him.  Oliver Boyce was killed by Protestant extremists who hated him, but we might ask who taught them to hate and whether they can be faulted for hating.</P>
    <P>John Cunningham was killed because some people hated what he did and expressed that hate by murder. But, again, can we truthfully blame them, or do we again blame the society which taught them?  John Doherty was killed by the IRA or by Catholic extremists, but again we might ask: who taught these people to hate?  Was it the politicians who did not give the clear lead to a better society south of the Border?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> I know who I would blame, but maybe I would not blame them completely because we all share the blame in that we have all stood back and watched all of this happen.  Some of us have even turned our backs and walked away and said that the battle is not ours.  Strangely enough it is not the bomber or the gunman who is killed as a rule but the innocent people who say it is not their battle. The people who turned their backs and walked away are those who are being killed.  I repeat: it is not the bomber or the gunman who loses his life.</P>
    <P>I could cite examples and continue to ask why the Fianna Fáil Party are lacking at this stage of the debate in giving a warm welcome to the settlement. No one ever expected that when the Taoiseach and members of his Cabinet went to Sunningdale, and when members of the Unionists, the Alliance Party and the SDLP went there they could attempt to solve in a weekend the problems of Northern Ireland which, in fact, are the problems of Ireland.  No one other than a lunatic would expect from the Sunningdale talks a solution that would be the ultimate.</P>
    <P>Most of us rather expected what was going to happen.  We probably could have predicted it because of what the political correspondents had written about the contentious articles and the points of agreement.  What most of us hoped for was a type of settlement which would be a means towards a final settlement.  If that is what our hopes were based on, I compliment the Taoiseach and the other members of the Irish delegations, north and south, for having arrived at the settlement they finally agreed to.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Carter will agree, the things that divide the present Government and the Opposition about this agreement are so insignificant that they do not even merit mention.  The success of this agreement means so much.  So many people's lives can be saved.  So many young people will have the right to go to a dance in Belfast, to say the least of it.  A generation is growing up there which <Col N="1633" /> knows nothing but hate.  They must be taught differently.  All of us have a part to play, and in the quietness of the evening we must ask forgiveness for not doing more.</P>
    <P>Surely my appeal to the Fianna Fáil Party should not fall on deaf ears. Give us your consent to this, as we, when in Opposition, gave consent to the manner in which the then Taoiseach, Deputy J. Lynch, was governing the country.  No one can dispute the fact that the bi-partisan policy which existed here before the change of government was anything but harmonious. I hope the Fianna Fáil Party are not going to rock the boat.  From my personal knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition I know that if the boat is rocked it will not be his doing. The boat will not only be rocked in the Fianna Fáil Party and in this Parliament, but the results of it could rock the thinking on the southern, political ideals.  This will only happen by members of the Fianna Fáil Party believing that another member of that party would bring them back to power sooner than that might happen under their present Leader.</P>
    <P>I do not want to lecture.  I hope that some of the Fianna Fáil Party who are not here may read my remarks.  As far as I am concerned &mdash;and I say this quite deliberately&mdash; the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Parties are a passing phase in Irish history.  Over 50 years ago they were not known.  Who knows what will happen in 50 years' time or whether the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour Parties will still be here.  It is not important.  What is important is that the Irish people, no matter in what tradition they have been reared, will have the right to live and to express themselves in a natural way.</P>
    <P>Peace among Irishmen must be paramount.  I will conclude by saying that it is in that tradition I have stood and will continue to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Harte need have no fears about the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to this communiqué.  I was in the House and I do not think it can be said that Deputy J. Lynch in his comments in any way tried to take <Col N="1634" /> from the contents of the communiqué. Deputy J. Lynch merely dealt with it and asked for further information.  In that context it might have been better if the Taoiseach, when he was introducing his Estimate, had dealt a little more deeply with this matter, as he is competent to do.  Perhaps that might have been the means of avoiding some of the comments which have been made.  Certainly Deputy J. Lynch, as leader of this party, had nothing but open arms for the agreement and did not condemn it in any way.  He merely asked for further information in regard to certain paragraphs.  That is a reasonable request.  It is open to the leader of any Opposition in any House to ask the same sort of question.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we are here inclined, as we always do in times of high-level negotiations, to indulge in euphoria. On the other hand, we can go into the &ldquo;dumps,&rdquo; as it were, at the other end.  We have been long enough in this House&mdash;and even before we came in&mdash;listening to comments on this whole matter.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, apart from a few comments which were made by way of further elucidation on the communiqué, everyone is in agreement with it.  Why not?  Deputy J. Lynch spent a long time as leader of this Party dealing with this very problem. Not merely on the home ground but abroad, he is on record in a wide way and his views on this question are well known.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we should not get too emotive about certain elements which go to make up this terrible problem with which we have been living for a long time.  We know the terrible blockage it has created in the minds of the people here, the terrible disadvantages it has placed this country in from the point of view of trade and so on.  We had the two ends of the nation thinking separately.  We know that any move to reduce this sort of thinking and to direct it otherwise is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us who have lived with it know that it is time to take the steam out of violence, to get the men of <Col N="1635" /> hatred out of the way.  For too long we have had people dealing in murder, arson, robbery and so on&mdash; all the products of hatred.  These crimes were committed in the name of patriotism.  All of us realise that we have a democratically elected Government and that if we are to have control of our destinies, of our own affairs, we must subscribe in a constitutional way to the efforts of whichever Government may be in power, not merely in dealing with negotiations of the kind we are now discussing but with other large scale matters, matters of trade and commerce, matters concerning Europe.</P>
    <P>It is not right that we should become either too euphoric or too emotive about this whole matter.  No one with any sense of history and certainly no one who has lived here in the past 20 or 30 years can blame any figure in history for the emergency which we are now enduring.  As a famous man in the south of Ireland said recently, no one in this House ever voted for Partition but we found ourselves with it.  I do not suppose we ever learned to live with it, as it were, and having regard to our history and background prior to it there were those among us who resorted to force on every occasion.</P>
    <P>Force in this instance is the wrong kind of medicine.  Therefore it must fall to the lot of the democratically elected Government to deal with it and it must fall to the lot of the people who believe in our democratic institutions to back up the Government. That is taking it in broad outline. I do not think Deputies need worry about the attitude of our party towards this communiqué, this agreement. I have had many conversations with people from the North.  I have been a member of the All-Party Committee of this House during the past few years.  People seem to think that it might increase the chances of reconciliation to talk in the first instance about unity as a prerequisite. Would it not be better to speak first of reconciliation, because in this context there have been numerous people in Northern Ireland who through the <Col N="1636" /> years have been brainwashed into the belief that we have had some ugly designs on their way of life and perhaps on their personalities?</P>
    <P>Members of the minority who live here will bear testimony to the fact that no such designs exist in the minds of any persons here.  If members of the minority would speak up here they could testify that there has been equal rights and equal opportunities available here for all.  Therefore, on the floor of this House we should not distort this matter.  It would be too bad at this stage that we would give that impression.  As I have said, if a Deputy wants to query some paragraph in the communiqué it is open to him in a democratic way to do so but I do not think that when he engages in that sort of exercise his motives should be queried, especially when his motives are well known and on record, when he has been widely publicised as having the view that reconciliation is the primary aim and that trade and commerce and social aims should take first place in any scheme of reconciliation.  We should lay aside that kind of tactic in this debate and proceed as factually as we can.</P>
    <P>I have met a number of people from the North in the past few years, people who genuinely believe in their work for reconciliation, and I have always heard them say that we should aim first of all at this requirement rather than to indulge in other kinds of talk. We know that any delegation which will go out to negotiate on behalf of this country will have a difficult time even if they go to negotiate a trade agreement much less something which has been causing agitation, bad feeling, resentment and anger.  It has caused people to look back in anger on every British statesman up to the present time.</P>
    <P>The greater volume of our trade is done with Britain.  Britain at one stage provided work for our emigrants, who no doubt earned their bread there, and we had a large volume of emigration which happily we have now reduced. Despite all this we always have the spectacle of not merely looking back in anger but of charge and counter-charge <Col N="1637" /> being made in public and private on the various personalities here and in Britain.  Large numbers of people north and south are subscribing to the aim of reconciliation. Over 97 per cent of the people here would be behind any Government in any move to try to reduce the violence and promote a better spirit between the communities.  Possibly 80 to 85 per cent of the people in the North of Ireland would be prepared to go along with that.  It would be a tragedy if, in view of the large numbers on each side who want to reach a better understanding, a few violent men on this side or the other side could vote to achieve the impossible and bend the will of the peoples on both sides of the Border.  If they do, it is a reflection on us.</P>
    <P>History has been blamed for a certain amount.  We are too near those happenings to give a decision on that. Possibly in our time we did not talk enough about the subject.  A number of people did not think deeply enough about this terrible problem.  Certainly the British people only think about it when something occurs and they lose personnel or treasure.  Then they think about it and possibly not very deeply.  One has to put oneself in the position of a hard line Unionist on the other side of the Border who believes that the only Government to which he could subscribe would be his own type of Government, and that was a permanent majority.  The laws which would emerge from that majority would be the laws which should be imposed on the minority.  It takes a while to convince that type of individual that there is any good in our system.  Mr. Faulkner has been mentioned in this debate.  He never at any time subscribed to violence and we hope he will succeed in continuing his mandate in order that he will be able to implement his side of it.</P>
    <P>We hope that the Council of Ireland will work.  We are in the dark as to what its functions will be, how it will be financed, and whether it will have an all-Ireland function. These matters exercise the minds of people who think in terms of reconciliation. As I said earlier those of us <Col N="1638" /> who have lived through the various assaults on life and property on both sides of the Border know that force will never be the solution.  If it is claimed to be a solution, what degree of force and what loss of life would make any inroads into this problem? We all agreed that this is a step on the road to reconciliation.  We all seek to come to an understanding of this terrible problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss some other matters which are troubling me at the moment.  We live in a period of scarcity.  Certain commodities become scarce in times of world strife.  They are scarce and dear and some of them cannot be purchased.  Fuel is very scarce and this will create a major problem for us in the future.  It will affect Britain as well.  Labour relations in Britain have been very disturbed for some time past.  We should all like to see, in the interests of this country, a continuance of the national wage agreement.  We live in times when small sections of people can inflict fierce wounds on the economy.  We live in times when we have nationalised power.  Some few years ago we witnessed a small group threatening to black out the countryside in the winter.  We see the same thing happening in Britain.  Fortunately here, due to better labour organisation and more advanced thinking, and higher standards amongst the labour unions &mdash;I must say that&mdash;in 1969 we achieved a national wage agreement. I am open to correction on that but I think it was in 1969.  The country owes a good deal to the national wage agreement.  By implementing it we avoided the worst pitfalls which the British economy was unable to avoid, even allowing for the fact that the labour organisations there are much older than ours.  There was good sense here not merely on the part of the labour unions and labour leaders, but also on the part of the then Government and the then Minister for Finance who was the chief architect of the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Being an open-ended economy as the Taoiseach said, we are being caught up in the jams which arise outside, <Col N="1639" /> the jamming of industry, the jamming of power, the war in the Middle East, American measures to control money.  There have been some negotiations and happily, I think, American investment will continue here.  We have enough on hands to try to minimise the worst aspects of the problems which are attacking us from outside, bearing in mind the fact that we still have to get through most of the winter.  All of us would wish to see a more rational system for the distribution of fuel and power.  Most members of the community would be prepared to put up with inconvenience and hardship provided they could be reasonably assured that we would not have rising unemployment or loss of job opportunities as a result of the worst aspects of the fuel situation.</P>
    <P>It is not merely confined to fuel. We are also attacked by the rapidly rising costs of the raw materials we have to import and convert and turn into the finished product.  It is a strange fact that, while there is fairly high employment in England and here, we still have this biting loss in the value of money.  Whatever we might do to combat this and to minimise its effects, we should be alive to the fact that one of the worst evils which could overtake us would be a loss in the value of our money.  When one saw £30 million being sheared off stocks and shares last week on the floor of the stock exchange as a result of panic one wondered whether if the Minister for Finance knew about it in time he should close the door of the Stock Exchange and leave those panic stricken people standing outside. That had to be done at times in other countries.  I do not know what all the panic was about.</P>
    <P>It may have arisen from the fact that there was an announcement in England that they were increasing interest rates and the Government here quickly followed suit.  I am not blaming the Government more than any other Government because it is always contended here by the banks that, when the rate of interest in England increases, money will flow out of here like whiskey at a wake if steps <Col N="1640" /> are not taken to make it dear.  At the same time, in any given year when this occurs the banks make a higher profit than ever.  Some steps should be taken to look into that aspect of monetary affairs.  I am not saying we can wave a wand any more than any other country, but we are better placed in relation to our size than Britain is to grapple with any problems which may arise for the rest of the winter.</P>
    <P>I read an article in <i>The Sunday Express</i> by Reginald Maudling in which he talked about the things they were beset with: the fuel shortages, the lock-outs, the voltage reduction in power.  He said that every TV news bulletin carried bad news.  He went on to talk about the proposed strike by the miners and he summarised how they stood in respect of energy and the sort of society they had built up in England.  It seemed to me that he was talking in terms of the desire of the labour force there to destroy their own economy by exorbitant demands for wages which could not be met out of production.</P>
    <P>We did not escape that in full but, happily, we escaped some of the worst elements of it.  Some other elements rubbed off on us and those are the elements which are causing the erosion of our £1 note.  Until all the people in the community realise that, our pound note will still continue to be eroded and over the past number of years it has lost at the rate of 10p a year and maybe more, if the rate of interest goes up again.  This is another aspect of the matter which we should query and as a democracy, come to terms with it, try to come to terms with it in a rational way, before irreparable harm is done to those amongst us who have to live on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me to labour that point but I am reminded of the occasion when Mr. Reginald Maudling talked about lemmings and the proclivity of lemmings to destroy themselves at a given time. This would lead me to think that he was charging the people who were making all these exorbitant demands in England with having the same urge, <Col N="1641" /> namely, to break down their own economy.  We would not like to see that happening either because, in simple terms, we looked to the British market for a long time.  We have found fault with it but they always bought our goods and paid for them and we were always able to buy goods and pay for them in return.  That is the way we want to see it and if we are to try to continue selling and buying, we would like to see those to whom we sell our goods and from whom we buy our goods in a position to surmount their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also mentioned that there was to be some reorganisation of Departments and that the trend indicated much earlier is being pursued. We now have a Department of the Public Service and the Minister for Finance has been made Minister responsible for this Department. Strangely enough, a Minister for Finance in any Government is not always the best choice to take charge of a Public Service Department.  I am not casting any reflection on the Minister who now carries this portfolio but I do contend that the aim of a Finance Minister and the aim of the people under a Public Service Department might not be one.  A Minister for Finance here, as indeed in most countries, is nearly always concerned with making ends meet and sometimes pressure is brought to bear on him to stretch the fund to cover projects or propositions with which he might not be in total agreement, but that is by the way.  As I say, a Minister for Finance&mdash;any Minister, and I am not casting any reflection on the present occupant of that Ministry&mdash;might not be the best person to take on a Public Service Department.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also dealt with the possible route of oil supplies and so on, and gave a detailed summary of what was being done in regard to exploration for oil and gas.  We scarcely know enough about this subject to talk very much about it but those of us who have some small idea would wish this exploration success. One never knows what is under the ground and one sometimes spends a <Col N="1642" /> lot of money to discover that there is perhaps nothing under the ground, but we hope, and will continue to hope, that there is oil and gas around our shores because if that should turn out to be the case, it would stand us in good stead in future years.</P>
    <P>He referred very briefly to interest rates in Britain.  I dealt with that and tried in my own way to summarise some of the backwash and the feedback, as it were, that one gets from there and the naked fact that our interest rate climbs with the British rate, whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>He dealt with agriculture and, strictly speaking, although those engaged in agriculture worked hard during the year, I doubt if it will be deemed to be a good farming year because of our weather.  We have had a big disaappointment in fodder and unfortunately now prices of feed compounds are such that it is going to make it very difficult for those engaged in stock raising to make cattle pay.  We hope they will be able to do so.  This is an element which we escaped last year but with which we have to contend this year.  A fact also which is tending to depress the price of cattle&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;is that farmers in England never like to stock up coming near Christmas. They wait until after Christmas or until March when the dry weather sets in because they do not want cattle leeching land and for my own part&mdash;I do not know what the Minister may think&mdash;I would not say to any farmer to throw away his stock because I think the price of stock will harden up again in the early spring.</P>
    <P>There were better crops this year than last year and certainly the potato crop yielded well.  I do not propose to go extensively into this on this debate, but it will relieve the position in this regard, and whether we produce potatoes for human or other needs, we are glad to see that at least we have this attribute this year, that we have had a good potato crop.  We are not so well off as we should be in grain and earlier on when I was saying something on the Estimate for which the Minister is responsible, I regretted the fact that we had not a basic tillage <Col N="1643" /> policy.  Possibly we could only have that through the medium of incentives but it is a pity that we do not have such a policy.  I believe it is essential. The price of imported feeding stuffs has reached such a dimension that it is hard to believe the price will ever fall again.  The elements are abroad which would suggest that there should be a fall in prices, even in the price of houses, but that is not happening.  One cannot see any immediate hope of any fall in the price of animal feeding stuffs. Indeed, exporting countries will have to call on what they normally export to feed their own animal population.</P>
    <P>We have then the social aspect.  We have a good deal of leeway to make up on the social side.  Those of us who are inclined towards such activities find the fight sometimes an uphill one.  I am referring now to co-ordinating social aims and giving some of our own leisure time to helping others less fortunate. There is always a tendency here to look for Government aid.  Government aid has grown over the years but it still remains a relatively small amount when it is distributed.</P>
    <P>There are people who have plenty of leisure.  We have a shorter working week and a free day every Saturday. Politicians do not enjoy this amenity. Most of us are engaged on Saturday and possibly also on Sunday.  There are people who could help to promote the aims of the different voluntary organisations to a much greater extent than any Government aid could possibly achieve.  Indeed, it has been my experience that when the Government enter into the picture the heart seems to go out of the personnel involved and there is not at all the same enthusiasm as there is in the purely voluntary organisation for which the fight is generally an uphill one all the way.  I am thinking in particular now of sporting activities and youth clubs.  I would like to see many more youth clubs.  I would like to see more interest in all branches of sport.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the problem of alcoholism.  How is it to be solved? How are we to stop the brainwashing of the youth growing up today by the vested interests who night after night <Col N="1644" /> on TV go on talking in glowing terms of their wares, urging everybody to visit places in which they will be able to indulge in these wares?  The young are being assaulted and if we do not take steps to put a stop to this assault it will continue with increased momentum. As I said, on another occasion, we blame the youth for a good deal; we can blame ourselves for more than two-thirds of that for which we blame the youth.  Youth today is earning a high monetary return for its labours and there are people waiting around the corner to take that monetary reward from youth the moment they receive it.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education should do everything possible to encourage youth leaders who, in turn, will encourage youth into interests less deleterious. In that way we might circumvent the worst results of an affluent society.</P>
    <P>An undue proportion of the profits of some companies seems to be directed into advertising.  There should be a law compelling people to advertise the harm caused by excessive smoking and excessive drinking.  If that were done we might not have so much advertising. We might take the appeal out of a great deal of advertising.</P>
    <P>We have a Government information service.  It is rather remote from me since I have never had recourse to it. I would advise the service to dwell more on the purely informative aspect of its work rather than on building up certain personalities.  It was founded as an information service and that is the role it should fulfil.  I doubt if it is fulfilling it at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach dealt with the arts.  I do not want to weary the House repeating what I said on this subject on the budget.  Arts naturally conjure up a world of culture.  One is struck by the fact that at the moment there is a disturbance in the school of art.  It is of fairly long duration and it is time someone tried to resolve whatever the difficulty is.  Daily we are confronted with the spectacle of people parading with placards outside the precincts of this House.  I doubt if that would be allowed in front of similar buildings in other countries.  I do not know of any <Col N="1645" /> other Parliament in Europe where this would be allowed.  People are well aware of their grievances and it is possible that some of those are manufactured. It seems that there are people involved there who will not be satisfied by anything.  They wish to parade on every occasion, particularly when this House is meeting.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, on the question of Parliamentary procedures, made reference to the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of this House which dealt with this matter.  I was a member of that committee and we did our best to provide for the better use of time on the floor of this House.  We had many problems to contend with.  We had to keep within the scope of the Standing Orders which was very difficult.  At the same time we endeavoured to redraft the rules to make for better use of the time of this House.</P>
    <P>In my view the report which was issued, a report which I hope will be adopted by all parties, will make for a better use of the time at our disposal. Some members of that committee advocated an extra day's sitting of this House, but the view was expressed that if this suggestion were carried out it would be filled out with talk just as the time we have available at present is filled out.  For that reason we had to cut our cloth according to our measure.  That report, which is not a drastic one, proposes a number of improvements which could lead to a greater volume of work from the House.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that when we talk about the use of time in this House we make a comparison with the House of Commons.  Those of us who have visited the House of Commons are aware of how that Parliament can rely on its committees to do part of its work.  We must also recognise the fact that that Parliament consists of 630 members and that if they all turned up for a sitting they could not be accommodated in the Chamber.  In fact, more than 200 of them would have to be accommodated in the Public Gallery.  The House of Commons can make good use of such committees because they do not take away from the numbers available to participate in a debate on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> When a Bill is sent from this House to any committee we always have to bear in mind that the composition of such a committee will mean a reduction in the number of Members available to take part in a debate on the floor of the House.  We always have to take into consideration the fact that a number of Members could be indisposed and that others could be engaged at county council meetings.</P>
    <P>On this <i>ad hoc</i> committee we had to make sure that if committees were set up to consider various Bills we would not be stripping the floor of the House of a sufficient number of Members. I hope this report finds favour with all parties because, if it is adopted, it will mean the business of the House will be dealt with more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>There is a trend of thought that parliamentarians are not abreast of current affairs.  If we are not ahead or abreast it is our own fault.  However, we all experience great difficulty in sifting through the reams of paper, reports on everything possible, that are placed at our disposal in the Library. For this reason we should have resort, on occasions, to direct briefings.  If we do not take steps to avoid the mountain of paper we will be found buried under it on the floor of this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask myself, in relation to this issue, who will direct when all pretend to know.  We are discussing a situation which will have an effect not alone on the nation of today but on future generations. For that reason we must apply ourselves to it not as public representatives representing any particular team if we want to be successful and honest with the people and with ourselves.  Recrimination and rancour, whether it is personal or political, will have <Col N="1647" /> no other end than to obscure the situation and we will finish up in the position that we will not be able to see the wood for the trees.  We must divorce ourselves completely from all association with our own particular parties in this issue because we have here an opportunity that has not occurred since 1921.  Let us not have a repetition of what happened as a result of the rancour and the personal recrimination that went on at that time and during that debate.  What was said then is there for everybody to read.  We all see and know the results of that unfortunate debate in 1921.  It behoves us all now to unite and to take advantage of the opportunity that is presented.  Not in their wildest dreams could anyone have imagined 12 months or even six months ago the developments that took place in Sunningdale this weekend. Nobody could for one moment have realised that we could have in the six north eastern counties of our land Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter coming together to talk and to unite with us here in the Republic of Ireland in order that we may bring about unity.</P>
    <P>The position as I see it is that up to now the gate was locked and locked firmly.  As a result of what took place over the weekend the gate is now open.  The field inside the gate is there to be ploughed, sown and reaped.  It is the duty and the responsibility of the Assembly when it is formed to cultivate that land and to let the land be cultivated equally. That is the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>I also see that there will be people who will disagree, who will take the nice pieces out, hold on to those, and then row and wrangle because everything in the package does not suit them particularly.  But we must deal with the situation as I see it.  In a triple alliance and talks such as these there were differences, grave differences, differences that appeared to any ordinary person in the street six to 12 months ago insurmountable and we now have reached the stage as a result of the unity, as a result of the approaches that had been made, that there is agreement among these extremely differing bodies connected <Col N="1648" /> with the reunification of this land of ours.</P>
    <P>I know that with one stroke of the pen or one wave of the wand we cannot undo what has been going on for generations.  I am prepared to settle for a good start.  I believe that well begun is half done.  I believe that there is a good beginning here.  I believe that if this situation had been presented 50 years ago Ireland would have been united long ago.  Unfortunately, that was not the way.</P>
    <P>For that reason I want to say that I am not particularly anxious one way or another as to who created this situation.  If it were created by any other party in this House I am sure it would have got the wholehearted support of the remainder.  I am convinced that this agreement will have the wholehearted support of everybody in this House.  There are things in all arrangements, in all agreements. in all deals and transactions that will cause problems, minor or major, but in the overall position this is the situation that must be reckoned with. We have got something that I for one never thought would come about as quickly as it did.  Without being in any way recriminatory, I must say that it has happened in this issue as compared with what happened in the Treaty negotiations, that the leaders and the men of responsibility and the men, I suppose, who had experience now more than they had then, that the captain and the vice captain of the team and those particularly engaged in this exercise went over to discuss with the other men involved directly and they took upon themselves the full responsibility to speak on behalf of the whole nation.  I think they are to be congratulated for it.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to sit on the fence and to criticise the men in the field. It is all very well to have a ring-side seat at a boxing tournament and to shout and roar at the unfortunate lads in the ring who are trying to do their best.  It is all very well for people to sit back and to criticise.  Let them have the courage of their convictions. Let them come out and convince me that they can do better.  Then I will <Col N="1649" /> say, &ldquo;Well and good.  More power to you.  I am with you.&rdquo;  But, let us not get into reverse gear and make it a political issue.  If we want to discuss this matter sensibly, let us think of Irish people, whether they are in Belfast or in Cork, in Galway or in Dublin as Irish people belonging to the one nation.  Let us not, as I have had, have to listen to people from the benches opposite, talking about their opposite numbers in their constituencies.  That is not necessary and that is not the way to solve the problem.  I know that the whole House will be with us when it comes to the crunch, that we in this Republic are prepared to go in that gate and into that field, side by side with all others interested who are prepared to make this a nation and to plough that field and to take whatever we can out of it in order that all can live here together.</P>
    <P>My associations go back much longer that do those of some of the people who come in here talking about republicanism and independence and I say that never in the history of this land have we got the opportunity that we have got now.  Never.</P>
    <P>These discussions that have taken place are only the first step, if they are a step at all, on the road to reconciliation. I hope that we, the Members of this House representing the people who sent us here, will take our courage in our hands, put the people before whatever party we belong to, and think of the generations who will come after us and judge us by what we do here this week.</P>
    <P>There will always be people who will grouse and grumble no matter what they get.  That is human nature, but reasonable people will realise that differences created over hundreds of years cannot be wiped out with the stroke of a pen or the wave of a wand. We must show our willingness to make living possible for everybody no matter what part of the land he comes from. Then we will have unity and not until then.</P>
    <P>My views in many ways are and have been very extreme, but I realise that the Irish people are our first consideration. If we want to divide them <Col N="1650" /> and keep them divided, good enough; let us say that and let us throw out this agreement that has been reached.  Let us not be picking bits and scraps out of it.  Let it be laid on the line: &ldquo;We will split the country again.  We will have civil war.&rdquo;  We all know what the outcome will be if we do not get together.  We all know what the extremists on either side are saying openly, on radio, on television, at public meetings.  However, they are men of dishonest views.  They are thinking of nobody but themselves.  It is our job to bring the people together. The only way that can be done is by sitting down and talking to them and having them talk to us.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into what happened since the days of Clontarf or any other time; we have had enough of that here already tonight.  Let us kneel down and say a prayer for those people who were killed.  Let us not be talking about four brothers carrying coffins and so on.  That kind of talk will not solve our problems.  I hope we will have no more of this acrimony that we have had to listen to tonight. That is all right at election time but not on an issue like this.  Then we can be Labour, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, but during this debate there is only one jersey to wear, and that is, the Irish jersey for a 32-county Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not think the other matters which come within this motion have any great priority at this stage.  There is plenty of time for them.  However, I would say that the nation is in a very healthy position at the moment. Our housing problems have been well and truly tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Limerick, anyway. I know the Deputy is not as closely related to these things as some of us, but we are at a stage in the city of Limerick at which we can now house people with one child.  There may be extreme cases that have come into the city within the last two or three months, people with two or three children, but we are well ahead with our housing programme.  Within the next three or four months we shall be looking for tenants for some of the <Col N="1651" /> houses.  The same thing could apply to any local authority who did their job properly.  The money is there, and we have a Minister who keeps pressing us to send up plans.  We have contented tenants, which we had not for years.  Rent strikes are at an end.  The Minister has met over and over again the people who speak on behalf of the tenants all over the country, which was not the case until he took office.  As a result of the dialogue that took place, house purchase and other developments are going ahead satisfactorily.  If houses are not being built it is not the fault of the Minister; it is the fault of the local authority.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty for which nobody can be blamed, that is, a world shortage of timber and other hardware materials.  However, we cannot solve that.  If the timber and the other housing materials were available we would be well ahead of our programme. This is something over which we have no control.  Yet, with all our troubles and difficulties, we are doing a first-class job and the people of Limerick are glad of it.</P>
      <P>In the field of health and social welfare, since the present Minister took over these Departments, we have people getting benefits they never got before.  And there is more to come; all these will be increased and the services will be increased and they will be far and away better than ever they were.  We have done a tremendous amount of work in a very short time and, given another year or two or three or four&mdash;which we will have&mdash; by that time we should be able to take our place among the nations of the world.  I am glad to say that. We have given priority to the more unfortunate old people.  The pensioners, widows and orphans and the blind and the deaf have all been taken care of.  We shall see that everything is levelled out and that social benefits will be distributed so as to make us comparable with any other nation in Europe.  That is something of which we can all be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must also congratulate the Government on introducing the Department of the Public Service because up to <Col N="1652" /> now, dare any member of the Army or the Garda or the Civil Service or any such people approach a public representative on any matter.  It could not be done&mdash;I do not know why.  If any member of those groups dared to make representations he would be for the &ldquo;high jump.&rdquo;  The result was that you had internal agitation and you had a go-slow without it being mentioned; you had not the full cooperation of the people involved, people who were living in a very unhappy state of uncertainty.  When a group of people are living in that state, not knowing from one day to the next what will happen and, whether it happens or not they are not in a position to come out and say so, or to anticipate events in advance, life can be very worrying. There are enough tensions all around us without putting more in the way. I congratulate the Government for establishing this Department so that anybody with a grievance can come along and make a case.  That is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into many details this afternoon.  I do not want to be like other speakers who have gone through every Department bit by bit; if I did, I would be here until this day twelve months.  I just want to touch broadly on some of these matters.  If there is a challenge, let there be a challenge and let our Ministers and the Opposition compare themselves.  I know what the result will be.  This was clearly shown in the Monaghan by-election.  After our short time in office the people reversed what had happened nine months earlier.  It is all very well to come here and talk&mdash;we have others in the Six Counties saying this, that and the other&mdash;but the ballot box speaks and has spoken like the oracle in Monaghan.  The people know exactly where they stand.  They now know they have a stable Government that there is unity and ability and courage in that Government.  Perhaps they were misled in the past.  Many obstacles and difficulties were put in their way, particularly prior to the general election but now, having had a trial over the course as we have <Col N="1653" /> had in the past eight or nine months, the people are convinced that we have the ability, the courage and, above all, the honesty to do a good job for the nation.  That we shall do and continue to do.</P>
    <P>I came in principally to make my position clear in regard to what happened in Sunningdale but in passing I want to say that we are here for a long time to come and no matter what misrepresentation there is or how matters are distorted the people are not fooled.  That was proved in Monaghan.  Anyway, we shall get on with the job despite any obstacles that may be put in our way.  We shall surmount these obstacles and make this nation as good as ever it was in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk about a number of topics, some of considerable importance and some, perhaps, less pressing.  I shall begin with one of the less pressing matters to which the Taoiseach devoted quite a lot of his opening speech, a matter of some particular interest to me, the question of reform of parliamentary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was chairman of a committee which reported in November, 1972, with suggested recommendations for the reform of the procedures of this House so that business could be expedited and more business completed, and so that discussions in the <Col N="1654" /> House would be more in tune with what was happening outside it and so that discussion of topical matters might be made easier.  The terms of reference of that committee precluded our examining the institutions of Parliament in a broader way which some of our members, and I think many Members of the House thought, perhaps, we should do.  Our terms of reference confined us to changing the details of existing procedures, details of the internal functioning of the House without any major changes in the function of Parliament as an institution or the relationship on a broad scale of Parliament <i>vis-á-vis</i> the country as a whole.  Within the limitations of those terms of reference we brought in a report which contained 35 main recommendations.  I was glad to hear from the Taoiseach in the House a month ago, and again in his speech today, that the Government have no objection to the implementation of all these proposals.  Assuming that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, who are at present examining them in detail, agree to all, or nearly all of them, I shall be in the happy and the almost unique situation of having chaired a committee which brought in a report virtually all of which looks like being implemented.</P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach made certain references in relation to these recommendations with which I am not in entire agreement.  We made a recommendation that the system of special committees should be more widely used in the House than at present. The reason was that frequently the Committee Stage of a Bill will take several days and the discussion tends to go on between the Minister and, perhaps, two or three Deputies, usually not more.  The committee thought that kind of discussion could more usefully be done by a special small committee of, perhaps, nine Deputies in a room in the House, rather than in the Chamber itself. While that was going on it would be open to the House to discuss other matters which at the moment it is precluded from doing.</P>
    <P>We recommended that the use of a special committee&mdash;in each case we <Col N="1655" /> recommended it should be an <i>ad hoc</i> committee&mdash;for a particular Bill should be by agreement between the Whips.  We did that for the good reason that if there was not agreement between the Whips it is possible that the Government of the day&mdash;we were in Government at the time of this report&mdash;might force a very controversial Bill into a special committee where it would be inappropriate and when it should properly be discussed in a committee of the whole House in the Chamber.</P>
    <P>Apparently the suggestion of the Taoiseach now is that all Bills should be sent to the special <i>ad hoc</i> committees we recommended unless there was some very good reason for not sending them there, that there should be a <i>prima facie</i> sending of any Bill to the committee unless it was proved, presumably to the satisfaction either of the Chair or the Whips, that it should not be sent.  I think it should be the other way around.  It should be as we recommended and not as the Taoiseach has suggested.</P>
    <P>I say that for two reasons.  First, the Government of the day might well force a controversial Bill which should be debated here away from the Chamber in order that it would not get much, if any, publicity.  The second reason is that we ran into the difficulty when we were thinking about committees generally that this is a very small House in the sense that there are only 144 Members.  Of those at any one time a large proportion are not available for committee work of any kind.  At any given time there are about 22 Members in Government, there are two in the Chair who are not available and there are 16 Members at any given time in Europe, ten at the European Parliament and six in the Council of Europe.  In addition to that, there are other calls of one kind or another on Deputies.</P>
    <P>The result is that there is a very small pool from which to pick personnel for any committees.  It is so small a pool that I cannot see more than one <i>ad hoc</i> committee existing at any one time.  We were conscious <Col N="1656" /> of that problem when we considered the matter in 1972 but since then there have been two major developments which accentuates the problem even more.  The first was the establishment of another and very important committee&mdash;the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  That committee has to meet regularly.  Of necessity there is a large number of Deputies on it; the European members must be on it as well as a considerable number of other Deputies because it may happen that the European members may be away at any one time.</P>
    <P>There is the further complication &mdash;the matter that has been the principal source of discussion today&mdash; namely, the proposed Council of Ireland.  It is proposed that 30 Deputies from this House should be chosen to sit on the Council of Ireland at consultative level, with 30 Members of the Northern Assembly.  It is obviously envisaged that the 30 Members from this House who go to Armagh, or wherever the council will meet, will have to spend a fair amount of time there.  Much to my surprise, it was announced in the communiqué from Sunningdale that it was proposed to pay allowances to members of the Council of Ireland at consultative level.  Presumably they are not being paid allowances for a nominal job or one that entails infrequent attendance at meetings of the Council of Ireland.  One can assume they will be away from this House and their constituencies for fairly lengthy periods and the strain put on the membership of this House to serve committees of any kind within the House will be increasingly greater between the European calls and the Council of Ireland calls.</P>
    <P>We have tended to think we could run a series of committees and a committee system in this House similar to Westminster but what we overlooked&mdash;and we came on this very forcibly in the course of our deliberations on this committee&mdash;was the fact that there are 630 Members at Westminster, of whom perhaps only 70 or thereabouts are in Government at any level at any one time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" /> There are perhaps 550 Members who are available for service on committees. Therefore, it is not valid to suggest that because this kind of thing can be done elsewhere it can be done here.  It cannot be done here having regard to the small numbers at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the possibility of the establishment of a specialised joint select committee of the Dáil and Seanad in relation to State-sponsored bodies.  This was not covered in our report because it was outside our terms of reference but it is something I would welcome.  It would certainly have to be a joint committee of both Houses because we would not have the personnel here to service it properly.  It is the kind of committee that could make a valuable contribution and it is one in which Senators could make a valuable contribution, having more time, perhaps, than have Members of this House to delve into the intricacies of the activities of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>There are many other reforms which might be desirable so far as the institution of Parliament is concerned.  In particular, I remember members of the Labour Party on this committee making that point and I had to point out to them more than once that our terms of reference precluded our examination of Parliament as an institution in the 1970s.  It was too broad a question and it was one in particular which, if a committee were to look into it, membership most certainly should not consist of Members of this House only. Indeed, the majority of the membership should consist of people who were not Members because all of us here, even those of us here a comparatively short time, tend to take too much for granted the existing procedures and to accept them in our own thinking, when fresher minds would see different but very much better ways, perhaps, of doing many things that we try, not very well to do.  I would say to the Taoiseach and to the Government that we on this side of the House would certainly welcome such a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad so far as State-sponsored bodies are concerned.  I would make the suggestion that the <Col N="1658" /> present Taoiseach should now do what the former Taoiseach did in 1971.  The former Taoiseach set up a body to look at the existing situation inside the House.  The Standing Orders have been thoroughly examined now and modernised and will hopefully be in operation in the very near future.  I would suggest that the present Taoiseach would now set up a different type of committee consisting mainly of persons from outside the House who would look in a much broader way at Parliament as a whole and see how it could be made more useful and how its relevance to life in the country and in the world today could be brought out more clearly and how its usefulness to the people of the nation as a whole could be increased.  I think that would be a fruitful field of work and I would commend to the Government that they would consider the establishment of some suitable committee to consider that whole situation.</P>
    <P>The next thing I want to talk about is the question of the economy and the way it has developed in the past nine months.  One of the figures that struck me most forcibly in the Taoiseach's speech was where he set out once more:</P>
    <P>Estimated current expenditure for 1973-74 stands some £141 million above its level in the last fiscal year and at the same time capital expenditure has been increased by £43 million.  The financing of these large additional expenditures has been so arranged that the net borrowing requirement at £193 million is some £72 million above its 1972-73 level.</P>
    <P>These are spiralling figures.  They are particularly so when one bears in mind that they represent an increase in expenditure of approximately 20 per cent on the expenditure in the fiscal year 1972-73.  The figure in 1972-73 was an increase of 10 per cent in Government spending over 1971-72. That was described at that time by the present Minister for Finance, Deputy R. Ryan, as irresponsible and enormous and likely to run the country into very serious difficulties. He himself has come along the following year and has doubled the rate of increase in spending and very considerably <Col N="1659" /> increased, what is more important, the rate of borrowing.</P>
    <P>The financing of much of this additional expenditure will have to come ultimately from the savings of the people.  The soundest place that the financing of Government expenditure like this can come from is from internal savings here rather than borrowing from abroad or borrowing from banks or other institutions.  For many years past we have had a constantly rising graph of savings by small savers and investors but this year Deputy Colley discovered, with no little difficulty, in the House on Tuesday, 4th December last&mdash;Volume 269, column 855 of the Official Report &mdash;the position with regard to savings and investment from the 1st April to the 23rd November.  The figures are very shattering.  One could, in Opposition, almost express jubilation about them.  That is the last thing I do because they are very serious for the country and they are very serious for those who will have to clear up the sort of situation they now reveal. Those figures got very little publicity because many people misunderstood their significance.  The manner in which they are presented&mdash;the figures are factually correct presumably&mdash;is misleading.  It tends to suggest that certain sums mentioned came in when, in fact, the sums that are mentioned in the reply at column 855 are the net result of what came in and what went out.  It must be many, many years since there was actually a net decrease under a number of headings in savings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Prize bonds were a popular form of saving and I thought remained a popular form of saving.  I would have thought that many millions of pounds go into prize bonds each year.  The position with regard to them this year is that while there was a net increase in the period from 1st April to 24th November, 1972 of £945,000, or almost £1 million, in other words the amount of bonds bought exceeded the amount which were cashed by about £1 million, the <Col N="1660" /> situation in the period from 1st April to 23rd November, 1973 is that there were net withdrawals of £256,000.  In other words the number of bonds bought by savers was less, for the first time ever I understand since the institution of the prize bond scheme in 1957, than the number of bonds cashed by people who wanted to take their money out.  There was a net loss to the prize bond fund of £256,000. When you look at that sort of situation in the context of these huge figures for borrowing and for increased capital and current expenditure in this fiscal year, it discloses a very serious position.  Where is all this borrowing to be financed from?  Very clearly it is not to be financed from the place, above all else, where it should be financed from, the savings of the people.</P>

      <P>Last year there were net receipts during the same period of £1,360,000.  The difference between the two years is not the difference between those two figures but is the sum of those two figures. Many people may not have realised the significance of that.  The net difference in the April to November period as between this year and last year is a figure of £2,500,000 in savings certificates alone.  This year there were net receipts in respect of national instalment savings totalling £958,000 whereas last year the amount was £2,841,000, a difference of almost <Col N="1661" /> £2 million.  Those three items alone, the only three that Deputy Colley asked about in that question, show a decrease in savings in a seven-month period as between last year and this year of almost £5 million.  If we could get the information in relation to other things, goodness knows what would be disclosed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did his best to prevent our getting the information. It was only when the answer had been circulated that we saw the figures.  The Minister got quite a roasting from Deputy Colley and also from Deputy Lynch in relation to these matters at the time; but if the Deputies had known then that the figures were as bad as we found them to be subsequently, I am sure they would have made it even hotter for the Minister.  After Deputy Colley had put down the question there was a fake question put down by the Minister in the name of Deputy P. Belton so that the Minister could give the reply in the form of a tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did this because it suited him much better not to give orally the three figures that Deputy Colley asked him in which case he would have been open to cross-examination by way of supplementaries.  Instead, he put down a question in Deputy Belton's name asking for a lot of other figures.  He included Deputy Colley's with those and took them all together in the form of one of these tabular statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the situation as indicated by the reply to the question concerning the saving schemes I have mentioned was bad, the situation that has been disclosed in relation to the national loan this year is atrocious.  The figures are an indication of the great lack of confidence in this country on the part of investors, but they will create even a greater lack of confidence.  We must ask why there is this lack of <Col N="1662" /> confidence.  By way of interjection the Minister tried to tell us that the reason why prize bonds, savings certificates and the national instalment saving scheme were doing so badly this year is because the interest rates are bad.  Possibly that is a partial explanation but the Minister is caught by his own argument because we might point to the national loan interest rate which was almost overgenerous. But lest it should not have been generous enough the Minister changed the rate three days after the loan going on sale so that it was offered at 12 per cent interest or 11 per cent at £92 which is equivalent to considerably higher than 12 per cent if one holds up to the time of redemption of the security.  Therefore, the Minister had both the fixing and the refixing of his own rate so he cannot now argue that low interest rates were the cause of people not investing in Government securities.</P>
    <P>The true test of the success or otherwise of a national loan is the amount that the ordinary or noninstitutional public subscribe.  This year they subscribed £8.8 million but last year for a loan that was considerably less attractive they subscribed £27.7 million.  This year's figure is approximately 30 per cent of that amount.  The Minister fixed the loan this year at a high rate but when he saw that it would be a flop he refixed it at a higher rate.  Despite that he succeeded in getting only £8.8 million from the public and this happened at a time when the value of money is depreciating from year to year.  Perhaps the £8.8 million this year is equivalent to 10 per cent less on last year's values.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting for Deputy O'Malley to point out that the British Exchequer increased the bank rate by 1.75 within 24 hours of the issuing of our national loan and that we increased ours by 0.3 but that nonetheless we got a national loan of a very substantial dimension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the figures here for all national loans so we will have no bother with that.  When one takes into account the 10 per cent <Col N="1663" /> depreciation that has occurred since last year it will be realised that the investment by the public is about 25 per cent of what was subscribed last year.</P>
      <P>The stark fact is that the small investors of this country, like many other people, have no confidence in a coalition.  That is why we get from them less than 30 per cent of what we got last year.  There is no other explanation for this situation.  The tragedy is that this is the first concrete evidence we have had of this state of affairs.  The situation has not been brought about by the oil crisis or by any of the other external factors of which we have heard so much from the Government in the last few days.  Because of inflation and increased production there is more money circulating now in this country than ever before in the history of the state.  Therefore, there is a greater pool of money from which the Minister can draw in issuing a national loan.  Yet he succeeds in getting only £8.8 million for a loan issued on terms that are almost criminally generous from the point of view of the taxpayers, who ultimately will have to service these loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That £8.8 million was supplemented by £7.5 million from insurance companies but that amount from the insurance companies should have been considerably more.  It is something in the form of a levy on insurance companies, particularly some of those abroad who are told quietly that it would be very good if they invested some of their assets in Government loans in this country so that they would be in a position to renew their licences. There are many people who think and, perhaps, think rightly, that this sort of money which is given very grudgingly by insurance companies to the Exchequer in a national loan should be invested by those companies in housing in this country.  The proportion of housing which is financed by insurance companies here has fallen drastically in the last few years.  The building societies have been carrying the brunt of the increased spending on housing over the past five or six years.  Insurance <Col N="1664" /> companies, many people feel, are not pulling their full weight. I am glad to see the Minister for Finance making certain suggestions to them.  I note that their £7.5 million is obviously a very grudging figure.  It is the same figure as was given last year and less than the figure given in 1971.  The figure then was £7.6 million.  There is another item which is called &ldquo;departmental funds&rdquo; which has gone up from last year.  This item &ldquo;departmental funds&rdquo; is not composed of public subscriptions. They are paper balances in Departments.  While I never professed in my days in Government to be a financial expert or to understand precisely what these were, I know at any rate that they are not really cash. They are no indication of the success or otherwise of a loan.  This is the Minister's own money.</P>

He would then realise the situation that this country is now facing.  He would realise the situation where he and the Taoiseach have boasted that they have produced £72 million more than last year.  Net borrowings have been raised to £193 million. That is £72 million above the level of 1972-73.  God help those who are going to pay for that borrowing. The principal and best source of capital development in this country is the savings and investments of the people. When they have dried up, as assuredly they have done now, it makes the expenses of all this extravagance all the more serious for the taxpayer and for those who will come afterwards to clear up this mess.</P>

      <P>If you regard that vote as a vote of confidence, it was <Col N="1666" /> rather close in the circumstances in which it was got.</P>
      <P>If there was one single factor which got this Government into office on the 28th February last it was the hoo-ha they created about prices.  In canvassing in my own constituency I met a number of people who told me they voted for me or my party before, but that prices had got out of hand and they thought the other politicians had a panacea for everything.  The people were told that there would be no price increases.  One tried to reason with these people and succeeded sometimes. With some of the people we did not succeed, but there would be no difficulty in reasoning with these people today.</P>
      <P>The celebrated unfulfilled 14 points were talked about.  The one above all others which was stressed and which apparently had some effect was the question of strict price control being introduced.  The people were told that there would be no further increase in prices.</P>
      <P>Three weeks ago Deputy Dowling asked originally the Minister for Industry and Commerce, although I understand the question was ruled out of order and was subsequently taken by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, the number of items that were on sale in this country which had not increased in price between March and November.  Deputy Dowling was told that it was not possible to give that information, that the information in the index covered only mid-August, that this index was worked out every three months and that the mid-November one was not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asked for the figures up to mid-August and in answer he was told that there were 11 items.  Of every conceivable commodity which one can buy there were only 11 items which have not increased in price between March and mid-August.  I asked the rather obvious supplementary question that, if there were 11 items that did not go up in price, how many thousand items did, and I was told that I was out of order or something of that nature. <Col N="1667" /> Afterwards we got a list of the 11 items, which were given in a written, circulated reply.  We examined the list and found that eight of the 11 items had increased in price since mid-August. Some of them were very obvious things like telephones and postage which we all know have increased drastically.  Postage has increased by 20 per cent and telephone costs by 10 per cent or more.  Some of the other items were ordinary household commodities which everyone knows have increased in price. There were three items about which we were not sure.  The three of them may have gone up in price but at least we were giving the Government the benefit of the doubt in that respect.  One of the items was neck mutton.  I can remember that one. Neck mutton presumably is the neck of a sheep which, I would say, is not widely eaten in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  The Taoiseach spoke at length today about a lot of things that were not all that important.  He spoke very briefly about something that is extremely important, the Council of Ireland, the Sunningdale communiqué and so on &mdash;extraordinarily briefly.  Four pages of his speech were devoted to it.  It seems incredible that the culmination of the most significant happening with regard to the constitutional future of Ireland should be dismissed in a major debate like this by the Leader of the Government only a few days after he had returned from the actual discussions or negotiations. That is bad enough, but going through his speech I find another matter which to my mind is exceptionally important.  I suppose at appropriate times it is exceptionally important to the Taoiseach's mind also.  He never mentioned one word about it.  It is the question of security in this country.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that at a time when there were so many problems of this kind, when there is constant bloodshed in the other part of our country and, unfortunately, occasional bloodshed in this part, that the Leader of the Government in reviewing the past nine months, as he was doing today, saw fit not even to mention in passing this whole question of the security problem facing our nation north and south at the moment.  There are many things one does not discuss with regard to security, particularly in my position because I was very intimately involved with it for three years.  There are many things I should like to talk about, that I might, indeed, be able to talk about but which I do not propose to talk about.  However, there are some things that one can talk about at a political level in relation to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now had nine months of this Government.  When they were in Opposition in the three years before they formed a Government in March of this year, the single factor, perhaps, about which they kicked up the greatest fuss and about which they made the most strenuous and vehement <Col N="1669" /> opposition in this House and outside it was security and matters relating to it.  I had responsibility in the last Government for the whole matter.  I had a difficult job.  I went through a period in those years I should not like to go through again and that I would hope none of my successors will ever have to go through.  I had to do many things that were very difficult. it was very difficult to decide to do many of them.  It was even more difficult actually to implement them.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem, possibly, in relation to them was in this House. There were evils in this country that the law of this country was unable to cope with because the law of this country was not adequate.  Because it was not adequate there was frustration on the part of those whose responsibility it is to enforce the law. That frustration and that inability, which were fully shared by me, made me resolve that I had to do what was necessary in this regard but that I would not do any more than was strictly necessary.</P>
    <P>I introduced many Bills in this House in the three years I was in office, but there were three Bills in particular that related to security and allied matters in which difficulty was encountered in this House&mdash;difficulty is, indeed, an understatement because the most vehement and vigorous opposition was forthcoming.  In point of time, the first of those three Bills was one which I was satisfied, after thinking about the problem for many months, was vital to stop a practice which had grown up in this country and particularly in this city, of squatting. It was not a question of homeless people going into a house or a flat because they had nowhere else to go, but squatting organised by the political fronts of illegal organisations here in Dublin and to a lesser extent elsewhere.  People were put into property for the purpose of causing serious disruption and hardship to those who were entitled to be on that property.</P>
    <P>This went on for a long period. The time came when I felt it could go on no longer.  A most vehement and <Col N="1670" /> eloquent denunciation of the situation in regard to squatting, organised squatting, by the fronts of illegal organisations was made in this House by Deputy Fitzpatrick when he was Opposition spokesman for Justice in 1970.  A very vigorous attack was made on my predecessor in office and on the Government of which I was then a member for our ineffectiveness in dealing with squatting and the fact that we did not bring in sufficient or adequate legislation.</P>
    <P>After much thought I brought in a Bill to deal with the problem.  Because the problem was serious&mdash;there were many complaints from all sides of the House and all sections of the public about it&mdash;I did not anticipate any great problem in relation to it. Little did I know.  That Bill was passed after four months of the most intense parliamentary debate, the highlight of which was the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, speaking for six hours on Committee Stage on one word, with dictionaries that went back to the 14th or some other century. His justification for this conduct, in which he got every encouragement from Fine Gael and his colleagues in Labour, was that that Bill was outrageous, scandalous&mdash;I think one of his favourite phrases related to South Africa, not Ghana.  He said it was the sort of Bill one would get in South Africa or in some other fascist or allegedly fascist country.</P>
    <P>The Bill was passed at the end of August, 1971, after three weeks in the Seanad.  The Seanad was comparatively civilised about it all and the weather was hot, which was a help.  That Bill was obviously a necessary Bill and it worked.  Within a couple of months the problem had disappeared because the Bill gave adequate powers to the Garda to deal with it.  Once the front men who were organising this on behalf of illegal organisations had been shown up, as they could be under the Act, that was more or less the end of the problem.  Now I believe there is occasional squatting but it is by unorganised individuals who are in need and about whom one should not <Col N="1671" /> in my opinion do very much, under the criminal law at any rate.</P>
    <P>The next Bill was the Prisons Bill, 1972, which resulted from a riot in Mountjoy.  This was very strongly opposed by the Labour Party who voted against it and who apparently by default at any rate, suggested that I should let a number of very dangerous people who were in Mountjoy free to roam the streets, rather than transfer them to somewhere else where they could be kept in custody. Statements were made at that time by the then Opposition, now in Government, highly critical of that Bill and of me, how unnecessary the Bill was, and so on.</P>
    <P>Then we came to the most famous instance of all, the Offences against the State Bill, 1972.  That is recent enough not to make it necessary for me to go into any great history in relation to it. I was satisfied after more than two and a half years in office at that time of the vital necessity for everything that was in that Bill and of the certainty that the provisions of that Bill were the minimum which were necessary to enable certain very serious problems which faced the Garda and the administration of law generally to be overcome. Phrases used relating to the Bill by the present Ministers for Justice, Lands and Foreign Affairs, are sufficiently well known not to need repeating.  Perhaps repeating them <i>ad nauseum</i> would only cause personal embarrassment.</P>
    <P>It was my good luck inasmuch as an unfortunate happening in this city on a night during the Second Stage debate which caused the Fine Gael Party to change their minds within a matter of minutes and allow that Bill to be enacted within a day or two later. Otherwise, I could have spent considerably more than the week I did in trying to get it through.  The strength of the Opposition and the vehemence of the arguments used against the Bill and against me, and the motives which were attributed to me at that time by many people who are now in Government, made it a very difficult time for me.  Only that I was totally resolved and satisfied in my own mind that that <Col N="1672" /> Bill was necessary, I might, perhaps, have wilted under the pressure and not ensured that I would see it through to enactment.  The significant thing about this is that there was this vehemence of opposition to all those measures.</P>
    <P>This Government have been in power for nine months.  They have not repealed one comma of that or any other legislation I introduced.  Not alone have they not repealed one comma of what they found so reprehensible and fit only for South Africa, Spain and Greece, and not for a civilised democratic country, but they have continued precisely the policies which I initiated and carried through during my term in office.  They have not introduced any new approach to security.  They have not done a single thing, which was not done, after all that legislation had been got through when the last Government were in power.  That, of course, is the total vindication of what I did and of what I said.  The silence from one Deputy in particular, Deputy L'Estrange, for the past nine months is, indeed, deafening. I would like to have heard him if we had been in office and I had been Minister for Justice on the 31st October, 1973.  That would have been worth listening to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is at all appropriate that a Minister should ask to be congratulated on the prosecution of someone whom he alleges was involved in helping people to escape from custody.  It is most improper that a member of the Government should make references like this in the House.  When I was on that side of the House I took very good care not to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent, as do a number of people, the blatant suggestion by the Minister for Finance that the Government should be congratulated on the capture of the gentleman in question.  One would think that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, had swooped down on a motel in Portlaoise in his helicopter and had single-handed picked up this gentleman in the same way as the public were led to believe that he had swooped on the famous, or infamous, <i>Claudia</i> and that he subsequently threw out of the country without charging them the captain and the crew.  It seems incredible that the Minister for Finance should ask that he and his colleagues in the Government should be praised or congratulated for the vigilance of an individual garda or prison officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was resentment in the Garda Síochána, in the Army and in the Naval Service at the time of the <i>Claudia</i> because of the attitude adopted by members of the Government. I would have thought that the <Col N="1674" /> Government would have learned their lesson with regard to that type of thing.  I am flabbergasted to find that the arrogance is such that at this hour of the night in a debate such as this, the Minister for Finance should intervene and interject when I am speaking to ask me to congratulate him and his colleagues in the Government on the fact that an individual garda at Portlaoise was vigilant enough to spot this man.  I do not offer any congratulations whatever to the Government.  I congratulate the gardaí who were involved and nobody else.  It was no thanks to the Government that this man was recaptured.  It was no thanks to the Government that the three men in question were allowed to escape.  If the Government, on the insistence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan had not been trying to save money on the Garda Síochána as they were doing in the two months up to the 31st October, 1973&mdash;&mdash;</P>
