      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>)<b>:</b> Before reporting progress on Thursday last I had dealt with a number of matters raised in the debate.  I had dealt with points raised about speculators, the control of land sales, the delay in the allotment of lands in the possession of the Land Commission, the problem of paying for lands in cash rather than in land bonds and the order I had made to include Cavan and Monaghan in the congested districts, thereby giving them the benefit of half annuities.  I was in the course of dealing with the problem of commonage, a problem which arises in many parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the increase in land values and increased profitability from agricultural activities commonage has become a very important matter.  We have two kinds of commonage, lowland commonage and mountain commonage. There is a request for the division of commonages and their allocation to those entitled to graze them.  When there is agreement between the commoners there is no problem and the Land Commission will carry out the wishes of those involved, arrange for fencing and generally implement a scheme acceptable to the owners.  It will be the continuing policy of my Department to pursue as energetically <Col N="615" /> as possible the division of commonages. Now, when there is a commonage some of the owners of which want divided and others want things to go on as they are, the problem is a very different one because it then becomes a human problem and, unless there is agreement, it is very difficult to do a job that will not result in bad feeling and possibly litigation as soon as the Land Commission have pulled out.</P>
    <P>Where it is in the interest of better agricultural productivity to divide a commonage everything should be done by my Department and by those concerned to have it divided.  I should like to appeal to the owners of commonages to be reasonable with each other, to listen to the advice given by the advisory services and to come forward with an agreed scheme to the Land Commission.  If that is asking too much, they should at least come to the Land Commission in a frame of mind in which they are prepared to fall in with advice and suggestions and accept the arbitration of the Land Commission. If they do that, I can assure them they will get every assistance and co-operation from my Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to voluntary organisations, to the farming organisations, the county committees of agriculture and the advisory services in general to try to create an atmosphere among the owners of commonages that will lead to a reasonable approach to this matter which is a problem at the moment.  Candidly, I do not believe it is possible for the Land Commission through the compulsory powers which they have to go in and divide a commonage against the will of some of the owners and hope that things will go smoothly afterwards.  I regret to say this is not possible and I think this view is shared by all reasonable Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I would make a further appeal to the owners of grazing on commonage and to the voluntary organisations, to the county committees of agriculture and the advisory services in general, and would direct their attention towards this problem with a view to solving it.  On the last occasion I visited Erris, County Mayo, I had an opportunity <Col N="616" /> of seeing some of the representatives of the advisory services there.  I am satisfied they are doing all they can to bring about the climate I hope for and I am glad that this is happening throughout the country.  It will take time but, with the goodwill of all concerned and with a response to the appeal I am making now, I hope we will be able to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Finn, Calleary and Gallagher, raised the matter of vacant houses on lands taken over by the Land Commission. I know this is a problem but generally I do not think there is unreasonable delay.  We are conscious of the necessity for disposing of houses as quickly as possible, of getting people who want them into occupation.  In some cases the disposal of the house is necessarily tied up with the division of land.  The house might be included in an allotment by way of enlargement or re-arrangement.  In such cases the disposal of the house must await the preparation and approval of the scheme for the division of the land and that may not be possible for two or three years.  However, when there is a very needy applicant in the locality, it is Land Commission policy to try to allow him into occupation of the house even in advance of the final scheme being drawn up.  If there is no such smallholder in the locality, the policy of the Land Commission is to sell the house by public auction.</P>
    <P>There is a problem when the question of migration arises because a house must be found for the migrant when he takes up his new residence and the Land Commission cannot sell the other house, if it is to be sold by public auction, until the title has been perfected.  Sometimes that takes a considerable time.  I understand that in County Mayo the practice has been to offer the county council in the first instance the houses which are to be sold.  That may have led to some delays in that county because I am advised that in many cases the county council eventually decided not to buy the houses.  It appears reasonable to offer these houses to the housing authority so that they might be able to give them to people in need but I have noted the <Col N="617" /> points made in regard to the delays in allocating the houses or putting them to use.  I accept that houses deteriorate if they are left uninhabited for a considerable time and officers of my Department and I will do all we can to expedite allocation of the houses.</P>
    <P>It would not be a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Lands if the matter of the one-mile limit was not raised.  As Deputies know, for many years it has been Land Commission policy in the first instance to consider applicants for land who are resident within approximately one mile of the holding being divided.  This matter was debated on a few occasions in the House in the not-too-distant past on a Private Member's motion and in reply to questions.  As a general principle, everyone will agree that a farm can be more conveniently and effectively managed if it is together.  If a farmer can walk from one field to another without going out on the public road, if he can drive his stock from one field to another without having to use the roadway, that is accepted as the ideal situation. It follows from that, that when this ideal situation cannot be attained the next best thing is to try to get land which is being allotted as near as possible to the parent holding.  The distance of one mile has been taken as being reasonable.  It is not a statutory condition; it is simply policy laid down by the Land Commission as being reasonable and practical.  I suppose applicants who live within a mile of a holding approve of it, while those outside the limit think the distance should be extended.  Generally it works well enough and is the best way of selecting allottees.  Where the Land Commission acquire a large holding and there are no suitable allottees within the policy mile, the practice is to migrate some suitable applicants either from a distance or from the same locality.  I shall be dealing with that later on.  The long term migrants are getting fewer and fewer over the past five years.  They are not too keen on moving, and, indeed, it is considered that it is probably better policy to migrate people from the same general locality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> As I say, I have yet to be convinced that it would be a good thing to select candidates from two or three miles, or five miles, as has been suggested.  The argument has been made that farmers are more mobile now that they have tractors and motor cars.  That is an argument in favour of extending the mile; it could also be an argument against it, because, with heavier traffic on the roads, it is not desirable that the roads should be cluttered up with farm machinery or stock moving from one part of a farm to another.  I think experience not alone in this country but throughout the world shows that it is undesirable to create fragmented holdings, that it is desirable to have as closely knit a unit as possible. While it does not seem to be wise to depart from that policy, it is not a statutory condition and in exceptional cases it can be breached.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made, too, in favour of landless men, and this is an argument with which I have considerable sympathy and can understand. At the same time, the general business of the Land Commission is to create economic holdings, to bring the small farmer who is working on an uneconomic holding up to a viable standard.  In the years immediately ahead the definition of a viable farm may change and change drastically. In years gone by, with the traditional type of farming, cropping, milk or beef, a sizeable farm was necessary. If we were to continue in that type of farming a sizeable farm would still be necessary.  However, with modern techniques and modern approaches to farming, you have intensive farming here and there, intensive pig rearing, intensive poultry rearing, and even intensive cattle rearing. That means another look may have to be taken at what is a viable farm and the acreage acquired.  We all know that it is not so much how many acres a man farms that counts as the amount of money that his activities bring him in.  The test should be that a man is given a sufficient amount of land to enable him to make a decent living when compared with other sections of the community. The statistics show that there are between <Col N="619" /> 60,000 and 80,000 farmers on sub-standard holdings which require restructuring and enlargement under the land settlement programme.  These uneconomic holders have a fundamental priority in regard to allotment of land.</P>
    <P>That is just the problem, that there is not enough land at the present time to cater for the needs of the uneconomic farmer without bringing thousands of other applicants into the group.  The question is whether the scheme we have prepared under EEC Directive 160 will improve that; whether in the years ahead there will be leasing of land which may make land available for people who have served their time to agriculture and who are skilled and qualified to use it, is something that will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>As things stand at the moment and under conditions which have prevailed for many years and, indeed, which prevail at the present time, it would be bad policy to introduce thousands and thousands of new applicants into an already overcrowded pool of applicants.  That is as clear as I can put it.  I do not mean to say that, due to conditions which may arise as a result of our going into Europe, as a result of people leaving farming, there may not be land for well-qualified and well-trained applicants, However, anyone who is prepared to anticipate what is going to happen as a result of our entry into Europe, what is going to happen as a result of the schemes under Directives 159, 160 and 161, is indulging purely in guesswork.  We shall have to see to it that the three schemes are as effective and as generous as possible and hope they will bring about the desired result, at the same time as we hope the industrial arm of the economy will develop hand in hand a more viable and profitable agricultural programme.</P>
    <P>The question of letting land acquired by the Land Commission pending its distribution has been raised, and complaints have been made, not alone during this debate but frequently in this House over the <Col N="620" /> last couple of years, that outsiders are grabbing up land that is offered for letting to the exclusion of small men in the locality who might eventutlly hope to be allotted land.  I concede that should be avoided if at all possible.  Smallholders in the locality within a reasonable distance, or even within a few miles, should have first claim on the land which is being let.  This is not an easy problem to solve.  As I said previously, the ideal way of selling anything if one wants to be fair to everybody is to sell it by public auction.  I agree in regard to what we are talking about now that that might lead to the survival of the wealthiest.  On the other hand, the weak must be protected and we may have to look around for the best way of letting land to the needy.  Were we to leave the letting of land to the local Land Commission inspector and authorise him to let it by private treaty I would not like to be in his position.  He would be open to pressures of one sort or another and to allegations that he discriminated against certain people.  There would be allegations of the abuse of political power as there have been in connection with these matters in the past.</P>
    <P>A third way suggests itself to me.  It is that the land might be let by sealed tender of those within a specified distance of the holding and who could be regarded as smallholders.  The difficulties which this seemingly simple matter presents are huge.  Let us consider public auction.  A condition could be written into the conditions of sale that farmers from outside a three-mile limit would not be considered.  There is nothing to prevent somebody getting an agent to bid for him.  The auctioneer could knock down the land and let it to the agent.  It is very difficult to prove whether the local man is really the tenant or whether he is a caretaker for a wealthy man living a considerable distance away.  That can happen in any case of letting whether by public auction, private treaty, or sealed tender.  This matter has been raised here on a number of occasions by way of Parliamentary Question.  It has been discussed in the course of debate also. <Col N="621" /> There has been a Parliamentary Question on this matter since the Dáil reassembled. The matter has been seriously considered in the Land Commission with a view to seeing if the problem can be solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider an alternative?  These lands which are usually taken over by the Land Commission may have been let for a number of years and the problems which the Minister envisages would not arise.  Local men have been taking land on conacre.  Why not let the land to them at the prevailing market price of the previous year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>)<b>:</b> I speak from considerable experience. Nobody in the House would suggest that a local man should get a letting for next to nothing.  I assume that Deputy Cunningham is not suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned prevailing market prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>)<b>:</b> There used be a man known as a &ldquo;vested tenant&rdquo;.  I am not using a legal term but I mean a tenant who has taken a field or a number of fields over the years, perhaps from the owner, even before the Land Commission took over.  Such a man comes to regard the land as his own.  He expects to get it and if anyone bids against him he is annoyed and offended.</P>
      <P>We must devise a scheme whereby land would be offered to needy local applicants at a fair market value.  I will work towards that aim.  I will urge the Land Commission to devise a scheme on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy S. Flanagan dealt with the need to get more powers to deal with speculators.  I have dealt with that <Col N="622" /> point before.  The Deputy also suggested that the Examiner's Branch should be abolished and that we should pay for small properties in cash.  He also suggested that the title to land should be cleared in a simple way.  I accept the principle that we should pay for land in cash to the greatest extent possible.  That is our aim.  It was the aim of Deputy S. Flanagan when he was Minister for Lands.  I hope that policy will continue and the fact that we are introducing a scheme under Directive 160 will help us in that regard.  We are obliged by statute to pay with land bonds for lands acquired in a compulsory manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Flanagan also stated that he hoped I would not fall for a proposal that the Land Commission should no longer purchase or acquire small holdings.  These areas could be vital in local rearrangements.  That proposition put forward by the Deputy is neither all black nor all white. Every case must stand on its merits. I hope that it will not be necessary for the Land Commission to acquire small holdings of ten or 15 acres if there is some suitable applicant in the vicinity who is a congest and who is a qualified applicant in every other way&mdash;a married man with a few children and a small farm of land which is overstocked.  If such a man wants to buy a farm in his immediate vicinity, whether a section 40 notice has been fixed or not, he should be let buy it.  He is solving his own congestion problem, he is relieving the Land Commission of doing the job for him, he is doing work which will enable the Land Commission officials to get after bigger fish.  That does not mean that there would never be a case or that there would not be plenty of cases where the Land Commission should in the interest of rearrangement acquire a small holding.  The point I am trying to drive home is that if one small farmer is prepared to solve his own congestion problem, with the assistance, perhaps, of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, who in my opinion have been doing a good job in recent years, he should be allowed to solve it.  That is my idea <Col N="623" /> of policy in regard to that suggestion by Deputy S. Flanagan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also asked me to see to it that duplication of effort between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Land Commission officials operating the farm modernisation scheme should be eliminated.  I hope, and I am convinced, that there will be no duplication of effort between the two Departments. There should not be.  If there were, it would be a waste of time and a waste of public money.  I concede that it is the duty of myself, as Minister for Lands, and of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, to see to it that there will be no duplication, that the two Departments will work in close co-operation to see that the schemes under Directives 159 and 160 bring the best possible results.</P>
    <P>These are new schemes.  They will have teething troubles.  When the free school transport scheme was introduced a few years ago it had teething troubles; it had to have.  It could not go into gear at a very smooth level all at once.  I accept that there should be no waste of official time or public money resulting from a duplication of effort between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in regard to Directive 160 and that is really the only directive under which there could be duplication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am afraid, judging by Deputy Cunningham's other remarks, that he does not appreciate who is responsible for the various directives.  As I see it, I am responsible, as Minister for Lands, for the scheme to be drawn up, which has been drawn up, under Directive 160 and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is responsible for the schemes under Directives 159 and 161.  As I see it at this stage the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will say that farmer A is a development farmer and that they believe it will be necessary to get for him 20 acres of land.  It will be the duty of the Department of Lands to provide that land for him and it will not be the duty of the Department of Lands, as I see it, to question the decision of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries as to whether he wants 20 acres of land or whether he does not <Col N="625" /> because they are the experts in that field, they are the people who are drawing up the modernisation scheme, who are advising on it.  They are the people who will be checking to see whether the targets are being raised or not.  A mystery and a myth are being made out of this just for the sake of making it.  Maybe I am over-simplifying the position but that is as I see it.</P>
      <P>The duty of the Minister for Lands as the Minister responsible to the Government for the scheme under Directive 160 is to introduce and put through the Government and put through Brussels a scheme that will be attractive enough to encourage sufficient land to come into the pool to meet the requirements of the scheme under Directive 159.  Having drawn up such a scheme, it will be the duty of the Minister for Lands and the Land Commission to organise land offered direct to it under the scheme into the proper channels.  It may well be that the Land Commission will have to continue to rely on its compulsory powers if sufficient land does not come into the pool but I believe it will.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde raised a point that some people take a letting of lands at excessive prices in order to qualify themselves for an allotment of the land.  I explained in reply to a question that if a man is not otherwise qualified the fact that he takes a letting of land on a Land Commission farm will not qualify him for it in the slightest.  I would hate to think that anybody would pay too much for land in the hope that by doing so he would qualify for an allotment.  If he is not otherwise qualified that will not qualify him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy raised the question of migration and migrants.  I dealt with that very briefly.  Over the past number of years since 1965 migration from Connacht and Munster to Leinster has dropped considerably.  In 1964-65, 42 people migrated from Munster and Connacht to Leinster.  In 1965-66, the number of migrants increased to 56. It decreased steadily in each of the succeeding years until in 1972-73 the number was only eight.  Other migrations have dropped but not to the same extent.  The number of migrants from one part of a Leinster county to <Col N="626" /> another dropped from 72 in 1964-65 to 42 in 1972-73.  The overall figure for migration dropped from 114 in 1964-65 to 50 in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The trend is away from migration. I am told that people in the west and in Munster are not as keen on leaving their native surroundings for land in Leinster as they were.  I am also told that a better job is probably being done by short distance migration.  I have dealt with commonages, the one-mile limit and landless applicants.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, and Deputy McLaughlin in particular, dealt with the staffing of the Land Commission inspectorate.  At the moment the authorised staff of the inspectorate is 174, and 150 are serving.  The staffing of the inspectorate is being reviewed at present and, of course, the matter will have to be examined in detail when there is a clearer picture as to the full effect of land settlement activities on our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>Leases were mentioned and the desirability of leasing land rather than vesting it in applicants as full owners. The whole question of leasing has come to life again in the context of our entry into Europe.  It has been high-lighted by Macra na Feirme in their report on farm inheritance.  I want again to compliment Macra on producing the report and to congratulate them on the vast amount of work and thought which must have gone into it.</P>
    <P>They advocate leases from father to son in an effort to get younger men into control of the management of land at an early date.  As Deputies know leasing of farm land is common and has been common in Europe, while in Ireland it is virtually unheard of.  It has not been part of our land structure at all and I suppose our history is responsible for that.  I suppose that when we had not got fixity of tenure in years gone by people were dispossessed and, with the coming into operation of the Land Acts, everybody who possibly could wanted to become the owner of his own land and disliked very much any sort of temporary letting, or even a lease that might look to be long-term.</P>
    <P>Macra na Feirme, leading young <Col N="627" /> agricultural thought in the country, and the EEC directive which provides for leases, may change our approach to this whole problem.  This will take time.  I believe that organisations like the IFA and Macra na Feirme have a big part to play in formulating a modern approach to agriculture, to land structure, land resettlement and land ownership.  It is only by co-operation between voluntary organisations like that, who are seen not to have any axe to grind except the axe in favour of improvements for the people they represent, and the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, with a friendly but a free and frank exchange of views, that we can bring about the change in the agricultural industry which will improve the lot of the farming community.  We are moving faster than we think towards that sort of co-operation and that sort of new thinking. The people will have to be educated towards leasing, if leasing is desirable, as I believe it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright raised a point in regard to what constitutes a viable or economic holding.  He wanted to know what is the size of a viable farm.  I dealt with that in my earlier remarks.  In a nutshell, the test should be how much land does it take to give a farmer and his family a decent living.  That should be the test and I think that will be the test.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies raised the EEC retirement scheme which is being formulated under Directive 160.  Deputy Cunningham complained that I am not being frank about this.  The scheme was drawn up but has not yet been cleared by the Government because it was only presented to them today.</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows what the directive contains.  It encourages elderly and other farmers to leave farming if they are not happy in that occupation.  The incentive is, of course, monetary.  The directive lays down that a premium can be paid to any farmer who leaves farming.  They will not subvent the premium or bonus.  The directive also lays down that the scheme may provide a premium and a pension in the <Col N="628" /> case of farmers over 55 years of age. There is no guideline for the premium or bonus because it will not be subvented or contributed to by EEC funds.  If a farmer is over 55 years the scheme may provide a pension or annuity.  The amount of the annuity, in terms of our currency, is £420 for a married man and £280 for a single man.  The EEC directive sees those annuities or pensions terminating at the age of 65 years, which is the accepted age for the coming into operation of the old age pension in EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The scheme which I have drawn up, and which I am satisfied the Government will accept, is much more generous than the minimum terms laid down by the EEC directive, both in regard to the amount of the pension and, more important, in regard to the duration of the pension.  I have heard the views of the IFA and Macra na Feirme.  When the scheme is cleared and I am at liberty to spell it out in terms of pounds and pence and the dates of commencement and termination of the pension, I hope it will be acceptable to farmers and the farming organisations.  Like the modernisation scheme, this scheme will need to be sold.  I rely on the assistance of the farming organisations, the Deputies and the mass media to sell the scheme. Unfortunately, the scheme under the 1965 Act&mdash;I do not want to get controversial&mdash;was not a success because it was not attractive to the people leaving farming.  It simply offered to pay a pension based on the value of the farm being sold and the pension was so small that only 38 applicants availed of it.</P>
    <P>As I said, this new scheme will need to be sold.  The pension, I hope, will not be a static but an adjustable one and will bear some relation to the value of the purchasing power of money from year to year.  Much as I would like to spell it out in black and white to Deputy Cunningham and other Members of the House, I simply cannot do it now for the reasons stated.</P>
    <P>This scheme was to be introduced by the EEC Commission in April of last year.  It turned out that practically <Col N="629" /> none of the countries, even the original Six, were in a position to produce a scheme at that date.  The time was then extended to 1st January next.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that we are ready with the scheme and as far as we are concerned it will be in operation on the date specified by the Commission.  I hope it will be considered attractive and that I will have the co-operation of the House and the other people I spoke of in selling it to the people it is beamed at and in convincing them that under this scheme they can retire from farming activities, if they want to do so, in security. &ldquo;Security&rdquo; is the operative word.  One thing an Irishman fears is financial insecurity.  If we can convince the farmer that under the scheme he has financial security I believe it will be availed of to the advantage of people who are not now getting a decent living from agriculture.  It will also be to the advantage of those who wish to remain in agriculture, to modernise their farms and secure for themselves a better standard of living in what is the most pleasant and peaceful way of living in the world, working in agriculture and being assured of a decent living.</P>
    <P>A Deputy raised the allotment plan for County Mayo for 1973-74.  It would be impossible to give accurate figures for the final allotments for the year ending 31st March, 1974.  It is estimated that the total allotment figures for County Mayo should reach 3,000 acres of which roughly 2,000 acres would be regarded as arable.</P>
    <P>A Deputy spoke about the abolition of the Land Commission.  I do not think anybody ever suggested that in the year 1973 the Land Commission should be abolished.  Never were the activities of the commission more necessary than at present when there is such competition for land, while there is such a real danger of the survival of only the wealthiest in that competition.  How else can you protect the weak in this race, this competition, for land other than through the instrumentality of the machinery of the Land Commission?  Probably Deputy Flanagan and other Deputies <Col N="630" /> who suggested this did not really mean that the Land Commission should be abolished.  I think that what they had in mind was that perhaps it should come under the wing of a Minister other than the Minister for Lands. That is a totally different proposition and it is always open to the Taoiseach and the Government to make such arrangements in the distribution of Departments as will effectively carry out the work of the Government. There are no such proposals at the moment, nor do I foresee any such proposals.  However, if by the suggestion that the Land Commission should be abolished it is meant that there should be a free-for-all in the race or competition for the acquisition of land I would deplore any such suggestion in the strongest possible terms as being utterly irresponsible.  I do not think that any such thing was mentioned but one does hear and read about abolishing the Land Commission. I say that the activities of the Land Commission in securing and protecting the weak or the comparatively poor against the very wealthy are necessary and are more necessary today than ever before.</P>
    <P>There was a complaint&mdash;I think it was made by Deputy Esmonde&mdash; about the four Lay Commissioners who hear appeals against the acquisition of land.  The Deputy complained that it was not reasonable that these commissioners should initiate proceedings for the acquisition of land and should then sit as judges on whether or not what they had initiated was correct, so to speak.  That is a point of view.  But, the commissioners are vested with very considerable powers in relation to the acquisition and distribution of land.  Within the stated policy they are the final judges in that respect.</P>
    <P>It has also been complained from time to time that the secretary of the Land Commission should not be one of the commissioners.  There is an argument for and against there again. Indeed, in regard to any point that may be made there is an argument for and against.  Any change in the present position would require legislation.  The present system is working reasonably <Col N="631" /> well and I would have to be convinced that there was a case for a change before I would move in that direction.</P>
    <P>There are many points that have been raised but I dealt with most of them in my general remarks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power suggested that farms which were adequate some years ago are not now adequate.  I think he was making the case for a revision of the concept of 45 acres of good land being a viable farm. In terms of traditional agriculture I would agree with him that there is a big argument for increasing the area in the case of farmers who depend on milk or beef.  On the other hand, there could be a farmer with less than 45 acres who would be making a very good living from some other type of agricultural activity.  I agree that the whole thing has to be looked at again in the light of modern conditions. Deputy Power thought that £1 million was not enough for the purchase of land in cash.  I agree that every Minister for Lands would hope to see the day when land is bought and paid for in cash and nothing else and we will work towards that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power dealt with a case in his constituency about a right of way which was pending for a long time. The Deputy was in communication with me since and I, at least, explained the position to him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham, from the same constituency, complained bitterly about the delay in dividing land.  I have dealt with that.  I hope I will see before long the day when these delays will be eliminated. Deputy Bermingham also dealt with the policy mile and I have dealt with that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham did make one point, which, indeed, was made by other speakers.  Deputy Blaney from Donegal was finding it difficult to understand why 200 acres of land was allowed to be sold in one place and compulsory powers were used to acquire 38 acres not too far away from the 200 acres.  One gets that sort of complaint from time to time and I can only tell the Deputies that if any such case is brought to my attention I will have it investigated and will <Col N="632" /> personally consider the file.  It is not easy to deal with a case in isolation but that point has been made.  I distinctly remember Deputy Blaney making it and Deputy Bermingham also made it. If my attention is drawn to any matters like that I will definitely have them considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary from Kerry complained about the indiscriminate use of section 40 notices.  I know that the use of section 40 notices can be very annoying and frustrating both to people who want to sell land and to people who want to buy land and also to auctioneers.  At the same time I believe that if it were not for section 40 the Land Commission would be faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> in a great number of instances and would not be able to do anything.  The land would be sold and that would be that.  I thoroughly agree that there should be no undue delays in giving a decision where a section 40 notice has been served and I give my general view about a section 40 notice on a small farm where an adjoining or nearby small farmer is prepared to buy it: I believe he should be let buy it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary also argued that the Land Commission should buy land at public auction.  This would, of course, be the ideal way to do it, but there could be abuses and there could be difficulties.  I believe the Land Commission should pay market value. Indeed, it was a previous Government participated in by Fine Gael and Labour who first introduced legislation making it compulsory for the Land Commission to pay market value.  Admittedly they pay in bonds and, if we could get away from bonds, we would have the ideal situation.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words now about the Forestry Branch and the Wild Life Section of my Department. EEC conditions and EEC values have definitely created a major problem for the Forestry Branch and the Wild Life Section.  In the not too distant past it was possible for the Forestry Branch to acquire by voluntary effort all the land they wanted.  In many cases the land was offered to the Forestry Branch.  This land was described <Col N="633" /> as marginal or bad land.  There is no such thing at present as either marginal or bad land.  Not alone is land not being offered to the Forestry Branch and Wild Life Section but the traffic is the other way.  Deputies frequently make representations asking for the release of land the Forestry Branch has bought for planting.  This could have a very adverse effect on our planting programme.  Deputies frequently make representations to me to use my influence to get the Forestry Branch to release land acquired for planting.  If this continues the result will be inevitable: there will be less land for planting and less employment in forestry work.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that, because of the price commanded by agricultural products and by land, land that could be made available for forestry is being held back by the owners even for the purpose of rough grazing. That is one side of the canvas.  On the other side, we must recognise that Ireland undoubtedly has the kind of climate that trees like.  There is plenty of rain, a long growing season and freedom from severe winter weather. This is something on which we should capitalise.  We should make it a primary duty to extract from Irish soil every good we can get out of it. Timber is one of the good things and the demand for timber is mounting. Indeed, timber is becoming one of the scarce commodities.  Whatever else is surplus in the EEC, timber is not. They are nett importers of timber and they will never be otherwise.  By devoting a fair proportion of our marginal land to afforestation we cannot go wrong.  That is the commercial side.</P>
    <P>Truly a country can be judged on what it does with its own resources. The wealth timber will produce in both the long and short term and the employment it gives will have to be weighed carefully against the demand for land for agricultural purposes. A decision will have to be taken as to whether the price paid for forestry land will have to be increased. I believe it will have to be increased if we are to get the amount of land we want.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> The Forestry Branch and the Wild Life Section have on the amenity side become a very, very important part of the Department of Lands.  The opening of forest parks to the general public in comparatively recent times has been much appreciated.  It should continue to be the policy of the Department, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, to develop forest parks.  There was a time when forest parks were out of bounds to the general public. That was deplorable.  The fullest possible use should be made of our forest parks as an amenity.  This is more important now than it ever was because there is more leisure time and, I hope, more money available to spend in that leisure time.  People should of such healthy and pleasant ameni-be encouraged to avail in their leisure ties as forest parks.  It will continue to be the policy of my Department to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham posed some questions about the activities of my Department in regard to the EEC. I think I made the position clear to him when dealing with Directive 160. The Deputy asked about the regional and social fund.  He also asked what I would do about aids for less favoured farming areas and he wanted to know what was being done about the restructuring of ownership.  I think Deputy Cunningham had come straight from a branch meeting, determined, in accordance with general policy, to fire these questions at me without giving due consideration to the question as to whether they were, in fact, matters proper for my attention as Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>I want to put the record straight in case anybody might think that I and my Department were not doing our duty from the point of view of our EEC responsibilities.  I want to tell Deputy Cunningham now that there is an EEC section in my Department in the charge of an assistant secretary and that section is fully and totally in touch with EEC activities.  It is not my responsibility, as Minister for Lands, to deal with matters relating either to the Regional Fund or the Social Fund.  As far as I am aware, proposals relating <Col N="635" /> to land settlement matters would not be appropriate for consideration in relation to these funds.  With regard to the proposed directive on aids for less-favoured farming areas, the Deputy will be aware that this is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The main proposals in the draft directive relates to headage grants for farmers in special areas which have still to be defined.  The criteria for this definition have not yet been determined. The officials of my Department are in close touch with their opposite numbers in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in relation to this and related matters.  The Deputy knows that, so far as the Regional Fund is concerned, it is in the very capable hands of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and that the other matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> With regard to the Deputy's reference to the restructuring of ownership and tenure being considered by the EEC, I presume he was speaking about EEC directives on structural reform in agriculture. There are two directives involved: first, on the modernisation of farms, which is being dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and, secondly, on the encouragement to leave farming and the allocation of the surrendered land to the modern farmers.  I have dealt with this fully.</P>
      <P>The formulation of the scheme to implement the latter directive is a matter for the Land Commission.  Everyone knows the scheme is at an advanced stage and that a Government decision on it will be taken any day.  After that the scheme under both directives must be submitted for clearance by the EEC Commission.  Needless to say, when dealing with matters like these, which extensively affect the agricultural community and which are complementary in effect, there is the closest possible co-operation between the staffs involved in both Departments. Officials from the Departments regularly attend the usual monthly meetings in Brussels of the EEC farming committee on agricultural structures. Further, my officials frequently arrange informal briefing meetings with the EEC officials in the agricultural section. I would add that the meetings have been extremely useful and I should like publicly to thank the EEC personnel for their co-operation and the generous provision of their time. On occasions they have travelled here to meet and discuss with us points of difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate Deputy Cunningham's anxiety to see that everything is being done to avail of the benefits <Col N="637" /> of the EEC and to ensure that our entry into Europe brings us the best possible advantages.  I can appreciate the Deputy's anxiety to see that the business of this Department in regard to this matter is being attended to.  I am glad to tell him that is the case. He can be assured that the farming community will have the best service possible in order to secure for them the maximum that can be obtained from our entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>In replying to this debate it has struck me that on many occasions I had to say that we must wait and see. In ordinary conditions that might not be regarded as a satisfactory approach but this is not an ordinary time for the Department of Lands or the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This is a transition period, brought about by our entry into Europe.  For example, the important question raised by Deputy Power regarding the acceptable area of a viable farm could have been answered five years ago without the slightest trouble.  That is not so now. We must see the kind of agriculture farmers will specialise in; we must find out how many of them will go in for intensive farming.  The whole matter must be considered in the light of all these matters.</P>
    <P>The compulsory powers of the Land Commission must be looked at again from the point of view of their necessity.  I think there will always be necessity for the compulsory powers of the Land Commission in order to prevent the acquisition of huge tracts of land by a small number of people. There will always be a necessity for those powers in order to protect the weak from the powerful.  However, we must consider what effect the EEC directives and schemes will have on acquiring land on a voluntary basis. The question of leasing can be discussed, but we must see if it will take on.  The matter of afforestation falls within the ambit of my Department and this also is at a transitional stage. I am not suggesting we should get out of forestry, but we must reconsider the situation.  There must be a policy decision; we must decide if there will be emphasis on reclaiming land for agriculture, as some people consider <Col N="638" /> desirable, or if the emphasis should be on continuing to plant the poor and marginal land as a better proposition.</P>
    <P>All those problems have been presented to the Department of Lands since we entered Europe.  That was the reason I said in my opening remarks that no Minister for Lands ever entered on a term of office at a more challenging time.  I realise that, if all these problems can be dealt with, it will lead to an improvement for those who decide to continue to live in rural Ireland.  Provided they are enabled to earn a decent living they will be able to enjoy what I believe is one of the most satisfying and happiest ways of life.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to thank the Deputies for their constructive remarks during the debate, and I hope I have dealt with all the problems that have been raised either individually or collectively. If I have overlooked any little problem that is worrying any Deputy and if he communicates with me I shall communicate with him and clear up the points raised.</P>

      <P>The immediate reaction to the proposals when they were aired was favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would look upon that statement as a compliment to the integrity of Fianna Fáil in their attitude to the proposals on this side of the House.  It might be no harm to compare at this stage the attitude of our party with that of Opposition Members who are now in Government in regard to community <Col N="640" /> schools, the furore they raised and the accusations they levelled against us about discrimination, sectarianism and so on.  At that time the media all played their part in highlighting this. It amazes me how all is changed, changed utterly.  A terrible silence seems now to be born.  All the cribbers seem to be gone and all the Doctor Dalys and others have now gone suddenly silent.  We compliment the Minister on his unique talent in bringing about this type of situation.  His personality on the media comes across very well indeed.  I pay tribute to him on his courageous step, and we on this side of the House will continue to act responsibly and will not hinder the educational improvements he envisages or will not endanger the educational future of the children of Ireland.  I would consider this policy a continuation of the policy that was pursued by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is welcome, and I am glad to see the people will have a direct say in the complete education of the children in every area, and that parents will get the type of education they want for their children.  I note that in the document which was circulated to us, <i>Regionalisation&mdash;Draft for Discussion</i> the word &ldquo;parent&rdquo; was never used, as far as I can see, in the entire document, even though it was possibly intended that parents should have a say.  It may be that parents as such are not organised and that is the reason.  I would like to ask, as Deputy Hussey did, for an explanation in regard to item 2 of the preliminary draft for discussion:</P>
    <P>The management of private secondary schools would not be interfered with by the scheme.</P>
    <P>I, too, would like to know what is a private secondary school.  Another matter on which I would like clarification is the development and maintenance of schools for the mentally and physically handicapped.  At the moment the Department of Health has a certain commitment in this regard.  Is it proposed that the Department of Education should take on this responsibility or will Health be expected to play its part, too?</P>
    <P>When one examines the structure <Col N="641" /> that is suggested here one comes to the conclusion that it is a broadening, on a different scale, of the existing vocational education committees who will now deal with all classes of education in an area or region.  That any Department should contemplate this step is a tribute to the people who were responsible for vocational education down through the years.  These are the people who were in at ground level in the 1930s and suffered great hardship.  They had a very uphill struggle in laying the foundations of the system that has proved its worth today.  In many cases they had to put up with a certain amount of belittling, but in spite of all that they have proved that vocational education could make the grade and was very necessary in our country.</P>
    <P>I was a little disappointed to hear Deputy John L. O'Sullivan in the opposite benches deploring the state of schools in his area.  In Kildare we had a wonderful building programme during the past ten years, and new vocational schools have been built in Naas, Maynooth, Prosperous, Kildare and Castledermot, and extensions in Rathangan and other places.  This is a tribute not only to the present committee and the CEO but also to those who did the groundwork way back.</P>
    <P>However, we do suffer from a shortage of science teachers and metalwork and woodwork teachers.  The teachers we have are called for a half day here and a half day there.  It is not the ideal solution, and something should be done to attract new people to our schools.  There is a greater demand than ever before for night classes.  We cannot meet these needs because we have not the teachers to deal with them.  In my own area a woodwork class was sought but the demand could not be met.  The Minister should endeavour to obtain woodwork, metalwork and applied science teachers for the whole country.</P>
    <P>Deputy John L. O'Sullivan was inclined to blame previous administrations and previous Ministers for neglect in Clonakilty.  Perhaps the Deputy should not look as far as the Department of Education, the present Minister or his predecessor.  Perhaps <Col N="642" /> he should look nearer home, at the structure and personnel of his local vocational educational committee.  He could ask them to try and do better. Can he prove that help was refused in Clonakilty?  The Deputy was most audacious to denigrate Deputy Faulkner's contribution and to say that his style of contribution was one of the reasons why we are in Opposition today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner did more good in his few years in office than was done by the person who denigrated him in his whole life.  We are told that people get the type of Government they deserve. Perhaps the people of Clonakilty are getting the type of school they deserve because in that area in west Cork they have the public representative they deserve.  To their eternal credit they did not accept as a representative for many years the man who now speaks in such a manner of previous administrations and Governments.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the blind and the mentally handicapped.  The Minister also referred to these people. A great deal has been done to provide the blind with education.  I know a blind man who got his leaving certificate in 1972.  He did some training and is now a qualified telephonist.  He cannot get a job with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who have changed to a new system.  This young, blind man is on a long waiting list for a Civil Service post.  At present he is working part-time in a well-known café in Dublin which has recently been handed over to the workers.  The workers who are now in management have a greater appreciation of the needs of the blind in regard to employment than others seem to have had.</P>
    <P>It is not the job of the Minister or his representatives to provide jobs for people.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be worried about outlets for the end-products in their training schemes.  The Minister for Education should make the remainder of the Government aware of the need to provide jobs for people who are being educated under our present system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the efforts of many and letters to the Minister we cannot succeed in providing jobs to the extent to which we would like for people like the man I referred to.</P>
      <P>Such people have a certain potential. We have trained them to use that potential to the maximum.  It is a pity they do not get a chance to show their paces when the Department of Education have done their duty.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there is a shortage of places for mentally handicapped in our special schools.  This was highlighted by Rev. Brother Clancy, a brother of St. John of God, speaking at Celbridge recently. Places at such special schools are taken up by adults.  If these adults were placed in suitable employment there would be room in these schools for other mentally handicapped people. The Minister should persuade his colleagues to follow up this point and to endeavour to provide places in industry for these people so that they can be absorbed into ordinary life or employed in sheltered workshops.  We have made an effort in County Kildare.  There is a firm manufacturing light upholstery.  It can cater for only 18 or 20 handicapped boys.  It should be the duty of somebody in Government to encourage firms to employ such people.  Perhaps the bookmakers' association could take some of these people under their wing. They are making plenty of money and could make a contribution.  Everyone should play a part in this work.  The Government and private firms should create public awareness of the need for handicapped people.  People should remember that handicaps do not refer solely to horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention briefly the modern tendency towards changes in education.  Not every change is good. The world is changing.  Education will always be changing, but never more than in the last ten years has education changed so much.  I would be very worried if I had to return to the classroom in the morning.  I would need a course of more than a year's <Col N="644" /> duration to prepare me for the changes which have come about.  Old concepts seem to have been discarded. The emphasis is on change.  The curriculum has become larger.  New subjects have been introduced.  My remarks might be considered very conservative and &ldquo;square&rdquo;.  Less stress is now placed on learning by rote. There is less need for strict discipline in the classroom.  The tablebook, the spelling book, and the stroke of the cane, when necessary, must still have a place in our national schools at least.  In years to come I venture to forecast that these very items will be put back into our structures and will be hailed as innovations.  I appeal to the Minister not to encourage change just for the sake of change.</P>
    <P>Before I came into this building yesterday I noticed the students of the College of Art sitting outside. Some were drawing.  One handed me a statement.  They say they are very worried about the unfair sacking of four of their colleagues.  They are worried also because they cannot understand how Deputies who were in Opposition some time ago&mdash;particularly the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating&mdash;and others who were Don Quixotes and Sir Galahads, who worried about every maid in distress, have become so silent now.  The plight of the students in the College of Art no longer seems to worry them.  I suggest to the Minister that dialogue is necessary between us and our next-door neighbours.  We are told that dialogue is necessary with our brethren in Northern Ireland if we are to bring about reconciliation.  Dialogue is probably necessary between the different sections of Fine Gael and the Labour Party over the changing of the constituencies and the appointment of judges.  If dialogue is necessary between colleagues who are so closely knit and who seem to be such friends, it must surely be necessary between us and our next-door neighbours.</P>
    <P>I emphasised to the students of the College of Art that the Ministers had onerous duties and that the Minister for Finance was busy counting the <Col N="645" /> money and looking after everybody's needs and deciding whether he should tax all the farmers, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, too, had tax on his mind, and that they had not time to deal with frivolous items like this.  They cannot understand this and it might be just as well to talk to the students anyway.  It is not nice for anybody not to be talking to his next door neighbours.  As the College of Art is a direct responsibility of the Minister for Education, he might interest himself in this end and endeavour to bring about a more sociable atmosphere, at least between our neighbours and ourselves.</P>
    <P>I feel pretty strongly on the question of the teaching of history in our schools.  There appears to be a great upsurge of interest in the teaching of history recently.  At one time inspectors came into the schools and worried very much about what we did not teach, now it appears that people are worried about what we do teach. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien felt last year that there was a danger that the teaching of history in our schools would produce little IRA men.  I maintain that the misrule of this country produced little and big IRA men and to ignore this misrule, either past or present, will not help to eradicate it.</P>
    <P>History should deal with facts. Whether those facts are palatable or not, an unprejudiced account is required, and a training of our students to draw their own conclusions is needed.  That is what history teaching is all about.  Ireland suffered generations of persecution and our children will have to be told this.  It is necessary to point this out to pupils, to explain why we are lacking in certain developments today, why our industrial development has lagged behind that of other countries, why our minds possibly have not been developed.  Possibly it is a good thing that they did not discover the natural resources we had underneath our ground some hundred years ago or, like the trees the previous Minister was so sorry we had not got, they, too might have been taken away. Those facts cannot be hidden from <Col N="646" /> children and should be explained to them.  The fact that Britain wronged our country for years and continues to wrong this country by endeavouring to hold on to six northern counties must be told to children too.  The fact that a British contrived majority can outweigh a nationally-minded minority in that small portion of our country does not absolve Britain from its duty to undo the wrongs that it has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Our party's first aim is based on that and I will not be a party to the watering down of our history to suit the delicate palates of anybody, particularly those the purity of whose motives I have every reason to doubt.</P>
      <P>Our national education system was founded in 1832.  That was the first opportunity for many Irish people to become educated or to learn.  In the 140 odd years since then they have struggled through famine and Fenianism, land wars and great wars and it has given us the people that we have in Ireland today.  I would see a direct link between this opportunity for education the Irish people got for the first time, starting in the 1830's, and the Irish revival, whether it be Gaelic or literary, military or national, at the turn of this century.  The advent of an educational system of our own was a precursor of the proportion of freedom we now enjoy.  In any branch of teaching, and particularly in the teaching of history, the teachers of Ireland have nothing to feel ashamed of.  We have helped to foster a feeling of Irishness in our people that has never accepted the idea that we are a province of Britain.  Other Celtic communities, such as Scotland and Wales, have&mdash;maybe grudgingly&mdash;but they have accepted it.  I feel that history itself will deal very sharply with anyone who proposes a wishy-washy type of history for our pupils in this State of Ireland or as some might prefer to call it, the States of Ireland, today.  I would appeal to the Minister not to allow his party to be a party to such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One item I should like to emphasise <Col N="647" /> to the Minister is his duty and all our duties in the educational priority areas.  Those are now easily discerned and we should designate them.  The area in Ireland is small.  We should create conditions that will help to eradicate the disadvantaged pupil and the disadvantaged parent.  Those people, because of their environment, because of their history, because of their lack of material goods possibly, lack the motivation to learn.</P>
    <P>It should be one of our priorities to create conditions that will give them the incentive to learn and we should strive to remove the reasons for their rebellious attitude and the tendencies towards &ldquo;mitching&rdquo; and subsequent vandalism that we have today.  It is not widespread as yet but what is happening in America, in Britain and on the Continent might give us a warning of what we should expect in the years to come.  While we have not as yet the vandalism they experience in other countries we should be warned and take steps to ensure that that will not happen. There is an attitude in the disadvantaged pupil of antagonism towards school and society and law.  We should learn from other countries, improve school conditions and give preferential treatment to this type of parent and pupil.  We should help to brighten the school, improve the teacher-pupil ratio.  I do not mean one to 45.  I mean something much more realistic that would give individual attention to this type of pupil.  In an area where books are not plentiful and in homes where reading is not encouraged some pre-school education might be a help as well as the availability of books and game facilities, sports fields, swimming pools and gymnasia. We should think about those things and act now while we are in a position to deal with the problem.  As yet it is of small proportions, but in a year or two it could be a much greater problem.  If we do not deal with it now the disadvantaged pupil will become the disadvantaged parent who will perpetuate this problem in the years to come.</P>
    <P>May I again wish the Minister the <Col N="648" /> best of luck in his very onerous Ministry. I can appreciate that he and his predecessors were all endeavouring to do the best they could for the students of Ireland.  I should like to pay a tribute to Deputy Pádraig Faulkner, who solved many problems during his ministry.  I would say he left no unfinished business or no half-baked policies behind him.  The Minister will agree that he did not inherit any insoluble problems or anything that was caused by lack of attention during the previous ministry. I see in Deputy Bruton a young man who has not much of a generation gap to bridge when dealing with youth, sport and his other commitments. I wish him luck.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to a very narrow field.  Education covers a very vast area in the development of our youth and in creating good citizens.  For the information of Deputy Power, the needs of the blind are catered for and are within his own jurisdiction as a public representative in County Kildare.  In the mid-Western Health Board, and prior to that in the Limerick Health Authority, we appointed two blind telephonists and we have a first-class blind physiotherapist.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are moaning and groaning. Now that they are in Opposition they can do nothing else, and they were never capable of doing anything else.  This has been proved by our achievements in such a short time. Deputy Power should drag himself and his party together in Kildare and realise that the initiative in this field must come locally.  While he decried the action of his own colleague in west Cork, Deputy Crowley, I must say that he himself is lacking in what he should be doing in Kildare.  When the balance is reversed the wound opens and the salt is not so easily accepted.</P>

      <P>I am not a Cassandra. I wanted to make those few remarks for the benefit of the boys from Kildare.  I want to congratulate the Minister.  In the short time he has been in office he has proved himself to be a man of courage, a man of ability and a man who will make a decision.  Nobody is in a better position to acknowledge his achievements than I, since I represent Limerick and region.  This is to his eternal credit.</P>
      <P>Some years ago in the time of some of his predecessors, we started agitations about the educational potential in Limerick city and region, with the city as the spearhead and the capital of regional development in education. We agitated.  We hired special trains for students from the region.  We paraded through the streets of Dublin. We were received in Marlborough House.  We organised the whole region to make our demands felt.  We were fobbed off by Ministers for Education with promises and promises.  I will never forget the promises given during the by-election in Limerick.  We were promised university status the day after the count by the then Minister for Education, now Senator Lenihan.  We were to turn the first sod for a university in Limerick the day after the count.  We were promised all that during the by-election.  I suppose we will have to pass over those things, make allowances for the weaknesses of the people concerned and treat them with the charity which is always forthcoming from these benches.</P>

      <P>I am benevolent at times.  I very seldom came here in any spirit of criticism, even in the Minister's predecessors' time.  I want to be as helpful as I can.  There are many facets of the educational field generally.  You <Col N="650" /> can apply education to practically all phases of life, and to young and old. In a more or less selfish way, I suppose, I want to confine myself to the needs, as I see them, of my city and my region. I do not believe entirely in regionalisation but I do agree with it where education is concerned.</P>
      <P>We will be discussing regionalisation at another time, I presume.  It can be very dangerous and very inhuman but where education is concerned I am 100 per cent behind it.  It is the only answer. In our approach to regionalisation we must not forget the teacher-pupil relationship that comes from the national school level.  We must have the confidence of the pupil in the teacher and we must have communication between the teacher and the pupil if we are to produce the end product at university or academic level, or within the crafts.</P>
      <P>In his Estimate this year the Minister has poured an extra £18 million into education.  I know that if it were possible that figure would be doubled and trebled.  It is a long time since we had such an approach to our educational problems and to the advancement of education as we have in the Estimate.  It goes back to the late Tom Derrig who projected such a powerful image in this field.  Of course, he had open ground to plough and it was easily done.  It is difficult today when there is so much competition and when there are advances whether computerised, or &ldquo;electronicised&rdquo;, or any other &ldquo;ised&rdquo;.  We are moving in a field of education today which was unforeseeable ten or 15 years ago.  I am glad we have a Minister with the capacity and the grit and the ability to tackle the problems presented in 1973.  We are lucky to have him and may God spare him long days to be with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has stressed the fact that we must have dialogue, consultation, talk&mdash;call it what you will.  To me it is parsed and analysed in one sentence, that is, communication between the four involvements: school management, parents, teachers, students.  When we have&mdash;as the Minister has set out to achieve&mdash;equality of motive, equality of thought and discussion at that level, there is no fear <Col N="651" /> that I can see for the future of education in a European competitive field.</P>
    <P>We will have disagreements, expected and unexpected, during these talks.  Around the table is the place for solutions rather than, as we had from Fianna Fáil, teachers' and pupils' strikes.  Every now and then students carrying strike banners parade outside the College of Art.  I know a little about students who make art their career, because a nephew of mine teaches art in Kilkenny.  Many students are wasting the time and money of their parents and, in my view, should be sent to Grangegorman for an IQ test.  This is a phase they are going through.  Not until they pull themselves out of the College of Art or their parents' money runs out will they realise what education is all about.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss a matter which, I am sure, is dear to everybody, and that is the rehabilitation of the handicapped child.  Much has been said about the education of the handicapped. &ldquo;Handicapped&rdquo; means many things.  It can be severe, mild, physical or mental.  As a finance-raiser in Limerick for the handicapped school, I found what I had to do degrading.</P>
    <P>The late Donnchadha O'Malley and myself organised crazy football matches&mdash;O'Malley v. Coughlan.  We organised flag days, dances and church collections to raise money to provide a school and transport for the handicapped children.  At the time it was topical for O'Malley and Coughlan to clash and we exploited that.  We raised enough money to buy a minibus and open a school, which was kindly given to us by the late Bishop of Limerick, Dr. Murphy. We did this by voluntary effort.  That was a shame and a disgrace to the Fianna Fáil Government.  Let them never forget that.  We went around Limerick on Church Holydays and asked people to help those unfortunate children.  This should not be done by any outside organisation but rather by the Department of Education.  The Deputies who come here moaning and groaning should remember their history and what they have done in this field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> Having advised Deputy Power on the rehabilitation of the blind, I should now like the Minister to make some contribution towards the cost of lead dogs.  A trained lead dog costs something in the region of £200. German shepherds and labradors can be trained to lead the blind and from what I have seen they are more intelligent than many people imagine.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of racecourses and bookmakers.  There is a blind telephonist at the regional head post office in Limerick and nothing gives him more pleasure than going to race-meetings within the Limerick area. He goes with his wife to Limerick Junction, Clonmel and Limerick Races on his days off and enjoys every bit of it.  I cannot understand people who say that nothing is being done.  If they make up their minds that something can be done, they should go ahead and do it and not come here complaining, morning, noon and night, when it is within their own capacity to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister for Education and the Minister for Health on the provision of a school in Limerick for the Brothers of Charity&mdash;I should not call it a school but a village.  The Minister for Health turned the sod one day last week. £2 million has been spent on this scheme for the provision of accommodation for handicapped children. The Minister's predecessors would get a paralytic stroke if they thought, or it was suggested, that that amount should be spent on this development. The Minister has done it and we thank him for it.  The £2 million to the Brothers of Charity was made up in different ways.  The health board, the Department of Health and the Department of Education are making up this money.  There will be the usual sheltered workshops and the general rehabilitation programmes from the day they enter this school until they leave as first-class people in whatever craft they wish to take. Much has been achieved, if the blind would only consent to see.  I cannot take the jaundice from the yellow <Col N="653" /> eye and there is no use trying to convince these people that these things can be done.  They can be done and they are being done.  Let us remember that.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch on the subject of the backward child.  While some of us were front-runners in our own class at school, there were others who tailed off.  These were human beings also and something should have been done to help them.  I know classes are graded A, B, C, honours and pass, but there is more to it than that.  There is a vacuum between the D class and the E or F class.  We must be careful not to embarrass the pupil or give him a complex which would jeopardise his future and his adult life.  Students and children can develop an inferiority complex which may remain with them throughout their lives.  This is something we must avoid in the case of backward pupils.  The front runner is OK, although many front runners fall by the wayside because they learn too easily.  The pupils in the centre who have to work hard in order to pass an examination are the ones who ultimately succeed.  They have to stay up half the night studying Euclid, Cicero, Shakespeare.  We all studied these things long ago and were receptive enough to what was being stuffed into our heads.</P>
    <P>The backward pupil must not be allowed to develop an inferiority complex. He must be allowed to develop at his own pace.  It is a pity that Deputy Power is not here.  He realises that the racehorse who wins at the Curragh and the donkey that takes milk to the creamery both work to the best of their capacity.  We must all work according to our capacity.  If we were all the same, the world would become a lunatic asylum.  I would advise the Minister to apply himself to the problem of the backward student.  We all know of boys and girls who are not able to keep pace with the other students and who when they leave school feel that they are behind everybody else.  My concept of education is that it should prepare children for the battle of life.</P>
    <P>There is the case of the wayward <Col N="654" /> child who commits some offence.  He is brought to the court and given the benefit of the First Offenders Act.  He commits a second offence and receives a warning from the district justice. The day comes when action has to be taken and he is sent to a reform school, to Daingean or some filthy hole.  In some cases, because of the fact that there is no room in a reform school, the boy is sent to the nearest prison.  This environment is all wrong. We must set about the rehabilitation of the wayward.  It is not an easy task. One may try to coax or nurse a wayward boy or to take him away from his associates, to no avail.  There should be a course of psychiatry to help these wayward children from the age of 12 to 18.  Such a course would be designed to teach them that they must conform to normal standards. There is some want in these children. We all know of cases where that want does not come from the parents. There are children who get into trouble every day of the week.  They steal or they absent themselves from school.  They stay out at night.  They are a continuous worry to their parents.  These children feel that they are rejected by society.  They are stubborn. Some means of handling this section of our community should be devised.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in regard to school books.  When I attended school the fee was one penny a week.  The Christian Brothers fought a hard battle.  They upheld their identity. They refused to be taken over by a foreign government.  They brought education to the people.  They did a tremendous job.  At that time the school books could be used from one year to the next.  Boys leaving a class could pass their books on to those coming into that class.  Today the school books change every year.  A school book may cost £5.  Next year the books will be changed again.  I would suggest that the books we used in the early twenties were as good as, if not better than, the school books available today but they were much less expensive.  The Minister should make things easy for parents by stipulating that over a period of four or five years the school books would not be <Col N="655" /> changed.  For instance, in the school in Plessey they are doing Russian.  I had to pay £6 last week for a book in Russian which was not obtainable in Limerick or Cork.  It is one of the languages my daughter is pursuing at the moment.  It is all very well if one has the £6.  A new penny or a five pence piece is not very much to have, but it is a &ldquo;helluva&rdquo; lot to want.  We must consider those who want.  There are unfortunate people who cannot afford things and they deserve to be considered.</P>
    <P>With regard to Irish history, it has been said, possibly with some degree of truth, that history is the lie that has been agreed on.  I think there is a great deal of truth in that.  Only out of the past, out of the achievements of our ancestors, can we provide for the present and look forward to the future.  Our glorious past and all the toils and tribulations of our forebears should not be wiped out as if they were a bad debt.  Children should be taught about these things in the classroom and in the sanctity of the home.  We should never forget the achievements of those who went before us.</P>
    <P>We have our so-called modern historians. One sees them in print and one hears them on the media.  Some of the history they produce is quite unrelated to our culture and our traditions.  We must hold on to our culture and our traditions just as we should hold on to whatever we have at the present time, because it is on what we have and do today that we will be adjudged by those who follow us. Let us take inspiration from the past and let us follow the example of those who were prepared to pay so much. These are my views and I am quite certain I am not alone in them.  We must cherish the past.  I would appeal to the Minister to keep this aspect in mind in the curriculum.</P>
    <P>We are well provided with decent, up-to-date schools.  Where schools are not what they should be&mdash;we have heard people talking about rat-infested schools, broken doors and windows and roofs in need of repair&mdash;nobody is responsible for that position except the <Col N="656" /> local representative.  He is the man who should set about rectifying that situation where it exists.  If he acts as he should&mdash;I do not care what party he belongs to&mdash;I am sure the Minister will give his representations the same weight that he gave to the representations in regard to Dún Chaoin.</P>
    <P>Local organisations should apply themselves to these things and, if they do not do so, then any defects that exist can be laid at their doors.  If it does not come from the ground it will not come down from the sky.  That is my advice to those who come in here shouting their heads off about what should or should not be done in our schools.</P>
    <P>There are all kinds of anomalies where free transport is concerned.  It is left to the county CEO, the manager or two or three other people to decide whether or not children should have free transport.  A half empty bus will pass by five or six children and half-a-mile further along it will pick up five or six children.  They are all attending the same school and the five the bus passes by must trudge wearily along in its wake.  There is no flexibility.  The quads are going to school but, because they are not attending the same school that their older brothers and sisters attended, they will not get free transport.</P>
    <P>I made representations on their behalf and I was turned down.  I was told they were not within the catchment area.  Who draws the line?  There are too many faceless people involved. One approaches one person and is told to see somebody else and when one approaches that person one is referred to someone else again.  One is like a fool in a fog.  These unfortunate children have to trudge the road in winter rain and frost and snow.  They could easily be transported by bus. There is no sense in this and I would ask the Minister to put an end to this practice.  The bus is there and if there is room in it the children should be allowed to travel on it.  I am completely against the present selectivity.  This is not what I mean when I talk about Irish tradition and culture and the education of our children.  I take a strong view on this.  I would ask the <Col N="657" /> Minister to rectify this classification as between one and another.  This is what has destroyed this country.</P>
    <P>Pupil guidance is an innovation and is most welcome.  In the past what mattered was the wealth of the parents. I knew of people who spent from ten to 20 years trying to qualify from the College of Surgeons, Trinity College or from the National University.  They were able to spend all these years in college solely because their parents could provide for them although one wonders about the end product.  It is essential for teachers and parents to come together and do what is best for the children.  It is not a question of what the adults want.  What is important is to ensure that the children are placed in a situation best suited to their talents.  The ambitions of the parents are not important; what counts is what the student is capable of and where he will make most progress.</P>
    <P>This country has recently begun to realise the importance of the skilled trades.  They are as good as, if not better than, the professions, and we are all glad about this.  The people in the trades may not have to wear a collar and tie, they may have to go to work early each morning, but they have as much in their pay packet as the alleged professionals or academics. Career guidance can play a major part in helping young people make their decisions regarding their jobs. Certainly, these courses should be able to place the young people where they are most suited.  If a man is content in his work he will be successful. Otherwise he will be a misfit, or a &ldquo;spoiled priest&rdquo; as we said long ago. The only way we can ensure that we do not have misfits is by providing an adequate guidance course.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a topic that might be called &ldquo;the plum of the day&rdquo;.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on what he has done for Limerick city and region.  He has given a sum of £18 million for the Limerick Institute and I am glad that the headquarters are in Limerick city. However, it is not a Limerick city effort.  It will cater for the region and for the West of Ireland.  I am glad that we have the daughter of the Parliamentary <Col N="658" /> Secretary from Mayo as well as many other people from the west of the country in this institute.  I am pleased the Minister has gone a step further and has done what his predecessors promised but failed to do. When they were faced with the situation they funked it.  The justice of our cause has been shown beyond doubt. We fought this matter in Marlborough Street and in this House, and we debated it throughout the region involved.  We always got the usual answer &ldquo;it will be done&rdquo; from Fianna Fáil.  They did nothing and if anyone says otherwise he is guilty of an utter deception.  The Minister has done something for the Limerick region for which he will gain personal credit.  I am glad to pay tribute to him today; otherwise I should be lacking in responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Limerick project will cater for 6,000 students and Fianna Fáil should think about this.  The previous Minister for Education yesterday gave us a litany of the dead for 3½ hours although I did not listen to all he had to say.  All the troubles and turmoil of the world had nothing on what he had to say.  He repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> what he did when he was in office but as far as Limerick is concerned he just turned his back on the area.  He was not alone in this because his predecessors did the same.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to meet the Limerick University Project Committee as early as possible perhaps, with the public representatives.  I have not discussed this matter with the Minister; I am only judging him by his actions and they speak much louder than words.  We should be very clear what a university means to a region.  I am not going to discuss this matter because the advantages of a university should be obvious, even to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister a long term in office.  I hope when the Taoiseach is selecting his Cabinet after the next election he will not overlook the excellent work carried out by the Minister.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate I wish to speak on one aspect of policy alone which is referred to in the Minister's speech, that is, that relating to the change in the status of Irish in the Department of Education.  I choose to speak on it in English because English is the main medium of communication, and if I were to do so through Irish the record available would be in Irish only and would not be likely to be as widely read as if I spoke in the English language.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech refers to the policy of selective compulsion which, to use his words, &ldquo;proved so disastrous for the Irish language over the last 50 years&rdquo;.  What the Minister is referring to here is the manner in which the State has endeavoured to bring about the desired revival of Irish through the schools system.  In so far as administrations since the foundation of the State had good intentions and many educational and voluntary fields put great effort and enthusiasm into their work in relation to this question, their efforts should be appreciated and commended.  In so far as only marginal progress has been made, despite the amount of energy, time and money that have been put into this sphere, all administrations and parties must bear some share of the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addressing myself to this subject I am not doing so in any party political sense.  I am interested in the national aspect of the question.  We are all aware of the chequered history of the language in the educational system. Many of us for a number of years have been highly critical of the methods which have been applied to try to bring about an atmosphere in which Irish could be a means of communication. Language is a means of communication which grows with a community, but our treatment of it as a school or academic subject has obscured the fact <Col N="660" /> that a language cannot live unless there is fluency in communication.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been and there is still going on research into the problems relating to the language, into the motivational area and into the various means whereby one could try to achieve more progress.  Fluency itself has been discouraged by many aspects of language policy&mdash;for example, the compulsory aspect of the academic examination system which we had and which was not achieving the original objective anyway: the ability to speak and communicate.  I should correct myself here by saying that in some large areas it was not achieving its objective.  Nevertheless, the fact that many of us can speak the language means that there was some achievement at any rate.</P>
    <P>Other aspects which have affected and delayed progress relate, for example, to the attitude in the home, indeed, to the attitude in politics itself, and to the fact that in the minds of many people the language tends to be associated with the poorest and most economically backward areas of our country.  Another factor which influences the situation, I believe, is a sense of inferiority or, perhaps one might call it, shoneenism which is part of the heritage of this nation.  The change which the Minister and his Government have introduced is not one on which I shall comment other than to say that it is Government policy and in so far as it may help us to see what progress can be made, we should welcome it.  I myself would tend to regard it as something in the nature of a trial to see if this is one of the means which would encourage the more widespread use of the language than as a long-term policy.</P>
    <P>I had mentioned that up to the time of the election of this Government many of us have been very critical in recent years of the policy in regard to the Irish language in the educational system.  This was being examined and recommendations were being put to the previous Administration in regard to somewhat radical changes in this area.  Briefly the sort of recommendation being put was that a test in oral and written communication in Irish <Col N="661" /> should take the place of the required literary examination, with all the difficulties relating to it in grammar, poetry, literature <i>et cetera</i>.  It is felt that any lesser requirement than this could mean that the Irish language might not maintain its position, let alone improve its use, as a medium of communication.</P>
    <P>I have said I do not wish to engage in any controversy about the change which has been made.  The brief comment I would make is that one is now faced in examinations with the language as one of the subjects from which a choice can be made.  It is where there is choice and where there is the lack of social motivation in regard to the use of Irish that we reach a dilemma. One of the major problems in relation to the question of Irish, apart from giving young people fluency in it which is quite difficult to do if they are trying to tie that in with the passing of academic examinations, is that where there is no social motivation it is very difficult to keep the language alive. There is widespread motivation in relation to the English language.  Some people would use stronger words than &ldquo;social motivation&rdquo;, but I am trying to convey the sort of problem which exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister and members of the Government have spoken in favour and in support of the Irish language.  I hope that the Minister and the Government in their overall responsibility for the language will be prepared to review progress in regard to the use of Irish as a spoken language.  The Minister has said that substantial achievement has been accomplished.  I am not going to comment on this.  I am more concerned with what will take place in the future. I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will be prepared to reconsider present policy at a later stage.  I hope that whatever Government are in office the Minister and his colleagues will do that.  If the present policy is not achieving the desired effect and especially if it emerges that the policy is having a weakening effect I hope that it will be reconsidered.  That is why I am speaking in a non-political context.</P>
    <P>I would have more to say about the public position in regard to the language if I knew exactly whose responsibility <Col N="662" /> it is within the State.  It seems to me at present to lie with the Minister for Education, the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Finance.  I am merely posing a question that has been the subject of discussion in the past among some of us.</P>
    <P>I believe that the intelligent policy for Irish publicwise, not in relation to education specifically, is that of a gradually developing bilingualism.  I do not think, if we are to face the problem squarely, that a language can suddenly become spoken.  A start must be made.  We must move forward in easy stages.  This is where the social motivation and ease of use comes in. If we believe we should retain and develop a clear sense of our own identity now and in the future we will try to undertake and adopt a policy which will bring an improvement in the spoken use of the Irish language over a long period.  A great deal of future development in this regard will depend on our own sincerity and on the example which those of us in public affairs, and in leadership in many other areas of life are willing to give.  In so far as the Minister is making genuine efforts in this regard he will have my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for the opportunity of speaking in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate which we have before us is a very large one accounting for £126.25 million, £18.75 million more than last year.  It is fundamentally important so far as all of us are concerned.  The large number of Deputies seeking to contribute to the debate is an indication of the increasing interest in education throughout the country.  As far as those of us who are Members of this House are concerned, it is right that so many of us should seek to express our particular interest in education. It is through the educational system that the ideals that brought many of us into public life will be achieved. It is through that system that equality of opportunity for all citizens will be achieved and that we can enable people to live a good life and to have <Col N="663" /> personal fulfilment.  It is through this system that attitudes and prejudices will be eradicated and the stage set for better progress in the future.  Our industrial life will also advance through education.  Through education we will have peace and harmony in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no need to say that education is a priority.  In his Estimate speech the Minister enumerated some of his priorities.  I have no intention of delving into every aspect of the Minister's speech at this stage.  I was happy to find that in relation to school buildings he has allocated an additional £5 million this year.  His prime concern is that the needs of rapidly developing areas should be attended to.  This is important for me in the area I represent. In the constituency of Mid-Cork there are rapidly developing communities. There are satellite towns where the pressure on existing school facilities is very great.  Such areas are Ballincollig, Carrigaline and the environment of Cork city generally.  In Ballincollig the population has increased eightfold in a period of four years.  There are 1,000 children under four years of age there and the clamour for additional educational facilities in that area is great.  I hope that the Minister will receive a deputation from that area in the near future in connection with the educational services and buildings in the area generally.  I am confident that he will be convinced of the justice of the case they will have to make.  My own town, Carrigaline, is in a similar position.  Unless action towards the provision of accommodation is taken quickly we will have a crisis situation in a short time.</P>
    <P>The school transport system is transporting 143,000 students each day, 32,000 more than last year.  This was a tremendous innovation and we give all credit to the Minister who introduced it, but it is valid to state at this stage that the system needs reformation and needs to be expanded.  The volume of representations which we in rural areas have to make in this regard is quite phenomenal.  There is a clamour for expansion of the service.  The grievances that exist with regard to it <Col N="664" /> are very numerous.  As far as the average parent is concerned there exists a maze of regulations.  We are familiar with them and know the system but to the average parent they are quite incomprehensible. All the average parent knows is that he or she does not want a child to have to walk several miles along a lonely road.  The parent is concerned for the child's health and for a child's safety in regard to traffic and otherwise.  I do not blame parents.  I have a ten-year-old child who is lucky enough to live within a few hundred yards of her school, but if she had to walk one-and-a-half or two miles along a country road I would be worried. What I want for my own child I want for all children.  It is important that the Minister should review, expand and improve the school transport system.  It needs improvement, particularly in so far as it caters for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>There are such children in County Cork and we are very lucky in that we have fairly adequate facilities for the education of mentally handicapped children.  Those children are picked up at very far flung points throughout the country on Monday morning and deposited back on Friday evening. Many of them are asked to travel distances of up to 12 miles to the pickup points.  Some parents have no private transport and, even in cases where they have, the father must take the family car to his place of employment. The result is increased hardship on already heavily burdened families.  I would appeal to the Minister to apply the system as leniently as he can in the case of mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>I am very heartened by the research work that has been undertaken in regard to disadvantaged or underprivileged children.  This is a very complex problem.  It involves the family of the child and indeed the attitudes in the community from which the child comes.  Of course, it is a vicious circle.  Such attitudes are very often hardened by the attitude of people outside that community towards those who live within.  We all know the employer who fails to employ otherwise suitably educated and trained personnel <Col N="665" /> because they come from a particular address.  Such snobbery is despicable, but it exists and it embitters those discriminated against to the point when many of them believe there is no use in trying.  While it is a question of changing attitudes within the deprived community, we must also ensure that many of those who are privileged change their attitude to them.  It is an enormous problem, but its solution is basic to the building of a society where there is equality of opportunity.  We are all indebted to all concerned with the Rutland Street experiment.  I hope that all the dedicated work that has gone into it by teachers, by psychologists, by social workers and all others concerned, will produce something that can be utilised to effect in other areas.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear Deputy Power in this year of 1973, with all the evidence we have that we should not encourage violence, advocating the use of the cane in schools.  Above all else, I deplore institutionalised violence.  I disagree totally with Deputy Power on this matter.</P>
    <P>The democratisation of education is something to which the Minister referred.  The involvement of parents at all levels is a welcome development. At second level, the community school is the ideal because of its wide-ranging educational and recreational facilities, and because of its potential to involve people.  It is the answer particularly to the problems of the new communities.  There will be a big clamour within these communities for the establishment of community schools.  In those schools the continuing process of education can be dealt with, the problem of the married woman whose skills are obsolete or who because of the attitude towards women when she was at school, has no skill at all.  Through those establishments she can be fitted into the work force to have a full and complete life when her children are reared.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister cannot make money and all this will cost a great deal, but the country and this House must decide to make available increasing amounts for education. <Col N="666" /> Where community schools cannot be provided every effort must be made, and is being made, to bring about co-operation between existing facilities. We must ensure that the things that are lacking will be provided in these areas.  I have in mind particularly the position in vocational schools, where expansion will not take place because of rationalisation.  In some of those schools facilities for pupils and teachers are pretty primitive.  I know that, in many of the vocational schools I have had occasion to visit teachers work in conditions in which people would not normally be expected to work by the standards that apply to workers generally today.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who have referred to career guidance.  This is vital.  I know there is the practical problem of having enough people trained for this service and I know that you cannot bring into operation over-night a service of any kind.  At the moment in many cases parents are completely at sea in trying to plan the education of their children at any level.  They are not sure whether to send them to secondary schools or to vocational schools.  In Cork city, the entrance examinations for all the schools in the city area are held on the same day.  Parents must choose some school and, due to the competition, it is inevitable that many of them will not get admission to the school they choose.  They have no second choice.  The result is panic and confusion.  Things sort themselves out somehow and there is no question of a pupil not finding a place in some educational establishment, but there is no advice for such parents, no coordinating system, no guidance.  As a result there must be many square pegs in round holes, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>If the children go to vocational schools they do their group certificates and the guidance in this area seems to be pretty good.  AnCO is doing a very good job and making good advances in this area.  I do not think that so far the same advances are being made in the secondary schools counterparts. Other speakers mentioned this yesterday.  There is a <Col N="667" /> hectic frenzy.  Secondary school children are urged on by parents and school authorities to secure as many honours as they can in their intermediate certificate.  The Minister implied in his speech that he is aware that the introduction of the system of grades has not really caught on. The question still is how many honours you got in your intermediate certificate.</P>
    <P>Then the pupils go into fifth year and they are really high and dry.  The frenzy and the excitement of the intermediate certificate are over and now the pupils have to decide where their aptitudes really lie, what subjects they should drop, and what subjects they should pursue further, what is essential in which faculty, and what is essential for which job.  We should all do something to remedy the wastage and the frustration and the lack of guidance before next year.</P>
    <P>I know that many efforts are made, UCC, the university with which I am most familiar, tries to provide some form of guidance for the secondary schools in the catchment area through a system of lectures.  Some of the schools do not avail of this service or of any other service and I suppose in other areas the service may not be available to the schools.  Certainly many schools have no guidance whatsoever available for the pupils.  The Minister is probably much more alert to that problem than I am.  From my own limited experience of it I would appeal to him to treat this as a matter of priority because it is creating a lot of wastage, a lot of frustration and injustice.</P>
    <P>Before I leave second level education I want to mention two other matters which merit mention.  One is the system of free books for necessitous pupils.  The idea was that decisions on allocations would be left to the school principal or manager. The system is haphazard at best. Schools seem to apply different criteria.  Some schools use the medical card as the yardstick.  Others restrict the scheme to pupils whose parents are not working or to one-parent pupils.  It has come to my knowledge <Col N="668" /> that two or three children in the same family have all been treated differently in the provision of free school books by virtue of the fact that they were attending different schools all within the one community.  Some schools provide free books up to a set figure, such as £5, or what have you.  I believe that the system should be scrapped as soon as it is practicable to do so.  It creates &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; in a system in which we are trying to bring about equality in our society.</P>
    <P>The other matter is the system of the purchase of school books at the beginning of each school year.  I will never forget the long queues outside the bookshop in Cork city&mdash;and I expect Dublin was worse&mdash;at the commencement of the school year last September.  As a parent I joined several of those queues at different times.  For quite some time I could not stick it out until I got to the book counter.  When I finally got to the book counter 50 per cent of what I wanted either had not come in at all or had been sold out and was being reprinted.  Surely there must be a better system.  Surely the list could be issued to the parents or to the schools in advance of school opening. Surely the books could be available in the shops in advance of the school opening to avoid all this chaos. Pending the time when all pupils will have free books available to them this system should be streamlined.  Surely something could be done to eliminate the chaos and frustration and the clamour for books at the beginning of the school year.</P>
    <P>At third level the entrance qualification for pupils whose intelligence and monetary background qualify them for grants should be put on a par with those who, because they have enough money, need no such qualifications.  I know that £469,500 extra was spent on higher education grants this year and it was good to see the grants being gradually extended to the more technical subjects and pursuits.</P>
    <P>The problem of overcrowding in certain faculties in our universities is a very big one requiring a huge infusion of funds, funds of a magnitude which I know is not readily available.  I note <Col N="669" /> in the Minister's speech that plans for UCC where large overcrowding exists have been approved, but there is no indication as to when this work will start and some relief given.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some indication of when this work might get under way. Like Deputy Burke who raised the question of the Cork Dental Hospital, I want to say that this is a vital question for us in County Cork.  Deputy Wyse will probably have more to add on that subject.  An assurance from the Minister on that question would be very gratifying indeed.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of education with which I could deal but many of them have been dealt with by other Deputies and I do not want to delay the House further.  I join with the expressions of good wishes to the Minister and I share the confidence expressed in this House in the past two days in his capacity and in his commitment to education.  I know that because of the backlog of work to be done on the social services generally, and the demands such services will make on the available funds, the Minister cannot progress at the pace he would progress at if the money were available to him. I am very confident that education will receive its due from this Government and from this Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to avoid any repetition but having listened to the many contributions made, it will be difficult to avoid some repetition.</P>
      <P>Education is the concern of all. Everyone has a part to play to ensure that we reach perfection in our educational policy.  Structures and approaches to education change.  It is important that the Minister and his officials be prepared at all times to consult the many interests in this field.  I am glad that the Minister feels that, with the co-operation and guidance of all those best qualified to participate in the work, a system may be evolved which will be in keeping with the needs and aspirations of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in his office.  I have no doubt he will dedicate himself to this work.  I should also like to pay a tribute to his predecessor on his efforts and his dedication <Col N="670" /> to his duties as Minister for Education. Everyone will agree that he built a structure for a very comprehensive educational policy.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on his lengthy and comprehensive brief. A notable absence which has been referred to by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, was that no mention was made of the building of a dental school in Cork. This is hard to understand when the Minister laid so much emphasis in his brief on higher education.  It may be that the Minister has his own views and is not permitted at this stage to express them.  However, I should like to put before the Minister some facts on this matter.</P>
    <P>First, the decision of the Higher Education Authority not to have a dental school in Cork was made without proper assessment of the situation and without prior consultation with members of the dental association. With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should like to quote from an address, published by the Irish Dental Association, and given by Dr. Stanley Thornton, LDSI, president of the Irish Dental Association, at a public meeting held at the Metropole Hotel, Cork, on Monday, 8th January, 1973:</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise at this point that at no time is it suggested that a Cork Dental School should be retained at the expense of the loss of a School in Dublin.  No&mdash; our well-considered argument is that Ireland needs two Dental Schools&mdash; one in Dublin and one in Cork. One to accommodate, teach and provide facilities for the profession in the eastern and northern parts of Ireland and the Cork School to provide similar facilities for the population of Munster and the western counties of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have heard the Minister say that he would consult with the various interests where higher education is concerned.  I hope he will not entertain for one minute a submission made by the Higher Education Authority on this very important aspect of higher education without at least making a very thorough investigation into it.  There <Col N="671" /> was always a dental school in Cork, and a very efficient one too.  If by chance the Minister's decision is against the erection of this dental school it will mean a falling off in that faculty.</P>
    <P>I am not putting up a case for Cork against Dublin.  The Minister also knows that there is a demand for two dental schools in this country. Our population is increasing every year, more so in the southern and western countries.  I asked the Minister to make an immediate decision on this, keeping in mind the costs of building.  A delay at this stage would be fatal and would increase considerably the original estimate for the school.  I am sure the Minister is also aware that the university authorities in Cork acquired a ten-acre site where the new regional hospital is being built.  Surely this must be a further incentive to the Minister to make his decision.  I appeal to him to come to grips with the Higher Education Authority and finalise this all-important aspect of higher education.</P>
    <P>Reformatory and industrial schools are best referred to as special schools. I should like to pay tribute to both the religious and the lay teachers for the tremendous work they are doing in these schools.  Their dedication and understanding of the problems should be admired.  Recently I visited a special school in Dublin and was most impressed by the activities there.  I cannot help wondering if the teachers' work and efforts are of any avail. When the boys leave these schools they return to the same environment which was, in most cases, the cause of their trouble.  When boys or girls leave a special school they have every intention of mending their ways but they need help, guidance and encouragement. We have failed in a follow-up service for these young people.  I would ask the Minister to review the whole position because without this follow-up service, guidance, advice and encouragement after leaving the special school we know that the boy will sooner or later return merely to a more restrictive school. <Col N="672" /> I have seen it.  I have seen young boys and girls in a desperate way because their home life amounted to nothing. Young people must be guided. Teachers in school cannot be expected to give the amount of time required to such young people.  Therefore I ask the Minister to review the whole position now.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the provision of an additional £40,000 for the extension of aid to youth and sporting organisations.  I was most disappointed, and I am sure many sporting organisations and youth groups throughout the country were disappointed, at this announcement.  This amount of additional money is not sufficient for this essential service. The development of sport and youth activities is a very important aspect of education.  There is too much lip service in regard to this matter and little or no practical help.  Many people who devote their time and energies to the provision of these facilities are at their wits end in devising means of keeping the services going and in trying to improve the services.  Whatever money is available to the Minister should be spent in this direction.</P>
    <P>I was going to ask the Minister by way of Parliamentary Question to make an allocation of at least £20,000 to the National Council for Community Games.  This is a council that organises sport for thousands of children all over the country to participate in every year.  The Minister knows how important it is to instil in the minds of children a love of sport.  This should start at a very young age.  If we are not prepared to spend the money now in building up a love for this kind of recreation in young children it would be pointless to promote that kind of recreation for them at a later age.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Community Games was founded only in recent years.  They provided means, for the first time, for children to compete in sport.  There was a certain amount of neglect in the past in regard to this matter.  Clubs catered for children from nine years of age to 15 years. Their neglect to cater for younger <Col N="673" /> children showed a forgetfulness of the future of their clubs.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and to give at least the amount I have mentioned, £20,000 a year, for the National Council for Community Games in order that they may cater for the thousands of children who desire to participate in the type of sport that they provide.  I am not being critical of the Minister's effort.  I am making the case because I have experience of the frustrations of all those who are promoting sport.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to youth leadership courses.  I often wonder if we really understand the problem in this respect.  Who is to organise youth leadership courses?  I would ask the Minister to organise youth work courses for professional workers at university level.  By doing so he would make available to youth clubs and to schools full-time youth workers who would be able to advise and direct those involved in youth activities.  This should be a top priority in the Minister's policy.  There should be university courses so that at a later stage the qualified personnel could organise and train people as youth leaders.  It would be a great thing if in every city and county there were at least four full-time youth workers.  The voluntary effort is there but it is not sufficient to meet the needs.  Trained personnel must be available.  We could talk here for the next year and it would be of no avail unless properly trained personnel were available for work in the field.</P>
    <P>I would appeal very strongly to the Minister to consider the provision of full-time courses in universities.  The persons taking these courses would then be available to the thousands of youth clubs in the country and would be able to direct and advise the many organisations, including schools, in this matter.  School children must have some place of recreation to which they can go at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. after school, a place where the branch of sport in which they are interested is properly organised.  That is why I make this very special appeal to the Minister to give this matter every consideration.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to the employment of mentally handicapped <Col N="674" /> persons.  I would endorse everything that has been said.  I deplore the lack of involvement of industrialists in this great work.  They have an important part to play with the many voluntary organisations throughout the country who are involved in this work.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>Increases in prices of cattle and pig meals depend on variations in costs of ingredients, of labour and of overheads.  The increases in ingredient costs are reviewed quarterly by the National Prices Commission, who recommend price increases only if they are fully justified to compensate for unavoidable cost increases under the headings of cereals and proteins.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers' cost increases under the headings of wages and overheads are reviewed periodically by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no purpose in changing the existing system for the review of animal feedstuff prices because, if there <Col N="675" /> are substantial increases in manufacturers' costs, compensatory price increases must be granted to the firms concerned if they are to remain in business.  Neither do I see any purpose in establishing a commission on the lines suggested by the Deputy. The National Prices Commission are widely representative of different interests and already have, or can obtain, the necessary expertise to carry out an examination in depth of any price proposals where warranted.</P>
    <P>I am unable to say what increases are likely to occur in the prices of feeding stuffs in the next six months, as any such increases would depend on the scale of compounders' cost increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>On 4th October, 1973, the Government Information Bureau announced on my behalf the establishment of a committee which will be known as the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee. I did this in accordance with the recommendation in the Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry on Motor Insurance for the establishment of a representative board which, among other things, would advise me on motor insurance premium rates.  The immediate function of the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee will be to advise me on motor insurance rates on the basis of statistics collected and analysed by them, but early consideration will be given to whether the committee should ultimately be given a more formal existence and should assume the other functions recommended for it in the report of the Committee of Inquiry.  I am hopeful that motor insurance rates recommended by the new committee on a scientific basis will lead to a motor premium structure which is fair to both insurers and insured alike.  I understand that the first meeting of the new committee will take place during this week.</P>
      <P>Other recommendations of the Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry involve changes of a far-reaching nature affecting the legal basis of liability and insurance, and require detailed examination.  I shall make my decision on these known in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that problems and difficulties are being created for insured persons as a result of the discontinuation of motor insurances by the company I have in mind and would he take special cognisance of the situation in his own Department?  I am aware that there is a committee in the Department of Local Government who deal with such matters but there is some urgency in regard to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="677" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the problem is difficult.  It is difficult from the point of view of insurers, some of whom, I think, are unwilling on a profit basis to handle any new motor business or, indeed, to handle any more business at all.  The problem is difficult also from the point of view of the insured in so far as there are large premium increases.  The only way we can be certain of permitting premiums to be pitched at the right level is by the kind of detailed investigation that is being undertaken now.  The problem is acute and is one which I will bring to the attention of the committee as being in need of urgent solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the idea of ensuring that those who are engaged in insurance generally in this State will be obliged to take on all insurance and that they will not be allowed refuse that which they do not like and seek only that which they consider to be most profitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Motor Premium Advisory Committee has been set up as a result of the interim report on the insurance industry as a whole.  I have not yet received the remainder of that report. The question is one to which the Committee of Inquiry will address themselves but, of course, they will be inquiring into the insurance industry as a whole.  I would prefer to await the remainder of their report before expressing an opinion, but I understand and agree with the sense of the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state what guarantees or protection can be afforded to a person who is refused insurance cover by all companies? Can he say also whether the Government have given consideration to the possibility of national motor insurance, that is, an insurance industry controlled by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the second question first&mdash;the Government have not done this currently but I assume that public participation in insurance <Col N="678" /> will be one of the questions examined and reported on when the final report of the Committee of Inquiry comes to hand.  Regarding the first part of the query, the Deputy will be aware that there is a committee in the Department of Local Government which does its utmost to place insurance for people who have difficulty in obtaining cover and who make representations either directly or to their Deputies or to my Department.  We pass any such inquiries to the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>There are a number of people experiencing difficulty in regard to insurance but the number who are finding it impossible to obtain cover is very small.  There are people in respect of whom a refusal is justified but the problem in a form as acute as the Deputy cites is very small. However, we have been able to overcome the problems in the vast majority of cases by reference to the office operated by the Department of Local Government.</P>

I want to ask the Minister by way of supplementary question if instead of waiting for any watch-dog commission or any report he should not treat this as a matter of urgency&mdash; the taking of action in relation to the basic cause of increased insurance, that is, the inflated costs when accidents take place and the abnormal awards which are being made and which, when balanced against the premium income, give the appearance of justification for the excessive premiums being charged. Surely the Minister should take some action to see that this racket which is going on&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister is he not aware, as all Deputies must be aware, that in an accident case in which insurance is involved the person concerned is a very <Col N="680" /> welcome customer in a garage because the awards made in court by juries are far in excess of anything that would be justified in most cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sentiment the Deputy has expressed.  It is one that is widely held.  I am not certain it is one that is validly held. To put it another way, it may be true in some cases but not in others.  On the other hand, I appreciate that the question he has raised is a real one and I undertake that either through the mechanism of the committee just set up or possibly of the National Prices Commission, who can function fairly quickly, we will look at the matter of the range of charges for repairs in motor accident cases.  It is a valuable suggestion which I would be happy to implement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>The terms of reference of the new Motor Premiums Advisory Committee are to advise me on motor insurance premium rates on the basis of statistics collected and analysed by that committee.  As the new committee have not yet had their first meeting&mdash;although I understand they will be meeting within a fortnight&mdash;it would be premature to fix a time scale for a report at this early stage.  I propose to convey to the committee when they meet my anxiety that they should press ahead urgently with their task in the hope that the present difficulties in relation to motor insurance, which are causing dissatisfaction to both the companies and to the public alike, will be alleviated.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would urge this committee, or if he would be prepared to urge them, to take a very broad interpretation of their terms of reference, and if he would favour the introduction of a State system of motor insurance in view of the chaotic private enterprise system we have at the moment&mdash;a system similar to social insurance and to the motor taxation system?  Would he have any thoughts along these lines and if so <Col N="682" /> would they come within the ambit of the committee?  I am asking the Minister if he thinks such a radical change as I have suggested is needed at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister in reference to the meeting of this committee whether he might consider it worthwhile to bring to their attention the manner in which penalty clauses seem to be operated at a time when there is a no claim bonus coming into being?  In other words, the penalties are there but there is no enticement worth mentioning for the accident-free driver at a time when the penalty clauses are going up and up.  Would the Minister make some arrangement in this regard which might be operated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly pass on to the committee on motor premiums the observations of Deputies.  In regard to the question of State participation in the insurance industry, Deputies will be aware that apart from the committee just established there is an existing committee investigating into the whole insurance industry and we have acted on the head of an interim report from that committee on motor business.  I am waiting their final report in regard to the insurance industry as a whole.  I think the question Deputy Desmond raised will certainly be considered in that final report.  I should prefer not to go into any further detail until we see what is stated in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>In the further discussions the Minister is having with the committee whose interim report he is considering, would he draw their attention to the fact that the country has now developed an effective system of national occupational injuries and the broadening of our social insurance system, and that the committee should take congnisance of the major developments in health, in occupational injury schemes and in social insurance?  Indeed, I think many of the private enterprise insurance companies would be only too glad to hand over to the State a rational system of motor insurance.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the whole object of seeking an interim report from this committee on motor insurance was to do something positive about motor insurance, a subject which affects so many people, as Deputy O'Connell has said?  There were a number of recommendations in that interim report concerning some of the points raised by Deputy Brennan which could have been acted on.  Why does the Minister now say that he cannot act on that first report, which had been sought so that something could be done about it?  Why has it been left over? Can the Minister give any assurance that there is any semblance of truth in the suggestion that the insurance committee can possibly bring in a final report by the end of this year?  I do not believe one word of it?</P>

      <P>Without any reflection on the committee or on the Department of Local Government, would it not be better to have this committee under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce? The work being done is more involved with industry and commerce.  There should be more speedy action than there has been.  Again I wish to say I do not mean to reflect on that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> In regard to the committee specifically on motor insurance premiums which has been set up, that is precisely the major action that was urged by the interim report on the insurance industry. The first meeting of this committee is within the week and it is the task of this committee to bring forward urgently the actions which I believe will solve this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of mine prospecting licences issued by his Department since 1953; and the number implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 1,635 prospecting licences have been granted since 1953.  In his reference to licences implemented, I assume the Deputy has in mind those licences under which prospecting was carried out.  Holders of prospecting licences are required to carry out work <Col N="688" /> programmes, to incur minimum expenditure on such programmes and to submit reports of the work done to me.  Some degree of exploration, varying from reconnaissance surveys to detailed drilling, has been carried out under all licences granted.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a precise figure for expenditure on exploration since legislation giving effect to the tax exemption was enacted in 1956.  It is estimated, however, that expenditure on exploration, so far unsuccessful, during this period was of the order of £5 million.  In the case of viable discoveries, exploration continues to be carried out after the making of the initial discovery during the development period and subsequent to the commencement of production.  Statements issued by the companies which have made viable discoveries indicate that some £38 million have been spent on the exploration and development of these discoveries.  I have no information as to the proportion of this amount spent on exploration work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that my estimate of £50 million being spent on exploration is the approximate sum and, indeed, a modest estimate.  In view of that, would the Minister not agree that there was no need for the indecent haste with which he acted to dishonour the agreement of the previous Government in relation to tax concessions on mining?  The Minister was not yet on the losing side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish people were on the losing side if we had not changed that scandalous tax exemption. There was no indecent haste and the Deputy will find himself on the losing side if he tries to endorse the continuance of a totally unjustifiable tax exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the impact of the removal of the concessions has hit the small investor who, in fact, bulged the pockets of the prospectors?  Is the Minister aware that they will lose as a result of the concession going rather than those who should in fact lose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="689" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy concurs with my opinion that they should never have had it.  If one follows the share prices, there is a very realistic assessment by the stock market which is that there has been a certain fall in the value of some shares but not an enormous fall.  The objective of this is to put back some balance and reason into the relationship between the Irish State, representing the Irish people on the one side, and the mining interests on the other side.  We now have that reasonable balance and I think that people who invested as pure speculation may get their fingers burned but people who made a serious investment and are prepared to stay with it will see that the companies are left in a circumstance where reasonable profits commensurate with their profits in other similar countries can be obtained and they will obtain not perhaps, a speculator's return but a reasonable return on their investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that what he now refers to as a &ldquo;scandalous practice&rdquo; could hardly be justified in view of the figures he has given?  The State has received many millions more than it has lost in any tax so far.  Does he not agree that there were many other ways and means by which he could recoup for the State a fair share of the mining profits without dishonouring a solemn undertaking given by the previous Government?</P>

      <P>I find a certain amount of amusement in the mock indignation of Deputy Andrews because I inherited a cumbersome arrangement with regard to restrictive practices which I am endeavouring to simplify.  I set that mechanism in motion on 8th June, 1973.  The mechanism, of which Deputy Andrews is probably not aware but should be, is that the matter is referred to the examiner of restrictive practices.  He reported back to me on 17th September and the mechanism is such that his report, under the arrangements of the previous Government, goes to the Commission on Restrictive Practices, where it is now.  With the mechanism <Col N="693" /> I inherited, I initiated procedures on 8th June to end this.  Similar efforts, as the Deputy will be aware, encountered severe legal difficulties in Britain, where the same problem exists.  This problem cannot be eliminated with a stroke of the pen.  However, I am pushing forward those procedures as rapidly as possible and I will act as soon as I get a clear recommendation on them.</P>

      <P>There is no control at present of aerosols in general, and no serious complaints have been received from the public about hazards arising from their use.</P>
      <P>The EEC are in the course of preparing a directive on the harmonisation of legislation on aerosols.  There are many technical considerations to be taken into account at international level and pending the completion of the EEC directive it would be premature to introduce separate regulations in this country.</P>
      <P>Control of therapeutic substances contained in aerosols is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Health and the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
      <P>I understand that the National Drugs Advisory Board in co-operation with the pharmaceutical companies have taken steps to guard against overdosage of asthma sufferers due to the use of aerosols.  These steps include cautionary labelling of the aerosols and drawing to the notice of dispensing chemists the importance of adequately instructing patients in the proper use of the aerosols and the broncho-dilators contained in them.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have seen a report in the newspapers of a death resulting from the use of an aerosol, not necessarily a pharmaceutical aerosol.  The aerosol was sold freely over the counter and it caused freezing of the lung tissue and the death of the person.  Would the Minister not consider ensuring that warnings are put on all aerosols to ensure they are not used in enclosed spaces?  This should apply to all aerosols, irrespective of whether they are used for pharmaceutical purposes or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly bring what the Deputy has said to the notice of the relevant authority in my Department. I should point out that the aerosol manufacturers are members of the Federation of European Aerosol Manufacturers.  This federation operates a code of practice to which its members conform.  It publishes a <Col N="695" /> monthly bulletin regarding its operations. I recognise that there is a difficulty here but I want to make it clear that it is not a difficulty of which we are unaware, and it is not a difficulty on which there is indifference. If the code of practice needs tightening&mdash;and I think there is now very significant evidence that it does need tightening&mdash;I will certainly press for that to be done.</P>

      <P>This Directive, which has not yet been discussed in the Council, is designed to remove technical obstacles to trade and to protect the consumer.  It applies to natural yeasts and yeast residues intended for human consumption, or for use in industry.  It lays down special conditions in regard to the composition of baker's yeast.  It establishes, also, relatively severe restrictions from the bacteriological and toxicological points of view.  Finally, detailed requirements are specified as to the packaging, labelling and marketing of the products concerned.</P>

The difficulty about pollution &mdash;and there is a difficulty&mdash;is that to respond to it properly involves the work of many Departments.

      <P>I understand that since its establishment in May, 1973, 450 firms from the member states have contacted the EEC Business Co-Ordination Centre with a view to forming links with other firms in the Community. I am not aware of any mergers or partnerships formed as a result of the operations of the centre.  The negotiations would take place directly between the firms concerned.</P>

Secondly, I believe that the newsletter of the Confederation of Irish Industries carried a section on it and some of the other periodicals that are concerned with business and business pages of newspapers.  Of course, the information is available if people contact the Department and wish to use this European level marriage bureau for business enterprises.  It is arguable that expenditure of public money on the taking of space in newspapers to publicise something like this, which had got a fair amount of coverage through the media anyway, would not be a useful expenditure of that money.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 to 53 together.</P>
      <P>St. Benedict's national school, Grange Park, Raheny, is a new school, the erection of which was completed, to the present stage, in 1972.  Sanction has now been given for the extension of the school by the addition of a large general purposes room.  The Commissioners of Public Works, as my architectural advisers on national school buildings, have been asked for a report on the allegations that the building was not completed in accordance with specifications and on the other suggestions that the building and its surroundings are unsatisfactory in their present state.  When this report is received, such action as may be considered appropriate will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the provision of play shelters, it is not the practice to provide grants towards the cost of such amenities at schools in which general purposes <Col N="712" /> rooms are provided.  I do not accept the implication that the absence of play shelters must necessarily cause serious dislocation in the running of a school.  Many large schools without such amenities are conducted quite efficiently.</P>
    <P>Grants from national school building funds are not made in respect of the cost of putting into suitable condition playfields adjoining schools, and I regret that I cannot make an exception in the case of this particular school. The case of laying down an adequate area of play space in tarmacadam or concrete has been included in the overall figure of cost on which the grant for this school was based.</P>

      <P>It was decided in 1967 to replace the very old and unsuitable Ballyroe and Shanganamore (Barrowhouse) school buildings by a new central school to be erected at Ballyroe.  It was expected that Shanganamore would have been closed as from the date of the commencement of the Christmas vacation, 1972. Arrangements for the staffing of the central school were made in 1972 and CIE were requested to arrange the transport service to the new school as from January, 1973.  Because of a delay in completing the building, the <Col N="714" /> date of the opening of the school was subsequently postponed to 1st July, 1973.</P>

      <P>Plans are being made to build new schools in Dodsboro' and these will cater, <i>inter alia</i>, for children from the Arthur Griffith Park estate.  In the meantime, there are over 100 children of primary school age from this estate attending the primary schools in Lucan, where there is accommodation for them.</P>
      <P>In the normal way these children could travel by CIE scheduled service but the link road to the estate is not yet finished and CIE are not prepared to provide the normal city service until it is finished and can take double-decker buses.  In the meantime, as a temporary measure, the Department are prepared to allow the provision of a special school bus at the same cost to the parents as an ordinary scheduled service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that the recent increase in bus fares for school children is a matter of concern for parents.  However, the Department of Education are paying a subsidy of £350,000 per annum to CIE in order to keep the fares of schoolgoing children, who are not eligible for free transport, at a reasonable level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the people in Dublin are being penalised. There is a very high concentration of schools in Dublin and most children in that area are within three miles of a secondary school.  It is only children in country areas who are not within three miles of a secondary school who are entitled to free transport. What is being done in Dublin is that the children are travelling on scheduled services regardless of whether they are going to the nearest school&mdash; in fact, they could travel right across the city&mdash;and are getting a subsidy in relation to the fare.  This is not available in the country areas, except where there is a special scheduled service.</P>

Above that level the increases have been substantially less; the increase is as low as 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>We have not asked at any time for a free school transport service to the third level institution in Letterkenny.  What we did ask for &mdash;and I am now asking the Parliamentary Secretary to say why he refused us&mdash;was that we should be enabled to utilise part of our all-too-scarce scholarship moneys to subsidise transport to bring to more students the benefits of third level education because of the dispersed nature of the catchment area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question does, in fact, ask for free transport and if he would look at the question he put down he would see that it does.  The second point is that moneys which are voted for scholarships are voted for scholarships and cannot be diverted to any other purpose.  We would be in trouble with the Committee of Public Accounts if we were to divert moneys in that way.</P>

There may be individual cases where difficulties have arisen for one reason or another: because there was a question of determining whether the child was suitable for admission to a school for the deaf, or because of the existence of a multiple handicap it was right that the child should be placed elsewhere. There would be delays in such cases. As to the existence of a global waiting list, I could not give the Deputy any information.  If he wishes to put down another question that would be helpful.</P>

Since it was held up in this House and since it was visible, at least to the Press Gallery, amongst others, that it was on Garda notepaper and that it was asserted by the then Leader of the Opposition that it was on Garda notepaper, how can any Minister stand over a Commissioner who would say that the Garda were not aware that any such thing had taken place and because no complaint was made about it they did not take any action?  Is the Minister not aware <Col N="741" /> that on at least two occasions in the past two years I asked the previous administration whether they had investigated this matter or intended to investigate it and, if so, with what results and nothing was done about it?

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Free legal aid is available in criminal proceedings under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, which came into operation on 1st April, 1965.  There is no statutory provision for the grant of legal aid in civil proceedings.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the 1962 Act provides for the grant of free legal aid at the various stages of criminal proceedings where the means of the person concerned are insufficient and either the trial is for murder or it appears to the court that by reason of the serious nature of the offence, or of exceptional circumstances, it is essential in the interests of justice that he should have legal aid.  The grant of legal aid entitles the applicant to the services of a solicitor and, where appropriate, counsel in the preparation and conduct of his defence or appeal, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1973 has, I am pleased to say, extended legal aid in two important respects.  First, it provides that legal aid will be available for the hearing in the court of sentence where the accused has been sent forward for sentence and for any subsequent appeal against sentence.  Secondly, it provides that legal aid will be available for all preliminary examinations in the District Court.  Previously, legal aid for preliminary examinations was restricted to cases of murder.  Free legal aid is also provided in <i>habeas corpus</i> cases, under an informal arrangement between the Attorney General and the Minister for Finance, where the High Court or Supreme Court recommends the grant of legal aid.</P>

Can the law be changed so that he can enter the country with his wife.

They say he must have a licence or a permit to work in this country before he will be admitted.  Can anything be done to ensure that this woman sees her own husband in her own country?  In Britain, as the Minister will agree, when an English person marries a foreigner the foreigner automatically becomes a British subject by naturalisation. The same thing applies in the United States and in most EEC countries, but seemingly we are unique in Ireland in preventing this.</P>

    <P>96.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps he proposes to take in relation to the serious grievances of junior hospital doctors which have caused them to threaten strike action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I should set out in full the background to this issue.</P>
      <P>The present remuneration and conditions of service of junior hospital doctors are based on settlements reached in 1970, prior to the first national pay agreement.  In common with other grades of staff in the health services the junior hospital doctors have since got the salary increases provided for in this agreement and the 1972 national agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present annual rates of remuneration are as follows: (i) Intern, £1,959 (ii)  House Officer, from £2,143 to <Col N="757" /> £3,213; (iii)  Registrar, from £2,855 to £3,972.</P>
    <P>Interns are doctors provisionally registered by the Medical Registration Council who are doing an &ldquo;intern year&rdquo; before full registration.  House officers and registrars are fully registered doctors employed in hospitals.</P>
    <P>The conditions of service for junior hospital doctors are related to a rostering arrangement of being on duty and on call which was arrived at in 1971 by a working party in which representatives of junior hospital medical staff took part.  Such an arrangement is not unusual in the special circumstances of hospital services.  The position is similar in Britain where, very recently, revised arrangements were made whereby the hours of being on duty and on call are to be reduced from a total of 102 hours to 80 hours per week with effect from 1st July, 1974.  This latter figure compares to a figure of 70 hours per week for the junior hospital doctors in this country.</P>
    <P>In agreement with the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union, a claim made by them relating to salaries and conditions, but not to hours of duty, for junior hospital doctors was referred to an agreed arbitrator earlier this year.  Following the normal practice, written statements of claim and counter-statement were submitted to the arbitrator on 10th July and exchanged between the parties. The arbitrator then arranged an oral hearing with both sides on 26th July, 1973.  In his report, dated 21st September, 1973, the arbitrator found that the claim was not allowable within the terms of the national pay agreement. The rates sought at the arbitration hearing ranged from £2,417 for interns to £5,634 a year for registrars.</P>
    <P>The junior hospital doctors, following announcement of the arbitrator's decision, formed an &ldquo;action committee&rdquo; which produced a plan of action to press for improvements in their pay and conditions of service. This committee did not, however, formulate any specific claim which could be considered.  Under their action plan, hospital authorities were notified that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> 1.  from 15th October, the doctors would continue to work their normal roster but would claim for overtime payment for all hours in excess of 40 per week, and</P>
    <P>2.  in the event of no satisfactory conclusion to negotiations, doctors would, as from 1st November, work only a 40-hour week, from 9-5 p.m. on Monday to Friday.</P>
    <P>This plan was adopted at a meeting of the doctors on 3rd October.</P>
    <P>On 10th October, I met representatives of the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union, who had acted for the junior doctors in the earlier negotiations.  In the meantime, the Medical Union had submitted a claim, dated 3rd October, for a maximum standard working week of 40 hours with effect from October, 1973. No claim from the Irish Medical Association had been submitted at the time, but the association did submit a claim on 11th October.  This claim also asked for the implementation of a basic 40-hour week, to be operative from 15th October, 1973, and also sought a 10 per cent salary increase which was related to increases given to other categories of health board personnel, <i>et cetera</i>.  This claim also included proposals for overtime rates for hours in excess of 40 per week varying from time and a half up to treble time in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I had told the organisations at the meeting on 10th October that I would be prepared to arrange for negotiations on any new claims which they made and that such negotiations would be conducted expeditiously.  A meeting was accordingly arranged in the Department on 15th October. This was attended by representatives of the Department, the health boards, the voluntary hospitals and the two medical organisations.  A further meeting was held on 19th October. That meeting had before it a further claim from the Medical Union.  This was for a 10 per cent increase in salary, similar to that requested in the Irish Medical Association claim, for overtime rates varying from time and a quarter to double time, for living-out allowances, for superannuation scheme, for sick pay provisions, <Col N="759" /> for payment of the cost of a telephone in certain circumstances, for postgraduate teaching facilities and for &ldquo;a proper staffing and career structure within the hospital service.&rdquo; This claim was dated 18th October and the official representatives at the meeting pointed out that the three claims before them would obviously take some time to examine and that it was clear that negotiations could not be completed by 1st November.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that a smaller working group would be set up to examine the claims and report back to the larger meeting by 30th November, specifically on the remuneration aspects of them.  The official side stressed at all times that, in this examination, consideration could only be given by them to claims which would not contravene the national pay agreement.  A further meeting of junior doctors had been called for the evening of the 19th October.  In the light of the arrangements agreed expeditiously for negotiation of the claims, it was expected that the junior doctors would abandon or defer their &ldquo;action plan&rdquo;.  However, even though representatives who had taken part in the discussions made the position clear to them, I regret to inform the House that the meeting of doctors did not change their planned programme.</P>
    <P>The situation now is that the official side, as represented by my Department, the health boards and the voluntary hospitals, are in negotiation with the two organisations representing the junior doctors.  In fact, the first meeting of the group established for this purpose took place on 23rd instant and the next meeting is being held this afternoon.  Nevertheless, the threat of action by the junior doctors remains <Col N="760" /> and I have thought it prudent to take certain precautionary moves in relation to this.</P>
    <P>I have asked all hospital authorities employing junior doctors to examine the situation and take whatever steps they consider necessary to maintain essential and emergency services in the event of any of the doctors going ahead with their industrial action. I have also drawn the attention of the Medical Registration Council to the situation so that they may consider and advise on the implication of this matter for graduates in the course of the intern year.  I should explain that the completion to the satisfaction of the Council of that period of internship is a pre-requisite to full registration of a doctor.</P>
    <P>I would hope that special steps will not be necessary and that the junior doctors will realise that I have initiated action, and am seeing that action is continued, to give a fair examination to the claims which have been made on their behalf.  Within the constraints which the Government have accepted under the national pay agreement, the claims will be fully and objectively considered.  No action by the junior doctors can force me to do any more.  I, accordingly, would ask each of them to consider the full facts of this matter before taking a decision of possible grave consequence to the hospital services.</P>
