    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware, of the hardship and the financial loss involved for unemployed persons from Finglas, Dublin, who must travel to Gardiner Street; and if he will arrange that the persons in question will have suitable signing-on facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployed persons in Finglas are subject to the signing arrangements which obtain generally in the Dublin area, whereby persons residing within a radius of four miles from the employment exchange attend there twice weekly and those in the four-to-six miles range attend only once weekly.  These attendance requirements are not onerous and they are regarded as the minimum safeguard to ensure the fulfilment of the conditions for the receipt of unemployment payments and the prevention of abuses.</P>
      <P>The great majority of unemployed persons in the Finglas area at present are required to attend only once a week on the day on which they receive their weekly payments in cash from the exchange.  These would, therefore, get no advantage from the provision of local signing facilities as suggested.</P>
      <P>This is not in any case a matter which could be considered in isolation. Special facilities could not be granted to Finglas without recognising that all similar parts of the entire Dublin area would be entitled to equivalent treatment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why a person in County Cork (name supplied) was not paid social welfare benefit due to him from 24th August to 2nd November, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>The person concerned was awarded retirement pension on 23rd October, 1972, with effect from 24th August, 1972.  As the award was subject to offset of any amount paid to him after that date by way of unemployment benefit of which he had been in receipt, payment of pension commenced on 2nd November, 1972.  It is regretted that the fact that unemployment benefit had ceased to be paid to him after 19th August, 1972, was inadvertently overlooked.  Payment of all arrears due has now been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>In the case of local authority housing schemes, contractors are generally required to enter into bonds with insurance companies for the due performance of contracts.  Difficulties have arisen from time to time in obtaining these bonds.  I am having this problem examined in my Department to see what can be done.  When this examination, which includes a review of arrangements in other EEC countries, has been completed, I will decide what new measures can be taken.</P>
      <P>As regards private housing contracts, it is for the parties immediately concerned to decide whether the contract should include provision for a bond by the contractor for the proper completion of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the difficulties local authorities are encountering, I wonder would the Minister consider it wise to approach the Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company, or association, or whatever they are, to see if they could provide insurance or bonds for this type of contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the Deputy's suggestion considered, but I am sure he is aware that contractors usually know where to go themselves.  In some <Col N="1546" /> counties there are separate arrangements where a bond is accepted from the contractor himself.  The Wexford County Council are one of those. However, in large contracts it is not possible to do this and indeed in Wexford recently two schemes had to be readvertised, one of them because there was a down payment sought from the contractor which he could not meet.  I appreciate it is a problem and I will bring the matter to the notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware it is practically impossible for any builder to get a bond.  This, in turn, creates the added difficulty in the matter of competition for local authority housing?  Would the Minister take into account accepting personal bonds as distinct from the requirement to go to insurance companies for these bonds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that it is practically impossible.  There is quite a lot of building going on at the present time.  The trouble with personal bonds is that where small contractors are concerned a number of local authorities are prepared to do it but in cases of large contracts it would be impossible to produce the necessary money to give a personal bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are talking about larger contractors.  They seem to be able to get bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne would not seem to agree, as far as his county is concerned.  I agree but I said that smaller contractors are having a lot of difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider issuing some directive to local authorities to do away with bonds altogether, especially for smaller contracts?  He will agree it is desirable to have competition if possible in the tendering for local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to do that.  I am aware, as every public representative must be, of contracts which have not been completed by <Col N="1547" /> small contractors and somebody has to finish them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must also be aware that we are getting very few tenders for local authority houses because a lot of the small builders cannot get bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why local authority housing is attracting so few tenders is because of the tendency of local authorities to accept the lowest tender which is often so low that the successful tenderer cannot complete the job.  If a realistic price were tendered for the job, it might be possible to get a lot more contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10th May I replied to Deputy Colley, who had asked in relation to the figure of over 50 per cent if the Minister included in that agricultural land or purely dwellinghouses. I mentioned &ldquo;householders&rdquo;<Col N="1550" /> and therefore residential.  I said householders comprise the great majority of all ratepayers and that it is understood the amounts were more than 50 per cent of the total amount of rates paid.  That is not what Deputy Colley asked me about a few minutes ago.</P>

      <P>I referred the Minister to the reply he gave on 3rd May last and the reply given by his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Local Government said that the bulk of the money was in respect of relief for dwellinghouses and the Minister for Finance spoke about &ldquo;the lion's share&rdquo;.  Now, even with a bit of juggling with the figures, the best the Minister can say is &ldquo;about 50 per cent&rdquo;, which is the reply given to him by his civil servants but which he changed in the reply given on 10th May.  I am asking the Minister to explain the discrepancy.  Is it due either to the ignorance of the Ministers for Finance and Local Government about a very vital matter on which the Government made a major decision or is it because both Ministers tried to mislead the House?</P>

      <P>There are approximately 1,000 orders on hand from the Tallaght area of which 140 are having attention at present.  There is a shortage of equipment in the exchanges serving the area.  Additional equipment has been installed in recent months and a major new exchange for the area at present in course of installation is due to be opened about 12 months hence. A substantial amount of cabling work is necessary, mainly for the new housing estates in the area.  It will be a considerable time before the backlog of waiting orders is cleared but it is expected that the bulk of them will be attended to within 15 months.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there is a heavy concentration of <Col N="1563" /> industry and newly developed industrial estates in the area, many of them waiting for telephone services, will the Minister see that priority is given to this particular aspect?  Development in this area is being impeded for some time because of lack of telephone services.</P>

I understand that a lot will depend on the technical means used to provide the service and on the type of set being used, and that in some cases no extra expense may be involved, whereas in other cases a new set may be necessary.  For instance, if, as a first step towards an open broadcasting area, one Northern Ireland channel were rebroadcast on VHF it could be received on most people's present television sets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of the Minerals Development Act, 1940 (a) the total number of prospecting licences currently in force, (b) the number held by companies which are foreign controlled and (c) the number held by companies which are Irish controlled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Up to 30th April, 1970, a total of 1,078 prospecting licences were granted to foreign controlled companies where as yet no economic discovery has been disclosed; 465 such licences are still currently valid.</P>
      <P>The number of prospecting licences currently in force is 829; 807 are held by companies which are foreign controlled: the remaining 22 are held by companies which are Irish controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particulars of these licences other than those issued since 1st January, 1973, are set out in the half-yearly reports laid before the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 and <Col N="1572" /> 1960.  Fifty-eight licences were granted since 1st January, 1973, of which 53 are held by foreign controlled companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether or not he is happy with the situation in which so many foreign controlled companies are holding so many licences at the moment and, indeed, for extended periods, and if he would think that there may be a danger that here one could get foreign companies gathering in these licences, adopting a dog-in-the-manager attitude and precluding Irish companies&mdash;I hope the Government will interest themselves in mining&mdash;from exploiting or exploring these potential minerals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in this area, but I would point out to him the time scale over which these licences have been issued: for example, I instanced the total number up to 30th April, 1970. This is something long in the past and, unless one is to undermine one's credibility very much with the international mining community, one cannot make lighthearted alterations to commitments already entered into. That applies to the vast majority of licences.  But I share the Deputy's interest. This is an area that has to be examined carefully.  It is also an area in which one has to be able to call on the expertise, both technical and financial, of some of the international companies.  It is a question of getting the balance right, getting expertise and capital and outlets, on the one hand, and protecting the national interest on the other hand.  It is an area we are examining.  As I said, I share the concern the Deputy expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I would not be expecting at all that the Government should in any way dishonour commitments already existing, but I would be hoping that they would, having regard to the knowledge we have now and the fact that capital seems to be available at home, amend legislation so that we would not get a continuation of what occurred in the past.</P>

Does the Minister have available to him in his brief anything to indicate the amount of money spent by the different categories of licence-holders to which he has referred in his reply?  May I also ask the Minister if one can assume from the fact that a <Col N="1574" /> number of the licences have been renewed from year to year over a fairly long period that the licence-holders in question have, in fact, performed reasonably to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are matters of detail in the Deputy's question, the replies to which are not in my brief. The Deputy is factually correct in regard to the one-year renewal.  Some licences are renewed for a year at a time but not all of them.  There are other sorts of licences also.  It might be better if another question was put down.</P>

It was in that situation that the mining programme was built up.  Is the Minister aware that it is only because of the success of foreign enterprise that Irish investors are now taking an interest in mining?</P>

There are two possible reasons which occur to one: one is that a high wall serves to keep people out, and the other is that it serves to keep people in.  Experience has shown in the past that high walls do not necessarily safeguard the schools.  The Department are not aware that complaints have been received about the safety of the children.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to illustrate on Thursday evening that my remarks were not made from the point of view of a financial expert.  They would approximate to the plain person's view, and possibly that is a good thing.  Many of the criticisms I would level at the budget would be levelled by the ordinary, plain person in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a serious allegation&mdash; possibly it was not intended as an allegation, maybe it was intended in a facetious manner, but he made a remark which was construed in <Col N="1607" /> different ways throughout the country. He mentioned the £29 million which we had promised over a year ago would be saved because we did not have to bolster up agricultural produce for sale abroad and we said that this would be channelled towards social welfare benefits.  When the Minister was asked what had become of that money he said that it had vanished or it was lost in a sea of inflation. He may have intended that as a glib cliché but many people have not analysed it as such and believe that Fianna Fáil went on a big spending spree before the new Government got into office and spent this £29 million and that it was not there when the new Government took office.  The Minister should disabuse the electorate of that false impression.  He should correct his own supporters, too, who are claiming that as a fact throughout the country.  We have been in the EEC since only 1st January.  It is only from that time we would have started to save this £29 million.  If we had not entered the EEC, the Minister would have been forced to find this £29 million and have additional taxation. I hope when he is replying he will endeavour to clarify the matter. A new Minister should be very careful that the remarks he makes are responsible.  He could make remarks in opposition which would be dismissed summarily by people but now that he is a Minister much more weight will be given to his remarks, and any remarks he makes should be made in a responsible way.  He should withdraw the remark that this £29 million was lost in a sea of inflation if he cannot substantiate it, and if he can substantiate it he should do so.</P>
    <P>On one occasion, when the Minister was in opposition, he made a remark which gained banner headlines in a Sunday paper.  He said that there were hatchetmen within his own party prepared to knife his own leader.  That was not substantiated later and perhaps it was only a figment of Deputy Ryan's imagination at that time. While that may have been all right in opposition he should be careful that no remarks such as that will emanate <Col N="1608" /> from a Minister for Finance.  People in Ireland have been conditioned to believing what Ministers for Finance have said in the past.  I would hope he will not bring the office into disrepute by making tactless remarks in future.</P>
    <P>I referred to savings and I said the Government should do everything they can to promote savings.  I said that some scheme should be implemented whereby big firms should be encouraged to promote savings among their workers, savings that are stopped at source.  This is the custom in continental countries.  Many workers start saving from the beginning of their working career for what will probably be the most substantial expenditure they will ever incur, that is, house purchase.  A scheme such as I have mentioned could form the nucleus of a large down payment on a new house.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is a new line of thought but it has been brought to my notice recently that Bord na Móna workers who have been participating in a savings scheme for house purchase now find that they are being taxed on the interest accruing from such saving where the interest is greater than £10 per year.  I know a person who had saved £300 on which the interest was, I think, £20 and he finds that he is now being taxed on the interest.  Of course, this will result in his withdrawing his money.  This tax imposition is no encouragement to workers to save their money.</P>
    <P>I notice also in the budget proposals that bank depositors who up to now paid no tax on the first £70 interest will not be able to enjoy this facility any longer because it is to go, if not this year, then next year.  Again this proposal seems to be aimed at discouraging the small investors and savers.  Surely it would be prudent to encourage saving, because saving can be of great benefit to our economy. This new line of thought on the part of the Minister and whoever else is responsible would seem to give a new meaning to a line attributed to another politician which says that a man should scatter, not save.  That <Col N="1609" /> seems to be the type of attitude that is being adopted towards small savers.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of small savers I might mention also small shopkeepers.  These people have been burdened because of the need for very detailed book-keeping in relation to various taxes, but they are now persecuted further with the introduction of a zero category which means that food must now be segregated when it is being paid for.  The effect of this is that the small shopkeepers who have acted as unpaid tax collectors in the past are being harried further from pillar to post.  They have had difficulties with decimalisation and more recently with the various levels of value-added tax and now they are faced with more difficulty.  Is it any wonder that they find it necessary to avail of the services of auditors every two months?  A further hardship is now being imposed on them.  This system of taxation is much too complicated and an effort should be made to simplify it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest task facing the Government today or, indeed, facing the government of any country, is that of trying to prevent prices from rising.  When we were in government we were being asked continually why we did not prevent price rises.  The problem is a very difficult one but the Minister and the Government have promised to make an effort to freeze prices in so far as is possible.  However, we should ask ourselves whether the budget that has been presented to us is geared to this end.  It is my opinion that the budget did nothing to ease the pressures on the middle man and that the vast majority of workers will gain very little but will pay more as a result of this budget.  I am convinced that before the year is out the Government will be feeling the pinch and that is the real test as to whether the budget is a good or a bad one.</P>
    <P>Regarding car owners we find that these unfortunates are being squeezed yet again.  There is a 6.5 per cent rise in VAT on cars and that, combined with the increase in petrol prices, will result in every car owner being heavily imposed on.  The Minister should ask himself whether motorists in Ireland <Col N="1610" /> are not paying enough already.  Is the car owner to be put in the same category as the yacht owner in respect of whom the Minister for Defence expressed such concern?  I note that there is to be a 100 per cent increase in the fee for driving licences and an innovation is a £5 fee for registering a new car.  So far as motor taxation and other taxes connected with motoring are concerned, we have gone completely mad.  A rate of 36.7 per cent value-added tax compares very unfavourably with the 20 per cent tax that applies in Great Britain.  There is also to be a 10 per cent increase in road tax.  We must remember that no longer can we put car owners in the luxury category.  We must ask ourselves how much should the car owner pay and if he is being asked to pay more than he should, we must ask what we are offering him in return.</P>
    <P>An endeavour has been made to put more into the Road Fund so that roads may be improved, but much more is deserved and expected.  These increases in prices will be detrimental also to our tourist industry.  We must have reached the position where Ireland is one of the dearest countries in the world in which to drive, at least it must be the dearest in Europe in that respect.  There have been many slogans in respect both of drunken drivers and TV spongers, but if we continue in our present madness towards taxing further the motorist, we might well have a new slogan which would say that Irish drivers are soaked by Government spongers.</P>
    <P>Before I concluded last evening I mentioned that the Minister for Defence had stated that he was proud to belong to a party that had promised 25,000 houses in a year.</P>

      <P>I would not castigate the Minister for Defence.  Indeed, anyone would be pleased to belong to a party that would produce 25,000 houses in a year and the Minister will have every reason to be proud if, in a year's time, he can stand up here and tell the House that his party had lived up to their promise in this regard.  Even if they produced that number in the following year, the Minister would have reason to be proud.  By then the Government will have had plenty of time to lay their plans.  But I have literature that was handed out before the last election which indicated that it was a promise by one of the parties &mdash;I do not know whether it was the mini or the maxi one&mdash;which now go to form this National Coalition that they intended to produce 25,000 houses in a year.</P>

      <P>Seeing that the Deputy's own organisation is in such a sad state, if he has any spare money to subsidise anything I would remind him that charity should begin at home.  I have read over some of the budget speeches of last year and I would like to quote from some of them.  On reading through the debates for 19th April of last year I got the impression that for the first time I had a kindred spirit in Mr. O'Higgins, who has now, unfortunately, left the Dáil but who is headed for higher places.  At column 596 of Volume 260, the then Deputy O'Higgins said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a price explosion and every housewife in the country has suffered over the last 12 months. From week to week, from months to month, in every shop and supermarket prices have rocketed upwards. There has been growing <Col N="1612" /> unemployment and decreasing business activity.  Is enough being done in this budget to rectify that situation?</P>
    <P>If Mr. O'Higgins were with us today I am sure his comments on this year's budget would be the same in respect of a prices explosion.  This year, too, Mr. O'Higgins would be more <i>au fait</i> with supermarket prices since he has been spending such a considerable amount of his time visiting these establishments and meeting housewives.  Perhaps, too, he would be very much aware of the price of the pint because I have noticed that he has taken a sup from a docker's pint.  I am sure Mr. O'Higgins and I could find common ground in regard to what he had to say on last year's budget and to what I have to say on the budget of this year.</P>
    <P>In the same volume of the Dáil Official Report, at column 604, I note that the then Deputy Corish had this to say about the budget that was presented in 1972:</P>
    <P>I believe that in this budget somebody should have been making sacrifices because there are people who are making money, there are people who are accumulating wealth year after year and that is on the increase year after year.  They are not being asked to provide a penny in this Budget.  On the contrary, as far as income tax allowances are concerned they will get the same as the agricultural worker, the plasterer, the civil servant, the same as those one would regard as having modest wages or modest salaries.  I believe there should have been some sacrifice from these people who have the money.</P>
    <P>I feel the same about it this year as Deputy Corish felt last year.  Many people who are making money have not been asked to pay the piper: I shall make only one more quotation from last year's budget speech.  While I am very pleased, a Cheann Comhairle, about your exaltation to the Chair and did compliment you on it, I regret you have departed from the floor of the House where you could have made your contribution to the budget this year.</P>

      <P>In that event, we shall let sleeping dogs lie.  I wish to quote from the last part of the Minister for Finance's speech where he says at column 1286, Volume 265, of the Official Report of 16th May last:</P>
      <P>Speaking in the debate on the nomination of the Government on the 14th March last, the Taoiseach declared his belief in government by consultation.  We propose to engage now in meaningful talks with representatives of the different interests in our economy....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister made reference to government by consultation, I am convinced that this budget is a bad budget because it is a budget by consultation. There was consultation with the <Col N="1614" /> differnt interests within the National Coalition, and that an effort had to be made to get the Labour Deputies to believe that what was the Fine Gael good was their good, and also what was good for Fine Gael was good for the country.  This budget was not aimed at producing social justice but at helping the National Coalition Government to remain in power.</P>
    <P>I do not condemn the budget in its entirety.  The budget is good, and very good, in spots.  However, we who laid the ground work for this gave the Government a chance but unfortunately the chance has been thrown away.  Those who are sitting over there and who have a say in the ruling of this country are there because they made promises, and whether it was that they were inexperienced or that they were out-and-out chancers, I am not in a position to say, but they did make promises which they have welched on.  Nevertheless, this budget is something they could not hide.  The ordinary Irishman and woman has seen through it.  Pages of verbiage and pedantic talk will not hide the fact that the Government that produced this budget were hamstrung by the 14 ridiculous promises which they have made, and possibly they have taken chances which a person who was free to make up his own mind would not have made.  The Minister and those advising him were not free agents because of this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan made great play of the fact that old age pension and social welfare benefits are now going to be paid a month earlier than the Fianna Fáil Government had succeeded in paying them, and he said&mdash;and Deputy Haughey was in the House&mdash;&ldquo;that is how honest we are&rdquo;.  He seemed to think it was a great feather in his cap that, in paying the benefits in July instead of August, he was a month more honest than Deputy Haughey. Deputy Donegan laboured the point so much that I thought &ldquo;The Minister doth protest too much&rdquo;, and that he was not at all sure of his honesty.  At column 1511, volume 265, of the Official Report of Thursday, 17th May, the last time the Dáil sat, Deputy Donegan said:</P>

    <P>It is a pity that the Whip who challenged me a moment ago and said no such promise was made is not in the House now, but perhaps the Tánaiste would convey to him the fact that Deputy Donegan at least, who has a good knowledge of boats and knows every boat in this country and some that are not in this country, has nailed his colours to the mast in regard to the 25,000 houses a year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan also remarked that in the short eight weeks in which the National Coalition Cabinet were in power they had turned the whole place topsyturvy.  I could not agree more. Let us hope they will make the best of things now, that they will pull up their socks, that they will not do too much harm and that they will not be carried away with too many false impressions of their own merit.  We here and the people of Ireland can only console ourselves with the fact that when Fine Gael once again fail, Ireland will once more be able to fall back on Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not hear the entire contribution that was made by Deputy Paddy Power of Kildare, but I had the advantage of listening to him over the last 20 minutes or so.  I do not think he was too severe on this budget at all, and I think that within himself, he must know that it is a good budget.</P>
      <P>He talked about ridiculous promises. I was frank enough to say before the election and after the election that the 14-point statement of intent could not be implemented in one year, two years, three years or four years, because despite what anybody from the Opposition might say, there are so many problems in the country, problems that have obtained for so many decades, that it will take quite a while to correct all the injustices we have now in the year 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Power said that this country could be described as the dearest <Col N="1616" /> country in the world for motorists.  I do not know whether that is so or not. but if it is so, as far as motorists are concerned, it certainly is the opposite to the plight or the difficulties in which people dependent on social welfare find themselves.  He spoke about the ways and means of raising money and he referred to some statements made by members of the Labour Party.  He spoke also about a tax on wealth and a capital gains tax.  He should have been honest enough to quote the Minister for Finance who said he would produce in the near future a White Paper which dealt with these aspects of the economy and with our general finance and taxation system.</P>
    <P>The topic that created most interest in the last general election was social welfare and social reform.  As far as my party were concerned our primary objective was reform of our social welfare code both in the long term and in the short term.  Prior to the election we decided we would spend on social welfare what has been described as the EEC savings on food subsidies to farmers.  Not alone have we done this in terms of the amounts that were bandied around; we have exceeded it to the tune of £11 million or £12 million per year.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election and right up to the change of government it was popularly assumed that there were £30 million available from EEC savings.  From the speeches of the present Opposition one would have thought that all the new Government had to do was to go into office, find the books balanced and £30 million waiting on a shelf.  I know the figure varied in some of the speeches not only of the Opposition but in the speeches of members now in Government from £27½ million to £30 million.  However, the plain fact is that the money was not there and the Minister for Finance was right when he said it was swallowed up in the sea of inflation. Not alone did we have a deficit of £5 million; in opening the account for the purpose of the budget we had a deficit of £20 million.</P>
    <P>I knew exactly what Deputy Lynch was going to say when he handed over the reins of government on 14th March when he quoted from his illustrious <Col N="1617" /> predecessor, the late Seán Lemass. However, he did not get the same kind of response from those sitting behind him in the benches.  Deputy Lynch said he hoped the new Government would hand back the affairs of government as they found them.  I will give one guarantee to Fianna Fáil: after our term, or terms, of office we will not hand back the country in the state we found it on 14th March, 1973.</P>
    <P>So far as social welfare was concerned we had to start from scratch in order to meet our pre-election promises. We could have said with credibility that, as the money was not there, we could not spend it on social services, because it had been dissipated by the then regime, the Fianna Fáil Government. However, we were determined our promises would be carried out.  We went even further because we are going to spend £39 million in the improvement of social welfare services and in tackling the problems that heretofore have been ignored or partially ignored by the former regime.</P>
    <P>The £39 million compares with the £8.3 million spent last year in what the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, regarded as a good budget. What we promised to do and what we are doing is to give a real increase to every social welfare recipient and at an earlier date.  Deputy Power did not refer to the complaint we had often made, namely, that it was wrong to defer payment of this kind of social welfare assistance until August, September or October.  In one case I remember social welfare, as distinct from social insurance benefits, were deferred until 1st January.  All the benefits proposed in this budget date from 1st July.  I know this was overtopped by Deputy Lynch when he was Taoiseach: he promised social welfare allowances would be retrospective to 1st April.  If he had kept that promise with some of the other promises he made, I shudder to think what kind of situation he or the Minister for Finance would have been confronted with on the introduction of a Fianna Fáil budget.</P>
    <P>We were always told it was impossible to give the benefits as from 1st July, but I have assurances from <Col N="1618" /> officials of my Department from the Secretary down, whose loyalty I do not question, that they will work hard during what I hope will be the hot summer months in order to ensure that the benefits will be paid as quickly as possible.  I wish to make one reservation: because we are making such a colossal endeavour to pay the benefits at the earliest date there will be mistakes.  People may not get the old age pension increases in time or some of the other increased payments but, so far as is humanly possible, the increases will be paid as quickly as possible from 1st July next.</P>
    <P>We were the first to commit EEC savings on agricultural subsidies to the alleviation of poverty.  I do not think anyone in the House can question any of my colleagues in the Labour Party on their attitude towards tackling the problem of the undoubted poverty that exists.  I have deliberately said the alleviation of poverty, not the elimination.  We have a long way to go before we can say every man, woman and child has a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>Let nobody make any mistake, this is a social welfare budget.  It is the largest single expenditure on social welfare in the history of the State.  It is too often forgotten by those who are asked to contribute that 327,000 people on long-term allowances, such as old age pensions, retirement allowances, widows' and orphans' contributory pensions and non-contributory widows' pensions, will benefit from 1st July.  Some 389,000 people on short-term allowances, such as the temporarly unemployed and those who are ill, will benefit.  Despite all the complaints by people on the opposite side&mdash;and I am sure we will get many complaints in the next fortnight&mdash;as Minister for Health and Social Welfare I am concerned only with the fact that 716,000 people will get increases as a result of this budget, and they include men, women and children.  The budget will also help one million children because of the increases in the children's allowances.</P>
    <P>As long as I have responsibility for the social services, the elimination of poverty will be a top priority.  I do not <Col N="1619" /> pretend to be the custodian of all the knowledge there is about taxation, social welfare and social assistance but I hope to be guided by those organisations who concern themselves, particularly in the past few years, with the problem of poverty.  I will take advice from the various churches, the trade unions and the employers, and, may I say it, from the Opposition.  Any advice they may seek to give in the field of social welfare will be gladly taken and will not be resisted merely because they have been proposed by somebody in the Opposition.  Naturally, I will depend on my colleagues behind me to engage in the same sort of exercise.</P>

      <P>We had not £30 million to play with.  We had a minus figure to play with.  The Deputy knows that as well as everybody else.  I am not under any illusions of the magnitude of the problems.  It cannot be done in one year.  This is not the be all and end all of the National Coalition's gestures towards the under-privileged in our society.  However, it is a major step and I hope that this new direction in our society towards social reform will be supported by all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in a full year would amount to £52.5 million.  I do not want to anticipate what the outcome will be in this year or what the situation will be next year, but this is a start.  We must have some sort of code&mdash;I am not making a definite pronouncement &mdash;whereby social welfare payments <Col N="1620" /> can and must be associated with various increases in the cost of living. I place a certain amount of blame on the last Government for their neglect. I agree some of their budgets were very good ones.  I do not know whether Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance when we had occasion to acclaim 95 per cent of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave the Deputy credit for that.  The point I want to make is that though Governments may introduce certain financial proposals to deal with those who are poor and underprivileged, I would remind the whole community, whether, they drink or smoke, whether they are farmers or publicans, whether they are those in the higher or middle income brackets, that we all have a duty to the hundreds of thousands who now find themselves asked to live below the subsistence level.</P>
      <P>During the general election campaign I quoted a figure which must be wellknown to everybody.  There are 660,000 people in Ireland deemed to be living, if &ldquo;living&rdquo; is the proper word, below the subsistence level.  It is not a figure that has been drawn out of the air.  It was determined and agreed on by a conference in Kilkenny on a Saturday in 1971.  It was a representative conference. The employers, the trade unions, social workers and the various churches were represented.  After long and careful research, they decided and agreed that in this country in 1971&mdash;I have no reason to believe there has been a vast improvement meanwhile&mdash; there were 660,000 people living below subsistence level.  That figure has not been challenged.  The social Welfare Council in 1971 accepted that figure which had been researched very carefully. It was an informed research headed by Séamus Ó Cinnéide, research officer of the Institute of Public Administration, a semi-State body.  I do not think anybody will contradict the figures which I now propose to give in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures refer to people who have not sufficient income to live decently and to be free of the primary need of <Col N="1621" /> food, clothing, and shelter, to the disgrace not of those of us in the Dáil at the present time but those who have been in the Dáil for decades and who have treated budgets so as to employ certain taxation to give reliefs in various directions and then, if there was anything left over, to give it to the old age pensioner or the sick person.</P>
    <P>That conference in Kilkenny agreed that the aged poor of 65 years and older amounted to 214,000; children in need numbered 213,000; the unemployed at that time&mdash;the figure is now 68,000&mdash; numbered 75,000; there were 25,000 widows and deserted wives; there were 60,000 people described as low income poor.  We can recognise those, particularly in rural areas where they must depend on home assistance and where their small businesses or small holdings do not give them sufficient incomes on which to live.  In addition, we have the handicapped, which were then numbered at 77,000.  That is a total of 664,000.</P>
    <P>We should be impressed by that figure when we think of taxation and of relief as far as social welfare and social assistance are concerned.  I repeat that I do not think the money being provided for social welfare in this budget, about £52½ million in a full year, will lift all those above the poverty line.  However, I claim that it is a significant start.  Again, let me say that we as a community must be prepared, through the Government, to face up to our responsibilities to those who must depend on the State.  If we are to face up to our responsibilities to those people, of course we must be made aware of the extent of the problem.  I quoted those figures so that in some measure at least we could shock our people into appreciation of the fact that poverty exists.  I want all of the community to help the Government by accepting the principle that those who have should come to the assistance of those who have not.</P>
    <P>It was natural that those who were taxed in this budget did not like it.  I think it will also be appreciated by all fair-minded people that the decision as to whether a general election should have been called when it was did not rest with us.  It must be admitted the <Col N="1622" /> election was called at a difficult time, when the Estimates were being prepared and when we were running up towards the budget.  I do not give that as an excuse as far as this budget is concerned, but time must be given to assess the problem generally, as far as my Departments are concerned, in respect of those who need help.  I would say that those who complain about increased taxation and those who say they got nothing will agree on reflection that the money so raised is being put to good use.</P>
    <P>I suppose there will be criticism&mdash;it existed when Fianna Fáil were over here&mdash;of the fact that the extra tax on beer, spirits and tobacco amounts to only one-third of the total sum being devoted to social welfare.  The total amount of extra taxation on beer, spirits and tobacco is £11 million this year as against £38.9 million being spent on social welfare.  My party have been consistent through the years in our attitude towards taxation when it is related to social welfare.  With few exceptions, perhaps once or twice and for reasons which we gave then, the Labour Party have always supported the Government in tax proposals designed to relieve social welfare and social assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power criticised the increase in motor vehicle duties.  I want to assure the Deputy that practically 85 per cent of the increase goes to the various public bodies for the upkeep of the main roads.  Last Thursday he criticised the increase in Post Office charges of £3.5 million.  This is going towards the £7 million debt which we inherited from the Fianna Fáil Party and Government.  With regard to beer, spirits and tobacco, and the extra revenue from VAT, there is an increase in taxation of only £14 million to meet the £39 million which we intend to spend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I do not think people have considered sufficiently the impact of the improvement, slight though it may appear to be, arising from these increases. I should like to give a few examples in respect of disability benefit and unemployment benefit, which are at the same rate for adults, adult dependants, and children.  Up to a few <Col N="1623" /> days ago I was under the impression that three children were the average family in Ireland but I am informed that the average is four or five.  Let us take it at three.  The father gets £5.55p. His wife gets £3.75p.  For the first two children they get £2.70p and for the third child they get £1.  In children's allowances they get £1.05.  Therefore, if a man becomes ill or is unemployed, and he is in receipt of unemployment benefit, if he has a wife and three children, he gets £14.05.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in this budget that man gets £6.55.  His wife gets £4.25.  For the first two children they get £3.70 and for the third child they get £1.50.  In children's allowances they get £2.15.  That comes to £18.25.  If a man with a wife and three children is sick or unemployed and, on the stamps as they say, under this budget the increase to that family is £4.10 per week &mdash;again, not sufficient, but, again, a significant increase.</P>
    <P>A widow with three children who is in receipt of a contributory widow's pension gets £5.60 at present.  For the three children she gets £4.50 and in children's allowances she gets £1.05. Under the proposals in the 1973 budget the widow gets £6.60.  For the children she gets £6.45.  The children's allowance is £2.15.  The total is £15.20 per week. That is an increase of £4.10 per week for a widow who qualifies.</P>
    <P>There are many examples that could be given.  The old age pensioner who has a wife, and is in receipt of a contributory pension, gets an increase of £1.50.  In the case of a non-contributory pension it is £1 a week only.  I make these admissions.  Even under the non-contributory scheme for widows' and orphans' pensions there is an increase of £4.05 per week.  For the deserted wife with three children there is an increase of £4.05 per week.  That is not inconsiderable in view of the financial difficulties the former Government left us in on 14th March, 1973. Under this budget there is an increase of £4.10 for the man with a wife and three children on unemployment assistance or, as it is popularly called, the dole.  To the families with three <Col N="1624" /> children this budget has meant an increase of about 40 per cent per week.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that, as an expression of our commitment to improve child welfare, the child dependant's allowance is increased by 50p per week, notwithstanding the increase in children's allowances which works out at 35p per week.  This budget has also shown a special concern for the one-parent family.  I have referred to those in receipt of a widow's pension and those in receipt of a deserted wife's pension.  Because there is no man of the house the financial burden on such a person is greater.  Not alone are we giving these people an increase of 50p per week but we are also giving another 15p per week in respect of each child, thus bringing the increase to the category of the widow and the deserted wife to 65p per week per child, because we understand the special difficulties facing the children of a one-parent family.</P>
    <P>On children's allowances we propose to spend £20.2 million per annum. From 1st July the extra £1.50 per child per month will be paid.  It is a pity Deputy J. Lynch did not develop something he spoke about last Thursday. He said that with £11 million he could have given more money to those in receipt of children's allowances.  I am sorry he did not expand on that and say whether or not it was in the Fianna Fáil election programme.  I have not had a lot of time to examine the social welfare finances but how he could give bigger increases retrospective to 1st April on £11 million I certainly do not know.</P>
    <P>As a group when we were in Opposition we also advocated an extension of children's allowances up to 18 years of age for children who are at school, or who were apprentices, and particularly for those who were permanently incapacitated.  From 1st July, children's allowances will be payable up to 18 years of age for children who are in full-time education, in apprenticeship, or severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>There is a general impression that everyone who has £2,500 a year will not get any children's allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> This is not so.  They retain what they have.  The figure of £2,500 is not a firm figure because interest on house mortgage repayments can be taken into account and deducted.  Interest on bank overdraft, if there is one, and social welfare contributions and superannuation contributions can be disregarded as well and any job expenses now allowable under the income tax code.  I am informed that in many cases they could go to £100, £200 or £300 above the limit of £2,500 which was announced.  The payment of children's allowances up to the age of 18 years in the categories I have mentioned will cost £2 million in a full year.  It is worthwhile particularly for those who are permanently incapacitated and for those at school and in apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>Another promise was made in regard to old age pensioners in the non-contributory class.  In their statement of intent the parties who promised to from a government if they had an overall majority were committed to the payment of non-contributory old age pensions at an earlier age and without a means test to both men and women.  To make a beginning to the introduction of the old age pension at 65 years, our proposal is to lower the age to 69 years in somewhat the same manner as we are handling our rates commitment in respect of health charges and housing charges borne by the local authorities, that is, by phasing them out.  This we propose to do in the case of the non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>From 1st July of this year that will cost £2.8 million.  This is something which must be included as well.  There will be a further provision of £600,000 for free travel, electricity and TV licences for those who are 69 years of age and qualify for the old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They are only being applied to those in receipt of them at the present time.  We also promised that we would tackle the problem of the means test.  In the short time available to me I have not been able to carry out an exhausive examination, needless to remark, of all the factors, both administrative and financial, involved in the alleviation of the means test for those in receipt of old age non-contributary pensions but a start had to be made.  In these circumstances I thought it best to begin by disregarding means up to £4 per week and by adjusting the allowances payable at various levels of income up to £9.50 per week.  Apart from those who applied for the pension and those who had to be investigated, those who had to do the investigation must have found their work very difficult, indeed, because glancing through the booklet issued by the Department of Social Welfare, one finds that there are 19 categories now as far as the means test is concerned in respect of the old age pension.  There are 19 of those means tests and I and my colleagues believe that they should be cut down drastically to seven categories.  This will help not alone the old age pensioners but also those who had to administer the complicated and most annoying scale that was prescribed up to this.  Anybody who receives up to £4 per week will get the full pension of £6.15 and between £4 and £5 per week will get £5.15.  The person who has between £5 and £6 per week will get £4.15, between £6 and £7 per week, £3.15, between £7 and £8 per week, £2.15, between £8 and £9 per week, £1.15 and a person who qualifies otherwise and has between £9 and £9.50 per week will get 65p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a dramatic improvement not alone as far as the increases are concerned but certainly as far as the means test is concerned and it indicates the desire of the Government to do away, by a phasing-out operation, with the means test.  I am conscious, of course, of the fact that as the years go on <Col N="1627" /> those who apply for non-contributory pensions are diminishing and the insured contributors are going up, so the problem will not be as bad as it was five years, ten years or 15 years ago because many more are being brought into the insurance net and as a result of raising the limit for insurability from £1,600 upwards it will improve as well.</P>
    <P>I believe not alone old age pensioners but other people who are subject to a means test should logically have the means test, which I have announced, applied to them.  I refer to those in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension and those in receipt of deserted wives' allowances.  We promised these and we have done these things.  I read the speech made by Deputy J. Lynch in Rathmines and apart from what has been said from the other side in regard to overcosting he did not promise as much as is being given in this budget. As far as widows and orphans pensions are concerned, those in receipt of £4 per week or less will get the full amount.  The Blind still obtain what they have been getting.  In addition there is the amended means test I have spoken about.</P>
    <P>I believe the means test was offensive and obnoxious.  It should have been improved at least and not left as it was for so many years.  As a matter of fact, I think the degrees as far as the means were concerned were smaller some years ago and I think it was the former Deputy Boland, as Minister for Social Welfare, who introduced so many of them. I do not hold that against him.</P>

      <P>There is the reduction in age.  There is the alleviation of the means test.  The cost of these improvements, including that in regard to the disabled persons maintenance allowance, comes to £10.4 million in a full year.

At the present time, in respect of this allowance, the means of all the near relatives in the house are taken into consideration for the purpose of deciding whether or not a person is entitled to, as it is called, the DPMA.  There was provision in section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, to make a regulation whereby only the means of the applicant and the spouse would be taken into consideration as is done in the case of the non-contributory old age pension. I intend to bring in a regulation in order to regularise that position.</P>

      <P>I will have the cost of that later on.  I propose to treat these people in the same way as other recipients will be treated as far as the means test is concerned.  There will be quite a number who will be entitled to this particular allowance in their own right having regard to the means of their spouse.  The infectious diseases maintenance allowance will also be increased to the extent of £1 in the personal allowance and 50p for the adult dependant.  The change in the means test for disabled persons and the change in the rate of infectious diseases maintenance allowance <Col N="1629" /> will cost £2.9 million in a full year and this year £2.15 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  The things I have spoken of constitute the bulk of the £39 million devoted to social welfare but that is not the end as far as the social welfare proposals are concerned because, as will be remembered, there has been allocated a sum of £2.5 million this year for the purpose of other necessary improvements in the general welfare code. The cost in a full year will be about £4 million.</P>
      <P>I want to warn the House that, as far as these improvements are concerned, we will honour our pledges but, because we are venturing into new fields, it may not be possible to cost them to the last £1 or to the last £1,000.  What we propose to do is to give an indication of our concern with people who have problems, problems which are not just related to cash benefits; cash benefits in many cases are not sufficient in themselves to solve the many social problems people have.  Very often, these people are unable to cope with difficult situations and they require assistance from skilled social workers and voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to make a start in the development of a service which will supplement the cash allowance given and also fill in some of the gaps in the existing services.  To do this I intend to use the £2½ million allocated to me in accordance with our pre-election commitment for the improvement of social welfare in certain areas.  I am not going to claim now that every single hole has been plugged, but there is certainly need for improvement in domiciliary welfare services.  These services are financed and administered by the health boards and they are designed to provide social care in respect of certain categories, such as the aged, the handicapped, the sick, the unemployed, the widow and the deserted wife.  There are many voluntary bodies providing services for these people, such as &ldquo;Meals on Wheels&rdquo;<Col N="1630" /> which provides meals for old people, many of whom are bedridden.  These bodies receive grants from the health boards.  I intend to make more money available to the health boards for these voluntary bodies in order to encourage the growth of these services. At the same time, I will make funds available to the health boards themselves for the employment of skilled social workers who will engage in community welfare schemes and in the provision of certain specialised services. For this year a sum of £500,000 will be allocated.</P>
    <P>I want to see the community care programme established on a firm basis as quickly as possible.  In many of the health board areas, possibly in them all, there are programme managers but there appears to have been great delay in getting programmes started. I hope this financial assistance of £500,000 will enable those concerned to get these programmes started as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I propose also to devote a sum of £450,000 this year for care allowance. Those who are interested in this aspect of welfare will be pleased to know that we are providing money for care allowance.  This is specifically designed to help parents of severely handicapped children under 16 years of age. Very often these have to be cared for at home at considerable expense to the parents.  It is my desire to help them and the children by making allowances to the parents.  This, too, will operate without a means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the parents of such children get no benefit at all although, peculiarly enough, an allowance is available to them under DPMA when the children reach 16 years of age.  I think that is the position, though I am not absolutely certain.  Many recommendations were received in the department as to how the money available should be spent and what section should have its circumstances alleviated under either Health or Social Welfare.  With all the goodwill in the world, we must be guided to some extent by the availability of money and the willingness <Col N="1631" /> of the community to provide the money.  This suggestion of an allowance in the case of severely handicapped children under 16 was recommended by the Council on Mental Handicap. I thank them for this recommendation and for other recommendations they sent to the Department.  I have certain reservations.  The administration of this allowance will naturally take some time and I do not anticipate its introduction until October next.  For a full year it will cost £900,000; in the current year it will cost £450,000.</P>
      <P>In the 14-point programme and in other programmes strong concern was expressed about deprived children.  As I said, an extra 15p per week will be paid in the case of the one-parent family.  They would be widows, contributory and non-contributory, pensioners and deserted wives.  I propose to devote to child care a sum of £200,000 this year and £240,000 in a full year.  Many people, here and elsewhere, have asked questions about the submissions made in the Care Memorandum. This excellent memorandum makes recommendations for the assistance of deprived children.  The 14-point programme, or statement of intent, also referred to the plight of deprived children.  Under the joint auspices of the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare I propose to develop a child welfare service on the lines suggested in the Care Memorandum.  A sum of £200,000 will be made available this year and £240,000 in a full year.  The money will be spent in a certain direction.</P>
      <P>It will be spent, for example, in the training of child welfare officers, in the employment of social work supervisors, in the provision of community centres and play groups and in the establishment of youth facilities.  As Deputies are aware, the memorandum was not addressed specifically to the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.  It was also directed to the Department of Justice and the Department of Education. It will, therefore, be necessary to have consultations with these Departments in order to co-ordinate child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> Another very important document published recently was the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  The report was published in the last three or four weeks and, as the House is aware, the Government accepted the report in principle.  Some of the recommendations were directed to the Department of Social Welfare and I propose to implement the following recommendation in respect of my Department.  All of us, though we were not prepared to put our hands in our pockets, have expressed concern for unmarried mothers.  In actual fact, these people have been the concern of very few from a practical point of view.  I do not mean that people are unconcerned, but people generally were not concerned to do much for them.  Unfortunately, in many cases they were regarded as outcasts.</P>
    <P>That sort of attitude is disappearing. They are people, and they have children. They are our responsibility.  At present, so far as I am aware, the only help they have is home assistance. This is degrading.  Somebody talked about people being second-class or third-class citizens.  We have regarded the unmarried mothers as the lowest type of citizens in the country. They are people who must eat, buy clothes and footwear.  They have to provide for a child or, perhaps, even children.  We must come to their assistance. Apart from their money difficulties, they are trying to cope with the many difficulties of one-parent families.  Because we are concerned about them they will now be regarded as people who should receive the same amount of allowance as a widow or a deserted wife.  These unmarried mothers will now receive £6.15 per week plus the allowance announced for each child.  I do not wish to be misleading but I think they will be entitled to the 65p increase per child rather than the 50p increase.  This year we propose to spend £110,000 on these allowances to unmarried mothers, and £250,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>We have all raised objections from time to time about the treatment of working widows.  We are all aware that the widow who works and who becomes ill or unemployed receives only <Col N="1633" /> the widows and orphans pension and half of the sickness benefit or the unemployment benefit.  I have not the complete answer to that, but in this budget I propose to do something to help such people.  It would be better to treat them in this fashion until we can arrive at a better solution.  In some paper there was a statement from the working widows of Cork complaining that nothing had been done for them in this budget.  I propose to do something for them.  Whether they think it is good enough or not it is going to cost the Minister for Finance £290,000 this year and £350,000 in a full year.  That is doing something for these working widows who at present only get half the unemployment benefit when they are out of work and half the sickness benefit when they are ill.  I propose to abolish their contributions for social welfare stamps.  That will mean an increase of £1 per week to them.  The stamp costs 99p per week.  They will also get their extra £1 per week as widows and 65p per week extra for each child dependant.  They will also get increases in the children's allowances. Whoever reported the contents of the budget to these people did not read the speech of the Minister for Finance very closely.</P>
    <P>This year I propose also&mdash;I hope from the 1st April&mdash;to make some improvement in the lost of a certain category of deserted wives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That gives her an extra 99p per week.  There are a certain number of people who are not deemed to be deserted wives but who have been divorced.  They are in a bad position because they cannot claim the deserted wives' allowance.  I propose to assist this very limited group.  I am advised by the Attorney General that it is possible to apply to them the <Col N="1634" /> same allowances that are payable to widows.  It is only fair that we should do that at a modest cost of about £5,000 per year.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Women made another recommendation. Other parties in this House gave evidence to the commission and the Labour Party Committee on the Status of Women gave evidence there.  Their evidence must have made an impact because many of the problems which they discussed have been dealt with.  I have announced improvements following the recommendations of the commission.  In accordance with the recommendations of the commission I intend to apply the deserted wives' allowance in the same conditions as apply to widows' pensions.  Thus, a deserted wife who is entitled to a contributory pension will receive benefits similar to those given to a widow who is entitled to a contributory pension.  If a woman has been deserted by her husband and if she is entitled to a contributory pension she will get that pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No. If she qualifies on her husband's stamps there will be no means test.  That will cost a modest £30,000 in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been criticism, from time to time from the Labour Party when they were on the Opposition benches, and now from the backbenchers who were then on these benches, about the treatment of women in domestic service and of women engaged in agriculture, and their entitlement to unemployment assistance.  It is a major recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women that a change should be made in this regard.  At present a woman who works in domestic service or in agriculture must have at least one dependant or at least 52 ordinary rate stamps over the previous four years in order to qualify for unemployment assistance.  These women will now be eligible for unemployment assistance when they have 52 stamps of any kind, no matter what rate applies to them.  This will cost <Col N="1635" /> £300,000 this year and £600,000 in a full year.  This suggests to me that it will not be possible to operate this scheme until October, but at least it is a good change in respect of these people.  There are women engaged in domestic service or in agriculture who find that they cannot receive unemployment benefit easily.  The condition at present is that they must be contributing for ten years to qualify for unemployment benefit.  I propose to treat them as any other insured workers for the purpose of unemployment benefit.  The stamps which have to be affixed to their cards in respect of domestic or agricultural work will be deemed to be at the ordinary rate, and they will be, under the ordinary conditions prevailing, entitled, if they so are, to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>There is also a grievance which we all find in our constituencies in relation to the continuation of insurability of a woman who marries and who is given a marriage grant of, I think, £10.  She must, after marriage, in order to qualify for benefit, obtain 26 weeks' work or more, meaning, of course, 26 weeks' stamps after here marriage before she qualifies for benefit. I know there are other reasons why women after marriage are not deemed to be eligible for unemployment benefit for various reasons, not being available for work and that sort of thing, but if they qualify as being willing to work and available for work I propose to scrap the marriage grant altogether and let them continue their insurance so that they would not have to work for 26 weeks in order to qualify.  The marriage benefit will be abolished.  The cost for the full year will be £350,000, in this year £180,000.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare, of which I have some little experience, is one of the Departments that comes under very serious criticism.  I suppose I have criticised the Department of Social Welfare as much as anybody not alone in the Department but as a member of the Opposition but I always qualified my criticisms by describing the sort of Department it is, a Department that has to deal with so many individuals, a Department that turns over 60,000 people a week for <Col N="1636" /> unemployment benefit or for sickness benefit.  As far as their calibre is concerned, they are, I suppose, no better or no worse than other Departments but they have a very difficult job to do.  The Parliamentary Secretary said the other day that there was a computerising system to be introduced which it is hoped will eliminate many delays and will elicit information as far as records are concerned very quickly indeed.  I have found and I think all of us who have held clinics have found that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the insurable class who do not appear to be aware of their entitlements.  The little booklet handed out by the Department is an excellent one in itself but unreadable for many people.  I think one of the functions of my Department is to publicise as far as possible and to do everything possible to show the people in simple language and simple figures what their rights are in respect of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory, deserted wives' allowances and all the little things like free travel and electricity. I intend to use the news media and also to supplement with additional staff the section in the Department for the purpose of giving information to the public.  I know how frustrating it must be for people to ring up&mdash;not necessarily from Dublin, because if you talk for half an hour in Dublin you get it for the same price but down the country they must pay extra for each minute after three minutes.  I believe as far as new benefits are concerned that people should be made aware as quickly as possible of their entitlements.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on social welfare improvements here and to a lesser extent on improvements in health.  The amounts that have been allocated to these two Departments account for about 80 per cent of the extra expenditure announced in the budget.  I believe also that the capital budget will make a significant contribution to the alleviation of unemployment in view of the fact that an extra £66 million is being spent in the capital budget, that is an increase of a quarter over last year. There is a conflict of opinion among economists as to whether this is a good <Col N="1637" /> or a bad thing.  As far as I am concerned, as long as it gives people employment it does something not alone for the employed person but for the economy as well.</P>
    <P>Taking the current and capital budget into account I believe that the 1973 budget is the biggest social budget on record.  It is a tremendous achievement not for me but for my colleagues and members of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties, to be able to make these improvements in social welfare.  I do not say it goes all the way or even half the way towards the elimination of poverty but a start has been made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch described the proposals of the Minister as wasteful and unfair.  Wasteful and unfair to whom? I wonder does he mean the 716,000 people who will benefit under this or people like myself and Deputy Haughey who take a drink at times. Deputy Haughey does not smoke.  Let us remember that with every sip we take and every puff we are contributing to these people who need it more than we do.  Deputy J. Lynch said there was no need to increase taxation, that all these things could have been done without an increase in taxation. If he can do that, I would invite him over here.  He said Fianna Fáil would have given better increases in social welfare for £11 million per year.  I would simply ask the question how.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power appears to have two minds on this budget because he said that the voice was the voice of Richie but the budget was the budget of George.  Which side is he on?  I think he is trying to tell us it is a good budget.  But I think he is also trying to tell us that Deputy Colley left so much money there for the present Minister for Finance that there was, as Brian Lenihan would say, no problem.  No budget is perfect, no budget pleases everybody. This certainly does help the poor and that is what we promised to do and that is what we started out to do and that is what we will continue to do with the help and goodwill of the people of the country and of the Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of this budget and its presentation to the House is the first major undertaking of the present Government.  Up to now we have had individual Ministers vying with each other within the ambit of their departmental activities to capture the odd headline.  We had quite a few departmental announcements of one sort or another.  However, this is the first occasion on which we can see the Government as a whole at work, when we can examine the product of their collective endeavours and, indeed, the outcome of their collective thinking.  For that reason it is important that we in the Opposition subject the budget to both a very careful over-all assessment and an examination in detail.  It is important in the public interest that we criticise it constructively and not look on it with the starry-eyed honeymoon-period approach of some of the commentators. In doing this we can render a service to the House, to the general public and even though they might not be too ready to admit it to the Government themselves.</P>
      <P>It is our duty as an Opposition, by constructive criticism, to help the Government do their job better, to encourage them along the lines that we would like to see them move and, if possible, to persuade them from courses of action of which we could not approve and which we would not regard, under any circumstances, as beneficial to the community.  We must from these benches, in the first instance, look on this budget as a whole as an instrument of economic and social planning and, in addition, we must subject its contents to a detailed scrutiny in depth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I should like to look at the general economic picture which faced the Minister when he set about preparing his budget.  It was a varied picture.  On the one hand, the Minister was fortunate in finding an economy which was on the upturn.  Agricultural output and income were moving ahead. Industrial production and exports were increasing fairly rapidly and the balance of payments situation which so often in the past has been the ogre of the Minister for Finance when he set <Col N="1639" /> about preparing his budget, could, on this occasion, be looked on with reasonable equanimity.  On the other side of the picture there were the serious inflationary pressures, the intimidating rises in prices, the comparatively high level of unemployment and the difficulties posed by the preparations which are necessary for the forthcoming national pay agreement.  The Minister's freedom of activity, was, I must add, unfortunately, circumscribed to a considerable extent by the necessity to redeem some injudicious election promises.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister made the somewhat surprising comment that there was no clear-cut prescription for him to adopt in terms of budgetary policy.  I confess that I find that surprising. I think it should be axiomatic in budgeting to have some coherent philosophy to which everything is related.  However, although the Minister said that in his financial statement, it seems to me that, basing his decision on the OECD report, he has opted for an inflationary deficit-financed budget. For this reason it can be argued cogently that the basic economic strategy of this budget is wrong.  The Minister's stated aim is to bring the economy more into line with its capacity.  He is seeking to do this, to accelerate growth, by inflating consumer demand.  To rely on the inflation of consumer demand alone to achieve acceleration of growth might be a legitimate exercise in the case of economies which are much more developed than ours and which are not as dependent on exports as we are, but in our case it is not the right prescription especially as it carries with it the real danger of adding fuel to the fires of inflation.</P>
    <P>Instead, this budget should have been aimed at a balanced growth and should have concentrated much more on directional supports to increase our capacity to produce exports rather than to stimulate home consumption. The budgetary programme as outlined by the Minister is completely devoid of any such directional supports. There is a total absence of any new incentives or any action programmes <Col N="1640" /> orientated to the objectives which I would have thought were the desirable ones.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not worried unduly at present about the balance of payments situation.  He has some justification for that.  This year he can count on an inflow of funds arising from our membership of the EEC and our participation in the common agricultural policy.  He can look, as he indicated, with some confidence to increasing industrial exports and he has assessed the inflow of investment capital at about £100 million.  All of these factors combine to enable him to look at the balance of payments situation for the coming year with reasonable equanimity.</P>
    <P>However, although it may not be necessary to do so, I should like to sound a warning note in this regard. This year we will have a very considerable upsurge in agriculture inflows from abroad in one form or another but let us realise that that is more or less a once-and-for-all operation and that we must be looking ahead to the time when that dramatic upsurge from agriculture in our balance of payments will have spent itself.  At this stage we should be keeping an eye on the long-term implications of membership of the Community from our balance of payments point of view.</P>
    <P>I should like to have a brief look at the arithmetic of the budget and to examine what resources the Minister had at his disposal on this occasion to cope with the many pressing demands, social and economic, which inevitably would be made on him. First, he was able to count on an unprecedented rise in tax buoyancy which he has described as &ldquo;an historically high buoyancy increase&rdquo; That buoyancy increase in tax revenue amounts in the coming year to £95 million.  Also, he had the net fiscal gain of £29 million arising from our entry into the EEC.  The additional taxes, duties and charges which he imposed this year will bring in £22 million and he is taking credit for an operation in regard to an unspent balance of £4 million.  In addition to all that, he is budgeting for a deficit <Col N="1641" /> of £39 million.  When we look therefore at the arithmetic of the Minister's budget, we find an extraordinary increase in the resources which he had available to him to dispose of for budgetary purposes: £95 million tax buoyancy, £29 million net gain from EEC membership, £26 million from additional taxation and charges, and a £39 million deficit.  All of these amount to the almost incredible total of £189 million.</P>
    <P>I want all Deputies, when they are examining this budget, to keep this in mind, that in coming to his budgetary task this year the Minister for Finance had, through a combination of circumstances, £189 million of disposable resources over and above what was available in the previous year.  With that figure of £189 million in mind, and the fact that he made available for improved social welfare a figure of £39 million, for the easement of rates a figure of £12.7 million, and a variety of minor reliefs a figure of roughly £1.7 million, I think we are all entitled to ask&mdash;did he do well?</P>
    <P>As the Minister here on budget day disclosed his litany of social welfare improvements, the backbenchers of the two Government parties were elated, but if they had known then what the true arithmetic of the budget the Minister was presenting was, I wonder would they have been satisfied with a mere £39 million for social welfare, £12.7 million for rates, and £1.7 million for other odds and ends of improvements, that out of £189 million at his disposal that was the best he was able to do.  If they are satisfied that he has done enough in regard to social welfare, then I think they are entitled to ask him now&mdash;are these figures which I am giving correct, and, if they are correct, why was he not able to do more in other areas where improvements are urgently needed and demanded, in particular in regard to income tax allowances?  I do not think, when you look at the <i>in toto picture</i> of the resources available to the Minister on this occasion, that his performance is all that satisfactory or that it deserved to be so enthusiastically hailed by his own backbenchers and by some of the more starry-eyed commentators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> While I am dealing with this matter of the arithmetic of the budget, I want to direct the attention of the House to an incredible statement which appears on page 51 in the Minister's financial statement:</P>
    <P>Tax buoyancy will increase accordingly and the actual deficit for the present financial year is expected to be less than now estimated.</P>
    <P>What anybody can make of that piece of gobbledegook I do not know.  The only parallel to that that I can think of is the farmer who, coming home from the fair, is asked by a neighbour how he got on and replied: &ldquo;I did not get as much as I was expecting, but then I did not think I would.&rdquo;  Note that the Minister's statement says that the deficit is &ldquo;expected to be&rdquo;; he does not say that it &ldquo;might be&rdquo; or &ldquo;would possibly be&rdquo;, but is &ldquo;expected to be&rdquo;. I invite the Deputies to contrast that with an earlier statement in which he is dealing with the deficit likely to emerge from the budget:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this year's estimate is realistically based.  It was arrived at after a careful analysis of the trend of tax revenue buoyancy in recent years and an examination of each individual tax head in the light of the macro-economic projections for the year.</P>
    <P>Here he tells us precisely, positively and confidently that his estimate of tax revenue is accurate and correct. The macro-economic projection to which he refers must, of course, take account of the budget itself and its effect on everything including tax buoyancy. I am forced to the reluctant conclusion therefore that these two parts of the budget financial statement were written by two different people.</P>
    <P>While on the question of the arithmetic of the budget I also want to deal with the Minister's rather puerile statement that a sum of £29 million had disappeared or sunk without trace. Even on the internal evidence of his own financial statement, that can be flatly contradicted.  In his outline of the arithmetic of the budget he says that he began his exercise with a deficit of £20 million, so at least there is £9 million, if nothing more, saved from <Col N="1643" /> the £29 million.  But I also want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that that opening deficit of £20 million to which the Minister refers is unreal, because he has already taken the precaution of including in the Book of Estimates the £12.7 million provided for easement of rates, so at the worst, far from £29 million having disappeared into thin air or sunk without trace, or whatever other euphemistic phrase the Minister wishes to use, in fact he came to his budgetary exercise with a deficit of not more than £8 million, if allowance is made for the fact that he had already included his election rates commitment in the Book of Estimates to the extent of £12.7 million.</P>
    <P>This budget, like most other things that come before us in the House, can be examined under two headings: first of all, what is in it, and, secondly, what is not in it but what might have been or should have been in it.  The central position on the budgetary stage this year is occupied by the social welfare proposals.  Take them away and I do not think there is a great deal left about which the Minister or his supporters can be very enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>We all welcome and congratulate the Minister on these social welfare advances. I do not think he will find there is any lack of appreciation on this side of the House for what has been achieved on the social welfare front.  In particular I welcome the new services the Minister has decided to provide as well as the many improvements in existing services.  I welcome the allowances for mentally handicapped children, the proposals in relation to deprived children, the new scheme of assistance for unmarried mothers and the change in regard to the allowances for deserted wives who are divorced. All these benefits will be greatly appreciated and we have no hesitation in congratulating the Minister on them.</P>
    <P>Nobody, least of all an old age pensioner, is going to look a gift horse in the mouth.  The social welfare increases in the existing services are to be welcomed but it is legitimate to ask: do they go far enough?  The main <Col N="1644" /> feature of the proposals is a £1 per week increase in the personal rates of all social insurance and social assistance benefits.  There was a time not long ago when £1 per week would be hailed as a significant and important increase in these rates but after the euphoria of budget day has evaporated let us look at the matter in a realistic manner.</P>
    <P>I think I can recall some of these rates being increased by £1 three years ago.  It was probably regarded as a magnanimous increase then.  However, can it be regarded as all that significant today?  Having regard to price increases and inflationary pressures, I do not think that a £1 per week increase is all that generous particularly when one considers that the figures I have given show conclusively that the Minister had £189 million of additional resources to dispose of this year.</P>
    <P>I realise the increases in the children's allowances are handsome and are quite significant.  When I had responsibility for framing budgets I always looked particularly at the children's allowances scheme because through this scheme one can bring relief and a reduction of hardship on a wider and more comprehensive scale than any other.  The Minister has done well in this regard and I am sure it will have a widespread effect in relieving hardship.  However, the income tax clawback is a mistake.  I can assure the Minister I am well prepared to hear him say I did the same sort of thing on one occasion.  I did, but have recognised long before now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I recognise now it was a mistake although I did not at the time.  My restrictions in that budget were much more limiting than were the Minister's on this occasion. At that time I did not advert sufficiently to what was involved.  I have a distinct recollection of someone in my constituency coming to me later in the year and saying to me that I had deceived him.  He told me he had welcomed the increase in the children's <Col N="1645" /> allowance but he did not realise that later in the year some of the money would be taken back by way of this income tax device.  I do not know if the Government are irrevocably committed to this matter but I think they should re-examine it.</P>
      <P>If it was done for revenue purposes only, if its objective was to reduce the cost of the increase in children's allowances, it does not make any sense.  This year it will bring in only £1 million and £2 million in a full year and, having regard to the size of the budget, that figure is relatively inconsequential. In addition, it complicates the income tax code.  In another part of his budget the Minister promised he would simplify the income tax code and make it readily understandable to all.  The new budget provision is a retrograde step in this regard.  I do not know what it will involve by way of an extra administrative burden on the revenue machinery but I think it will be of considerable significance.</P>
      <P>If the claw-back is proposed for reasons of social justice as distinct from revenue considerations, it is equally indefensible.  The Tánaiste and myself had a few words across the floor of the House about selectivity in social services.  If this income tax claw-back is an attempt at selectivity it is a very crude one.  Deputy Joe Brennan indicated that investigations were going on in his time to see if a more refined method could be devised. The Minister has set the cut-off point at £2,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to chastise the Minister for the use of the word &ldquo;net&rdquo; on the night we were discussing the Financial Resolutions because he threw the House into a state of confusion and unnecessary and futile argument.  When he used the word &ldquo;net&rdquo;, most Deputies with reasonable justification jumped to the conclusion he meant that one could take off the income tax allowances <Col N="1646" /> before arriving at the £2,500 figure. What the Minister really meant was that the £2,500 would be arrived at after the normal charges allowed for income purposes, such as bank and mortgage interest rates and so on.  The income tax allowances are not to be included.  A very valid criticism of the proposal is that there is no marginal relief at the £2,500 point.  Anyone who has £2,499 net total income for income tax purposes is all right, but anybody who has £2,501 has in effect to return the increases which have been granted in children's allowances. Of course that will almost certainly give rise to an amount of manipulation of income in the case of self-employed people.  I think it is certain that quite a number of such people will make sure coming towards the end of the year that their income does not go beyond the £2,500 point.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect I should like to bring to the Minister's attention and ask him to take note of.  It seems to me that in the case of PAYE taxpayers there will be a necessity in many cases for adjustments at the end of the year.  Persons' incomes might not be fully ascertainable until the end of the year and therefore taxpayers, through no fault of their own, will throughout the year receive children's allowances and will be called on at the end of the year to pay additional tax because of these provisions. That is something that should be avoided if at all possible.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies know that this business of adjustments and extra payments at the end of a specified period is one of the most odious aspects in people's minds of the differential rents system.  The strongest possible objection is taken to them, and rightly so. People like to pay as they go.  I should be grateful for any reassurance the Minister can give in this respect because it seems to me it will give rise to a differential rents type of situation in the case of PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect which has been mentioned is the situation of an individual who, for some special reason, does a lot of additional overtime in a particular year.  A married man wishing to purchase his own house <Col N="1647" /> might, in order to do so, for one or two years punch in an unusual amount of overtime to provide himself with additional income from which to pay the deposit on a house.  He would in that way push himself over the £2,500 limit and because of his industriousness deprive himself of the increase given in children's allowances.  I seriously submit to the Minister, if it is not too late, that this is something which should be looked at again with a view to cancelling the claw-back income tax provision.</P>
    <P>Another significant feature in the budget is the change in the VAT structure.  I have given quite a lot of thought to this and I am convinced it is a mistake.  I think it was an unfortunate election promise which had to be redeemed.  It is unfortunate that the promise was made in the first place.  I suppose like most election promises it had to be redeemed.  The first thing to be said about this removal of VAT from foodstuffs is that there is no guarantee it will be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I have taken the trouble to discuss this with many people engaged in the distribution trade and there is fairly general agreement that it will not affect significantly the retail price of foodstuffs and that it will not be passed on effectively to the consumer, no matter what efforts the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his price inspectors may make.  If that is so, then it is certainly a mistake.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that as our obligation to harmonise with tax structures within the EEC will arise during the next few years, it is also mistaken.  I suggest the Minister is well aware of this because in his statement he uses the words &ldquo;present Community legislation&rdquo;.  He said that in doing this we will not be in conflict with present Community legislation.  Obviously he realises that having regard to our future obligations this was a mistake.</P>
    <P>Of course, the real problem arising from this proposal by the Minister to remove VAT from foodstuffs is that he has to recoup the revenue from other things which, though they may not be regarded as fundamentally important <Col N="1648" /> as food, nevertheless, must be thought of as necessities.  I am sure it has not escaped Deputies' attention that while redeeming this election promise the Minister has unscrupulously used the occasion to raise another £2.6 million from VAT.  He has kept his election promise in a very narrow and restricted sense, but he has in an underhand way availed of the opportunity to increase the rates on other commodities to bring in extra revenue.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the zero rating of food in this way will interfere with the administrative efficiency of the tax.  Another aspect of the VAT change is that the Minister is increasing the tax on the upper range to 36 per cent.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the imposition of a 36 per cent tax on some of these items it is a fact that when you boost your tax rates up to that high level you encourage evasion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, on the second day of the debate put up a very spirited defence of the Government's action in raising the cost of domestic durables in the way they had to compensate for removing VAT from food.  He was replying, in particular, to a fair amount of criticism from these benches to the fact that the rate of taxation on sporting goods had been increased.  He drew for us a vivid picture of the Government trying to take an agonising decision between football boots and food.  I do not think that was the real choice that faced the Government.</P>
    <P>In arguing this way the Taoiseach was cleverly concealing the fact that in the change they did squeeze an extra £2.6 million from VAT as a whole.  Therefore, if he wanted to, he could have left out sporting goods as well as food having regard to the £2.6 million extra which he was raising. In all of these things it is a question of trying to find a reasonable and humane balance.  Some will argue very strongly that sporting goods, particularly for the young people, should get special treatment. Others would, perhaps, prefer that other goods were exempted rather than sporting goods.  When one looks at the overall implications of the <Col N="1649" /> changes made I think the conclusion one must reach is that this was a fundamental mistake and it will have to be rectified because sooner or later our EEC obligations are going to make us come into line with other European countries in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted some considerable portion of his budget statement to the question of the evasion of income tax and he outlined the measures which he proposed to take to counter this evasion.  This is an area where, year after year, a running battle goes on between a certain section of the taxpaying public on the one side, and the Revenue Commissioners on the other.  The Revenue Commissioners keep a wary eye on the situation.  They look out for developments and find out the latest evasion devices.  The commissioners come forward with their measures to counter these evasions but as soon as they have done so the fertile minds go to work again and new methods of evading tax are sought out.  So it goes on from year to year.  Evasion device, followed by counter-measures, followed by further evading devices, followed by further will continue to go on as long as we have this system of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement said something which puzzled me.  He said that one of the reasons why our rates of taxation are so high is that a great many people who ought to pay a lot, pay a little, or, indeed, none at all.  I am not so sure that is true.  If it is, it would indicate that tax evasion is on a much higher scale than any one of us would have suspected. If it is true, then the converse is equally true.  I should like the Minister always to have regard, when he is taking advice on the imposition of taxes or the rates that he should settle on, to the fact that if tax rates increase beyond a certain point then evasion is inevitable.  It is a delicate point to try to decide where to stop. It is, I think, axiomatic and recognised by most experts in the taxation field that if the rates are fixed too high a point of diminishing return is reached because of the impetus the higher rates give to evasion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> The Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I know, will always be alert to ensure that any insignificant attempts at evasion are counteracted.  I hope they will also keep in mind whether or not the evasion is sufficient to justify the counter-measure and the trouble and inconvenience that the counter-measure is going to cause for many people who are perfectly innocent.  However, I do not think that any of the anti-evasion measures which the Minister proposes will meet with resistance from anybody in the House.  But I hope the Minister, in framing the provisions in the Finance Act, will bear in mind that it is important, in seeking to catch someone who is avoiding income tax not to cause unnecessary or undue hardship or inconvenience to other taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Up to now I have spoken about matters which are contained in the budget statement.  I should now like to talk about the things which are not in it and which, perhaps, might have been included.  It would be easy at this stage for any of us on this side of the House to list all sorts of things that the Minister should have done on this occasion.  I do not think that would have been a constructive approach on our part because we must recognise that no one budget can do everything.  I will confine myself, therefore, to the main areas where expectations were raised or where promises were given or where the situation clearly demands some action.</P>
    <P>The first big area of disappointment is in regard to income tax allowances. I do not need to remind the Minister, or any of his colleagues, that when they were on these benches, year after year with admirable diligence, they hammered away at the inadequacy of our income tax allowances and the necessity in justice to increase them. There is general recognition now that they are inadequate and I think that on the concessionary side this is the most serious criticism that can be levelled against the Minister.  He has failed with one minor exception to make any concession whatever to the hard-pressed income tax payers, especially those in the lower and middle income groups.  In the circumstances <Col N="1651" /> of this year's budget he had a unique opportunity, indeed an obligation, to make some movement forward in the general level of income tax allowances.</P>
    <P>A very slight improvement has been made in regard to the allowance given to married women who go out to work.  I hope he will not consider my criticism a carping one when I draw his attention to one point in that regard.  He said that this increase now means that the personal allowance of a married couple is equated with that of two single persons.  That is in fact true up to an income of £2,000 a year.  After that the two single persons have a considerably increased allowance over the married couple. Perhaps he would look into that aspect of this concession and see whether he could, throughout the income scale &mdash;or perhaps if not throughout the whole income scale at least at some higher point&mdash;equate the personal allowances of the married couple with that of two single persons.</P>
    <P>On the night we were discussing the Financial Resolutions I could not help but recall&mdash;unfortunately I spoke out of order&mdash;the crusade which the present Minister for Local Government waged down the years on the question of some income tax allowance in respect of the cost of the journey to and from work.  On many an occasion he appealed to me as Minister, to my predecessors, and to my successor, to do something in this area.  He was wont always to instance the case of the tradesman who had to use his motor car to get from his home to his place of employment, often ten, 15 or 20 miles away.  He felt it was iniquitous that no income tax allowance should be granted to such an individual.  Now on this occasion not alone is such a person&mdash;and there are many of them&mdash;not getting any income tax allowance, although he might have expected that the voice of the Minister for Local Government would have prevailed in this regard, but he is being sorely pressed in a number of new ways.</P>
    <P>He will have to pay more for his driving licence, for the tax on his car, <Col N="1652" /> for his petrol, for his cigerettes and for his pint because whether anybody likes it or not, to the tradesman who does a hard day's work, a pint at the end of the day is very much a necessity. Here we have the Minister for Local Government acquiescing in a budget in which not only is this favourite character of his not being granted the income tax allowance, for which he has fought and pressed down the years, but in fact the wheel is being turned in the other direction.  I have given this some thought and I must say that I was very puzzled about it. Eventually I have decided that I have the solution.  It is quite clear to me now, that, as soon as we have finished debating this last resolution, the Taoiseacht will have the resignation of the Minister for Local Government.  I cannot see any other way out of the dilemma is which the unfortunate man now finds himself.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget which I find disappointing is in relation to investment and the provision of credit. The Minister dealt very scantily in his budget speech with these two very important aspects of economic development. I would have thought that he would have had a great deal more to say about them.  In particular I am concerned with his almost complete lack of reference to the question of credit for farmers.  This is one of the most serious omissions from the budget.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the capital budget shows a substantial increase of £56 million and, of that, an extra £11 million is provided for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to enable it to increase its lending to the farming community. This area of credit for agriculture will be of fundamental importance in the development of our economy in the next few years.  Our entry into Europe and our participation in the common agricultural policy will generate a massive increase in demand for credit by our farmers.  Now, for the first time, our farmers have guaranteed prices and guaranteed markets.  They are able to plan&mdash;and they are already planning&mdash;with confidence to maximise their output.  It is absolutely essential that our farmers should be able to develop their land and its facilities and <Col N="1653" /> to expand their stocks quickly to realise the full possibilities opened to us by membership.  In order to do that, credit on a vast new scale is needed.  I am afraid this budget does not even begin to come to grips with this problem.  The increase of £11 million to the Agricultural Credit Corporation does not even begin to scratch the surface of the problem.</P>
    <P>Related to this increase in the demand for credit which will come from the desire of our farmers to increase their output is the fact that we will have to change our whole system of supports, direct production supports, to our farmers.  Over a period the grants which are there at present will have to disappear.  In future aids to farmers and to the agricultural community will be confined to making credit available to them at a subsidised rate of interest. From that point of view also there is urgent need for us to mobilise vast resources of credit for the farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I intended to say was that in the budget speech it was not afforded anything like the space and attention it deserves.  The very fact that the Minister for Finance should interject and draw my attention to the fact that an increase is being made available in this way to the <Col N="1654" /> Agricultural Credit Corporation indicates that he is not aware of the enormity of this problem because £11 million in this context is practically irrelevant.</P>
      <P>I would be the first to pay tribute to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. They have done a wonderful job in recent years.  They have revolutionised their approach and their techniques and have done great work indeed in providing credit to the farming community. Apart from the Agricultural Credit Corporation it seems to me that the best vehicle for channelling credit to the farming community is the commercial banks.  They alone have the comprehensive and sophisticated network of lending outlets throughout the farming community.  They have the experience, they have built up relations with their customers over the years and it is on them in the main we must rely to provide the credit needed. Unfortunately, as things stand at present, they will not be able to do so.</P>
      <P>In this connection I want to come to the provision in the budget to withdraw the existing tax relief from the first £70 of bank deposit interest.  Deputy Paddy Power mentioned this point also.  This is a very serious mistake and I am astonished at the manner in which the Minister justified this proposal in his budget speech. He said that a certain limited number of banks have this concession and he was being approached by the others to grant it to them and, rather than do that he thought the simplest thing to do was to take it away from those who had it.  This has far wider and deeper implications than the Minister appears to realise at this point of time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Power mentioned, and I think he is right, that this is a disincentive to savings.  The capital budget booklet treats us to a little homily about how we should go about financing our capital programme and then it goes on to say under the heading &ldquo;Residual Borrowing&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The surest foundation for satisfactory development in the public capital programme lies in the expansion of domestic savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an incontrovertible statement <Col N="1655" /> and one to which we would all subscribe, but how can the Minister reconcile that particular statement with this decision to take away this very valuable incentive to small savers? The commercial banks draw a very considerable amount of their resources from small depositors.  If this concession is removed as the Minister proposes there will undoubtedly be a withdrawal of the deposits from the commercial banks and a consequent limiting of their capacity to lend to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I do not understand the thinking behind this proposal, particularly at this time when there will be a tremendous need for the banks and all the other lending agencies to mobilise themselves and gear themselves to make credit facilities available to the farming community.  I strongly urge the Minister to re-examine this proposal.  There is, whether we like it or not, a very old traditional feeling in rural Ireland that the only safe place to put your money is in the bank and if this incentive is withdrawn I foresee considerable repercussions in the capacity of the commercial banks to lend to the farming community.  If there is a swing, as is envisaged in the Minister's proposal, to the Post Office and the trustee savings banks as they cannot lend to the farming community, this will represent at this moment a serious retrograde step.  The whole emphasis in the future in support of agriculture will be on cheap and available credit. The Irish Farmers' Association, in their pre-budget submissions, suggested that interest rates for farmers, subsidised at the rate of 5 per cent, should be introduced and that will be the pattern in the future.</P>
    <P>The capital programme shows a substantial increase of £56 million. Again, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs watching my words meticulously, I want to say that the Minister has not dealt in any satisfactory way with the financing of that capital programme in his budget speech.  When he comes to reply to this debate he could give us a great deal more information about it.  On the resources <Col N="1656" /> side, he indicates that to finance the capital programme £60 million will be expected from the domestic banks and that an additional £37.7 million will be raised either from the domestic banks or by means of foreign borrowing. I would like to hear him expound a little more on the implications of these figures.</P>
    <P>My information is that the domestic banks at the moment are heavily lent and I am not too sure if they could meet from their existing resources this £60 million which the Minister will seek to help him finance the capital programme.  I am certain that if they have to provide it, apart altogether from providing any portion of the other £37.7 million of residual borrowings, they will have nothing left to lend to the private sector.  That is something of which the Minister must take serious note and on which we are entitled to his views and observations.</P>
    <P>I have instanced how important it will be in this year and the years ahead for the banks to be able to provide adequate credit for the farming community, but from the way matters seem to be shaping up at present they would not be in a position to make any additional credit available for agriculture.  There is another aspect of that position which I would like to mention to the Minister.  It seems to me that, if our domestic banks are called on to make additional credit available during the coming year to industry and to agriculture, then something will have to be done about the existing restriction which the Central Bank places on them in regard to borrowing abroad.</P>
    <P>I foresee that the banks would have no difficulty in going abroad and raising very considerable resources which they could channel into Irish agriculture and Irish industry.  I understand that at the moment the Central Bank mandate is that, if they raise any moneys abroad, they must deposit half the moneys raised with the Central Bank at a punitive rate of interest. That is something which should certainly be looked at and revised in the light of the situation with which we find ourselves confronted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" /> Another area about which the budget is comparatively mute is that of industry and industrial development. Despite any increases which we might project in agricultural output and to which we can hopefully look forward, it is undoubtedly to industry that we have to look for the jobs to reduce unemployment, the taxable capacity to maintain and improve our social welfare and our health and educational services and for a considerable proportion of our exports.</P>
    <P>I find the budget statement gravely lacking in what it has to say.  There is a vague general statement that growth is expected, that exports will rise, that existing incentives are being continued and there, in effect, the budget ends. There are no new incentive schemes, no enterprising or imaginative programmes, export-oriented, in fact no directional stimulus.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister should have dealt much more fully with the area of industrial promotion and with the work of the IDA.  We are told that the reduction in the requirements of the IDA this year is simply a reflection of a falling off a couple of years ago and, in fact, the pipeline at the moment is reasonably full and we can expect increasing results from the IDA's promotional activities in the years ahead.  We would like to know a little bit more about that because it is a very crucial area and the Minister, when replying to the debate, might give us some figures and some projections into the future.  Indeed, he should have done so in the budget and, perhaps, he will make amends in his reply and tell us something about the situation which will arise from this Nixon tax package and what effect this is likely to have on our industrial promotion efforts and whether there is any counteraction he proposes to take in regard to this legislation, which, I understand, will be very injurious, indeed, from our point of view.  Are we just piously hoping that some natural upswing in industrial activity and in the economy will give us the growth we need?  I think we have got to be a little more positive and a little more dynamic than that.</P>
    <P>There was a headline some days ago about the car assembly industry.  I hope <Col N="1658" /> that these shock pronouncements do not represent a real threat to this industry, but let us look at the situation that would arise if there were a real threat and if the industry were in danger.  The Minister is basing his budget and everything else on a growth rate of 4 or 5 per cent this year.  If the car assembly industry were to cease, or go out of business&mdash;we hope it will not&mdash;that could by itself bring that projected growth rate down by 1 per cent. That is a rather sobering thought.</P>
    <P>Another thing I find lacking in the budget is any real effort to come to grips with the problem of the shortage of trained skilled workers.  This is a time when the Minister should be considering a massive injection of financial resources into the training and retraining of workers.  I am not sure if I am correct in this, but I think AnCo's maximum output of trained skilled workers in the year is 1,400. That, of course, will be completely inadequate in the years ahead.  That is another area in which I find this budget very disappointing.  Apart from carrying on what is more or less there already, there is no really important provision for additional industrial training.</P>
    <P>In no other area has the Minister trod so warily as he has done in regard to the question of capital taxation.  I give him credit for the concessions he has made in regard to estate duty.  The increase in the general exemption limits, the additional abatement provisions where a widow and children are concerned, the insurance and superannuation changes, all these will help in many cases to alleviate or completely wipe out hardship.  They are very welcome but, in regard to the provisions regarding abatement for a widow and children, I hope the Minister will consider one aspect which has been drawn to my attention.  I think the figure is £4,000 now in the case of a widow; perhaps the Minister would consider the case of a family in which there is no widow, in which the mother has predeceased the father or both have been killed in an accident.  In that case, I think there is a strong case to be made for giving the same type of abatement to the eldest child <Col N="1659" /> in the family.  Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to consider that between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has introduced these concessions, and they are not insignificant, he has run away from the central question in this area.  That is, of course, the crucial question as to whether estate duty will be abolished and replaced by some new form of taxation on capital.  As the House knows, this was quite an issue in the general election campaign.  In the farming community in particular there was and is a very real concern with the present system of operation of estate duty.  Not alone has the Minister not faced up to the election promise to abolish estate duty but, in one significant respect, he has gone in exactly the reverse direction.  This is one of the most incomprehensible parts of the Minister's budget.  He has introduced these concessions in regard to estate duty and, on the other hand, he has doubled legacy and succession duty. When one has regard to the number of estates, particularly the number of farms, which pass to relatives other than the widow and children of the deceased, this is an extraordinary proposal by the Minister.  Its effect is to a large extent to negative by these increases in succession and legacy duty the reduction the Minister has made in estate duty.  I hope the Minister will explain his thinking in this regard when he comes to reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has trod very warily in this area and has committed himself to very little, except to study the situation and produce a White Paper. I do not blame him for that.  This is a very difficult area and we must all recognise that there are problems in regard to it.  The administration of the present estate duty is complex.</P>

      <P>The rest of what the Minister says in that particular page raises some doubts in my mind at least. This is a very difficult area, and I do not blame the Minister taking his time. He is wise to take his time.  If he is going to abolish estate duty in its entirety and substitute some other form of capital taxation it will take all the ability which we can assemble in this House and in the public service to put together some reasonable and viable alternative.</P>
      <P>I am frequently on record as being against a capital gains tax.  I do not think a capital gains tax is in any way appropriate to our situation for reasons which I have given from time to time. I look with great distrust on the suggestions about a wealth tax.  Our economic and financial situation is different from that in most of the countries which operate such taxes.  It is difficult to get concrete information about how these taxes operate in other countries.  Some people here have been making investigations and trying to discover what way such taxes are administered and the results they yield. It seems clear that in other countries the machinery operating such taxes is not very efficient or effective.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will listen more to realists in this field rather than to the theorists.  It is very easy to be theoretical in this area, but it is not so easy to devise something which is workable, practical and not worse than the system proposed to be abolished.  No matter what has been said in recent agitation, we have not any great amount of accumulated wealth which can be taxed, as the Minister for Finance knows.</P>

      <P>There are a few items of the budget which I want to deal with quickly but which are not of any great significance.  The Minister is going to make provision to exempt from tax earnings from patents. There is one point which I want to mention in that regard.  I have not had time to check this out completely but the proposal outlined in the budget speech suggests that this concession will only be made available where a patent is first registered in this country.  I have a vague recollection that the Americans will not give a patent to anyone if the patent is taken out anywhere else first.  Perhaps the Minister will look into that point and make sure that it does not cause problems. At one time one had to get an American patent first before getting it in any other country.  Otherwise, the American would not give a patent. The budget refers to patents first registered in this country.  I am not sure that the proposal as it is framed at present will be of any great value. It will be restricted to royalties from the patents.</P>
      <P>The Minister might look at this proposal in a broader way.  The outright sale of patent rights is taxable.  If the Minister really wants to encourage patents and inventions in this country he might look at whether exemption from tax could be extended to the outright sale of a patent.  Very often an inventor could get some reasonable return from selling his invention or patent to some remote country in which he was never likely to develop it himself or from which he was unlikely to get any royalties.  He might get a chance to sell the rights for some figure and in such cases consideration should be given to exempting that type of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A provision is also to be included whereby commercial organisations will be permitted to endow a chair in a university.  They will be allowed income tax relief with regard to such endowment.  Perhaps the Minister would examine this also and see whether it could be extended a little or whether it will be confined exclusively <Col N="1662" /> to the universities.  In relation to the similar provisions about the natural sciences it was found desirable to extend them to colleges and schools.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I do not understand, even remotely, what the Minister is talking about in regard to this business of organisations which are devoting themselves to human rights and fundamental freedoms.  I will read a paragraph from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>I also propose to introduce two provisions for the purpose of giving some tax concessions, subject to certain conditions, to bodies established for the purpose of promoting the observance of the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the implementation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>I find that a little bizarre.  I do not know whether there is such a body in existence or whether numerous bodies are going to spring into existence as a result of the Minister's proposals.  I want to point out in regard to these bodies, whoever they may be, that the Minister is proposing something unique.  He is proposing, first of all, that they will get the normal exemption applicable to charities and, in addition, he is proposing that they can avail of the covenant procedures in regard to annual contributions.  I am subject to correction but I doubt if there is any other body in the country which has both those concessions at the same time.  I know there are many bodies which have the charitable concession and there are other bodies which have the covenant provisions applicable to them; but this is something which the Minister must tell us a great deal more about and explain to us in greater detail why he is doing this, what is involved and generally what is the philosophy behind it.</P>
    <P>If he is going to go into this area and extend the provisions in regard to covenants for annual contributions I would certainly ask him to consider making this provision available to Gorta because in regard to our contribution to the underdeveloped world <Col N="1663" /> there is no better mechanism available to us than Gorta.  If there are to be any concessions given&mdash;I want to emphasise that I have not discussed this with anybody from Gorta but as the Minister responsible for establishing it I certainly think that, if there is to be a new approach in regard to these covenants, then organisations like Gorta should receive special consideration.</P>
    <P>It was with some irony I noticed&mdash; and I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs is occupying the ministerial front bench at this stage&mdash;that the Minister has decided to increase the stamp duty on contracts for the erection of office blocks from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  I have a distinct recollection that, when I first brought this in some years ago, the Opposition were inclined to be quite scathing about it and quite doubtful as to its usefulness. The Minister has said that he is to proceed with his examination of all that is involved in changing the provisions with regard to company taxation and, as we know, there is a White Paper already published in this regard.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he should proceed very cautiously in this field.  It is very likely that we will have to carry out some changes in the next few years in regard to company taxation as a result of our membership of the EEC and our obligations to harmonise our tax structures. It would be very foolish and unwise to make any radical alteration in our system of company taxation at this point in time when we might have to change it again in a couple of years' time because of EEC directives and regulations.</P>
    <P>The system we have has been there for some considerable time.  It may not be the best system of company taxation there is, but at least it is working. If it were very ineffective and inefficient perhaps it would be necessary to change it in the short term.  However, it is working reasonably effectively and reasonably well and I do not think it would be wise to bring in something now which we might have to discard later on.  The business community, and indeed the Revenue administrative <Col N="1664" /> machine, have digested some very considerable changes in the last decade or so and have taken them in their stride. We should be reluctant to ask either the business community or the Revenue authorities to undergo two fundamental changes in company taxation in a very short period of time.</P>
    <P>The budget speech makes reference to public servants' pensions and I am very glad to note that the Minister has re-affirmed the decision to bring about full parity with regard to public servants' pensions.  That is something for which he must be commended.  I should like to point out, however, that there is one group of public service pensioners&mdash;I think I am entitled to call them that&mdash;who have not got parity and for whom I think there is no attempt being made to provide parity.  I am referring to former Members of the Oireachtas.  This is something to which the Minister might direct his attention. I learned with some surprise quite recently that there are still former Members of this House drawing pensions which are based on their £1,000 a year rate of remuneration as Deputies of this House.  I think there is a very valid case to be made for giving these men and women parity.  I hope the Minister will look into that without any undue delay.</P>
    <P>There is a very considerable problem at the moment in regard to the provision of house purchase facilities for the private sector.  The Minister makes reference to this in his statement.  That is something to which I would like him to give, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, fairly immediate attention.  It seems to me there is one of two things he can do: he can go in and reorganise the building societies, he can introduce a system whereby he would provide them with capital from the Exchequer and, at the same time, take some control over their forms of lending and their rates of interest and try and get away from this situation which we have at present, this stop-go situation where they give loans this month and do not give them next month and so on.  There is an urgent necessity to do something pretty radical about the building societies or else forget about them and <Col N="1665" /> let them become commercial institutions and concentrate our efforts on the SDAA mechanism.  The problem at the moment is that the limits imposed on the SDAA mechanism are inadequate. It seems to me we should go either one or other of these two ways, either do something to make the building societies more effective and reliable as house purchase lending agencies, or else provide an alternative structure through the local authorities.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the budget, which in one way is satisfactory but which in another way is unsatisfactory, is the question of community affairs. While listening to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare I gathered that considerable progress will be made through his Department in the whole area of community services, amenities and activities.  That is very desirable and something which is needed urgently, particularly in the suburban areas of Dublin and other cities.  However, one matter in that regard that I would like to draw to the Minister's attention is the vital necessity to make some funds available from some source for the provision of community centres.  In Dublin city at present there are no grants available in practice for the provision of community centres and more and more in the suburban areas provision of these centres is becoming an urgent necessity.  All types of community activities&mdash;recreational, sporting, social and other&mdash;are being impeded by the lack of some suitable community centre in which these activities can be pursued.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister for Finance will probably claim credit for the relative increase he has made in the provision for support to sporting organisations.  Taking last year as against this year, the increase is relatively substantial, but I would like to see much greater provision being made for this purpose.  This aid will have to be provided because in most urban areas today the problem of vandalism is becoming so serious that anything we can do to assist sporting organisations and activities is not only desirable but really essential.  Therefore, perhaps the Government would <Col N="1666" /> give favourable consideration, not to a relative increase in this provision, but to a massive increase.</P>
    <P>It is characteristic of this budget that it has not yet, either in the Fourth Estate or in the general public mind, found a popular name.  Some attempt was made to describle it as a Robin Hood budget but that did not get off the ground because, whatever else it is, it is not a Robin Hood budget. It might have helped the poor&mdash; we cannot say it does not do so&mdash;but there is no suggestion of it robbing the rich.  What it does is that it helps the poor and the weaker sections of the community at the expense of a not much better-off section.  This budget will press very hard indeed on the middle class&mdash;the tradesman white collar worker section of our community. With some justification it could be described as a budget designed by the Right for the Left to the considerable detriment of the man in the middle.</P>
    <P>For a long time it has been consistent policy in this country to protect, to help and to support the lower paid and the weaker sections.  That policy has been pursued fairly consistently by all Governments, with a greater or a lesser degree of enthusiasm, depending on the particular incumbent of the Office of Minister for Finance at any given time; but by and large, that has been the approach.  However, in this budget, for the first time, there is a significant development in that regard.  The attempt to help the lower paid sections and the weaker sections of the community has been done exclusively at the expense of the middle class section, the tradesman and the white collar worker.  In pursuing these laudible social objectives, on which it can now be said we in this House are all fairly well agreed, we must be careful not to create a new poor.</P>
    <P>It is possible, with some justification, to criticise this budget in that direction.  There are many people in our community who are not obviously poor and, apparently, not in need but, as somebody has described them, leading lives of quiet desperation These are people on fixed incomes, people to whom it is very difficult to <Col N="1667" /> channel assistance through any of the existing schemes.  This section of the community must be taken into consideration in any grand design that we might put forward for the future of our society.  As the Minister for Health and Social Welfare pointed out, there are many people in the community whose poverty is obvious, but we must also keep in mind these other people to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>This budget could be described also as a budget with a sting in the tail in that, after the euphoria of budget day evaporated, and as the days go on, there is a greater realisation of what exactly is involved in the impositions announced by the Minister.  I think that a great deal of disenchantment will set in in the minds of the general public and, perhaps, ultimately in the minds of the back benchers of the parties opposite.</P>
    <P>I have tried to assess this budget realistically.  I admit that it represents a significant advance in the field of social welfare.  We, on this side of the House, do not deny that.  But we contend that this was going to be a social welfare year anyway and that we had intended doing as well, if not better, in the field of social welfare than the Government has done.  If one leaves aside the generous social welfare provisions, there is not a great deal left of which the Government can be proud.  There are a number of the Minister's proposals which are either objectionable or, at best, unattractive. For instance, I am not enamoured with the VAT proposal or with the provision in regard to rates.  I find the budget seriously lacking in many areas where action, or at least a statement of intent, could have been expected. On strictly economic grounds the thinking behind this budget, as I have endeavoured to show, is neither sound nor coherent.</P>
    <P>Summing it all up, giving full credit for the social welfare advances granting that the budget was put before us by a Government that had just arrived in office, and being as generous as I can about all the different aspects of the budget, I am afraid that in the end I can only award it a very poor pass if not, indeed, an outright fail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened as we expected, to an interesting and thorough analysis of the budget from Deputy Haughey, an analysis made with all the selectivity which is permissible to an Opposition in presenting a critical case, but nonetheless one which made a number of constructive points and which, I am sure, the Minister for Finance would want to take note of in due course.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey said the budget had not yet got a name but it was not a Robin Hood budget.  I shall come back to that point again, but it does seem to me that it is, above all, a budget of social progress.  That is not, perhaps, a very catchy phrase, but it is a description of it, if not a name.  I shall endeavour to show how true this is, true beyond people's realisation.  If the budget has a defect&mdash;and it came across to me very clearly in hearing the budget speech&mdash;it is the sheer number of different things it does.  In fact, it was not possible for the Minister in one hour and threequarters even to mention them all.  Half a dozen very important innovations in the social sphere could not be set out in detail and have, in fact, been dealt with more fully here by the Minister for Social Welfare this afternoon. One of our problems is to get across to people just how much has been done in this budget above and beyond, I submit, the commitments entered into by us in our election manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming to that, I want to deal with a point to which Deputy Haughey was referring early on in his speech and one on which there seems to be some confusion.  He seemed to suggest that there were vast resources available&mdash; wonderful buoyancy of the revenue, and with that and the £30 million from the EEC we should have had no difficulty in doing everything we wanted to do without taxing anybody.  What he did not refer to was the buoyancy of expenditure, the buoyancy of expenditure as it had developed under the previous Government, as the previous Government had planned it in the Estimates which they had prepared and which they left behind them.  The simple fact is that when we took over we were <Col N="1669" /> faced with a volume of expenditure which, in relation to the buoyancy of the revenue as we came later to calculate it, would have left us with a deficit of about £20 million.  This was quite contrary to what had been indicated by the previous Government.  No one listening to the speeches of the previous Government during the election campaign could have thought when the new Government, be it they or us, took over there could have been such a shortfall.  On the contrary, all the speeches suggested there was this £30 million surplus available to play with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy would not mind my interrupting on a point of fact.  He is saying there was a deficit of £20 million to which the previous Government did not refer at election time, but that £20 million deficit must be reduced by the rates provision which you put into the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I was just about to explain that.  Perhaps before making my political point I should have developed the figures further in explanation.  We faced this deficit of £20 million and we faced a number of election commitments, one of which for technical reasons was the most urgent, that relating to the rates.  In order to fulfil that commitment we had to find, in addition to provision made by the previous Government in regard to the normal rise in the health charges and in housing subsidies, for which extra provision had been made, £12½ million. What we did was to prune the Estimate before us by £12½ million so that we were able to deal with this problem of the rates in such a way as not to worsen the £20 million deficit the previous Government had left to us. I think that perhaps because of the two figures of £12½ million&mdash;our pruning of the £12½ million, and the partly but not entirely coincidental £12½ million increase in the cost of our rates commitment&mdash;there has been some confusion.  Therefore, we faced a deficit of £20 million when we took over, not a surplus of £30 million, as Fianna Fáil election speeches had indicated. We faced a situation £50 <Col N="1670" /> million worse than we had been led to believe.</P>
      <P>Despite this, not only did we do what we had promised to do but we did 20 other good things as well over and above those points set out in our manifesto, the things we had committed ourselves to, in addition to the rates provision, which is almost forgotten.  What people should be reminded of is, that the rates would have risen by amounts, depending on the particular area, of around £1 per week, whereas, in fact, the rates have either risen very little or, as in most instances, have fallen, by 29p in the case of Dublin.  For the average small dwelling with a valuation of £20 to £25, the typical house in which rate-payers live, this has meant a saving for them of the order of at least 50p per week and in the case of somewhat larger houses, obviously, <i>pro rata</i> above that figure.  Their purchasing power is increased by that amount as a result of rates remission.  This is something which perhaps they are not aware of, because what we have done is largely to prevent an increase that would have taken place under the provisions of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Then we promised to increase the basic social welfare rates by £1 per week, which is an increase of 20 per cent on the basic rate prevailing hitherto, for example the rate of £5.15 in the case of the old age pension. That we have done.  We promised to start reducing the age at which the old age pension is payable.  That we have done, reducing it to 69 years.  We promised to start the process of alleviating the means test.  That we have done quite dramatically, and again I am not sure people realise how dramatically.  To take an example, a man who previously had private means of £4 a week would have been reduced to an old age pension of £1.90 and would have had to live on total income of £5.90.  Now under our provisions he is in a position where, in addition to his £4 per week, he gets the full old age pension of £6.15, so his income has been raised from £5.90 to £10.15, as a result of this alleviation of the means test, a virtual doubling of income in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> Again, whereas previously no one with an income of more than about £5 per week could get any old age pension, now up to £9.50 the old age pension is payable.  People up to £500 a year are able to get some benefit from the old age pension, whereas previously if they had half that figure they were cut out and got no benefit whatever.  That is a very substantial alleviation of the means test, one which in some instances almost doubles the total income of the people concerned. That commitment we entered into; that commitment we have fulfilled.  Let us recall that until this budget, any means whatever, no matter how small, even if the amount was only a few shillings in the year, was sufficient to reduce a person's pension.  Now, unless a person has over £200 a year or £4 a week, there is no reduction whatever.</P>
    <P>We also said we would increase the children's allowance by £1.50 per child, which in the case of the first child, involves quadrupling the existing allowance and, depending upon the child's place in the family, involves increases ranging from 100 per cent to, at the lowest, about 70 per cent.  There has been some misunderstanding about one aspect of this.  We felt it right not to extend the full benefit of this to the people in the higher income groups. Needing, as we did, money for many social purposes, we thought it was wrong that we should spend money by giving £2 million a year, as it would have been, to people with incomes running into a number of thousands a year who had less need of it, clearly, than those living at the poverty level. Therefore, we decided to make an adjustment to the income tax child allowance.</P>
    <P>This has been misinterpreted.  There are people who believe that in some way this provision is going to take back some of the existing children's allowances.  This is not the case.  In fact, everyone is at least 50p per child better off as a result of this budget. No one loses anything.  Everybody gets some small sum of money and it is only those with incomes probably of £3,000 and upwards who will fail to get the full benefit of the increased <Col N="1672" /> children's allowances, because the provision that the income tax child allowance would be reduced in order to recover the greater part, but not all, of the increase in the children's allowance which we propose to pay, is one which relates to people who, after deducting superannuation contributions, health charges over £50, bank interest, mortgage interest, have incomes in excess of £2,500.  In practice the majority of people with children who have incomes in the £2,500-£3,000 bracket will be making contributions to superannuation of at least 5 per cent or 7 per cent.  In many instances they will have health expenditure sometimes over £50, will have mortgage interest payments, and in many cases will have bank interest payments and overdrafts.</P>
    <P>Let us take the instance of a man earning £3,000 a year, who is paying a 5 per cent superannuation contribution and who has a house mortgage loan of £3,500&mdash;at the present time this amount is no more than a fraction of the cost of a house.  Such a man would benefit from the full children's allowance and none of the increase would be removed.  This is an important point and I hope it will be taken up.  I do not think it is properly understood; in fact, some people think they will be less well off, but this is not the case.  Everyone will be better off with the children's allowances and anyone with £3,000 per year will get the full benefit without any reduction of the increased children's allowances.</P>
    <P>In addition to fulfilling the obligations to which we committed ourselves in our manifesto, we have done many other things which, when accumulated, add up to a social welfare budget, a budget of social progress of which any government in the world could be proud.  This budget has concentrated on the problems of the weaker sections of the community; of families, above all one-parent families, in the social welfare bracket, of poor people, deserted wives and unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>Let us take some examples.  Had we extended to the child dependant in the social welfare code the same <i>pro rata</i> percentage increase as that given in the basic allowance, we would have <Col N="1673" /> been giving 25p per child, in proportion to the £1 per week given in the basic allowance.  However, we doubled that and increased the children's allowance by 40 per cent, namely, by 50p.  In the case of one-parent families, a further 15p is given. The result is that a deserted wife with five children&mdash;in my constituency I have come across a number of such cases&mdash;will find her social welfare payments have increased from £13.90 to £19.90.</P>
    <P>Under another provision that has only become apparent in the detailed setting out of these benefits by the Tánaiste today, if the deserted wife is working for her living&mdash;as many are forced to do&mdash;if there is a question of a social welfare payment she will get the benefit, as a widow will do, of no longer having to make that contribution and she will be £1 per week better off on that account.  A deserted wife with five children is better off to the extent of £6 per week, and if she is working she will be £7 better off as a result of this budget.  That is a dramatic increase of the order of 50 per cent per income and is something of which this Government can be proud.</P>
    <P>We made no promise or commitment to extend the children's allowance beyond the age of 16 years because, in our caution in Opposition and not being sure of the position, we committed ourselves only to those things of which we could be certain. In fact, we have extended the allowance to 18 years in respect of any child who is in full-time education, who is apprenticed, or is incapacitated. This is a long overdue reform because the child allowance in the income tax code&mdash;which is available only to those sufficiently well off to pay income tax&mdash;is extended beyond the age of 16.  In my view it was socially unjust to make such a distinction, not to give the children's allowance to families where the children were continuing in education, in apprenticeship or were incapacitated. I am very glad this reform was undertaken because I have felt very strongly about it for some time.</P>
    <P>Not merely have we reduced the age at which the old age pension is <Col N="1674" /> paid, we have extended the free television licence, travel and electricity provisions to people aged 69 years. We did not commit ourselves to this in our pre-election statement but we have made this provision in the budget.  We promised to move towards eliminating the means test for old age pensioners but, in fact, we have done this also for widows and deserted wives.  With regard to disabled people, there is a means test under which the means of relatives are taken into account in determining the disabled person's allowance.  This means test is being discontinued; again, this is something we did not promise in our pre-election statement.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election we did not make any specific references to the question of home care or domiciliary welfare but in the budget we have provided £1 million per year to give additional funds to voluntary bodies undertaking services like meals on wheels.  This sum is also for the purpose of employing professional social workers to provide the services that are necessary socially, and which will be economically advantageous by minimising the pressure on institutions, many of which have people who could have remained at home and who would have preferred to do so had there been provision made for them. For this purpose trained social workers will be employed&mdash;workers against whom the former Government seemed to have had some unaccountable bias.  There was an extraordinary failure to employ the numbers of trained social workers becoming available from courses carried on in our universities and many of them had to emigrate.  In the last ten years many of these workers had to emigrate to Northern Ireland or to Britain but now at last they are being given a chance to do good work in their own part of the country.</P>
    <P>Although we did not make a promise about a constant attendance allowance for young people up to the age of 16 who are completly handicapped, that is now being given at a cost of almost £1 million per year, and without a means test.  Apparently this was something the previous Government did not <Col N="1675" /> contemplate.  This provision is made on the recommendation of the Council on Mental Health.</P>
    <P>We listened to the recommendations of groups such as the CARE group who are concerned with the problems of deprived children.  Deputies in my party and the Labour Party, with Fianna Fáil Deputies, met representatives of CARE in this House not long before the election and listened to what they had to say.  The meeting was attended by a high proportion of Deputies and Senators and, as a result of that meeting and the many contacts which Deputies on this side of the House have had with CARE since its establishment, we decided that the recommendations made should be implemented and that a child welfare service should be provided.  This involves the training of child welfare officers, the employment of social work supervisors, the provision of community centres, play groups and youth facilities. A beginning has been made in this area by way of the provision in the budget.  We must pay tribute to the work done by CARE and the other voluntary groups who drew the attention of Deputies to particular social problems and thus ensured that they were tackled.</P>
    <P>Under the previous Government an unmarried mother who kept her child got the magnificent sum of 12p per week for the purpose.  She could get home assistance but all she was entitled to as of right was 12p weekly &mdash;that is, 50p per month for the first child under the children's allowance scheme.  We have remedied that situation. If such a mother decides to keep her child&mdash;and it is only proper that a mother should be able to to do so if she wishes&mdash;she will have just under £8 a week as against 12p a week under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In the case of deserted wives, as well as vastly increasing the benefits&mdash;in many cases they will be up 50 per cent better off&mdash;we have also eased the conditions on which these benefits are paid which were unduly rigid, stringent, harsh and, indeed, humiliating.  As well as that, we have eliminated the absured provision which the previous Government <Col N="1676" /> insisted on so meticulously, that any deserted wife divorced by her husband in England should thereby cease to benefit as a deserted wife in this country from our social welfare provisions.  That was the recognition in this country of divorce in a most peculiar way: the only recognition divorce had here was to deprive deserted wives of the benefits they were entitled to if their husbands went to Britain and divorced them, with or without telling them they were doing so.  It was something which was raised frequently in this House and we had Deputy Joe Brennan, as Minister for Labour and Social Welfare, stonewalling us, telling us it could not be done.  The cost of doing it is minimal, the cases are very few, it can be done, there is no legal problem whatever, as we discovered when we got in.  It was just the obstinacy of the previous Government which was responsible for not effecting this simple, inexpensive social reform in the cause of social justice.</P>
    <P>We have also implemented a number of the recommendations in the report on the status of women.  The provisions under which women in domestic service and agriculture had special eligibility clauses which prevented them from benefiting and the 10 year rule in the matter of their contributions have been removed and they are put on an equal footing with other social welfare insurance beneficiaries.  There is also the provision in regard to women's entitlement to benefits after marriage.  The condition forcing them to re-entitle themselves and denying them the right to carry forward the entitlement they had earned by their contributions before marriage has been reformed by this Government.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to the whole system of social insurance, we have decided that it is wrong that the burden should be more or less equally shared between employer and worker, something which is not the practice in the EEC countries on the Continent.  This is part of the code under which a greater share of the burden will be carried by the employer.  The employer here is being helped to carry the additional burden by virtue of the fact that he will <Col N="1677" /> benefit substantially from the rates remission provision.  The benefits he will get under that will enable him to recoup the larger share he will have to pay towards the social insurance stamp.  This, again, is a reform in the interests of the weaker sections of the community at the expense of the stronger sections, part of the Robin Hood element of this budget which Deputy Haughey so conspicuously failed to notice in his analysis of its provision.</P>
    <P>These are some, by no means all, of the social welfare provisions of this Government which have not, perhaps, attracted sufficient interest so far.  In working on this budget, may I say personally the deep pleasure it has given me to have been associated with those reforms?  It has been worth while to have spent eight years in Opposition waiting for the opportunity to get into office to do the things that the previous Government refused to do, things which they could have done, in some cases inexpensive things which did not require much money but which, in the conditions in which they found themselves at the end of 16 years in office, they could not bring themselves to do because their advisers advised against them and they were not prepared to overrule their advisers.  To have been able to contribute to this and to be able, with a clear conscience, to say that we after a couple of months in office have done something really worthwhile towards social progress in this country, justifies the efforts of many years&mdash;I have been a much shorter time in Opposition than many of the others who spent the full 16 years in Opposition&mdash;and gives one a sense of pride at having survived that debilitating period in such good shape as to be able to come into Government and replace with vigour a Government which had failed in the closing years of their period in office to do their duty by the country, and to have been able to show the kind of reforms that could be carried through by a Government determined to push through their reforms and not to be frustrated by any opposition or by any obstacles.</P>
    <P>We have also carried out other reforms that we had promised.  The <Col N="1678" /> VAT on food has been removed.  We listened to some nonsensical arguments on this.  Deputy Colley, in particular, seems to have a genius for finding nonsensical arguments on the subject, though I must say Deputy Lynch came close to him with his concern for two items of the household budget&mdash;why he picked on these I could not fathom, but he seemed to think they were of extreme importance&mdash;bandages for cut fingers and football boots.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we are much more concerned with the food our people must buy every day of the week than with the pair of football boots bought a couple of times in the lifetime of a child or the small expenditure on bandages for cuts. The Fianna Fáil attitude to the removal of VAT from food has been very typical of attitudes of Governments at the end of a long period in office.</P>
    <P>The social advantage of removing VAT from food is self-evident to everybody in the country except, apparently, Fianna Fáil.  I think that, perhaps, many of them saw it but they went to their advisers, their advisers said no, that it would complicate the position, it would mean an additional rate of VAT very difficult to administer.  There was a moment last summer when Deputy Colley, then Minister for Finance, showed himself interested in making this reform.  He told us in the Special Committee that he would be interested in carrying it through if we could show him how it could be done, but he came back a week later, having been brain-washed by his advisers, and told us it could not be done.  He then produced arguments one of which was that the removal of VAT from food would mean cheaper caviar, as if this was a serious objection to it.  The fact that he introduced such a level of triviality into his arguments showed how bankrupt of argument he was.  It showed that he had to accept the advice offered to him because the Government at that stage of their career were no longer capable of thinking for themselves and Deputy Colley had to invent whatever extraordinary arguments entered his <Col N="1679" /> head to cover up the fact that he was simply doing what he had been told by his advisers.</P>
    <P>We in this Government believe that arguments of administrative inconvenience, while certainly to be considered, especially if they carry implications of cost, are not the determining factors in matters of social policy.  Although naturally we received the same advice as the previous Government got about administrative complications, we took our own decisions rather than accepting the decisions offered to us by advisers. That is what a Government are for.  It is right that the advisers to any Government should advise it about the difficulties and problems of any proposal the Government might make.  That is their function.  It is right that the Government should consider these seriously and, having considered them, should then take their decision in the light of the overall social, political and economic considerations.  We took our responsibilities in this matter where the previous Government failed to take their responsibilities.  To attempt to cover up the weakness and the bankruptcy of ideas of the previous Government by talking about caviar, football boots and bandages for cut fingers does not cut any ice.  One has only to quote the speeches of Deputies Colley and Lynch outside this House to produce hilarity and laughter on the part of anybody they are put to.  Any Opposition which are reduced to putting arguments which are so absurd as to make people laugh should look again at their methods of opposition.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this.  Families living on old age pensions spend 40 per cent of their incomes on food. If one can reduce the cost of that by 5 per cent while increasing the other 60 per cent by a much smaller proportion, one succeeds in shifting the burden of the cost from poorer families to richer families who spend only 20 per cent of their incomes on food and a proportion of their incomes on cars, yachts and so on, at a very high tax rate&mdash;Deputy Haughey referred to it as 36 per cent.  Of course they will pay more.  That is the whole purpose of the exercise.  This is part of the &ldquo;Robin <Col N="1680" /> Hood element&rdquo; in the budget which Deputy Haughey has so notably failed to detect in his analysis of the budget and its provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey suggested that this would have to be rectified.  There is a kind of threat there that if and when &mdash;and it is &ldquo;if and when&rdquo;&mdash;Fianna Fáil returned to power, the 5 per cent would go back on food.  Those are the words Deputy Haughey used on behalf of his party, this removal of VAT off food &ldquo;would have to be rectified&rdquo;. I hope those words will appear in the newspapers tomorrow morning and in the radio commentaries tonight so that the people will know where Fianna Fáil stand in this matter and the intentions of Fianna Fáil, should that party return to power.  It is their intention to reintroduce that 5 per cent tax on food.  That is the proposal and attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party and I am glad it has been put on the record of this House and I hope that record will be promulgated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I come now to the estate duties concessions. In this regard Deputy Haughey did say that the Minister for Finance in his budget speech had said merely that he would give consideration to the abolition of estate duty, implying in some way that he was going back on the commitment entered into in the manifesto issued by the National Coalition.  I quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The Government before taking office undertook to abolish estate duty and to replace it with a new form of taxation of capital.  This commitment will be honoured.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to say that this would require detailed consideration and consultation because some of the interests concerned who are anxious to have this changeover have, even since our election to Government, asked us to be consulted.  Some of them had asked us beforehand to consult them on this matter, and clearly any shift of taxation of this kind in the sensitive areas is one that requires consultation.  It is necessary that this consultation should take place.  This will be done by publishing the White Paper which will set <Col N="1681" /> out proposals arrived at after further consideration of the views put to us. That White Paper will then be commented on by the various interested groups and then our proposals for the new system of taxation of capital will be formulated.  This is designed to replace the estate duties.</P>
    <P>Recognising that this could not be done in this budget, and nobody ever thought that it could in view of the complexity of it, but that the estate duty problem had reached serious dimensions, we did in the budget do what we had not in fact promised to do.  We went beyond our promises in this respect.  We made concessions in regard to estate duty by increasing the exemption limit from £7,500 to £10,000, by doubling the abatements, by arranging for the first £7,500 of life insurance benefits to be exempted, by increasing the artificial valuation of land so that net valuations of up to £3,000 rather than £2,000 would be exempt.  All these concessions were made although none had been promised. All we promised to do was as soon as practicable, to replace estate duty by another tax.  We have gone beyond this to alleviate estate duty in the meantime, something which we did not commit ourselves to and which goes beyond the commitments we entered into during the campaign. Here, as elsewhere, we have done more than we promised and in no case have we done less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the inheritance tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The inheritance tax is a tax&mdash;I take it the Deputy is referring to succession or legacy duties &mdash;on property passing outside the immediate family.  That is something which has been increased and properly so.  Our concern is that property passing to the immediate family should not, and should never have been taxed.  In replacement of that other forms of capital taxation, including increased taxation on property passing outside the immediate family, are necessary and desirable.  I will stand over that at any time.  Our concern is that, when a man dies, his widow and his children should not <Col N="1682" /> suffer at that stage by having what he has been able to accumulate and leaves behind him diminished by taxation at that point in time.</P>
      <P>There is no commitment on the part of this Government, nor should there be, to the transmission of property without any taxation when this property goes outside the immediate family to other people.  If that were to be freed of all tax, and if one did not have an adequate capital tax structure, you would merely have a further accumulation of property in too few hands.  We know already that something like 70 per cent of the property in this country is in the hands of 5 per cent of the population. Our job is to move away from that, not to intensify that maldistribution of wealth.  On that basis the changes in taxation which I have outlined and those which will be contained in the forthcoming White Paper are justified and will be implemented.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of this budget which involve tackling the problem of excessive wealth in certain hands.  Deputy Haughey, again in his desire to avoid being able to attribute to this budget the title of a &ldquo;Robin Hood Budget&rdquo;, was careful not to refer to them.  He did not refer to the stringent provisions with regard to business entertainment.  He did not refer to the limitation of the capital allowance for cars so that businessmen who want to show off their wealth by moving around in large and expensive cars would pay for it themselves rather than charging it to the consumer and to the shareholders.</P>
      <P>There is also provision to tax benefits in kind.  There is the provision to get at the phoney three-year life insurance-cum-banking arrangement under which a certain group were offering 19 per cent rate of interest per annum by abusing provisions of the tax code for that purpose.  There is provision to deal with the abuse of friendly societies by gentlemen who, whether they are friendly or not to the ordinary people of this country in their attempts to extort from these people large incomes of great wealth, also abuse the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> All these provisions are designed to tackle the problem of the maldistribution of wealth and to ensure that the rich do not get richer while the poor get poorer.  Here, as in the positive provisions of the social welfare part of the budget, this budget is directed to the redistribution of wealth.</P>
    <P>How was the budget financed?  It was financed to the extent that was necessary in order to reduce the deficit to a figure appropriate to the economic situation at the present time, by increases in taxation, not in income tax despite the threats or warning by the Opposition who when in Government stated that if we came into office, income tax would be increased. It was not financed by increasing company taxation.  We certainly have not made the mistake that Deputy Colley made some years ago and had to retrieve so ignominiously by pulling down again the increase in company tax, which he had so foolishly imposed by raising the rate from 50 per cent to 58 per cent. This was well above the level in neighbouring countries and no increase was made in general expenditure taxes.</P>
    <P>What we did was to adjust Post Office charges merely by the amount that would be sufficient to ensure that the Post Office breaks even in the next financial year, though not enough to make it break even in the current year. We imposed increased taxation on drink and tobacco.  These taxes had not been increased for several years, four years in one case, two years in another. In regard to increases in drink and tobacco&mdash;and this is a point which is too often overlooked&mdash;owing to the peculiar way in which this tax is levied, not as in the case of customs duties, or value-added tax, as a percentage of the value of the goods, but as a specific sum of money attaching to the goods, if we do not increase drink and tobacco taxes over a period of a couple of years we are in fact in real terms reducing these taxes and reducing the price of the goods.</P>
    <P>With the decline in the value of money under the last Government at a rate approaching 10 per cent per annum <Col N="1684" /> the failure to increase drink and tobacco taxes meant that these taxes were yielding in real terms 40 per cent less in one case and 20 per cent less in the other case in terms of purchasing power, in terms of their real value, than when they were imposed.</P>
    <P>Unless one adjusts the monetary value of these taxes from time to time you are in fact reducing them.  Whereas if these taxes were imposed in the same form as value-added tax or the old turnover and wholesale tax, or customs duties, as a percentage of the value of drink and tabacco, then, without having to come near this House to pass a Financial Resolution the tax revenue from these would increase buoyantly each year.  But because of an antiquated system of and because of a technicality, these taxes are levied by a different arithmetic method.  And consequently we have come to this House and purport to increase these taxes when in fact all we are doing is restoring them to the level they were at a couple of years earlier and from which they were eroded by the decline in the value of money during the lifetime of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The other form of taxation increases relate to motor taxation.  They are modest.  I cannot recall how many years it is since they were last increased but the increases in motor taxation are of the order of 10 per cent which is equal to one year's inflation and certainly it is more than one year since they were increased.  The motor taxation as levied, in this budget is significantly lower, in real terms, than it was when last increased by the previous Government some years ago.</P>
    <P>The increases in taxation have merely been designed partially to remedy the erosion of the value of these taxes by the change in money values in recent years and do not represent any net increase in the burden of taxation as it was some years ago when these taxes were last fixed.  Our approach, therefore, has been a modest one.  The increases in taxation have been such as to cause the minimum disturbance; merely to readjust tax levels to the level appropriate to the present value of money after a number of years of rule by the previous <Col N="1685" /> Government.  A budget under which we have not merely implemented our promises but have gone so far beyond them under 20 different headings is one which, with those taxation provisions, we can fully justify and of which, indeed, we can be and are proud.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the social aspects of the budget.  What about its economic effects?  In my view, the economic effects of this budget will be beneficial. The best estimate we got of the kind of growth which the economy would experience in the year ahead, were we to introduce a neutral budget, was that the economy would expand by something like 4 per cent.  This is below the capacity of the economy.  After all, we are in the end of a period of three years during which the previous Government were unable to achieve a rate of growth in any one of those years anywhere near the rate of growth which could be justified by the capacity of the economy to expand.  As a result, there is now a substantial spare capacity in the economy.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the annual growth rate of capacity is certainly now above 4 per cent.  I would think that, even before EEC entry, it had risen to something like 4½ per cent and that now, with the increased capacity unleashed by the impact of the EEC price structure on the output from the land, the capacity of the economy to expand must now be of the order of 5 per cent; indeed, perhaps, more, because the impact of the EEC price structure on our agriculture, on our farmers, has been more dramatic even than I, in my optimistic speeches during the campaign, was prepared to say.</P>
    <P>After three years of relative stagnation in which considerable spare capacity has been built up, and at a time when the capacity of the economy is probably expanding at 5 per cent or more per annum, any failure on our part to push up output to that level would be to deprive our people of possible benefits to which they are entitled and which this country can afford.  Our job in this budget, therefore, was to push up the annual growth rate to something of the order of 5 per cent, or 5½ per cent or 6 per cent.  One could, indeed, have justified pushing it <Col N="1686" /> to something like 6 per cent, or so, bearing in mind the spare capacity that remains after three years of relative stagnation.  But cautiously we aim to put it up to a figure which is about the rate at which capacity is growing per annum, leaving on one side the spare capacity generated in the past three years.</P>
    <P>This is moderate and cautious and it is right that we should be modest and cautious.  It would be unfortunate for the country and unfortunate, indeed, for us as a Government, if we were foolishly to generate excessive growth and create a situation in which we had to pull back the economy at a certain point in a year or two and inhibit its growth in order to prevent its overheating. We have been cautious, and properly cautious, but we have done what is necessary to push up the growth rate and to secure that the increasing capacity of the economy will be fully utilised.  We have done this by having in this year's budget a deficit of the same order of magnitude as&mdash;in fact in real terms identical to&mdash;that which was provided for in the budget last year by Deputy Colley when he was Minister.  Nobody has challenged that and I think rightly so. Nobody has suggested that a deficit is inappropriate to our needs.  It is a cautious and reasonable deficit for us in our present situation and should help to generate the additional growth which we can afford and, indeed, of which we have need.</P>
    <P>In the course of Deputy Haughey's speech I interrupted him at one point when he seemed to be saying that the Minister had not made adequate provision for agricultural credit, although it was not clear whether he was complanning that the Minister had not made adequate provision or had not claimed sufficient credit for doing so. The facts are, as I pointed out by way of interruption, that in column 1246 of the Official Report of the Minister's speech there is a reference to an increase of £11 million, or almost 50 per cent, in the provision for agricultural credit in the current year, a very important addition, indeed, and very timely, an increase which, together with the very great increase in farmers' <Col N="1687" /> incomes, a large part of which is properly being ploughed back into the land, should provide the impetus for further rapid growth in the agricultural sector in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>In 1972 there was an increase estimated at 35 per cent in farmers' incomes.  It appears likely that this year the increase will be again of the order of 20 to 25 per cent&mdash;an increase of something like two-thirds in farmers' incomes in two years.  It is long overdue and not to be begrudged because it was so badly needed.  The starvation of the Irish land by farmers who were themselves starved of income and of the means to use their lands fully, has been a tragic feature of the first half century of independence, forced upon us by the nature of our economic relationship with the United Kingdom which, happily, has now been changed as a result of entry to the EEC.  Now the money is there.  The income is there and the farmers are ploughing it back.  We are helping them with a 50 per cent increase in agricultural credit to plough even more money back into the land this year so that we may achieve a rapid increase in output which is possible, an increase which looks like being beyond the most optimistic assessments made before entry into the Community.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak at length.  I merely want to emphasise the social features of the budget and the economic justification for it.  The budget is well shaped.  I am happy and proud to be associated with it.  The fact that we have reached the point where we have been able to make such social advances, and that so many of our social benefits are now at or close to the level of those in Northern Ireland, and that this has been done in this first budget of this Government, is an earnest of social commitment on our part to continue with this progress in the years ahead.  When we go back to the people in four years time, having carried on the work we started here, they will see a country largely transformed so far as social justice is concerned and one in which, while nothing will be perfect&mdash;because <Col N="1688" /> nothing is ever perfect&mdash;there will have been a great stride forward which will satisfy our people and will, I hope, justify them in returning us for another term of office to carry on the good work.  Certainly the work is well started.  It is work of which this Government are proud and I am proud to be associated with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this budget the Minister reminded me of the man whistling going by the graveyard.  He hoped that he would create some approbation and admiration for the budget.  This budget is like the curate's egg: it is good in parts.  I welcome the social welfare benefits and the benefits for handicapped children, but the Minister will have to admit that the Fianna Fáil Government had set the pattern in recent budgets in this respect.  I hold the Government to be at fault because this year the Government, for the first time in our history, had the benefit of the savings on our subsidies to agriculture due to our membership of the EEC.  But having made impossible promises during the election campaign, they found they were not able to keep them. They started of with a type of &ldquo;do-gooder&rdquo; budget with a little bit for everybody.  The only message this budget has for us, apart from the social welfare increases, is that of a Government trying to go a bit of the road with every man and failing dismally in the process.  The election campaign was fought in this city largely on the question of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parties comprising the National Coalition put forward a kind of half-backed scheme.  They promised they would take the health costs off the rates.  A year ago I pointed out in this House that this was not a good idea because by doing this you would take the rates off the big industrialists and the wealthy people and the gap thus created would have to be filled in in taxation by the ordinary man in the street.  We can now see how the very wealthy elements in our country may well be pleased with the budget because the big office blocks in this city will save by the removal of the health charges from the rates. I notice in the rates book for last <Col N="1689" /> year that the Government pay £750,000 to Dublin Corporation in lieu of the rates on buildings occupied by Government Departments.  If one deducts the health charges from that figure, Dublin Corporation will have to budget for an increase of 3p extra in the £ on this head alone.</P>
    <P>The Dublin rates have not yet been struck.  First of all, amendments have to be made because of the Government decision last Wednesday to remove part of the health charges from the rates.  I wonder how all those people who rightly agitated for a reduction in the rates will feel when they see that the promised bonanza in the rates will not come and they will find very little difference in their total rates bill.  They will also have to face increased taxation to recoup the Government for cutting the health costs.</P>
    <P>That is a very important aspect of the budget because the rates problem presses on everybody, young and old, but particularly on young people buying houses.  It may well be asked why the Fianna Fáil Government did not change the rates system.  They had set up machinery to examine the whole system and I must praise the civil servants who brought forward the first report.  They condemned the rating system and said it should be replaced. That committee had not finished its deliberations when the Government went out of office.  In the election campaign Fianna Fáil promised to take the rates off all dwellings.  There is some sense in that because even though wealthy people might have benefited from this cut in the rates at the same time thousands of young people would also have benefited. They will not benefit under this budget because the big property owners, distillers and brewers, will save many thousands of pounds a year because their buildings will be rated at a lower figure, thanks to the changes in the health charges.  A brewery in Dublin, which is stated to be the biggest in Europe, has a valuation of £125 on a building.  When the health costs are taken off that, I estimate that brewery will save £3 per week on their rates.  This may not seem a large sum.  If you take a resident of the <Col N="1690" /> Benburb Street flats, which are not palatial, he will save very little on the rates on his flat.  This man could have had his total rent reduced through the rates reduction if the Government saw fit to apply the rates cut only to dwellings and not to all property.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is a very experienced member of the Dublin city council, knows what I am saying is the truth.  I can only deplore the fact that the Government did not see fit to accept suggestions which I and other Members of this House made many times.  We are not blaming the Government for not doing this because we argued this during the term of office of the last Government who brought forward a plan to take the rates off domestic dwellings.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases given in social welfare benefits.  I do not think any Deputy will condemn that although he may be overcritical of it. We may say, like Oliver Twist, that we would like more and this is natural.  Somebody may well ask why did the Fianna Fáil Government not do it.  They put forward their programme for the new social welfare plan if returned to power.  This was a far better one than the present Government brought forward.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, in recent years, increased the social welfare payments with less revenue than the present Government have.  It may be said that the present Government are only two months in office and they did not have time to look at our total resources.  On reading the budget speech of the Minister, I am inclined to agree that they did not have time as otherwise they would have done a far better job on the social welfare increases and on many other aspects of the budget.</P>
    <P>The budget statement was very wide-ranging.  I do not think I have ever read such a weighty tome.  The word &ldquo;brief&rdquo; is contradictory because there is nothing brief about this.  The budget has been a source of vast disappointment even to those who support the Government, whether they be Ministers or backbenchers.  We hoped this would be the brave new budget, judging by the speeches of the <Col N="1691" /> Ministers, but there is nothing in this of even the Fine Gael <i>&ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;</i> never mind the great society which the people in the country are seeking.  I wonder if the Minister was inhibited by the promise which he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are said to have given to the tycoons and capitalists in the city when they said they would not nationalise the banks, although this will be mooted by the Labour Party, that they would not take over the building societies and that they would not do anything drastic.  The Labour Party continue to tell us that they are a socialist party. I do not pretend to be a socialist but I think I am like the vast majority of Irish people who want to see the weaker sector in our society getting a fair break and the whole resources of the nation so channelled as to create a society wherein the weakest will have at least a frugal existence.  Even though it is not accepted today we know that in our society there are many sectors in an impoverished state. Therefore, I wonder what the Minister has done with our vast resources. Somebody called this a Robin Hood budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is in every budget introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government increases were given.  Admittedly, we were never satisfied with the amount of the increase but all the efforts of the Government were channelled in the direction of building an economy which would enable us to <Col N="1692" /> give more and more of the national wealth to the weaker sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that if one does not tax commodities every so often prices will fall. People would welcome a fall in prices. Many families today are finding it very difficult to keep up with prices.  Every day of the week prices increase because of inflation.  I do not blame this Government for inflation.  It is a worldwide problem which most governments find it impossible to solve, but there is nothing in this budget to curb inflation and, if it is not curbed, we will face disaster.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of money has been allocated for housing.  I can recall, as can the Minister for Finance, the fact that on two previous occasions when we had a Coalition Government, during each term of office of that Government the building industry ground to a halt.  There are already signs that things are not well in that industry.  If the Government are really sincere that the tempo of the housing drive will not be slowed down they will have to do everything possible to ensure that the tempo does not slow down.  The building industry is the national barometer by which one measures the prosperity, or otherwise, of the nation.  Apart from that, we know that there are long waiting lists for houses in various parts of the country and, added to that, is the fact that we have to deal with obsolescence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be watchful of the manner in which the moneys allocated for housing will be used.  I hope these moneys will be there, not merely on paper but issued in cheques which will be honoured. I hope the present Dublin City Commissioners will not have to do as the Minister and others had to do a few years ago, touting around the various financial institutions in the city begging for money so that the housing drive would not be slowed down.  If there is a hold-up in the industry it is subsequently very difficult to restart it.  The workers lose faith in the prospect of continued employment and they emigrate.  I trust the Minister in his very, very powerful office will <Col N="1693" /> ensure that the money for housing will be there.  I hope he will take cognisance of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said; he said that, because of inflation, money loses its value.  That being so, the present estimate for housing may well be inadequate to ensure a continued drive and high rate of output.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that the Minister intends to deal with the matter of sites and so forth.  I think he will have a very difficult job trying to solve that problem but, having been a member of Dublin City Council and being aware of the great need for housing, I hope he will not be remiss in ensuring a continuous flow of capital.  What I am afraid of is that the Minister may be very, very earnest in regard to the housing drive but there may be other interests who will suggest that money, possibly in short supply, should be diverted into other things or withheld altogether.</P>
    <P>The Government will be judged by their attitude to housing.  I am not one of those who cry &ldquo;housing emergency&rdquo;&mdash;I have never understood what it meant actually&mdash;but, if the Government are going to keep their promise to build 25,000 houses in the next year, they must remember that the sinews of house building are money.  It is a pity the Minister did not see fit to give some income tax relief to workers engaged in the building industry.  It is not a soft trade.  The men have to work in all weathers and work very hard indeed.  Some incentive should be given to encourage more young people to go into the various building trades.  I do not think the Minister dealt with this but I hope he will keep it before him because of the importance of the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister increased the duty on tobacco and beer.  I do not criticise him for that but I recall the great outcry by the then Opposition about interference with the working man's pint when Fianna Fáil Governments increased the taxation on beer.  It always sounded a bit hollow and hypocritical.  In this budget both the pint and cigarettes are heavily taxed, proof of the hypocrisy of the then Opposition when they criticised the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> They alleged these were necessities, not luxuries.  This imposition shows up the emptiness, the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Labour/Fine Gael Coalition when they were in Opposition. The Minister had to get the money somewhere.  As Deputy Haughey and others pointed out, he was in a very favourable position to disburse the national wealth without imposing any new taxes.</P>
    <P>Someone once said a week is a long time in politics.  It does not seem a week since we sat here and listened to the Minister read his budget statement. It was quite a long one and a very interesting one.  I recall the promise during the election campaign to curb prices.  I have always said that a Government like ours cannot do a great deal to control prices because we have to import so much raw material. and because of this we are at the mercy of those who supply the material.</P>
    <P>Anybody in business will know that on opening the mail in the morning he may find a manufacturer has informed him of an increase of 2½ per cent or 5 per cent in a commodity.  One can look for another supplier in Britain or on the Continent but one will find that, either accidently or deliberately, most prices have been increased to the same level as the original supplier asked.  The businessman can put up with the increase or do without the commodity. The Government may not have the power to control prices but they can do a certain amount.  Fianna Fáil established machinery for controlling prices in so far as they can be controlled.</P>
    <P>Last week we had an interesting little episode concerning the CIE fares. The Minister for Industry and Commerce rejected the application for an increase in fares.  How long will he continue rejecting that application? Will he tell CIE that they must continue their present fares and that the Government will reimburse them with a greater subsidy than heretofore? That is one way of solving the problem. The taxation to raise the necessary money would have to come from the pockets of the people.  Possibly the increases in fares may come any day after tomorrow week, when a very <Col N="1695" /> important election is being held.  We may see the increased fares coming then, and the people will then have to face the fact that the Government have broken yet another promise.</P>
    <P>In any shop today the housewife notices the increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs from day to day.  I am not going to blame the Government totally for that.  I am blaming the Government because they suggested during the election campaign that they could control prices.  They may be able to do so when we have deflation instead of inflation here.  Perhaps it might then be easy to control prices, but by then it will not be necessary to do so.  That is the only hope I can see of the Government bringing down prices.  During the election campaign the people should not have been told that the National Coalition parties, if elected to power, would make this country a land flowing with milk and honey and a land for heroes to live in.  One cynic was heard to say &ldquo;One would want to be a hero to live in this country&rdquo; The Government have deliberately increased the telephone and postal charges.  Many other prices have also been increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald, Minister for Foreign Affairs, spoke about a return after four years.  The Minister is indulging in wishful thinking.  If the people were given an opportunity of making a decision in a practical way on the budget they would act in a very definite manner which would cause the Minister and the Government to do some serious thinking on their financial policy and on the thinking which went into this budget.</P>
    <P>For some years we have had a serious unemployment problem.  I cannot see anything in this budget which will encourage rapid industrial development. More and more people will leave agriculture.  This is a problem not alone for us but for every country in the world.  This has been going on since the Industrial Revolution.  I do not blame the Government for not solving this problem, but I blame them for not taking steps to ensure that the people leaving the land can be absorbed <Col N="1696" /> into industry.  I can find nothing in this budget which will give hope to the boys and girls leaving the rural areas and heading for the cities or across the channel.  I would hate to see emigration starting again.  For the first time since the famine emigration is almost nonexistent. Our people, who are very proud in many ways, will not tolerate living on social welfare benefits if they can be given gainful employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister when replying might perhaps, for my own dull brain or for other people similarly puzzled, tell us how the Government propose to revitalise industry which is lagging or how they will deal with the present threat, or rumoured threat, to the workers in the car-assembly industry, and what steps they will take to ensure that the promises given to these workers that they would be safe enough until the middle-1980s are going to be kept.  These are matters which worry many thousands of our workers in the assembly trades today. Will the Minister review the Redundancy Act or will he ensure that these workers will not become redundant? Many of these workers voted for the Government.  They excercised their choice in a democratic way.  I approve of that.  The decision they made in voting for the Government was arrived at because of the promises given.  We will try to ensure that those promises are kept.</P>
    <P>I remember the Labour Party document of 1969 which I read avidly at the time.  In it there was mention of a form of socialism which was potent, if outdated.  They came forward with a new republic.  It was to have been a real socialist state.  The fact that other prosperous European nations regarded the philosophy of that document as being outdated did not daunt the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>This budget bears very little resemblance to the socialist budget promised by the Labour Party for many years.  I could not find any part of it which would suggest that <Col N="1697" /> there was any extreme socialist thinking behind it.  I welcome the higher payments in social welfare and one or two other parts of it but where is the budget that was promised by the Labour speakers to greet the brave new world we are going to live in? Does this budget reflect the thinking of the Fine Gael economists and not of the Labour Party?</P>

      <P>I would say in fairness that I believe the leader of the Labour Party is committed to a just social policy but I do not find this in this budget, especially when one remembers that, unlike previous Ministers for Finance, Deputy Ryan had the resources to come forward with, and not just his own ideas and those contained in the Fine Gael Party policy document on a just society.  The people had hoped they would come forward with a policy for the great society. That, I know, will not emanate from this budget.  It is a rather watery and weak social document which, apart from the increased social welfare benefits which will go to the people who need them, contains gestures to the wealthier classes in our society. The rates remission alone will show that the Government were not sincere in seeking to distribute the wealth of the country in an equitable fashion so that those needing it most would receive the biggest share.  It seems a short time since the Minister stood there to reveal his plans and, while we may differ on party politics, there is not one Member of this House who would disagree with the Government if they brought in social welfare benefits of the very highest order but this has not been done.  The Minister has misused the resources available and, in trying to be all things to all men, he has penalised the weaker sections. If anyone doubts that let him have a look at the various allocations and how they will be used.  There is £12 million for rates easement.  How much of that will go to the social welfare sectors and how much will go to the wealthy industrialists?  One big brewery will save £3 a week on rates on one building alone.</P>

He only has to cross the Liffey to see this giant brewery for which the Government in their socialist policy, have seen fit to ease the burden of rates.  The Government may claim that because of the increased contribution by employers that that will offset that saving.  Of course we know well the employers simply increase prices with the permission of the Government and recoup any loss they might have.</P>
      <P>To me the budget is like the curate's egg, it is good in parts but the bad parts form the greater part of the total. Therefore we must oppose the budget to show up the emptiness of the promises of the parties who formed the National Coalition and to show that they have not kept face with the people who voted for them.  I admit that it is a difficult task to bring forward a budget which will please everybody. We should not try to please everybody. The people we should try to please are those who are in need and who are in want.</P>

      <P>That was not done.  You tried to go a bit of the road with everybody, to be all things to all men. That meant that there was less for the people who really needed it after you had looked after the tycoons and the industrialists.  I would like to see the day when we could have a social welfare code equal at least to that of any other country.  The Government will claim that we are almost on parity with and, indeed, in front of some of the benefits being paid in the Six County area.  In fairness to the Government they have given these benefits here without a huge subvention from <Col N="1699" /> another power but they did have an initial subvention by reason of the saving on subsidies no longer payable because of our membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a strange statement this evening. He said that the growth in GNP should be at least 4 per cent next year but that they knew it would be more.  If they knew, why did they not budget for a greater expansion of our social welfare services or aids to industry or to education? They are saying they think the growth rate will be 4 per cent.  I hope it will be more but what will happen if the rate is greater than 4 per cent?  Why did the Government not have the courage to say: &ldquo;If we have 4 per cent, we shall give X pounds in social welfare increases?&rdquo; Believing that the growth will be more than 4 per cent but not increasing the aids I have mentioned is wrong and suggests that the Government have been afraid of some sector.  An article published in <i>Hibernia</i> some time ago said that the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs had reassured the financial interests that they would not do anything to upset the <i>status quo</i> in regard to finance.  I do not know whether the Ministers gave any such assurance but if they did, it is easy to understand why they are so hamstrung now in not being able to put forward an expansionist budget.</P>
      <P>When I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs this evening putting forward his usual barrage of figures, it occured to me that here was a man who knew the price of everything but who knew the value of very few things. The Government should be able to retain the faith of the people in the promises made.  It is the duty of any Government to use the national wealth for the common good and not for the good of a certain sector especially when that sector are people who are well heeled.  No Government should divert money to people who are rich while that money is needed for the provision of extra housing and for better social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are aware that such people as <Col N="1700" /> widows, orphans and the disabled are very glad because of the proposed increases in their payments.  Of course, we are all very pleased that these increases are being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases in the past have been greater if one takes into account the fall in the value of money.  Because of inflation it should be necessary today to give at least 10 per cent extra on any benefits.  In his contribution the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that if extra tax is not put on any one commodity for three or four years, as has happened in the case of cigarettes, the effect is to reduce the price of that commodity.  Governments all over the world are endeavouring to reduce prices.  The Minister was defending the increase in tax on cigarettes and drink.  I am not criticising the imposition of additional tax on these items.  Perhaps it would be good to impose extra taxation on cigarettes and alcohol if this would have the effect of preventing people from smoking and drinking but to increase the taxes simply to ensure a higher price level is not right. There are many people who regard cigarettes and alcohol as necessaries. Of course, the Minister's idea was to take in more revenue and nobody could disagree with that provided it is done in such a way as to affect people who are able to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that members of both Fine Gael and Labour will agree that there are defects in the budget.  On budget day the backbenches of both parties sat here thinking that the great moment had dawned.  It did dawn but not in the way they expected.  In this first year of our membership of the EEC this budget has failed to bring us more into line with many of the wealthier European countries.  In a recent editorial in the <i>Evening Herald</i> it was stated that the middle class section of our community do not regard this budget <Col N="1701" /> favourably.  Any mention of class nowadays sounds like a remnant of the Victorian age but if we are to refer to the middle class sector then we must remember that tradesmen with a basic wage plus overtime would be in the £2,400 bracket which bracket is now regarded as indicating that a person is in the middle class.  However, the Government did not consider a reference to the middle class sector to be outdated when they taxed in various ways the people in this category.</P>
    <P>We may not be one of the wealthier nations of Europe but we have sources of untapped wealth.  There is also untapped wealth on the Government side when they do not see that, through their political philosophy, in their first budget they could have put forward a plan for the creation of the great society, that is, a society in which every family would have proper housing and a proper standard of living.  The Government may say that they have been in office for only two months and ask how could they have done this but the point is that the budget did not lay the foundation for any such expansion.</P>

I do not know whether that was a Marx or an Engels or any other sort of document but is there anything in the current budget to suggest that there is any socialist thinking in the Government? When I refer to socialism I am thinking of the modern socialism of such countries as Sweden and West Germany. The Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned that 5 per cent of people in this country own 70 per cent of the wealth.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I shall simply deal at length with the Labour Party's New Republic document which we are told has in some way influenced this budget.  Having sat for two hours listening very carefully to the Minister last Wednesday, I cannot see that there is any kind of extreme socialist thinking in this budget.  It is a budget of a very right-wing set-up.  They must look, first of all, to the captains of wealth and industry to ensure their continued support.  Therefore, as published in one of our Dublin periodicals, a guarantee was given beforehand to the <Col N="1705" /> wealthier sections that this Government would not do anything unorthodox or what they would call unorthodox in regard to distributing a greater part of the wealth among those who need it.</P>
      <P>We know that for the next year we will be told about the increased social welfare payments, but, with the present rate of inflation, these payments will have lost a great deal of their real value in six months time, as money loses its value all the time.  It is a pity the Government could not have spent more time preparing this budget and less on the gimmickry we have been receiving every day of the week.  Had the Fianna Fáil Party been returned to power, they had stated before-hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil never waited.  Every year they have increased social welfare benefits at a time when they did not have the EEC benefits.  However, I know the Deputies on the far side are disappointed with this budget.  I can understand their disappointment, but I am more interested in the failure of the Labour Party to put their stamp on this budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dowling rightly remarks, it is a Fine Gael budget, and therefore a right-wing budget.  Since successive Ministers of Fianna Fáil Governments have in every budget, increased social welfare payments, the National Coalition would not have the audacity to come into this House without giving some social welfare increases.  While I welcome the increases given, I am wondering what happened to the philosophy of the new Republic which we were promised four years ago.  Where is that gone?  Is there any evidence of it in this budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is.  Where is it?  Is it not a fact that postage stamps and telephone calls are to be increased? Or the price of clothing and footwear, and even the price of food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> Anybody who believes that when VAT is removed from food there will be a price reduction is certainly an optimist.  This budget will be judged, perhaps, not for what is in it but for what is not in it, and the Labour Party, particularly, in the next few months, are going to have to answer many critics in various places as to why they have backed this budget and did not demand such things at a capital gains tax.  It will be remembered that the Labour Party used to attack us on that side of the House and call people like myself and Deputy Dowling reactionaries because we did not have a capital gains tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the biblical saying: &ldquo;Not by bread alone doth man live...&rdquo; may have influenced them but, as Deputy Dowling has rightly pointed out, they have reduced the size of the loaf.  Even in wealthy socialist countries like West Germany and Sweden, 95 per cent of the property is owned by private enterprise.  In our country it seems that in order to balance the budget we have to cut the size of the loaf.  If Fianna Fáil had done that they would have been hounded by the Labour Party as very bad capitalists but when Fine Gael reduced the size of the loaf, loyally&mdash; or perhaps, disloyally&mdash;they are backed by the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formation of the National Coalition Government has shown that the Labour Party have no idea of what socialism is, apart from a right-wing &ldquo;do-good&rdquo; type of philosophy where a little wealth is given to people to keep them quiet.  We realise that in order to build a great society in which the most humble of citizens will have certain basic rights it will be necessary to tax the wealthy.  To achieve social justice we know it will be necessary to stand on someone's corns, but I suggest it is better to stand on the corns <Col N="1707" /> of people who can afford a better type of footwear.</P>
    <P>What the Government have done is to increase the price of bread for the widow and the orphan.  Deputy Kyne mentioned how many people would benefit in the budget.  This is true but there is a contra-item on the other side of the page which shows that people will have to pay more taxation, more postal and telephone charges.  They will also pay for a smaller loaf, and, if things get really bad, they may have to pay for some kind of ersatz loaf which will be the product of the National Coalition.  I hope their baking of this loaf will be better than their financial thinking or their social philosophy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The economist Adam Smith said that in order to have a prosperous and well-run nation it was necessary to increase the size of the national loaf, but in this instance the Government are reducing the size of the loaf.  The amount of wealth in the country that should be distributed to those in need is reduced drastically. When the people get an opportunity, they will show the Government what they think of the broken promises.  Our proposals regarding the rates were more realistic.  Even before the budget the Minister for Local Government said that what we were proposing to do regarding the removal of the health charges was bad economics.  He also said that our proposals were not practical but it is easy to obtain information from local authorities regarding the ratings on dwellings and flats and on industry.  If the Government had done this they would have had more money to distribute and would have given some substance to their promise to distribute the national wealth.  In the future the Labour Party will pay dearly for the relief they have given the wealthy owners of office blocks and palatial manors, the breweries and the distillers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> In trying to fulfil some of their rash promises the Government had to act quickly.  Last week the Minister for Local Government said that our suggestion of not taking health charges from office blocks, factories and other money-making bodies was desirable but not practical.  We demonstrated it was practical and I hope the Government, even at this late stage, will give the matter second thoughts.  When they bring in the new budget in the autumn after the Presidential election&mdash;after which time we will have won the Monaghan by-election&mdash;I hope they will have done some re-thinking regarding distribution of the national wealth.  By that time the Labour Party may have discovered again some of the beliefs of the founders of the party and will cut adrift from Fine Gael which is leading the Labour Party to destruction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with pride that I support the budget.  It was fashioned by the ability and talents of the two great parties forming the Coalition Government.  Before the general election they put before the people a 14-point programme which the people judged.  They gave a mandate to the National Coalition Government to implement that programme.  This Government in a short period of two months have introduced most of their 14-point plan.  Listening to Deputy Moore one would not think we were discussing the same budget.  Does Deputy Moore want to face up to the facts?  I will outline them for him in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a great social budget, the greatest since the foundation of the State.  We have in it all the elements of the Papal Encyclicals on social thinking and reform.  In this budget we have attempted to distribute the wealth of the nation, to give to the less well off, to the deprived and the underprivileged. It has been said that a nation can be judged on how it treats its older citizens and the other less privileged in its community.  We are confident that when the Irish people become more fully aware of the vast improvements in this budget they will, despite Deputy Moore's doubts, give a <Col N="1709" /> further mandate to this great coalition Government.</P>
    <P>I shall risk boring the House by giving some of the facts, some of the information which Deputy Moore has not studied apparently.  The improvements we have given are in the form of tangible hard cash and those who will mainly benefit are the poor. We have improved social welfare benefits of all kinds.  We have provided for retirement pensions at 65 years, we have improved the adult dependant allowance, we have improved the old age contributory pensions. I could go down along the whole list of improvements but if Deputy Moore or any other Opposition Deputy wishes to do so they can find them in the Library.</P>
    <P>More than 780,000 of our people in this small nation will benefit.  Of particular interest to me is the old age care allowance.  This has been improved so that older people will no longer feel embarrassed.  They can now be looked after and cared for in their homes by the younger couples.  We have improved the lot of deserted wives and unmarried mothers.  We have given increased disablement benefits and we have extended the period from 16 years to 18 years for children's allowances.  We have alleviated the abominable means test for deserted wives, old age pensioners and widows.  One million pounds has been set aside for continuous home care for elderly people.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the social welfare improvements in our 14-point plan we promised to abolish death duties.  This we will do.  In the meantime we have invited all those concerned to give their views and a White Paper will be issued in the near future on the most equitable form of taxation.  We will not renege on any points in our plan.</P>
    <P>In that plan we promised to remove VAT from foodstuffs.  We were told today that the lower income group spend more than 40 per cent of their incomes on food.  The removal of the 5.2 per cent VAT from foodstuffs will be a comparatively big saving for these people.  Admittedly, there has been a small increase of 1.09 per cent, roughly 1½p in the £, on certain items such as <Col N="1710" /> clothing and footwear but surely that very small increase will be offset by the removal of VAT from foodstuffs.  So will the small increase on such things as football boots and bandages for cuts. Coming from Tipperary, I know that the great hurlers and footballers of that county do not begrudge the aged and the other less privileged the little extra they will get from this 1½p on football jerseys, hurleys and footballs.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase of 1.23 per cent on furniture and furnishings, cleansing materials, kitchen equipment and so on.  These items are not bought so frequently and the people who buy them are magnanimous enough to pay willingly the little extra margin in order to contribute their share to the welfare of the less well off.  There has been a small increase on cars, motor cycles, television sets and so on.  The percentage is 6.39.  Again, the people who can afford to buy these will not begrudge the small increase so that the under-privileged will get extra benefits.</P>
    <P>The removal of VAT from food was one of the points in our 14-point plan and if Deputies are here long enough they will see all the other points implemented. In this budget we have helped the younger couples setting up homes by a reduction in the stamp duty.  In respect of a house not exceeding £1,000 in value the duty is nil, on a house exceeding £1,000 but not £2,000, the duty is ½ per cent; on a house exceeding £2,000 but not £6,000, the duty is one per cent.  Most young people acquiring their own houses will come within the £6,000 range.</P>
    <P>The money has to be found somewhere and there has been a small increase in taxation on tobacco, spirits and beer.  I would remind Deputies that the Government have been advised by medical authorities that smoking is detrimental to health.  I hope that this extra taxation on tobacco coupled with the advice from the medical authorities will restrain people from over-indulgence in cigarettes, spirits or beer.</P>
    <P>A lot has been made of the increase in postal charges but how often, in reality, does a widow, a deserted wife or others in need write letters, send <Col N="1711" /> telegrams or make telephone calls? One penny per letter is the amount that any widow will have to find each week to post a letter and in most cases such a person would only write one letter per week.  The less well-off section of our community have no telephones so this increase in charges for telephone calls will not affect them.</P>
    <P>I see this budget as a move towards bringing us into line with our EEC partners.  Deputy Moore was worried about the social thinking of the Labour Party and their &ldquo;New Republic&rdquo; and my own party's &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;.  This budget is the best of both worlds, the best of the &ldquo;New Republic&rdquo; and the best of the &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;.  We put it proudly to the people because we know well that they will accept it.  The people realise that the Government gave the money to the necessitous cases.  They realise that the Government taxed minimally those sections who are able to pay the tax.  I have no doubt that the people will accept it in their Christian outlook as an obligation enshrined in all our teachings and traditions.  We must help out the needy and the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>Moving from the social welfare improvements we come to the vast injectment of capital that has been put into the economy: £56 million has been injected into the public capital programme, more than in 1972-73. Of this, £21 million will go towards housing.  Everybody, whether they are living in urban or rural Ireland, will agree that housing has been one of the main sources of discontent during the past 16 years of misgovernment and mismanagement.  A sum of £21 million is to be injected into the economy in this housing drive to live up to the promise of building 25,000 new homes for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The sum of £3½ million is to be injected to improve the educational programme.  This money will be used to replace old schools, putting additions to schools that are at present overcrowded and also towards improving the pupil/teacher ratio.  In the agricultural field, £11 million extra has been placed at the disposal of the <Col N="1712" /> farming community to enable them to derive maximum benefit from this country's entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>Industry is to receive an extra £9 million to bring the total for this section to a record £51 million.  This money is being injected into the economy as part of the drive to encourage more industrialists to Ireland.  The ESB is getting £7 million, to ensure that power will be provided in most rural areas and, in particular, in places neglected by the past administration.</P>
    <P>In this expansionary budget we have reached a new dimension in social thinking in Ireland, a new concept, a new Ireland.  Deputy Moore would have us believe that this could only have been brought about by Fianna Fáil.  This budget has been engineered by the talents and the abilities of the Coalition Parties.  They placed before the people their 14-point plan which the people accepted.  The people do not regret the decision they took in February and, I have no doubt, that when we go back to the people again our mandate will be increased.</P>
    <P>In this budget, the first by the National Coalition Government, all sections of the community have benefited. A vast injection of £39 million has been given to the social welfare sector.  This will serve to improve the lot of almost one million of our people. Deputy Moore would have us believe that this is not a product of socialist thinking.  Our social services are now almost in line with and in some cases in advance of, those in Northern Ireland which is akin to England which is regarded as a socialist state. Surely the socialist thinking of our European partners is reflected in this budget.  We stand behind it as we did behind the 14-point plan and we know that the people of the country will accept it.</P>

      <P>When I entered this House on the afternoon that the budget was introduced I did so with a feeling of trepidation about my political future.  Were I to believe the members <Col N="1713" /> of the Fourth Estate the budget to be introduced was to be a revolutionary social welfare budget which would remedy all of the inequalities in this State.  However, I left with a feeling of amazement at the fact that the opportunity which was presented to the Minister by the EEC money and by the healthy state of the economy when it was handed over to him by Fianna Fáil had been completely wasted. Instead of producing a progressive social welfare budget it was, in fact, a retrograde step and a recipe for economic disaster.</P>
      <P>The budget of 1973 will be looked upon in the years to come, by the public and by the political correspondents at large, as the first pealing of the deathknell of the Coalition of the seventies.

      <P>He made a very good speech.  It would be dishonest on the part of any Member of this House to say that is everything is wrong and nothing is right with this budget.  There were very many welcome social welfare changes.  Nobody in this House would begrudge increases given to the old or the less well off sections of our community. What I criticise is the niggardly way in which some of them were handed to the public and then taken back.  There was the callous breaking of the promise to reduce the old age pension qualifying age from 70 years to 65 years.  This promise was made during the election campaign and, to save face, the age was reduced from 70 years to 69 years.  Surely it would have been better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his budget statement the Minister said that the Government had decided to expand economic activity to obtain a higher growth rate.  Then he proceeded to kill all incentives to workers and businessmen alike to become involved in the expansion of economic activities. He has given no increase in earned income relief to the workers, with the exception of a paltry £30 relief to the working wife.

He has increased the road tax, the price of cars, the price of petrol, through an increase in VAT which must come inevitably, and he has increased the price of many other items.  He has increased the basic cost of raw materials.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Assuming that our competitiveness is not seriously affected by the likely rise in unit production costs....</P>
      <P>He increased all those items, left no incentive for the workers and, at the same time, he talks about increasing unit costs.  To me that looks very much like a wage standstill.  That is a personal opinion.</P>

      <P>That sounds as if it is building up very rapidly to a wage freeze.  The Minister also said:</P>

      <P>Steps have been taken, under the Housing Acts, to bring the price of new houses under conrol.</P>
      <P>  In the blue document &ldquo;Principal features of budget presented to Dáil Éireann on Wednesday, 16 May, 1973, by Mr. Richie Ryan, T.D., Minister for Finance&rdquo;, the Minister talks about keeping down building prices but in his decision to increase VAT from 5.26 per cent to 6.75 per cent, an increase of 20 per cent, there are a number of items listed.  While there is an increase of 1.49 per cent on most building materials we find further on in the document that there is an increase of 3.13 per cent on items which are essential for a house.  These include fitted kitchens, all electrical goods, electric wiring and electrical fittings, which are essential for any house.  While the Minister talks about keeping down the price of houses he is at the same time putting on at least a 20 per cent increase in VAT on most of the items which go into the construction of a house.  Who is to bear this cost?  Surely the price of the house must go up?</P>

      <P>They must be. What is to be done about the building societies issue and the provision of loans for young married people anxious to buy their own homes?  We see from this inflationary budget that there will be an increase in the price of houses.  Will this further exacerbate a difficult situation where at the moment loans cannot be obtained? This will be even worse in the future. Is the solution to this the injection of massive sums into the SDA schemes and the revision of them to open them to a much wider net in order to bring more people into them, to increase the income limit from £3,800 in the Dublin area, which I understand is slightly less in the country areas?</P>
      <P>The situation cannot be let continue in this stop-go manner where building societies are open for applications today, they are closed tomorrow, they are open the next day and closed again the following day.

      <P>I come now to the issue of value-added tax and the promise made by the Coalition parties to remove value-added tax from food immediately on election.  We know well that value-added tax will not be removed immediately.  It will not be removed until 1st September next and I do not think any of us are naïve enough to expect that between now and 1st September there will not be an increase in the price of food, an increase which will more than compensate for the reduction of the 5.26 per cent tax.  But, as if that were not bad enough, the Minister, while taking the tax off food, has at the same time increased the tax on clothing and footwear.  Those of us who are familiar with the realities of life in this day and age know that not a week goes by in any family in which some <Col N="1721" /> item of clothing, be it drapery or footwear, has to be purchased.</P>

      <P>I will come to the football boots in due course.  All these items will be increased in price. What about books, newspapers and periodicals?  This is possibly the most detestable increase because children's school books will become dearer. There was a man who ruled in Germany not so many years ago who did not believe in reading matter being accessible to the people.  He burned the books.  We have a Government which increases the tax on books.  Costs will increase for publishers. Postage is going up.  Value-added tax will be added to these extra expenses and the people finally will have to pay increased prices.</P>
      <P>Non-oral medicines, which cover a very wide field, will be increased in price because of value-added tax.  Soft drinks and sweets will be increased in price.  Children's allowances are increased, presumably to show we cherish the children of the nation, and, at the same time, there is this heartless attack on commodities like soft drinks and sweets.</P>

We find an increase in value-added tax <Col N="1722" /> on hotel services of 20 per cent, an increase from 5.26 to 6.75, and this at a time when we should be doing all in our power to build up the tourist industry to the maximum extent possible. This is, indeed, a reprehensible decision.  I only hope the decision is not final and that the Minister will forthwith retrace his steps.</P>
      <P>We have a thriving furniture industry. What are we doing to assist the industry?  The Minister, with a stroke of his pen, is increasing the value-added tax from 16.37 to 19.5, an increase of 3.13 on all furnishings. Electrical goods, hardware, kitchenware will all go up by 3.13 under the value-added tax element.</P>
      <P>I come now to the item about which Deputy McMahon was so worried&mdash; sporting equipment.  This will go up in price.  One of the things we should be doing is encouraging our youth to become involved in sport, be it football, hurling, what-have-you.  You name it.  What are we doing?  In this budget value-added tax on sports equipment will go up from 16.37 to 19.5, an increase of 3.13.  Is this designed to encourage youth to take part in sports?  The Department of Education give grants to sporting associations.  We heard the Parliamentary Secretary on the subject earlier today.

      <P>These increases will inevitably bring increases in prices, directly and indirectly.  They will result in demands for extra money, and rightly so, from the workers of this country.  We are all workers.  We all work, whether in school, house or factory. There will be demands for increased wages.  We are told in the Minister's speech, from what I understand, that demands for extra money will be met by a large &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and that wage and salary developments can best contribute towards the objective, which is a reduction in inflation.  This is a recipe for increased inflation.  This Government have a great responsibility to bear.  They are putting the country in a difficult position.</P>

I quote from that journal the words of Deputy John Bruton, now Parliamentary Secretary, who was then Fine Gael's spokesman on agriculture.</P>

There is an increase in tax free allowance of £30 to a married woman.  There is no increase for the single male or female workers.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important decision made by the Government was in relation to the transfer of the health charges and housing subsidies from the rates to the Central Exchequer and the two Ministers most immediately concerned in that decision were the <Col N="1726" /> Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  The importance of this matter which I am raising here this evening is that the records of this House now show that those two Ministers were either ignorant of basic information which the Government should have had before them when making that decision or, alternatively, that they knew the situation but in answer to Parliamentary Questions deliberately misled this House.  When this matter first occurred, as the record will show, I gave the benefit of the doubt, particularly to the Minister for Local Government, but the subsequent events in this regard seem to show that I was too charitable in giving the benefit of the doubt to the Minister for Local Government and that, in fact, he was aware of the situation.</P>
      <P>The story, as far as the records of this House are concerned, commences on Thursday, the 3rd of May and it is reported in Volume 265 No. 4 of the Official Report at column 443 and column 444.  In the course of supplementary questions I asked a question and I am reported as follows:</P>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the major portion of the cost to the Exchequer involved in this will be spent in relieving rates on dwelling houses or on other property?</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully replied:</P>
      <P>The Deputy is so well aware of that that, in fact, his party were attempting to do something like what we are doing during the general election but they thought of it too late.  The people who will be relieved in the main are the owners of dwelling houses.</P>
      <P>I shall quote further:</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: Are we to take it then, that the Minister is saving that the bulk of the money involved will be spent in relief of rates on dwelling houses?  Is that what the Minister is saving?</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: That is what I said.</P>
      <P>I shall read the remainder of this because it bears out what I have said:</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: Does the Minister not know that that is not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> Mr. Tully: I made a statement and I expect Deputy Colley to accept that statement.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I accept that the Minister is mistaken.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: The insinuation that the Minister was telling an untruth must be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I am saying the statement made by the Minister is untrue and I accept that he is making it under a misapprehension or by mistake.</P>
    <P>As I said, I gave the Minister the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>The next part of this saga arises on the same day, the same Question Time, the same Volume&mdash;265 No. 4&mdash; of the Official Report at column 491 when I put supplementary questions to the Minister for Finance.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: Could the Minister state whether the bulk of that relief would go to the benefit of dwelling houses or other rateable hereditament?</P>
    <P>Mr. R. Ryan: I must sympathise with the Deputy when he is unable to recall what the Minister for Local Government has already said.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: I recall very well what he said.  I want to hear what the Minister for Finance has to say.</P>
    <P>Mr. R. Ryan: What the Minister for Local Government said is the absolute truth.  The lions share of the relief is in respect of dwelling houses and the percentage of business and industrial premises, in respect of which the Deputy has been endeavouring to make great play, is a very small fraction of the total.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: Can the Minister give us the respective figures?  There are two percentage figures involved, one for dwelling houses and one for others.  Could he give us the figures?</P>
    <P>Mr. R. Ryan: I have not the figures here.  If the Deputy cares or dares to ask the question I shall be very happy, indeed, to give him the answer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> Mr. Colley: I certainly will.</P>
    <P>You will note, Sir, from that the brazenness with which these answers were given.</P>
    <P>The next move was that I did put down a question to the Minister for Finance and it was ruled out of order. I subsequently put down a question to the Minister for Local Government and it was dealt with today but before we get to that point I should like to draw your attention, Sir, to the reply given by the Minister for Local Government to a question on the 10th of May, reported in Volume 265 No. 7 of the Official Report at column 967. This is the end of a reply given by the Minister to a question by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  The last paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>No precise figures are available as to the amount of rates paid in respect of private dwellings.  Householders comprise the great majority of all ratepayers and it is understood that they account for over 50 per cent of the total amount of rates paid.</P>
    <P>It so happens that the copy of the reply delivered to the Deputy in that regard showed that as originally typed the reply was:</P>
    <P>Householders comprise the great majority of all ratepayers and it is understood that they account for about 50 per cent of the total amount of rates paid.</P>
    <P>That was changed in handwriting to &ldquo;over&rdquo; 50 per cent.  It may, I think, be considered significant in the light of what went before and what came subsequently.  Incidentally, it is difficult to know what the Minister was trying to convey by &ldquo;over 50 per cent&rdquo;.  Did he mean 51 per cent or 99 per cent?  It will emerge that what the Minister was trying to do was to justify to some extent what he had said on the 3rd of May and what had been said by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister replied to a question by me which was:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government the basis on which it has been calculated that the rates paid by householders account for <Col N="1729" /> over 50 per cent of the total amount of rates paid.</P>
    <P>The reply was:</P>
    <P>The estimate is based on a sample survey and includes an element in respect of the residential portion of mixed hereditaments.</P>
    <P>In response to a question by me as to when this sample survey was carried out the Minister stated among other things:</P>
    <P>It is calculated on the basis that 49.56 per cent of the total rates is paid in respect of domestic hereditaments and approximately 4 per cent relates to the domestic element in mixed hereditaments.</P>
    <P>That is to cases such as a house and a shop together.  The interesting thing about that supplementary reply is that the Minister was clearly trying to indicate that although the figures showed that the correct answer to the question: &ldquo;How much is attributable to dwelling houses and how much to other property?&rdquo; is: &ldquo;Approximately 50 per cent&rdquo; the Minister could not say that so today he managed to drag in another 4 per cent from somewhere. The strange thing is that if one looks at the report of the proceedings on the 10th of May&mdash;Volume 265 No. 7 &mdash;one will find that in relation to the Local Government (Rates) Bill, 1973 Deputy Seán Moore asked a question. He said at column 901:</P>
    <P>I just want to ask a question. Although naturally I welcome the Bill, would the Minister inform us if there is any possible way of restricting the health charge remission to residential houses only?  As the Bill stands, huge industrial concerns will benefit as well as the ordinary ratepayer and I do not think this would be desirable.  I hope the Minister can devise some means by which large industrial concerns will be excluded from this benefit.</P>
    <P>There were a few more exchanges and then Deputy Moore said again:</P>
    <P>Take the large industrial concerns. They will now benefit from the remission of the health charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> The Minister for Local Government replied:</P>
    <P>It could not be done.  The rate is a common one which applies to an entire building and it would not be possible at this stage to do what the Deputy suggests.</P>
    <P>You will see, Sir, that on that day it was not possible to divide the rates in, say, a shop and house combined for the purpose of the Local Government (Rates) Bill but when it came to trying to get the Minister out of a fix it was possible to divide them and produce a figure of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The pattern that is emerging from this is that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance gave wrong answers on the 3rd of May.  They were given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to get off the hook but they did not take it.  They persisted in their bluffing in this way.  One can see that the correct answer to: &ldquo;How much is due to dwelling houses and how much to other properties?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Approximately 50 per cent&rdquo; but even if one takes the figure given today by the Minister for Local Government, having denied what he said earlier on the Local Government (Rates) Bill, you still get 53 point something per cent.  Does that percentage, taking the best figure the Minister can produce, justify the Minister for Local Government saying that the bulk of the money was going to relieve dwelling houses?  Does it justify the Minister for Finance saying that the lion's share of the money was going to relieve dwelling houses?</P>
    <P>Is it not clear that both of these replies were totally misleading?  You might well wonder, Sir, why all this deception.  The first reason is that the lack of real social concern, which is a characteristic of many of the policies of this Coalition Government, is emphasised glaringly in their policy in relation to rates.  They wanted to get off that hook, particularly when their scheme is compared with the Fianna Fáil scheme.  But the second reason and the one that has become much more urgent now for the Minister is that since the budget it is clear to voters that all of the enormous extra <Col N="1731" /> taxation that is being imposed is being imposed partly to enable the taxpayer to have the privilege of reducing the rates paid on office blocks and other commercial property.</P>
    <P>I know, as I am sure the Minister knows, that very many of the voters want to know why they are being asked to pay 3p extra on a packet of cigarettes, 3p extra on a glass of spirits, 1p extra on the pint, a 50 per cent increase in telephone coin box charges, 1p extra on the postage of a letter, substantial extra motor taxation and millions more than is necessary under the VAT impositions on essentials to replace VAT on food.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare, whom I am glad to see is in the House, is reducing the estimates of the health boards by more than £8 million.  All of these things are going on in a context in which, so far as the voter is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All of this taxation that has been imposed raises immediately in the voter's mind the question: &ldquo;Why should I be asked to pay taxation in order to relieve the rates on office blocks and other commercial properties?&rdquo; Whatever else I may say about the Minister for Local Government, I concede that he is a very good political animal but he has tried to get himself off that hook and that is why we have <Col N="1733" /> these frantic efforts to bluff the people into believing that &ldquo;the bulk of the money&rdquo;, according to the Minister for Local Government, &ldquo;the lion's share&rdquo;, according to the Minister for Finance, is going to relieve dwellings.</P>
      <P>I have explained how the Minister for Local Government arrived at the figures produced by him&mdash;the doubtful method by which he did this and which contradicts what he said in the House the other day&mdash;but if one takes the figures given by the Minister today, they cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, justify those terms used by the Ministers for Local Government and Finance.  Therefore, that is the reason for these frantic efforts by both Ministers to explain this away.  They know that the voters, and I use that word advisedly in the present context, are becoming aware that they are being asked to pay so much money in taxation and that they are questioning particularly this matter of relieving rates on office blocks and commercial property.  While I understand the political exigencies and pressures on the Government in this matter, no political pressures or exigencies can excuse the deliberate giving of false information in reply to parliamentary questions and I repeat that when I raised this matter originally I gave the opportunity to the Minister to point out that he had made a mistake, that he had answered in error.  I would have accepted that but he did not avail of that opportunity.  Up to this day he has given an answer calculated to mislead this House and to mislead the people.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House we knew that the Coalition Government would produce a mess but that they should do this so quickly, and so soon resort to the despicable trickery and deceit which is evident in this matter and of which we know them to be capable, is a grave abuse of their trust and it is also a very bad omen for this Coalition Government.</P>

In the first of <Col N="1734" /> these programmes Deputy Colley and the now Minister for Foreign Affairs exchanged figures but Deputy Colley was a very bad loser on that occasion and in an attempt to get off the hook he said that he had some questions to ask of me if I would take part with him in a television programme a week later.  On that second occasion Deputy Colley was even more confused than on the first occasion with the result that he did exactly as he has done here tonight: he trotted out a lot of figures which did not mean anything to him.</P>

      <P>No matter what way the Deputies try to get out of this, it will not bring them back to this side of the House.  The simple fact is that today at Question Time Deputy Colley was not prepared to accept the figures I gave.  These figures were conservative ones because they could have been a little more in our favour but I was being fair to the House and to the Deputy when I said that 49.56, which is the figure that Deputy Colley's Government obtained almost five years ago, is the figure for dwelling houses in the country.  If the Deputy wants to say that 53.56 is not <Col N="1735" /> the bulk of the rates, will he suggest that the balance of 46.44 of the rates is the bulk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer to Deputy Colley's question&mdash;and I have repeated it four times and maybe the fifth time he will understand it&mdash;is that if dwellings represent 49.56&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  I will call it exactly what we got in 1968-69, which Deputy Molloy's officials at the time were able to find out.  If we add on a mere percentage, 4 per cent, for the purpose of covering the combined housing and business dwellings in the country, it gives us 53.56 per cent.  If that is not the great bulk of the rates, if it is not a greater bulk than that <Col N="1737" /> which is collected from others, then the Deputy does not know what he is talking about.</P>
      <P>I should like to go a little bit further although time is very short.  I heard a comment from either Deputy Molloy or Deputy Colley as to what Fianna Fáil proposed to do in their programme.  One of the biggest weaknesses of the Fianna Fáil proposal was (1)  it was not going to apply for 12 months and (2)  it is admitted both by the officials of Local Government and Finance that, apart from the rough estimate which they have given here, it is not possible and would not be possible for a very long time to divide the hereditaments between dwellings and business premises.  Right well the Minister knew that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I told Deputy Colley that the estimate of 4 per cent was given to me and I am prepared to accept it from a very efficient set of officials who worked under Deputy Colley for a number of years in the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Colley was Minister for Finance I am quite sure he at least knew how such calculations were made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it could not be accurately done in 12 months.  I wanted an estimate and I got an estimate, and that estimate was in Deputy Colley's Department before he left government. They must have been tinkering around to find out could they do what they were promising, and I am quite sure they found they could not.  Yet Deputy Colley has the sheer audacity to come into this House and try to prove the country is being sold down the drain simply because the figures I have given him on three occasions say the bulk of <Col N="1738" /> the amount was being paid on dwellings, which he says is wrong.  If the bulk of the rates saved is not on dwellings, would Deputy Colley tell me what it is on?</P>
      <P>We heard a comment about what would be saved by the Fianna Fáil plan.  Every ratepayer has had an average of over £1 in the £ on the rates saved in this year because of the Coalition plan.  Let us talk any way we like about 3p on this and 3p on that: the plain fact is that the ratepayers&mdash; and the people mainly concerned are the people living in houses&mdash;were very glad to get such a reduction.  Furthermore, Deputy Colley must know, if he knows anything about finance, that of the office blocks he is talking about, which, incidentally, are owned by most of his party's friends, not ours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is true, as it was true, that certain savings accrued to the people who are paying rates on office blocks, Deputy Colley, as a former Minister for Finance, must know that over 50 per cent of those savings found their way back into the Exchequer through income tax and corporation profits tax.  Does he or does he not admit that that is true?</P>
      <P>A great bluff was tried tonight by Fianna Fáil.  The reason this matter was raised tonight was that they thought they could score a couple of petty points in order to boost their very shaky hopes of winning the Presidential Election.  They did not gain anything by it because they were in the wrong shop.  It was all right when Deputy Colley was over here and, because he was standing up here with a brief in his hand, could get people to assume he knew what he was talking about, but he was over there without a brief&mdash;&mdash;</P>
