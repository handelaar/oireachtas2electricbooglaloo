    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7 together.</P>
      <P>On the issue of medical cards to students, the legal position under the Health Act, 1970, is that &ldquo;adult persons&rdquo;, that is, those over 16 years of age, are entitled to be assessed in their own right.  Section 45 of the Act states that only the means of the person and his spouse will be taken into account.  Therefore, the means of a university student's parents are not relevant.  I would mention that this has been the law for hospital services since 1953.  The 1970 Act made the rules for the general practitioner service consistent with that law.  The Eastern Health Board are simply complying with the 1970 Act in the issue of these cards.  The matter of parental agreement is not one for the health board, which must deal with applications received on their merits.</P>
      <P>The number of cards issued by the Eastern Health Board which are held by students from counties outside Dublin is 2,967.  The number held by students from countries outside Ireland is 206.  These, at the time of the issue of the cards were, of course, resident for the purpose of their studies in Dublin and the board's obligation to provide services extended to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his very comprehensive reply.  However, although it may be in the Act, in circumstances where we know that the rest of the citizens of Dublin have been subjected to a means test, would the Parliamentary Secretary not think that possibly the Act should be amended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Act was passed by the Oireachtas at a time when I had little to say in the matter except to talk from the Opposition benches, as the Deputy is doing now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer <Col N="994" /> my questions completely.  I hope the new Government will not feel obliged to live with every sin of which they might think the former Government were guilty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree it is unfair and unjust that the taxpayers and rate-payers of Dublin city should be called on to subsidise the wellbeing of those who are in a position to pay while, at the same time, they themselves are subjected to a means test with regard to medical cards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of allegations of this nature concerning the processing of claims for social welfare benefits by my Department and I must say that I am not satisfied with the present situation. However, many of the delays are caused by factors outside the control of the Department.  For example, neglect by a claimant to send in required details, medical certificates, <i>et cetera.</i> It is my wish that the service to the public, whom we serve, would be speeded up and made as humane as possible.  While accepting that delays on occasions do occur as a result of some fault in my Department for which I accept responsibility, the Deputy must understand that the requirements as laid down in legislation by the Oireachtas must be complied with in all cases.  I think it should be appreciated that my Department deal with well over 500,000 new claims of all types per annum, an average of well over 10,000 new claims per week, and it is only natural that some human error will occur in this volume but I can assure the Deputy that I am most anxious that any delay due to this factor will be brought down to the absolute minimum.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that approaches on the north side of Redmond Bridge, Waterford City, are currently the subject of a major repair operation which is causing much inconvenience to traffic and to the operations of local firms; if he will expedite the progress towards the <Col N="1000" /> provision of a second bridge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, that Waterford Corporation, acting on the advice of their consultants, have found it necessary to take urgent measures to strengthen the structure referred to. These include the placing of bailey bridges as a temporary measure pending the completion of permanent repairs.  Special steps have been taken in consultation with my Department to ensure that the works are completed quickly.</P>
      <P>The corporation have also been advised that the over-water structure forming part of Terminus Street and connected with the approaches to Redmond Bridge also requires to be strengthened, and they have instructed their consultants to proceed urgently with the necessary designs for this work.  Pending the carrying out of this work it will be necessary, subject to the approval of the Garda authorities, to introduce one-way traffic on Terminus Street for heavy vehicles.</P>
      <P>The corporation's consultants are proceeding with the detailed investigation, including test borings, of the recommended site for the second bridge near Bilberry Quarry.</P>
      <P>I appreciate and regret that the measures now being taken cause inconvenience and disturbance to all sections of the community in Waterford and surrounding areas.  I am, however, sure that all will accept that inconvenience is unavoidable and is preferable to having to close the bridge to traffic.  I am satisfied that all reasonable steps are being taken to expedite the works.  The full cost of the works is being met from the Road Fund.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the lack of recreational facilities, playing pitches, community centres, etc., in newly built housing estates; and if he will ensure that contracts for the building of new estates will contain provision for these facilities as a matter of entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that these facilities are inadequate in many housing schemes.  Regarding future action, I presume the Deputy has local authority housing schemes in mind since he mentions contracts.  Local authorities have been asked to adopt a more progressive attitude in regard to environmental aspects of housing developments and to have action plans prepared for the provision of amenities and community facilities at the same time as the houses.  I announced recently my intention to place a new emphasis on the development of the total environment in housing schemes.</P>
      <P>In the amenity grants scheme administered by my Department, local authorities are urged to give priority to projects which provide leisure activities and develop the community interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does the Minister agree that there is a singular lack on private housing estates of this type of amenity? For this reason would the Minister consider setting up, in his Department, a section to ensure that this type of development occurs?  The Minister, I am sure, will agree that leisure will become one of the most important aspects of human endeavour in the not too distant future but at the moment we do not have adequate provision to deal with this type of situation on the various housing estates throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The figures requested are about 33,000 and 20,000 respectively.  I am very concerned at the size of the waiting list, the length of the delay and the way in which the waiting list has expanded over the past few years.  Let me give figures of the waiting list for telephones over the past two years.  In 1970 it was, 14,601: by 1971 it had become 20,653 and by 1972, 30,899.  I am most anxious that all possible steps should now be taken to reverse this trend which has prevailed over the past few years and I hope to deal with this matter at greater length in my reply to the debate on the Estimate for my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 4th April I issued a statement indicating that the Government had decided to seek leave to introduce legislation postponing the local elections due to be held next month.  The decision to postpone the elections was taken having regard to the number of elections that have already taken place during the past year and to the proximity of the Presidential election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is enacted the elections will be held in June, 1974, and every fifth year thereafter.  The Bill extends the terms of office of existing members of <Col N="1050" /> local authorities accordingly and makes minor consequential arrangements in relation to appointment of school attendance committees and the meetings of vocational education committees. These are purely technical matters and the provisions in this regard are identical with those contained in the Local Elections Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>This is the fourth occasion on which local elections have been postponed in the past eight years (the 15th occasion since 1919), special legislation being introduced each time.  Deputies will note that it is now proposed under section 2 of the Bill to empower the Minister for Local Government to effect any future postponement of local elections by order, subject to the limitation that such an order will not have effect unless and until it has been approved by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The substance of the change now proposed is that the postponement instrument will be an order, not an Act.  The final effective decision on whether local elections should be postponed will continue to rest with the two Houses of the Oireachtas, following full and open debate.</P>
    <P>The simplified procedure now proposed will be less wasteful of parliamentary time.  Again I would stress that the specific approval of the Oireachtas will still be required before an order made under section 2 can come into operation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill have been dealt with in the explanatory memorandum and I do not think it necessary for me to say any more on it.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Minister's provision in this matter and I am aware, of course, that there are precedents to which he can point and to which he has, indeed, pointed in his opening speech but, having said that. this is.  I think, a matter on which I should express the feelings of the community in regard to a further postponement of the local elections.  In the structure of Government which we have local authorities play a very important role.  They are responsible for <Col N="1051" /> the provision and maintenance of major services and the efficiency or inefficiency of the authorities determines to a very large extent the quality of life enjoyed by our citizens.  It is important that people should recognise the vital role local authorities play in Irish life and it is also important that everything possible should be done to foster respect for the elected members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The law lays it down that there shall be local elections held every five years. The law also gives power to the Minister, if the Oireachtas so decides, to extend the period but, to accept the continuous postponement of local elections as a kind of normal situation, will in the long run tend to diminish the respect of the community for such important institutions as local authorities and greatly weaken the influence of these bodies in community affairs. These results are, of course, highly undesirable, particularly in present day circumstances when there is a need to expand the role of the local councillor and increase his influence in shaping the environment in which he and his fellow-citizens must live.</P>
      <P>During my period in office as Minister for Local Government I had set about a greater devolution of authority and decision-making from central Government down to local authority level.  I had taken quite a number of practical steps to achieve this object. One step was the expanded role of local authorities in carrying out their own housing programmes.  I initiated that and I am pleased to see that the present Minister has, in fact, approved of it and will continue it.  Another step was the amended grants scheme introduced by me, a scheme which allows local authorities themselves to make the decision on each individual allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made other efforts to increase local authority involvement in the administration of group water schemes.  These I considered very necessary and I hope the Minister will continue my efforts in that direction.  I believe he shares sentiments similar to mine in this matter and, indeed, in other matters in relation <Col N="1052" /> to devolution.  Above all, I indicated my desire to apply in a practical way all my plans for the strengthening of local government.  Strengthening it for what purpose?</P>
    <P>My purpose in setting about the strengthening and reorganisation of local authorities was to allow for devolution on a massive scale, a scale which would remove departmental control from many areas in which it is presently exercised and in which it creates delays and frustrations.  To play down the role of the local authority in our democracy is not a good thing and I suggest the further postponement of local elections is, in fact, doing just this.  It is regrettable that the Minister should feel it incumbent on him to do this.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the fact that I was not in favour of the further postponement of local elections; I was, in fact, proceeding expeditiously with the preparation of a reorganisation Bill.  That Bill could have been dealt with in two parts, if that were thought desirable, and I had hoped to come before the Dáil shortly after the Christmas Recess with the Bill.  I also hoped to hold the local elections this year following on the passage of my reorganisation proposals by both Houses. I accept that the timetable I had set myself could not be followed by my successor because of delays caused by intervening events.</P>
    <P>I would accept, in fairness to the Minister, that he would expect to have a look at the reorganisation plans and to make his own decisions on them.  For these reasons and to be fair to the Minister, my party have decided that we shall not call for a vote on this occasion to record our disagreement with the Minister's decision in relation to the postponement of the local elections until June, 1974.</P>
    <P>Postponement at this stage indicates to me that the Minister is giving serious consideration to the need for reorganisation. This must be the main reason for the postponement.  It is important that the House should be told if this is so, because the only data we have to go on in seeking the Minister's opinion in relation to reorganisation are the statements which have <Col N="1053" /> been made by the Minister and by Deputies of this Government and by their parties, when indicating what they would do.</P>
    <P>In looking at some of the statements that have been made I would like to put on record the opinions of Members of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties. That is the only way in which I can seek to find out the intentions of this Government.  I am going back to their policy statements.  I wish to put on record the Fine Gael policy documents <i>Winning through to a Just Society</i> which was published before the 1969 election and quote from that document, which said:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that our present system of local government urgently needs reform.</P>
    <P>  It also states:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that there should be a fundamental review of the functions and form of local authorities.  The present structure of local government is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>According to Press reports of 20th June, 1967, which was quoted in <i>The Irish Times, Irish Independent, The Irish Press</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> it was stated:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael proposed to change the structure of local government by the establishment of regional councils. These might consist of 15-20 members, the majority of whom would be elected by the county councils within the region and the rest could either be co-opted or nominated.  The functions to be undertaken by these councils would be those which at present attract a high proportion of grants from central funds.  These councils could continue to obtain the bulk of their income from this source so that the need for statutory demands by them on local rates would be minimised....</P>
    <P>This, they believed, would have had the effect of increasing the financial economy of county councils.  We can take it that that statement is vague. It is fairly definite in proposing the introduction of a new level of local <Col N="1054" /> authority.  This is the regional council to which they refer.</P>
    <P>Another source from which I have been trying to find information on the intentions of the Government in relation to reorganisation was a statement made by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan), spokesman on local government, quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 11th February, 1971.  The Deputy said:</P>
    <P>Towns have outgrown the urban areas.  It is difficult for small towns to carry on a service without increasing rates astronomically.</P>
    <P>One could reasonably assume from that statement that major changes were envisaged by Fine Gael when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16th April, 1969, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, now the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said:</P>
    <P>It has become evident in recent years that the existing pattern of local government is unsuited to modern needs.  The existence of over 80 planning and housing authorities in a small county of this size is clearly absurd and while our existing system of local government is sufficiently flexible to cope with this situation by the delegation of authority for housing and planning work from smaller authorities to larger and better-equipped bodies, such as county councils, this delegation process serves only to emphasise how unrealistic our present structure is.</P>
    <P>Even the county as a unit of administration is now too small for many purposes.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Our counties vary enormously in size and population&mdash;Cork is nine times as large as Carlow, and Dublin has 24 times Carlow's population&mdash; but even the largest county is not big enough to constitute in its own right a natural region for such purposes as hospital services, colleges of technology or tourism, or for the kind of physical planning studies referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> The Deputy further stated:</P>
    <P>It has been evident for some time past that a regional administrative structure is now required to coordinate the regional activities which have sprung up throughout the country in response to modern demands that cannot be fitted within a county structure devised in a period when the horse was the most efficient form of communication.</P>
    <P>These are some interesting thoughts from leading Members of the Fine Gael Party in relation to reorganisation.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party, the other half of the partnership, dealt with local government reorganisation in the policy document published by the Labour Party and approved at their annual conference in 1969, which contains the following:</P>
      <P>The present system of local government is an English creation.</P>
      <P>County boundaries have not been drawn from any predetermined plan.</P>
      <P>Some of the county units are too small and others are too poor.</P>
      <P>A new tier in the local government structure should be created which will group numbers of county councils.</P>
      <P>The regional authorities will administer some central government services together with planning and development, water and sewerage and roads, and will also have functions in relation to amenities, housing and conservation.</P>
      <P>Regional councils will be directly elected and will have their own staff.</P>
      <P>Just before the 1969 local elections a statement of local government policy was issued by the Labour Party. Among the points made was this one:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> The entire local government system is untidy and tends to be inefficient.  Labour proposes that it be streamlined and modernised...</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Local Government who is a Member of the Labour Party.  The country, and the elected representatives in particular, are anxious to know what form the streamlining and the modernising will take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would love to hear me repeating his words on that occasion. They were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alderman Seán Treacy said he was very conscious of the feelings of loss in the minds of public representatives who served so well and <Col N="1057" /> for so long with no recompense whatsoever the people in their respective areas.  They did naturally resent the suggestion that their local authorities should be abolished, but then again, a very compelling case could be made for the merging of these bodies with a major one like the county council.  This council had recently to come to the rescue of Cashel Urban Council already in the matter of housing and he hoped, as a result, to see a joint scheme there soon to relieve the acute housing problem there.</P>
    <P>There again, is the intention being expressed by a leading member of the Labour Party.  In trying to find out what the Minister's thinking is in relation to it I have had to do some research into the statements of intention which had been made by members of Fine Gael and of Labour before they assumed office.</P>
    <P>Another comment which I should like to put on record here was made by Deputy Maurice Dockrell in a radio interview on the day the Dáil convened. I think it was Liam Nolan's programme. The Deputy said his new Government would create a greater Dublin Council and would not hold elections to reconstitute Dublin Corporation and that they would abolish Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Urban District Council and the Balbriggan Town Commissioners. He said the new authority which they would create would include the area of all these authorities that I have mentioned and also parts of County Meath and County Wicklow.  There is a rather sweeping change, something far more extensive than I had ever envisaged and I should like some clarification from the Minister as to whether or not his intentions in relation to the future structure of local government in Dublin would go that far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>I think I have quoted sufficiently to indicate to the House that the Labour and Fine Gael idea is to create regional councils.  If this is the intention of this new Government I should like the House to be told what will happen to the existing county councils.  Are we to take it from the Bill, seeking the postponement of the local elections that county council elections will never again be held?</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention in bringing this Bill before the House to give himself a further 12 months period in which to carry out the reorganisation, in order to prepare legislation which will, in effect, abolish county councils and establish regional councils as suggested in the policy documents and in the statements from which I have quoted from members of both parties now forming the Government?  These are questions that every county council is anxious to have answered.  Indeed the entire community is anxiously awaiting an indication of the Government's intention with regard to reorganisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that when he is replying the Minister will give us some indication as to when it is hoped he can publish the Government's intentions either by way of a White Paper or Green Paper or Bill.  Having initiated the discussion and the debate on this subject and having the approval of the other parties and the agreement on the need for major changes, it would be only fair to the country that he should give some indication fairly soon as to what his intentions are.</P>
      <P>There is one other point that I should like to make to the Minister. He will remember that while I was in the office he now occupies I was happy to grant votes to the youth of Ireland, to those aged 18 and over.</P>

The youth of Ireland have a very keen interest in local affairs, in local administration, probably a keener interest in those matters than in seeking election to Dáil Éireann or participating in Dáil elections although they do have a very keen interest in Dáil elections.  By the postponement by the National Coalition of the local elections the youth are being deprived of the opportunity to vote next June in the local elections.</P>

      <P>That is a point that the Minister may have overlooked.  It is one that is worthy of consideration. However, in view of the circumstances and the situation in which the Minister finds himself, as I have indicated, we do not intend to register our disapproval of this move by way of a vote.  At the same time, I wanted to sound the warning that I have sounded.  I hope to receive some information from the Minister as to what is happening in regard to reorganisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When we in the Labour Party opposed the postponement of the local elections last year we did so because the then Minister was once again asking the Dáil to postpone the granting of democracy and the reconstitution of democracy in the Bray Urban District Council and Dublin Corporation.  On that occasion the then Minister made no provision to restore councils to either of those areas.  Before introducing the Bill now before the House the Minister restored democracy to both of these areas and he can be assured that that is very welcome.  I speak from a certain amount of local knowledge, particularly of the Bray area <Col N="1060" /> where the lack of public representatives for a number of years highlighted the need for local representation. Services were not available which should and would have been provided if there had been 12 good councillors agitating for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has restored the councils to Dublin and Bray and at the same time has provided that persons aged 18 may stand for election. When the previous speaker referred to the youth of Ireland one could only smile because not only did he deprive the youth of the vote at general elections but he was also prepared to deprive them of participation as candidates in local elections.  The Minister has amended that and young persons in the local elections next year will be allowed to stand for election to every council.  They have a year in which to prepare themselves and to make themselves known in their respective areas.</P>
      <P>The previous Deputy spoke about the quality of life being enhanced by local authorities.  When one considers that he was prepared to abolish dozens of urban councils and town commissioners it is difficult to understand how he can make that point.  In my area a council was abolished, one of the three urban areas, and under his White Paper the other two urban councils were due to be abolished.  I cannot understand how the quality of life would be improved by the abolition of small urban councils and by depriving the people of a say in running their own communities at that level.</P>
      <P>The change proposed by the Minister in the Bill before the House will restore local democracy in all urban councils.  I do not see anything in the Bill that suggests there is any change in the structure at the moment.  There is no hint given anywhere that changes are needed for regional councils and there are no such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister is doing.  However, I would ask that Deputies be given a chance to debate section 2 if the Minister proposes to postpone elections in the future.  A period of seven years is long enough to have the councils in office.  However, in view of the number of <Col N="1061" /> elections and referenda recently there might be a certain apathy on the part of the public if the local elections were held in 1973.  We know that in Great Britain only 2 per cent or 23 per cent of the electorate vote in local elections.  While I do not think that is likely to happen here, it could come about if we had a proliferation of referenda and elections around the same time, and particularly if the local elections took place after the other elections.</P>
    <P>It would be a mistake to hold the local elections on the same day as the Presidential election and I am glad the Minister has not done this.  The people can make up their minds on the important issue of the Presidential election without having to cope with the long list of local candidates in the local elections.</P>
    <P>When the elections take place next year, young people will have had an opportunity to make up their minds about putting their names forward. They will have had a year's notice in which they can have made themselves known in their communities.  In addition, the election register will be up-to-date. Preparation of the last register was so rushed that the names of thousands of young people were omitted and every Deputy is aware of that fact.  We know that rate collectors did not have time to do a thorough job on the preparation of the last register but now young people who are eligible will have an opportunity to get their names on the new register. Some of them may be deprived of the vote in the Presidential election because of the small quotas that were involved in local elections, particularly in urban areas.  However, when the names of the young people are included in the register next year this will mean that we will have a more true result.  With regard to postponement of the local elections, I do not think the public want more elections this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The postponement of the local elections this year is disappointing, particularly after the clamour we have had since 1969 about the restoration of the Dublin city <Col N="1062" /> council and the Bray Urban Council. I agree with Deputy Molloy that postponement of the local elections does nothing for the status of the local authorities.  In the past 50 years elections have been postponed on 15 occasions and these postponements may create an impression in the public mind that we do not think much of the local authorities, although I agree that postponements in the early part of the century may have been for different reasons than apply today.</P>
      <P>The year's postponement will give the Minister an opportunity of examining his party's policy on local government and on whatever defects we have seen in the present set-up.  Perhaps in future legislation the Minister would consider a suggestion of embodying in some Bill a proviso that local elections might be postponed if they occur in the same year as a Presidential or general election.  At least this would let people know why the local elections were being postponed and it would put the local authority in the mainstream of political events.  In most cases local elections have been postponed at short notice and people who were prepared to serve on the local authority were denied an opportunity of doing this; this has added to the frustration of civic-minded people.</P>
      <P>In his reply to this debate I should like the Minister to tell us his attitude towards the White Paper on Local Government issued by the former Government.  There are proposals in his party's manifesto on local authorities that have some similarity with the suggestions in the White Paper.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if he intends to abolish or to amend the Management Act.  This has been criticised by his party in previous years but the people in Dublin city would like the Minister to spell out the future pattern of local government in the Greater Dublin area.  Will we have a Dublin city council, a county council and a Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation or will we have a Greater Dublin Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be compelled to make some move towards rationalisation of the Dublin scene.  At the <Col N="1063" /> moment some absurd things happen; for instance the corporation purchase land in the county area and allocate this land to builders: they must apply to the county council for planning permission but the matter is even more absurd when one realises the chief planning officer covers the entire area. The city manager is also the county manager and here we have a case of a public body applying for planning permission to another public body but in the end one man, with jurisdiction over both bodies, makes the decision. There are many other anachronisms in the local authority organisations and I think the Minister could spend his time in a worthwhile way in examining this situation.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before the House there is no guarantee that the local elections will be held next year.  The Minister has promised a comprehensive Bill dealing with local government.  It is said that it will contain measures which will save parliamentary time because we will not have to enact a new Bill annually if there are postponements of the local elections.  While these new proposals may save time there is no guarantee being given now that we will have the local elections next year.</P>
    <P>Positive steps will have to be taken in order to raise the status of local authorities in the minds of the general public.  A Dublin newspaper some time ago carried out a survey of public opinion on the absence of the Dublin City Council.  The number of people who were aware that there had been a city council was very small.  All those interviewed in that survey were aware that Dublin did not have a lord mayor. The most serious point, however, was the small number of people who were anxious that the city council should be reconstituted.</P>
    <P>The Minister, or his predecessor, or the general public are not to blame for this.  It is the result of the manner in which during the past 54 years local authorities have had to carry on while the elections were being postponed. The postponing of local elections has caused the view in the minds of the <Col N="1064" /> public that local authorities are not necessary, particularly when there are excellent officials to carry on.  Officials in Dublin, and I presume in Bray, have carried on in the absence of the councils and I am not aware of any great mistakes made by these officials. They carried on the housing programmes at much the same rate as the councils would have if they had been functioning.  These officials also carried on other aspects of the local programme.</P>
    <P>When he introduces his comprehensive Bill I hope the Minister will give local authorities the greatest shot in the arm that they have ever been given by bestowing more executive powers on them.  Having served on a local authority for many years one finds that apart from section 4 of the Local Government Act a member has very little power otherwise.  The Minister, having served on a local authority, is well aware of the weaknesses of the general set-up.  His experience and his desire to improve matters will help him in this regard.  He should always bear in mind the fact that (a), his own party have issued a manifesto on local government and that (b), the Fianna Fáil Government, in a most impressive and comprehensive and far-seeking document on all aspects of local government, have given him a really progressive piece of legislation on local government.</P>
    <P>I shall wait, impatiently perhaps, for the introduction of that Bill which I hope will be introduced before the next local elections.  I hope that the local elections will not have to be postponed again next year because the new organisation, or reorganisation, of the local government scheme will not be ready.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments on this Bill will be very brief but I think it is only right and proper that the record should be set straight for everyone to read. as far as the Fine Gael and Labour Parties&mdash;the National Coalition&mdash;are concerned.  Listening to Deputy Molloy, the previous Minister, shedding crocodile tears for our youth <Col N="1065" /> being deprived the right to vote again one can only come to the conclusion that this must be taken with a grain of salt.  The Deputy, when he was Minister, had a great opportunity if he had postponed the general election for six weeks to have given the youth of Ireland an opportunity of feeling that they were participating in the creation of a new Ireland by using their vote for the first time.  They would have had that opportunity if the general election had been held sometime after April 14.  I am sure the youth of Ireland will judge the former Minister and his remarks, which I am sure will not be taken seriously by them.</P>
      <P>At the time of the dissolution of the 19th Dáil, two Bills were in the course of preparation.  The first one, which was ready for introduction, provided for the dissolution of town commissioners, the dissolution of 44 of the 56 urban district councils, including boroughs, and the setting up of area and other committees of local authorities. The second Bill, which was at an advanced drafting stage, dealt mainly with local government in county boroughs.  It provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for a merger of the existing authorities in both Dublin and Cork, district committees of large unified authorities and joint management of both city and county in Limerick and Waterford.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to record and to stitch into the record, as Deputy Molloy was so anxious to stitch the Fine Gael policy into the record, the town commissioners that were to be abolished.  They were: Ardee, Balbriggan, Ballybay, Ballyshannon, Bandon, Bantry, Belturbet, Boyle, Cootehill, Droichead Nua, Edenderry, Gorey, Granard, Kilkee, Lismore, Loughrea, Mountmellick, Muinebeag, Mullingar, Passage West, Portlaoise, Tramore and Tuam.  All these town commissioners were to go if Deputy Molloy were still a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following boroughs and urban districts were to get the hatchet if Deputy Molloy were still Minister: An Uaimh, Arklow, Athy, Ballina, Ballinasloe, Birr, Buncrana, Bundoran, Carrickmacross, Carrick-onSuit, <Col N="1066" /> Cashel, Castlebar, Castleblayney, Cavan, Ceanannus Mór, Clonakilty, Clones, Clonmel, Cobh, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Fermoy, Killarney, Kilrush, Kinsale, Letterkenny, Listowel, Longford, Macroom, Mallow, Midleton, Monaghan, Naas, Nenagh, New Ross, Skibbereen, Templemore, Thurles, Tipperary, Trim, Tullamore, Westport, Wicklow and Youghal.</P>
    <P>It is very arrogant for a former Minister to say that he was interested in local authorities and that he wanted to give more powers to local authorities when, with a clean stroke of the pen, he would do away with so many town commissioners and urban districts. It is only right and proper that the public should be made aware of what Deputy Molloy had in store for them so that they could thank their lucky stars he did not get a chance to put them into operation.</P>

      <P>I am possibly one of the few people in this House who could not care less if the local elections were postponed every year for the next five years.  In expressing this view I would be hopeful that the end product would be something substantial. No hasty decision should be arrived at in relation to the structuring of local authorities on a different basis.  Every consideration must be given to this matter in order to ensure that the country has the best possible local authority set-up in any new legislation that will follow.  It is important that there should not be confusion in the future and that the problems that have arisen in the past and are arising on a day-to-day basis in Dublin city and county are adequately dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very big problems are arising in this area because of perimeter development and the other developments mentioned by Deputy Moore.  There is the confusion between Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  This confusion <Col N="1067" /> occurs not alone at public representative level but at official level also.  It is well known that officials dig in against one another with the result that serious problems arise for the community as a whole.  It is well known that during the years when one set of officials did not pull with the other, substantial developments bogged down for a period.  It is undesirable that there should be a situation, as exists in Dublin city and county, where there are three authorities with consequent substantial overlapping. There is no comprehensive plan for sewerage development, water supply or, indeed, housing development.</P>
    <P>If two years are necessary, then the Minister should use that time to ensure that there is a proper set-up which will function effectively and efficiently in Dublin where one-third of the population is located.  In this city there is one manager, Mr. Macken, who is also responsible for Dublin county.  At city council meetings the city manager is instructed to write to the county manager to ask him if he is in a position to carry out certain functions.  He writes back and tells himself that he cannot do it and he writes again to himself asking that the decision be reconsidered and that he be allowed to do so.  This farcical situation has been in operation for a number of years and the sooner it is cleared up the better, so that we will have some definite line of authority in Dublin city and county which can make a binding and lasting decision without writing to himself. In addition to being confusing for the city manager, it is confusing for public representatives and, indeed, for the official, and it is sometimes easy to understand how agitated some officials become when they see three sets of public representatives, with three sets of ideas and no comprehensive approach, from the same three parties in this House on three different councils, having nothing in common with one another, in the city, the county and Dún Laoghaire Borough.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to pay special attention to the Dublin situation, to see to it that whatever type of structure evolves, it will give a new image to the local authorities because the local <Col N="1068" /> authorities in Dublin and throughout the country have not that good an image.  Some of them have, but in the main they are looked on as a colossal joke, as talking places where certain individuals seek publicity and those of us who have served for a considerable period on Dublin City Council know full well that there are people who monopolised the proceedings for the one purpose of personal publicity without any regard whatever for the needs and problems of the residents. It is important that when the new structure emerges, the responsibilities of public representatives as a whole be clearly defined, with possibly the additional powers, which are little enough, sought by them and that they no longer engage in double talk in the form of supporting rent strikes when in opposition and not supporting them when on the other side.</P>
    <P>This applies to all parties.  I do not blame any party or individuals but we feel that this artificial situation must be abolished and we must have a new responsibility and ensure that the elected representatives have responsibilities and measure up to them.  In the past, it is unfortunate that some representatives did not measure up in this way.  I have heard the question of the abolition of Dublin City Council and Bray Urban Council mentioned here and I feel as I did on that earlier occasion that if public representatives in Dublin City Council had measured up fully to their responsibilities, the council would never have been abolished.  It cil would never have been abolished the council&mdash;it was the council itself&mdash;and I am quite certain that if a serious situation developed in any council or corporation, if it was felt that the public representatives were not playing their part in full, were impeding progress by adopting a negative attitude in failing to play their part, the present Minister may on some future occasion have to consider abolition.  If he does it for just reasons.  I will not disagree, any more than I disagreed with the previous Minister when he abolished Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>The questions of planning, of housing and services development in the city and county are matters to which the Minister must give serious attention <Col N="1069" /> even before any new structure emerges in order to ensure that the three councils can operate more effectively and efficiently for the benefit of the community. I am not terribly concerned with what type of structure evolves as long as it is a commonsense structure which will eliminate many of the defects that exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley mentioned the matter of people being deprived of their votes. It is unfortunate at any time that persons entitled to vote should not have a vote at a particular time, but if he is telling us that a general election will not be called at any time other than when a new register is available, that is fair enough, but the situation must be looked at in terms of its being the prerogative of the Taoiseach to call an election when he thinks fit, at what from his point of view is the best possible moment or when he is forced into it.  When the register comes into operation is not the thought in the mind of the Taoiseach at that time, whether it be the previous Taoiseach, the present Taoiseach or the next Taoiseach, and I think it is cheap publicity on the Deputy's part to seek to indicate that a general election was called to deprive people of their votes.  People have been deprived of votes every time an election has been held over the years before the introduction of the new register but not deliberately.</P>

      <P>I am as fairminded as anyone in relation to the rights of individuals but it is cheap publicity to keep indicating that this was a definite decision designed to deprive people of votes.  That is not so and it has not been and is never a factor in the decision, as I am sure it will not be a factor in future.  These people have their opportunity in the Presidential elections and in all elections in future. This is the way the register is compiled but if we get an understanding now that no election will be called in future, except on the basis of a new register, we can look at the situation in a very different light but I do not think any Government will give that guarantee. If a question is put down to the <Col N="1070" /> leader of the present Government asking if he supports Deputy Begley's point of view and that of other Members, that any future elections will take place only on the new register to ensure that nobody will be deprived because the people who will be deprived of a vote in future, if not fought on a new register, will be the 18-year-olds who are coming into entitlement to vote within a few months of the register becoming effective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a hobby horse and if the Deputy wants to ride this hobby horse, fair enough, but I believe the people have sufficient common sense to understand that this does not happen.  It was just unfortunate on the last occasion that this situation developed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh shed crocodile tears about Bray Urban Council and Dublin Corporation.  I do not suppose he cares two hoots about them but I am as concerned about local democracy as he or anyone else but if local representatives fail to play their part in full, if they fail to measure up to their responsibilities and if a council is abolished purely because of political gimmickry, as in the case of the last council, these people had a right to lose their places.  I am glad to see Dublin Corporation restored even in its present form but I would not have been sorry if an election had been held and new representatives elected.  It does give this voice to the local community and local representatives, a voice which has been missing for some time, but in the meantime I believe that the affairs of the city were conducted in a fairly impartial manner by the commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However long it takes, I hope the Minister will make sure that we will have the type of structure that will be best for the common good of the citizens of the country, and for the common good of the citizens of Dublin city, who comprise one third of the population and deserve special <Col N="1071" /> attention.  I am not too fussy as to whether he holds it this year, next year or the year after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather interested in listening to Deputy Dowling speaking about the last general election and what brought it about.  He said it was the job of the Taoiseach to call the election.  We are all with him on that.  But a number of people were about to reach the age of 18 years and would be entitled to vote for the first time.  He omitted to say that.  If one looks back on the record of elections one finds that there were more general elections, more local elections and more Presidential elections in the month of June than in any other months.  It is quite obvious that the quick decision to hold the election was made to deprive those people of their votes.  If that was not the reason, nobody is stopping Deputy Dowling or any other Fianna Fáil Deputy from telling the House exactly what the reason was.  To me and to everybody else that was the reason.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on postponing the elections.  He is quite justified in doing that for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons is that people aged 18 years are now entitled to vote in local government elections, in a Presidential election, and a Dáil election.  They are not allowed to offer themselves as candidates in local elections. I do not think the Minister would be doing justice to these people &mdash;knowing his thinking and knowing the thinking of every Deputy on this side of the House that they are entitled to the opportunity of offering themselves as candidates in local elections or general elections.  That is another reason why I think he is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people referred to the White Paper issued by the Previous Government. I hope the Minister will succeed in scrapping it immediately. Listening to the people on the opposite benches, you would think that it was we on this side of the House who introduced the Managerial Act.  Far <Col N="1072" /> from it.  It was not we who took the powers from the local authorities.  It was the people on that side of the House who did it.  Listening to Deputy Molloy, Deputy Dowling and other speakers, you would think that it was we who did it.  These people can switch things around in their own minds to suit themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when the Minister scraps the White Paper issued by the previous Government, he will produce something which will not do away with the urban councils or the district councils which Deputy Begley, the Parliamentary Secretary, mentioned. It would be a desperate situation if local government were to be stemmed to that extent.  The whole thinking would be done here, in the Custom House, and in O'Connell Bridge House.  As Deputy Dowling said, members of local authorities would become a laughing stock.  I doubt that you would get people to offer themselves as candidates if that were the situation. Like other Deputies, I have the experience of being a member of a local authority for 35 years.  I never saw any disrespect shown to a member of a local authority unless he created that situation for himself, and there are very few people who did that.  I should like to pay tribute to members of local authorities who spent their time and money looking after the interests of the people of their county or district.</P>
    <P>There are about three areas where a manager is operating two counties. I suggest that there should be one manager in one county.  If a county is too small and it is not economic for a manager to operate it, the secretary of the local authority should act as manager.  I am casting no reflection on the manager for Sligo and Leitrim where this is the case.  It cannot work and it does not work.  I hope the Minister will reduce the powers of these people and give much more to the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Minister's backbenchers who has been clapping him on the back said that one of the reasons why he felt obliged to postpone the local elections was that he wanted to have the opportunity and the legislation to enable people of 18 years and over to stand for election. Maybe he was chancing his arm. I wanted to hear the Minister say he was wrong, which he is, of course. Therefore we can ignore the rest of the contribution made by the Deputy <Col N="1074" /> if this is the sort of speech he insists on giving the House.</P>
      <P>I want to refer in particular to one aspect of this Bill, and quite a serious one to my mind, that is, legislation by order.  After all, the postponement of elections whether they be local, general, Presidential, or otherwise, is pretty important in the lives of our people, and it should be done here in public, as it has been done up to now, by introducing a Bill.  The Minister may say I am wrong but this is my interpretation of it, and I seriously and genuinely object to the part of the Bill which seeks to legislate in this way in future years.  I have heard Opposition speakers condemn this practice again and again on much more trivial and minor matters than the one we are discussing now.  Members on the Government side of the House expressed these feelings strongly, and genuinely I hope, when they were on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister throws up his hand and says: &ldquo;What do you expect?  We are over here a short time only.&rdquo;  I often felt that if he put on an answer-phone and kept it going, we would get the same effect.  Every time somebody gets under his skin, or any time he feels someone is getting under his skin, he throws up his hands in horror and says: &ldquo;Why hit me now with a baby in my arms?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that in the next ten years I will not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would get very &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; at the rate he is going if he were to continue doing it for ten years.  When Deputies on the Government side were over here they spoke very strongly against this sort of legislation.  It is true to say that the order can be brought before the House if people feel aggreived by it.  Why not do it by ordinary straightforward legislation as it has always been done?  In the short time I have been here today the only reason I have heard put forward for postponing the local elections is that those over 18 years should be entitled to go forward and be selected as candidates.  Now that this reason is gone what are the <Col N="1075" /> other reasons for taking the action which we are now taking?</P>
      <P>I know that the former Minister, Deputy Molloy, said during the debate this time last year that the local elections would be held this year.  The present Government, then in Opposition, spent quite a time debating this and putting forward all sorts of arguments and an assurance was given, which was not changed, that the local elections would be held in June of this year.  We are having a Presidential election at the end of this month and it would have been ideal to hold both elections, which has happened on a number of occasions before, on the same day.  It was already decided to hold the Presidential election on the 30th of this month so no valid reason has been put forward for not holding both elections on the same day.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he is only a short time in charge of the Department of Local Government so perhaps he had not time to get down to this work and wanted to kick for touch. This is such a serious matter that I think he made a major mistake in coming before the House with this legislation which deprives those between the ages of 18 and 21 years, who are now on the register since the 14th April, of the opportunity of selecting and electing their local authority representatives, whether they be county councillors, corporation officials, urban councillors or town commissioners. This, among other things, is what the Minister is doing by this legislation.</P>
      <P>I disagree entirely with this legislation because I know that the various local authority representatives, county councillors and the various political organisations all over the country had made arrangements for the county council elections.  In some cases county council candidates were selected in preparation for a June election.  We had the postponement of local elections and other elections over the years but I believe this is only the second time when the local authorities have been seven years in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many councillors elected seven years ago feel like serving now?  How many of them after such a long period <Col N="1076" /> do not wish to get out and leave it to younger people.  There are many valid reasons why a double postponement of local elections should not take place. We heard many reasons by members of the present Government why the local elections should not have been postponed but now, a year later, the present Minister for Local Government comes before us without any explanation, without any good reason, without any excuse and very flippantly says that he is postponing the local elections for another year.  The people do not want this and certainly those over 18 do not want it.  We must remember it was the previous Government who introduced the legislation giving votes to people of 18 years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to thank the Minister for appointing me a Commissioner of Dublin Corporation.  We hear a lot of weeping and wailing from the Opposition regarding the postponement of the local elections but for the last four years Dublin city has been without local government.  The previous Government showed very little concern about taking that right away from the people.  The present Minister was only in office a month when he reconstituted Dublin Corporation by appointing commissioners.  This shows his concern for local government.</P>
      <P>I regret, as I know the Minister does, that the local elections have to be postponed for another year but there are obvious reasons why they have to be postponed.  We had no local government in Dublin; changes were taking place; we had the White Paper on Greater Dublin and we had to look at those in the context as we saw them in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> With regard to the Greater Dublin Council I believe this is coming because Dublin is expanding out into the county and when the corporation require serviced land they have to go into the country.  We have one manager now operating between both authorities, so obviously this is coming.  One must be careful before one comes to a decision as to whether one will have a vast council within the Greater Dublin area.  I believe we shall need a Greater Dublin Council but not solely in that form: within that greater council I see smaller units of say 100,000 so as to give real, meaningful amenities and services in their own areas.  They would send councillors to the Greater Dublin Council.  This would be a useful exercise.</P>
    <P>I believe the greater council will also have to expand its concern to consider clear water areas.  Local authorities may have to look beyond their own boundaries and have regional councils for matters such as water, enviornment and pollution. One local authority may be very diligent in regard to pollution while another may not and as a result there will be no progress.  Regionalisation on water, enviornment and pollution would mean an approach to a situation which is very desirable.</P>
    <P>One smiles at references to people being deprived of votes at 18 when one remembers that they were so deprived on February 28th when a delay of six weeks would have given them votes at 18 not only on a local but on a national level.  To cry about this now seems to me to be shedding crocodile tears.  Votes at 18 were proposed at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis and adopted. Since then we have been constantly bringing the matter to the notice of the Government so that they might introduce votes at 18 but it was eight or nine years afterwards before this was done.  Therefore they should be rather slow to criticise this side of the House on the matter.</P>
    <P>I see the overall development of local authorities as something requiring a complete overhaul because of changing times.  The Minister is quite right to postpone the elections <Col N="1078" /> for one year to give us time so that we shall not hastily rush into electing councils for another five years.  By waiting a year we can draw up comprehensive plans to suit the country's needs today, put them into operation and elect local government representatives on this basis.  In that way we shall get real local government.  I support the postponement because I believe it is in the best interests of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy O'Brien said, but I should like to say first to the Minister that when I speak here I do so honestly.  If I am destructive, I hope it will be in a constructive sense. Deputy O'Brien realises the difference between being in power and being in Opposition and if he were in Opposition his speech would be somewhat different in regard to supporting the postponement of local elections.  I daresay the Minister himself would have been somewhat critical of such a decision.  Make no apologies for that: that is politics.  I hope I do not sound cynical; I do not intend to do so.</P>
      <P>If there is an attempt to get the 18-year-old voters on the side of the Government by suggesting that we called the election when we did because we were fearful of 18-year-old votes, that is unfair because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We know this.  But, as the Minister himself will find out in the course of time&mdash;in fact he is aware of it already&mdash;he does not know when the Leader of the Coalition will call an election and the Leader of the Coalition will, I am sure call an election at the time he thinks best suits the needs of the country, as did our leader.  I say to members of the Government: do not underestimate the intelligence of 18-year-olds.  They are not foolish and it would be a very weak effort to try to give the impression that we held the general election when we did so as to deprive them of votes and that therefore they are forever indebted to the National Coalition and must always vote for them.  That <Col N="1079" /> would be trying to put the 18 to 21 year old voters in a false position. They are not foolish.  The majority of them are aware that Fianna Fáil introduced the necessary legislation.  Deputy O'Brien told us that Fine Gael advocated this as far back as 1963, but it is only in recent years that other countries have given votes at 18, America and Britain and many others. Many European countries, as far as I know, have not yet given votes at 18; in some cases the votes are given at 19 and possibly 20 in others.  I agree with what Deputy O'Brien said regarding the establishment of the Greater Dublin Council.  I favour the setting up of smaller units because if the area covered by a council is too large the council will tend to become remote from the people.  In my own constituency there are many areas such as Rathgar and Rathmines which could have a local council to serve the needs of those communities.  There is also the Kimmage-Crumlin area where there is a high density of population.  I would favour thought being given to the establishment of local councils to perform certain functions in their own areas where they could keep a closer eye on developments.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the dissolution of Dublin Corporation.  That was not the first time a council has been dissolved.  Dublin County Council was dissolved in 1924 for six years by the then Cumann na nGeadhael Government. If there is so much revulsion now against the power of a Minister to dissolve a council I would like to ask the Minister will he consider abolishing that power which he now has and when he is replying I should like to have his views on that.  Will this be another section 31?  Does he think that this power which is so revolting should remain?  Will he abolish it and so make local councils completely independent so that, if they refuse to strike an adequate rate, that is their affair?  What does he intend to do about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the compilation of the electoral register. We are all agreed that there is a great deal to be desired in the compilation <Col N="1080" /> of this register.  Perhaps it would be possible to drop into letter boxes some kind of communication exhorting householders and others eligible to check the register and ensure that their names appear on the register.  I am sure forms, no matter how carefully filled in, can get lost. They may fall off the table accidentally and finish up in a wastepaper basket. We know that large numbers find themselves unregistered when an election comes.  This may result in their losing their votes in, perhaps, two or three elections in a year.  There is something wrong.  The system is falling down somewhere.  I hope the Minister will give special attention to this.  It has been adverted to on both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that young people of 18 to 21 will be able to stand in local elections. I would particularly like to see those young people engaged in youth work putting themselves forward for election.  It is very important that their voices should be heard at local authority level.  In the Dublin area I am sure we could get quite a few young people elected to Dublin Corporation and I would say to them that now is the time to start selecting their spokesmen either through their own organisation or through political parties; there is nothing wrong with political parties. They simply must become involved because it is only by making their voices heard at this level that we will get anything done.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us whether he intends to produce a White Paper in the near future on the re-organisation of local authorities.  The time is certainly ripe for such a paper and the more discussion there is the better it will be.  I would like to emphasise again Deputy O'Brien's point about smaller units.  Smaller units would give the people a bigger voice locally.  Big units tend to become too remote.</P>

      <P>As a member of an urban authority and a member of the county council for some years and having attended many conferences on the White Paper on Local Government, I was indeed amazed at the about face <Col N="1081" /> on the part of Deputy Molloy in his attitude to local authorities.  If my memory serves me correctly, he listened to us but, at the same time, he had his mind made up.  Perhaps I should say he pretended to listen to us.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Begley, pointed out, prior to the dissolution the chips were down in the case of urban authorities and town commissioners because the Minister and the central authority did not deem them of sufficient importance to continue them in existence.  That attitude, of course, was quite typical of the arrogance of the Minister and the central authority.  The people were there to be heard but no attention was paid to what they had to say.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for postponing the local elections.  I am prepared to wait until such time as a Bill is enacted which will give people power locally.  The Minister had many years service in a local authority and he appreciates the appalling frustration suffered over the years in practically every aspect of local government, from housing grants to road estimates and small housing schemes.  Everything had to go to the Department of Local Government.  Power will have to be concentrated in the local authorities and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that powers are entrusted to the local representatives.  They are the people's representatives.  They are accepted by the people as suitable representatives, conscious of the needs of the people.  They also protect the people from the central authority.  If the Minister gives powers locally, particularly with regard to housing and planning appeals, he will do no more than justice and any delay in the meantime will be worthwhile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I believe there is a compelling case for the postponement of the local elections for at least another year.  However, I have a certain reservation because, looking through the Minister's speech, I see that he can make further postponements; he can, for example, come in on 29th June next and say he wants to postpone the elections for another year.  I do not <Col N="1082" /> think that is right.  That is something of which I would not approve.  However, the Minister is new in his office and he should be given an opportunity of studying in depth the full implications of a new local government code. That can only be done in the light of mature experience.</P>
      <P>Last year the elections were postponed on the grounds that the study of the re-organisation was continuing and the Minister for Local Government of the day addressed himself very seriously to that study.  He visited practically every local centre and obtained the views of those involved and assessed the situation.  There must be a vast amount of material available now in the Department which will help the new Minister in formulating proposals for improved local government services.  It is generally recognised, particularly in the larger urban areas, that the present system is outmoded.  That applies not only in Dublin city and county but in the major cities and towns throughout the country.  There is a need to place greater responsibility on local authorities in these areas.  I hope responsibility will be given back to the local people elected to whatever organisation the Minister has in mind.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that the local elections did not take place this year at the same time as the Presidential Election.  Many people were anxious that these elections should take place. The Government have decided that they should not take place, and we must put up with that decision.  I hope that the Minister will be in a position shortly to bring in a measure concerning the general reorganisation of local government.  I know that the Minister has been very busy since he took office, although the Dáil only met on about eight occasions.  We have had a long holiday.  The Minister had to deal with the Rates Bill.</P>

      <P>I wondered when we would be recalled to deal with the legislation.  I appreciate that this is a complex measure.  The reorganisation <Col N="1083" /> of such an important service is very difficult.  I am prepared to give the Minister reasonable time to bring his proposals before us.  Other speakers mentioned the serious overlapping and anomalies in administration, particularly in the Dublin region, the duplication of officers and officials&mdash;all of which are very costly and contribute to the burden of rates which the people have to pay.  I look forward to the time when the Minister will be in a position, perhaps even during this session of the Dáil, to inform us of his proposals for the general reorganisation of the local government services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for postponing the elections this year, and for having a down-to-earth attitude to local government problems generally.  The local government elections should be postponed until next year.  I am not qualified to say whether local government should be reorganised.  No matter how small a local authority may be, it arouses thought at local level.  A small local authority may bring many advantages to the people at local level.  We should not rush the legislation which would abolish these small councils or town commissions.  I do not believe that the previous Minister could have had this type of legislation ready even if there had not been a general election. It would have been at least this time of the year before he would have been able to have had such legislation dealt with in the House.  It would have been this time of the year before the persons who would have been facing the electorate in June would have known the kind of authority they were going to have and to which they would be standing for election.  I ask the Minister to be careful and to make sure that he is doing the right thing.</P>
      <P>There has been discussion about the young people of 18 not having votes this year.  The Minister has not deprived these young people of their votes; they will have them in time for the next local elections.  They were deprived of their votes in the general election.  The young people should become familiar with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> The Minister should look carefully at how local authorities could be revised. Some small councils may not be able to raise sufficient money.  The financing of local authorities needs thought.  In any change in local administration at present the Minister should consider giving power back to the people to whom it really belongs, the ordinary representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a county council for many years.  I have never known that council to announce an irresponsible decision.  People on such councils are capable of using power given to them.  I am far more impressed by the speeches of the people in the council of which I have the honour to be a member than I am by the contributions in this House.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints that an overall scheme for big centres like Dublin is necessary.  I am not qualified to give an opinion on that.  Mention has been made of difficulties in relation to planning permission.  It has been said that planning permission has to be got from one council or another even where the corporation are taking land in a county council area.  I am also a member of a regional planning authority covering not only all of greater Dublin but also County Wicklow, County Meath and County Kildare.  Public representatives attend meetings of that authority in an advisory capacity only.  These people, if they were doing their jobs properly, would bring before the regional council all the planning they had in mind, and the problems could be ironed out in a manner which would ensure that one council would know the plans of another council.  That does not mean that any of these councils should be abolished.</P>
    <P>People in the 18-year-old group should be given sufficient time to help them to decide what kind of authority they would elect.  The Minister should give back to the local authorities some of the powers that have been taken away from them over the years.  At a seminar on one occasion I was told that the council make the policy but that the county manager is the executive officer who carries it out.  I have <Col N="1085" /> not found that that was how it worked out in practice.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that local elections have been postponed twice in succession.  I have been on a council for six years.  The previous council had been in office for seven years.  In my own capacity as a councillor I have seen schemes coming to fruition.  I am proud of the fact that I initiated some of these schemes. This has only happened because of the postponement of the elections. Had my term of office as a councillor been over, I would not have seen the fruits of my work.</P>
    <P>I believe in democracy.  People should have advice as often as possible. The Minister should look at the possibility of having a term of office of seven years for councils.  That might solve many of our problems.  Councillors might then start programmes knowing that they could see them through during their term of office. This would apply if members of councils had greater power than they have now.  I would conclude by saying that the Bill should be passed.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Deputies who took part in the debate for the manner in which they dealt with the Bill.  I disagreed with quite a number of things that some Deputies said.  They disagreed with me. Fair is fair.  Some of the arguments put forward were quite reasonable; some were ridiculous.  Deputy Molloy deplored the postponement of the local elections.  He seemed to forget that there were three other postponements in the last eight years&mdash;not a bad record&mdash;and the fact that two of them were carried out by the Government of which he was then a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The postponement in this case was necessary because of the proximity of the Presidential election and because of the many elections held in the last six or eight months.  Anyone who thinks that the general public like elections or that the ratepayer, who is responsible for paying for the elections, wants frequent elections, should <Col N="1086" /> consider the facts.  The election will cost about £200,000.  We could not have another election this year.  Some people ask why did we not have the local elections with the Presidential election.  Out of the mouth of one of the Deputies who suggested that we should do that, let me give the explanation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government in the former Government, Deputy Cunningham, said in the debate last year&mdash; Volume 261, column 1044 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, the Government's decision to seek authority to postpone the local elections was based on two considerations. In the first place, legislative proposals relating to changes in the structure of local government arising from the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation are being prepared and it would not have been possible to have this legislation dealt with before June. Secondly, it was considered undesirable that the local elections and the referendum in relation to the accession to the European Communities should be held so close to one another.  The desirability of postponing the elections in these circumstances has not been called seriously into question.</P>
    <P>We had a referendum in December and a general election in February and will have a Presidential election in May.  I do not know how the Deputy could suggest, in these circumstances, that we should proceed to hold the local elections in June or have them on the same day as the Presidential election.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion that a Presidential election and local elections were held on the same day there were a great number of complaints because there were two ballot papers and where urban councils were being elected there were three ballot papers and there was a lot of confusion.  I agreed that the objection was warranted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of whether they would guarantee when the election would be held, Deputy <Col N="1087" /> Cunningham said&mdash;at column 1045:</P>
    <P>Doubts were raised as to whether it would be possible to have the legislation on local government reform enacted and implemented within the next 12 months.  I do not know the precise circumstances which will prevail in 12 months' time. All that can be said at this stage is that the intention is to hold the next local elections in June, 1973, and it is intended to proceed with proposals for local government reform as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I could not say it better.  Deputy Ben Briscoe suggested that when one moves across the House one changes one's ideas.  Here is the best example that could be obtained of a person crossing the House and changing his ideas to such an extent that I can quote what he said, as being the best argument that I could make.</P>
    <P>I hope that the next local elections will be held in June, 1974.  While it is true that Deputy Molloy, as Minister, and his Government, produced a White Paper, I do not agree with the White Paper.  Neither do my Government. Therefore we propose to have a good hard look at it.  Deputy Timmons, Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore are correct in saying that the thing must be done properly.  It is unreasonable to suggest that in a period of a month or so priority should be given to this, because it would not have been possible.  I want to say categorically that I believe there was no intention on the part of Deputy Molloy to hold local elections in June, 1973 because, if there had been, the legislation to have the changes made in the areas should have been passed before that.  It is only right that this matter should be clarified. These are the facts.  I do not want to follow the hare that was raised about votes at 18 but, just for the record, let me say that the previous Government did hold a referendum in December at which the people, with the encouragement of the three parties, decided that there should be votes at 18 but no legislation was introduced to give them the vote at 18 and that legislation had to be passed before they <Col N="1088" /> could have the vote.  It fell to my lot, and I am happy that it was my first legislative act in this House, to introduce a Bill to give the vote at 18 and also to allow persons of 18 years to be members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Whether or not the vote at 18 was an issue when the general election was called is a matter on which I would not be competent to decide.  It looked very suspicious but I would accept the assurance of colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party that there were other far more serious matters which caused the general election to be called and I can guess one or two of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy said that, of course, I would want to have a look at local government reorganisation.  That is quite ture.  I do want to have local Government reorganisation.  I am quite sure that Deputies, particularly in Dublin, will be prepared to agree with me that the county electoral areas which were drawn up in 1942 in most cases have not been revised since.  In many counties significant changes have occurred in the distribution of population which have not been reflected in the allocation of county seats. Talk about gerrymandering&mdash;artificial gerrymandering has occurred so that a person would need 4,000 or 5,000 votes to get elected in one area whereas a person can be elected in another area with 300, 400 or 500 votes.  That is entirely wrong.  While it is not as important, it is almost as important as the issue of the constituencies with regard to Dáil seats. Therefore I propose to get local authorities interested in having this matter rectified as quickly as possible. While the last word remains with the Minister and while I could as of now notify local authorities as to how they should draw their areas and the number of representatives they should have in an area, because this is not laid down in legislation, I hope to get the assistance of local authorities in having a fair system of drawing up the new electoral areas so that there will be something like unanimity between them and myself with regard to how it should be done and so that there will be a fairer system and fair <Col N="1089" /> representation.  Everybody in the House would be prepared to agree with that and that this should be done before the next local elections.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy asked me if it is my intention to abolish county councils.  Let me state categorically that I have no intention now or at any other time of abolishing county councils.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh wanted a chance to debate the postponement.  This brings in also what Deputy Cunningham said.  I do not know whether other Deputies agreed with me or not&mdash;perhaps my sense of humour differs from theirs&mdash;I felt in the case of Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Cunningham it was the pot calling the kettle black. While Deputy Cunningham was accusing Deputy Reynolds of not knowing that the votes at 18 Bill had been passed and signed, Deputy Cunningham did not know what the Bill now before the House does.  He did not know that it contains, not a proposal that by order the Minister should have authority to change the date of the elections from one year to another or postpone them, but a provision which means, if passed, as I expect it will be, that the Minister can introduce a motion before the House which will not be effective unless debated and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In view of that it is unfair that Deputy Cunningham should try to give the impression that I want to do what many of my predecessors did&mdash;they just made an order and wiped out anything they wished because they had authority to do so.  I do not propose to take that authority.  I think that would be wrong.</P>
    <P>If the Houses of the Oireachtas in future years decide for good reason to agree to the postponement of elections, then the postponement takes place; if they do not agree, the postponement does not take place.  I might add I have no intention of postponing the elections beyond next year.  I want to make it clear that the right to postpone will remain with the Oireachtas, the same as applies to a Bill, but it will save a lot of parliamentary time.  We <Col N="1090" /> have had a useful debate today; now we have the ideas and anyone who has something special to say will have the right to say it when the matter comes before the House.  Deputy Kavanagh and others who are interested know it is proposed to hold the elections in 1974 and if we have to postpone them they will have an opportunity to discuss the matter in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore wanted to know the position with regard to the Greater Dublin area.  As I have stated already, I intend to have a thorough review of the present organisation of local government and this includes Dublin. It is only fair that I should be given a fairly good time to have a look at the matter.  I have been doing quite a lot of other work in the past few months and it is only fair that I be given a reasonable length of time to study the matter.</P>
    <P>The future shape of local government will have to be decided for many years to come and I propose to do this as quickly as possible.  However, I do not want to give a definite date because that would be unfair.  Deputy Molloy and Deputy Moore were anxious to get detailed information on my views on the structure of local government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy completed his study of the local government system and published his findings in a White Paper in February, 1971.  By the time he left office two years later he had not made up his mind on what he wanted to do with regard to this matter because he did not introduce here the necessary legislation to change the system.  Therefore, he is drawing the long bow in this when he suggests I should have been able to make up my mind between the general election and the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe he met all the local authorities in the country but the peculiar thing is that practically every local authority, including those where Fianna Fáil had a majority, were opposed to the idea.  The municipal authorities at their conference unanithin <Col N="1091" /> mously decided not to agree with the propos he put forward but, despite that, the Deputy tells us he had legislation almost ready to do what he wanted&mdash;not what the elected representatives wanted.  I do not propose to do that.  I am not going to steamroll members of local authorities because I have the greatest respect for these people.  They do a lot of work for which they do not get paid.  Many people criticise county councillors, commissioners and urban councillors; all of these people work very hard, they do not get paid, and I wonder frequently why they do it.  They have a dedication to public service it is nearly impossible to comprehend.</P>
      <P>Because someone did not like the present system it was decided that a list of local authorities which my Parliamentary Secretary read out would be wiped out without giving any opportunity to explain why they should be retained.  The small local authorities are doing a good job and the only thing wrong is that the system of financing some of their schemes must be reconsidered.  I have met many of the local authority members during the years and I am satisfied it would be most unfair to wipe them out with a stroke of the pen, as was suggested. However, it was only suggested.  Legislation was never brought before the House to do this; it was held over their heads like a sword.  I do not know why this was so.  I am satisfied that if Deputy Molloy were Minister for Local Government he could not have the local elections this year unless he carried them out on the same terms as the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Dublin and Bray, I reconstituted those two bodies and I think it was the right thing to do.  In fact, it was something we had to do because the issue on which they refused to strike the rate was the matter of the health charges.  As we decided to do something about taking the health charges off the rates it was only right to reinstate the authorities which were abolished because they were not prepared to strike a rate which they thought unfair.  It does not matter what party the members of the local authority belonged to or, <Col N="1092" /> indeed, if they belonged to any political party.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters complained of at Question Time today would not have occurred if we had active members on a Dublin council.  Whether it would be possible to have 100,000 population units with eight councils to cover them, whether we will have one great council, or whether we will retain it as it is at present, is something I am not prepared to comment on until I have an opportunity of going into the matter in detail.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham commented on the fact that the local elections in 1966 were postponed for a further year because of the Presidential election in 1966 and this meant there was a gap of seven years between the elections. Deputy Briscoe referred to the abolition of Dublin Corporation but, as I pointed out, we must restore them because we have taken measures with regard to the health charges.</P>
      <P>The matter we have been debating boils down to two questions.  First, do we agree that the local elections should be postponed&mdash;and even Deputy Molloy agreed that should be done&mdash;and secondly, if, at a future date we want to postpone the elections, should a Bill be introduced or should we have a motion that might be discussed by both Houses of the Oireachtas?  I think Deputy Molloy was prepared, whether reluctantly or not, to accept that these proposals should be passed.</P>

Furthermore, if this Government had been elected any time in the last couple of years, the council would have been reinstated immediately this Government came into being because we do not believe that the people of the capital city of Ireland should have representing them one man paid by the State.

Instead of replying to stupid questions, I am saying that we are providing that there will not be this long rigmarole of having a Bill on each occasion and having it debated <Col N="1095" /> at length.

      <P>The suggestion that the time of the House be cut down is admirable in some respects but this Government have met only on a few occasions since they were appointed. Are we to take it that this is to be a new pattern or development&mdash;that most of the business of the House will be done by orders which will be presented on the occasional day the House will meet?  Is this part of a new development, that the business normally done in the House in a democratic way, through Act of Parliament, will in future be done by ministerial order?</P>

      <P>We all know that certain businessmen would love that to happen.  It is the intention of the Government to do things in a democratic way but it is not their intention that the time of the House should be taken up dealing with things that should be done in a less formal way. We shall be busy dealing with legislation to improve conditions in the country.  There was a lot of legislation and a lot of discussion here in the past few years that we could have done without.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum of £5,104,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> The Estimate shows a net increase of £615,000 over last year.  I should point out, however, that the employment exchages were transferred to the Department of Social Welfare with effect from 1st April, 1973, and the cost of administering the service will be borne on that Department's Vote. The main increases are in Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £229,000 and in subventions to AnCo, £240,000, IMI, £25,000 and CERT £20,000.</P>
    <P>In introducing my first Estimate to the House as Minister for Labour, I intend to address myself to three main areas:</P>
    <P>1.  A general review of the work of my Department and its various agencies during the past year.</P>
    <P>2.  Indicate to the House my views as to the role of the Department of Labour in the general field of social industrial policy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>3.  In the light of that general approach and the realities of life in our country at the present time, to indicate the main areas of action to which my Department will be devoting their attention and energies during the coming year.</P>
    <P>As this is the first debate on Labour affairs to take place since Ireland became a member of the European Communities, it is appropriate that, before commencing the customary review of the Department's services, I should make reference to the EEC.  As far as I am concerned the most significant fact is that the European Communities, with their opportunities and their problems, are now part of the economic and social environment in which the Department must work.  I stress the social dimension of this European Community, which it is the function of my Department to give substance to, in all our contacts with the Community bodies with whom we collaborate.  If at home my Ministry is concerned with the human factor in social and economic planning, that home concern to be successful must in the context of our EEC membership be directed to making of the Community a truly human comity of nations, as the Paris Heads of State Declaration laid down. Indeed, in my own contacts with Community <Col N="1098" /> leaders, I propose to take the Paris Summit Declaration of the Heads of State as my point of reference, with a view to raising it to a point of equal influence on Community action as was the original Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity of assessing in a preliminary way the implications of membership as far as the work of the Department of Labour is concerned and, consequently, the policies now being developed and operated take account of our membership of the Communities.  However, I should like to consider first the home situation.  It is, unfortunately, true that no review of the Irish work situation can start at any point other than that of unemployment. This began to increase in the final quarter of 1970, continued into early 1972 and it was only in the latter half of last year that more hopeful signs began to appear with an increase in employment in transportable goods industries.  This reflected itself in a decline in the numbers of unemployed compared with 1971; but the primary catalyst for all policy in my Department and in those other agencies responsible for job creation is the fact that we have at this time 68,000 people unemployed in this country.</P>
    <P>Despite the rising unemployment between 1971 and mid-1972 we have seen a continuous drop in emigration over the same period.  I believe that we have no grounds for complacency here since the figures for job creation in no way indicate why this should be so.  We must recognise that during the past few years when there has been an apparently spectacular improvement in the emigration situation, it has been coupled with a low level of economic activity and a high rate of unemployment in Britain.  The continuing counter-effect of the condition of the British economy for good or ill on our prospects must, even in an EEC context, continue to be a prime consideration affecting the economic advancement of this entire country.  To absorb into employment those available for work is a formidable national task and the national objective of achieving full employment is one which the Government is placing at the highest priority level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> The most notable characteristic of the Irish economy in the past 18 months has been the very high level of redundancies which we have experienced. While it may be argued that this is a necessary transitional stage to a higher level of technology and efficiency in Irish industry, no administration may ignore the very great human and social implications involved for working people.  We must ensure that we have the earliest possible information on likely redundancies, and warding off the worst effects, by helping industry modernise in a less socially disruptive way.  As a last resort, we must ensure that the transition into new employment is achieved at the lowest possible cost to the individual worker, his family and his local community.</P>
    <P>We must expect, however, that the continuing characteristics of the Irish economic scene will be a steady outflow of workers from agriculture, the necessity for workers to change from one occupation to another or one industry to another as our economic processes are modernised and the continuing need to adapt our industrial society to meet the social aspirations and demands of Irish working people.  The statistics of employment spell a story made familiar elsewhere, of a country in course of transition from a settled rural economy to a new industrial civilisation.  It is the major task of my ministry to ensure that the new industrial society we are making will respect human dignity, cherishing all who work equally.</P>
    <P>Against this background with which Deputies will be familiar, I should now like to deal with the activities of the more important sections and agencies of my Department during the past year.</P>
    <P>It is often overlooked that the training of our work force is a key factor in the attainment of higher living standards. We have been accustomed in the past to overlook this element in economic planning.  There is an intimate link between rising technological <Col N="1100" /> emphasis in our industry, in itself an inescapable component of an industrial base which is expanding and generating higher living standards, and the level of training in the work place.  Sociologists have long noted that the unemployed and the unskilled are synonymous, which in itself is synonymous with underdevelopment and non-fulfilment.</P>
    <P>The provision nationally of adequate training facilities is critical for our continued advancement, We will not secure a place in working Europe unless our people are trained to the higher skills required.  Without this training input, requiring augmentation of resources allocated, the scale of industrial development will remain static.  How often is it forgotten in the official mind that investment in the human element in industry is as vital, and immeasurably more so in my mind, as investment in capital and material infrastructure?</P>
    <P>One of the essential areas of concern of my Department is that of training for industry.  It is of particular importance to our young people.  We have a duty to provide our young people with every possible opportunity for development of their talents.  Since its inception in 1967 AnCO has provided diverse manufacturing industries in this country, many of advanced technology with workers whose latent skills they had developed.  These were mostly young people who eagerly grasped at the training opportunities provided by enlightened management. AnCO works closely with employers, workers, educational interests and Government agencies, and its council represents these interests.  Decisions are taken by AnCO on the advice of representative industrial training committees, which affect businessmen and members of trade unions.  These decisions are the outcome of a process in which nominees of employers and workers are very closely involved.</P>
    <P>Of all AnCO's objectives perhaps the primary one has been to make both managers and trade unions aware of the importance of, and the benefits to be derived from, effective training schemes.  By encouraging and assisting companies to identify training <Col N="1101" /> needs and to prepare and implement programmes to meet those needs, AnCO hopes to make training a necessary and integral part of every company's operations.</P>
    <P>The main programme which AnCO have devised to achieve their overall aim are company based training, apprenticeship training and direct training.  With respect to apprenticeship training, AnCO recently published a document entitled <i>Apprenticeship&mdash;A new Approach.</i> This contains far-reaching proposals for a modernisation of the apprenticeship system. It should be emphasised that these are proposals, not decisions.  The document has been widely circulated to all the interests concerned&mdash;trade unions, employers, vocational education interests and Government Departments&mdash; and AnCO will be having full consultations with all these interests before coming to final decisions.</P>
    <P>The aim of the proposals is to ensure that Irish craftsmen are trained to the highest international standards, that the skilled work force necessary for industrial expansion will be available in future, and that individual apprentices and craftsmen will be given a reasonable opportunity of developing their abilities fully.  It might be said that AnCO has performed a public service in preparing these proposals for discussion and that it is hoped that the proposals will be given careful consideration by everybody concerned.  I should like to emphasise here that these proposals have been very carefuly thought out and discussed with all the interests concerned. I feel these proposals are very worthwhile and should be carefully studied by all Deputies.  They are reasonable proposals and I would welcome any reasonable counter-points or other recommendations regarding them that Members may care to make.</P>
    <P>Levy-grant schemes are in operation for textiles, clothing and footwear, food, drink and tobacco, construction and engineering and the printing and paper industries.  In addition, AnCO has begun on a project for the chemical and allied products sector.  AnCO have informed me that they operate these levy-grant schemes in a reasonably <Col N="1102" /> flexible way.  They recognise that every company has its own problems and priorities.  They are prepared to help companies at all times to advise on, and in most cases solve, their training problems.  This system is essentially designed with a view to underlining the importance of training to management.</P>
    <P>It is a new system and it will take time to produce results.  While it has not been welcomed in some sectors of the business community, it should be pointed out that considerable progress is being made and I am satisfied that the system should be retained for some time to come.  Certain modifications to the system might be considered in the future, so that companies making a genuine and worthwhile effort in training, will be relieved of the responsibility of paying levy, and that those companies which it is felt are not giving wholehearted co-operation in preparing and implementing training programmes for their staff will find it more difficult to recover the levy which they pay in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>Initially all firms were included in the scope of the levy-grant schemes. However, some time ago AnCO decided to introduce cut-off points and exemptions to the levy order, thus exempting from levy smaller firms in each industry.  Small firms may, however, opt in to training schemes and participation through group arrangements. I would, indeed, welcome such moves.</P>
    <P>In the first year of levy-grant schemes for three of the designated sectors&mdash; textiles, clothing and footwear, food, drink and tobacco&mdash;94 per cent of the levy has been paid and 83 per cent has been paid back to the companies. In the engineering industry first year scheme, 82 per cent of the levy has been collected while 64 per cent of the levy in the first year scheme for the construction industry has also been collected.  Any levy funds remaining after payment of grants will be used for the benefit of training for these industries.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the initial results of the schemes are encouraging. More top managers are becoming <Col N="1103" /> aware of the importance of training&mdash; a point which was made very clear to me at the recent Irish Management Institute conference in Killarney.  At the latest count, Irish industry employed 255 full-time training managers, 365 part-time training staff, and 1,312 instructors/demonstrators who can be regarded and are by my Department to be doing very valuable work.  An increasing number of businessmen acknowledge that the levy/grant system focussed attention on an essential but hitherto neglected area of business.</P>
    <P>It is significant to mention here that AnCO are co-operating with the Irish Management Institute in a study of how managerial training needs might best be met in the future.  AnCO assist management and supervisory training by paying up to 50 per cent of the cost of attendance by managers and supervisors at courses.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the system of apprenticeship will have to be updated if we are to have enough well-trained skilled workers in the years ahead.  As an experiment, AnCO have provided first year training to 500 apprentices in a systematic way, off-the-job, in their training centres.  This experiment is regarded as being highly successful and both employers and trade unions have been impressed with the standard of skill of the young people so trained. It may be that off-the-job training with shorter apprenticeship periods might well provide the basis of a system for the future.</P>
    <P>A disturbing aspect has been a drop in apprentice intake in the past couple of years.  If this decline continues, it could have serious results in four or five years' time when the output of fully qualified skilled workers will be correspondingly reduced.  I have had discussions with AnCO on this disturbing feature, who are at present conducting an intensive campaign to get intake raised and the results so far, I am glad to say, have been most encouraging.  I would appeal to employers to co-operate with them.  I am hopeful that this campaign will succeed.  If it does not, additional <Col N="1104" /> measures may have to be undertaken to ensure that shortages of skilled workers do not hinder our future progress.</P>
    <P>AnCO have training centres in Waterford, Shannon, Galway, Dublin, Cork, Gweedore and Dundalk.  The centres have a total of about 1,400 training places with a through-put of 2,400 trainees a year.  A further training centre in the north west region is also planned to be opened later this year.  In addition, experimental mobile training units with about 100 training places are operating in Tralee, Athlone and Ballina.  The experience gained from these centres will enable future demands to be assisted and provide indications on unlikely developments.  It is worth noting that in three years AnCO have trained or retrained over 2,000 adults and apprentices in their training centres.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that by 1975 there will be nine or ten permanent training centres with a capacity of about 2,000 training places each of which would serve a region and have a mobile training unit or units.  These mobile units would provide in addition another 500 training places.  It is also envisaged that the range of courses would be expanded and the duration of some courses could be reduced.  It is hoped that retraining of older workers and particularly provision of courses for women will figure more prominently than hitherto.  On this basis AnCO by 1975 would be able to handle 8,000 to 10,000 trainees a year.</P>
    <P>AnCO are working in close co-operation with the IDA in regard to the location of training centres and the courses provided in them.  A network of well-run training centres providing relevant courses is a vitally important addition to the measures under way to attract new industry to Ireland which, in itself, is a vital aim of this Government.  There is another exciting and unique aspect of AnCO's operations on which I am seeking development.  It is in the crucial area of cross-Border economic co-operation. Discussions about the possibilities for co-operation between the <Col N="1105" /> training authorities in the north and AnCO have been proceeding.  Some of the AnCO training centres are close to the Border and so are some of the training centres in the north.</P>
    <P>In the light of the proposed Council of Ireland, it is both sensible and vital for mutual economic progress to continue to examine the extent to which training centres both north and south can co-operate in providing training to persons living in the border areas, so as to avoid duplication and overlapping of facilities.  It is also envisaged that research into training matters would also be arranged on a co-operative basis as would the development of common curricula for training courses. Similarly, it would also be possible to arrange for a common staff development programme.</P>
    <P>As industry becomes more widespread in Ireland, and employment emphasis changes away from agriculture, we are trying to accomplish in a few short decades what has taken over 100 years in most of the industrial countries.  The three key areas of the AnCO effort have been the levy/grant system, apprenticeship and direct training. It is of the greatest importance that their efforts in all three areas should succeed.  As I remarked earlier, the levy/grant system has its opponents. Firms with good training arrangements sometimes regard it as an intrusion, but I must ask the House to accept the fact that we have a long way to go before the level of training of Irish industry as a whole can be regarded as adequate.  My attitude is that the levy/grant system should be retained until the greater majority of industrial firms have adopted satisfactory standards of training.  When this day comes I shall gladly look for other means to keep our industrial training at a satisfactory level.</P>
    <P>The financial provision for AnCO in 1973-74 has been fixed at £3 million an increase of £240,000 over 1972-73. This provision has been settled on the firm expectation that substantial additional moneys will be forthcoming in the current financial year for training purposes from the European Social Fund.  I am not in a position at present <Col N="1106" /> to accurately state what Ireland's share of that fund will be, but I am more than hopeful that our training requirements will not be hampered by lack of adequate finance.  It need hardly be emphasised that the financial aid forthcoming from the European Social Fund will enable AnCO to undertake a considerable expansion of their direct training activities.</P>
    <P>One further point I might mention. At present AnCO pay to unemployed and redundant workers undergoing training a weekly allowance which is marginally better than the appropriate rate of unemployment benefit.  AnCO are proposing to increase these allowances with a view to changing to a system of income related allowances.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a change in traditional attitudes towards the unemployed. As a society, we inherit more than we care to acknowledge of the social attitudes of the Victorian era.  I foresee hopefully in the near future that an unemployed person will naturally undergo further training to improve his or her chances of re-entry to gainful employment, whilst out of work.  Our training service must cater for that future requirement.</P>
    <P>The increasing awareness by management of the importance of training is due in no small measure to the efforts of the Irish Management Institute. During the year the institute continued to co-operate with AnCO in providing courses for training managers and training executives.</P>
    <P>The institute provides special training courses to equip managers with the knowledge and skills required to compete in international markets. Special attention is given to managers in small firms.  A very high standard of management expertise is required so that the other skills we are developing will have the best opportunity of being used.  That is what justifies Exchequer support towards the IMI management development programme.</P>
    <P>To expand its services to meet the demand for management training the institute has found it necessary to build new premises.  I welcome this <Col N="1107" /> expansion of the institute's activities and Exchequer support for the project has been promised.  The total subvention will be £400,000 over the three-year period 1972-73 to 1974-75. £150,000 is being paid in 1973-74.</P>
    <P>The need to induce a revival of business and to promote the expansion of tourism highlights the need for more and better hotel training.  Higher staff standards, to which training can contribute, are important for the recovery of the tourist industry.  Hence the increase in the grant to CERT Ltd. I visualise that training for the hotel and catering business should in time come under the umbrella of AnCO&mdash;this would be in accord with the Industrial Training Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>The span of training facilities offered by CERT should, however, be expanded to include industrial catering needs.  The primacy of training staff for the tourist industry must, I feel, continue to be upheld but there need be no conflict between broadening the areas of training covered by CERT and providing for the special needs of the tourist industry which evidence indicates will be one of our major revenue earners in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The development and expansion of the National Manpower Service continued during the last year.  Additional placement staff were recruited and trained and a number of new offices were opened.  There are now six regional directors and 28 placement officers operating in 13 centres.  These are Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Dundalk, Drogheda, Sligo, Athlone, Wexford, Ballybofey, Ennis and Monaghan.  It is intended to open offices in a number of additional centres in 1973.  Recruitment of additional staff is in progress and I hope to increase numbers substantially over the next few years.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of the manpower service to build a reputation for skilled, rapid service.  The service deals with people&mdash;the most valuable asset of any country.  By placing job seekers in the jobs best suited to them and by securing, <Col N="1108" /> quickly, the best available workers for employers the manpower service provides valuable help to job seekers, employers and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding employment difficulties the service has, since June, 1971, placed over 13,000 people in jobs.  About 1,400 were in the administrative and clerical categories, with a small number at executive and senior management levels.</P>
    <P>Where no suitable candidates can be found from within the country, the service tries to fill vacancies from Irish emigrants living abroad.  Copies of the service's vacancy lists are circulated regularly to over 150 Irish organisations in Britain and to our embassies abroad.  Workers returning to Ireland with the approval of the manpower service, are entitled to benefit under the resettlement assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>Another feature is a schedule containing details of professional and highly-skilled workers seeking jobs in Ireland which is circulated twice a year to major Irish firms.  The schedule has a special section for graduates undertaking post-graduate courses in business administration in the US. The schedule which at present covers over 160 persons is revised and updated regularly.  Some employers as well as the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, and a number of regional technical colleges have found this service of great value.</P>
    <P>I propose developing this service into a national professional and executive register.  In co-operation with the appointments officers in the universities, final-year graduates would be encouraged to register with the manpower service.  A pilot co-operative programme in this area has been started with the equivalent British Government service and it is hoped in this way to make information on this type of vacancy more widely available to Irish people in Britain.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to provide &ldquo;self-service&rdquo; facilities in the Dublin office of the manpower service on an experimental basis.  Particulars <Col N="1109" /> of vacancies will, with the agreement of employers, be displayed in the public office and job-seekers will seek suitable vacancies for themselves. The success of the &ldquo;self-service&rdquo; depends on the co-operation of employers.  Experience will show whether &ldquo;self-service&rdquo; placement will become a permanent feature of the manpower service here.</P>
    <P>The importance of this initiative is that it opens up a new source of job information for those who want to change jobs rather than those who are without jobs and thus raises the visibility of the National Manpower Service in the eyes of the public.  A vocational guidance service for adults is being prepared.  The vast majority of adult job seekers using the service know the types of jobs they want and need only information on vacancies. So far the percentage requiring skilled guidance has been small.  I hope to have a clearer indication in the next year or so of the extent to which a specialist guidance service should be provided.  In the meantime a start will be made on a pilot basis in one or two centres.</P>
    <P>The manpower forecasting unit has been integrated with the information activities of the National Manpower Service.  The emphasis on the work of the unit has changed to making estimates of the quality and quantity of labour available for employment in particular areas.  This information is prepared mainly for use by the Industrial Development Authority and to help industrial promoters to select areas for factories.</P>
    <P>Over the past eighteen months labour availability surveys of this kind have been carried out in 15 areas and a further ten are planned for the next 12 months.  Three special surveys were carried out on behalf of AnCO for the setting up of mobile training centres in Athlone, Ballina and Tralee.  Work on a new classification of occupations based on the ILO classification and suitable for use in the EEC is nearing completion.  It should be ready for use in the National Manpower Service offices during 1973 and is already used experimentally in a number of the offices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Responsibility for the employment exchanges was resumed by the Department of Social Welfare from 1st April last.  This followed a decision of the previous Government that job placement should be separated from benefit-paying and that the benefit-paying function should then revert to the Department of Social Welfare, a decision with which I agree.  In any area not served by a manpower office the employment exchanges will continue to carry out placement work under an arrangement between the two services.</P>
    <P>To meet the demand for information on careers over 200 leaflets covering more than 300 careers have been published and distributed.  These leaflets are continuously updated and revised. Irish language versions are also published.</P>
    <P>More careers exhibitions are being organised by schools, colleges, and development organisations.  Personnel of the Department attend these exhibitions to publicise the careers service and distribute the leaflets as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>Whilst recent years have seen a distinct improvement in the range of careers open to young people, a great deal remains to be done by way of providing more information and guidance about job opportunities for young people.</P>
    <P>Young people cannot be expected to make wise decisions about their future career or occupation if we do not ensure that reliable information and guidance is at their disposal.  More must be done to ensure that we cater for all the needs of youth in the matter of job guidance and information on suitable openings.</P>
    <P>I have in mind closer liaison with a fast growing section in the teaching profession.  I refer to teachers specialising in a full-time capacity in careers information.  There is an yet too meagre a recognition on the part of many schools on the need for career advice and information.</P>
    <P>I propose to initiate discussions with the relevant authorities leading to early decisions which will help our <Col N="1111" /> school leavers in their choice of a working career.  Before I leave this subject, I should like to pay a well earned compliment to the <i>Evening Herald</i> for their enterprise and sense of commitment to our young people as it demonstrated in their career desk feature.</P>
    <P>There is little point in young people taking a job with little prospect of advancement or in chosing an occupation with no future.  Young people must be able to see clearly how they can progress to higher levels of job satisfaction.  Training and further education is of vital importance in giving the quality of choice to young people seeking work.  Only the skilled and educated young person will truly relish freedom of choice in occupation. It must be our objective to give this freedom to every young person by providing the facilities.</P>
    <P>The resettlement assistance scheme helps persons who have to move to new areas to take up employment arranged through the National Manpower Service.  The scheme was confined to the unemployed or to workers about to become redundant who were insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  In October, 1971, the scheme was extended to all workers including emigrants returning to Ireland.  The number assisted in 1971 was 168.  In 1972, 995 people were assisted and of these 355 were resettled in new areas including 56 who returned from Britain and Northern Ireland.  The people who returned had skills which were in short supply or were unavailable here.  The extended scheme is undoubtedly an attraction to employers and job-seekers and the co-operation of employers with the manpower service has increased as a result.  I am satisfied that the scheme is contributing to a greater degree of mobility in our work force.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in October, 1969, a committee of persons interested in and familiar with the welfare of emigrants was appointed to advise on the problems of persons going abroad and of Irish people <Col N="1112" /> overseas wishing to work at home. This committee also advises on the distribution of grants to voluntary emigrant bureaux here which provide advisory services for intending emigrants. I should like to compliment the committee for the excellent manner in which they have discharged their duties.  Most of their recommendations have been or will be implemented. I should also like to pay tribute to the voluntary organisations, the advisory committee and my Department in improving the advisory services for emigrants generally.</P>
    <P>The task of the voluntary emigrant bureaux in providing information and advice about jobs and accommodation in Britain has changed very much in the past few years with the fall in emigration.  Many bureaux have experienced a significant decline in the number of inquiries received.  On our joining the EEC in January the National Manpower Service became responsible for administering any services available to workers leaving or entering the country.  The advisory committee have been examining this development.  A question which now arises is whether the State should continue to provide help for the voluntary agencies.  I believe that the State must continue to shoulder this responsibility but it is now I believe opportune to re-appraise the direction of State aid.</P>
    <P>I have been reviewing the entire question of services for emigrants and State support for the voluntary organisations. My present disposition is to await some experience of EEC conditions before taking final decisions in consultation with voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Employment Agency Act, 1971 came into operation in November, 1972.  The Act provides for the licensing of private employment agencies, approval of their fees and furnishing by such agencies of returns of their activities.  Special regulations have been made regarding advertisements for employment abroad, which are aimed at the elimination of misleading advertisements.  These regulations have been discussed with representatives of the newspapers and they have <Col N="1113" /> welcomed them.  This legislation should enable action to be taken on abuses by employment agencies, particularly in regard to employment abroad.  I am satisfied that the great majority of agencies are reputable but there is need for power to intervene where abuses occur.</P>
    <P>The redundancy payments scheme continues to operate to alleviate the hardships caused to redundant workers and their dependants and to facilitate the national manpower policy.  The lump sums payable provide compensation for workers dismissed because of redundancy, while the weekly payments help to maintain incomes close to pre-redundancy earnings in the period following disemployment.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced in January, 1968, and covered workers becoming redundant after four years service.  It was amended under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1971, to include workers who become redundant after two years' service.  The Act also provided for substantial improvements in benefits without any corresponding increase in contributions.</P>
    <P>The number of notified redundancies under the scheme for 1971 was 8,556, 6,632 men and 1,924 women, and for 1972 was 10,159, 6,941 men and 3,218 women.</P>
    <P>During the first quarter of 1973, the figure was 2,082, 1,549 men and 533 women, compared with a figure of 2,643, 1,964 men and 679 women, for the first quarter of 1972.  In the latter half of last year, the credit balance in the redundancy fund fell because of the higher level of redundancy and also because of the improvement in benefits and it stood at approximately £222,000 on the 31st December, 1972. The increase in the rates of contributions towards the end of last year strengthened the fund somewhat but drawings on the fund have created the need for temporary Exchequer advances to enable the payments due from the fund to be made pending a recovery of the financial viability of the fund.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Appeals Tribunal <Col N="1114" /> heard 893 appeals in 1972 as compared with 725 in 1971.</P>
    <P>The industrial inspectorate has the task of ensuring that employers meet their obligations under the various worker-protection Acts administered by the Department, particularly the Factories Act, 1955 and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.  An additional activity of the inspectorate is to provide a safety-advisory and accident-prevention service to industry.</P>
    <P>The importance of the advisory functions of the inspectorate can hardly be overstressed.  Only if safety considerations are kept constantly in mind can the toll of accidents be reduced. Any employer with a problem in the field of worker-safety is welcome to seek the advice of the inspectorate at any time.  I appeal to managements to do so.  The report of the industrial inspectorate for 1972, to be published shortly, will show that last year there were 2,908 accidents, of which 24 were fatal, in work places to which the Acts apply.  Of the 24 fatal accidents, 11 were in factories and ten on building sites and works of engineering construction, two in mines and one in a quarry.  The records show that a frequent cause of fatal accidents is persons falling or being struck by falling objects.</P>
    <P>Industrial growth and the increasing complexity of industrial processes continue to place a strain on the resources of the inspectorate.  Its strength has recently been increased and arrangements have been made to augment it still further.</P>
    <P>A programme of surveys of environmental health hazards in Irish industry covering such factors as noise, dust, fumes and radiation, has been prepared and the field work commenced in 1971.  The pilot survey of hazards arising from ionising radiations and toxic chemicals has been completed. The field work on noise levels has also been completed and the data collected is now being processed for the assessment of any health hazards to the workers.  Survey work of this nature will be an on-going aspect of the work of the industrial inspectorate in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> I have been examining the report of the Robens Committee in Britain as well as the results of the investigatory work already referred to.  I am giving consideration to complete overhaul and updating of all legislation governing conditions of work, safety and health regulations in the place of work.</P>
    <P>The fundamental legislation governing factory legislation is based largely on the British Act of 1937.  I think there is need for modern legislation, which would be a charter for the safety, health and welfare of our working people, more attuned to the social objectives of a reforming administration.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Safety Organisation&mdash;NISO&mdash;is a voluntary body which is housed and staffed by my Department.  It also receives a grant-in-aid, which this year amounts to £15,000 from the Vote.  The grant is paid on the basis of £4 for every £1 raised by the organisation.  I would appeal to industrial firms to join NISO and take part in the continuous campaign for the promotion of safety consciousness and safety education in industry.</P>
    <P>The Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, which was passed some months ago brings up to date existing legislation protecting both workers and the general public against dangers inherent in the use of explosives and petroleum and also makes provision for dealing with other dangerous substances. It is largely an enabling measure which must be supplemented by codes of regulations.  Work on the regulations is now proceeding and the Act will be brought into operation when the necessary regulations have been formulated.  The Act is also of relevance in the context of our entry to the EEC in that I will, in due course, avail myself of powers in it to implement EEC directives regarding the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue the policy of playing an active role in the International Labour Organisation and participating as far as practicable in its programmes.</P>
    <P>Last year for the first time since <Col N="1116" /> becoming a member of the organisation in 1923, Ireland has obtained a seat on the governing body which is the committee of management of the ILO.  This gives us a better opportunity of contributing to the work of the organisation and of utilising its facilities to develop the services of the Department.</P>
    <P>The OECD examination of manpower policy in this country is proceeding. The examining team consisting of high-ranking personnel from other OECD countries has made two visits to Ireland and has had discussions with bodies engaged in manpower and related activities and with employer and worker organisations.</P>
    <P>The next stage will be a report by the examining team, which will be followed by a discussion later in the year in the manpower and social affairs committee of the OECD.  The OECD will publish a report and the conclusions of the Manpower and Social Affairs Committee.  The exercise should be of benefit in assessing our performance in the manpower field and in the working out of policies for the future.</P>
    <P>If one is to use the statistics of man-days lost as a yardstick of progress in industrial relations the years 1971 and 1972 showed a marked improvement over previous years.  In 1970 there was a loss of 1,000,714 days; this compares with 273,770 days in 1971 and approximately 200,000 in 1972.  This improving situation gives grounds for satisfaction but not for complacency.  Further substantial improvements can be achieved with a little more give and little less take on the part of what are nowadays cosily termed &ldquo;the social partners&rdquo;.  The general acceptance by workers of the National Wage Agreements of 1970 and 1972 was undoubtedly responsible in large measure for the considerable improvement in the &ldquo;days lost&rdquo; situation.</P>
    <P>In 1971, the Labour Court and its Conciliation Service dealt with 664 disputes as compared with 569 in 1970 and the Report for 1972 is expected to show a further increase.  In 1971 Conciliation Conferences were held in 628 cases and these conferences produced <Col N="1117" /> settlements in 68 per cent of the cases. The Court itself issued 162 recommendations on disputes, of which employers accepted 158 or 98 per cent, while the workers accepted 127 or 78 per cent.</P>
    <P>During the year I was glad to note a tendency for employers and trade unions to negotiate collective agreements which included provisions for solving disputes without resort to industrial action.  As the Labour Court is the most experienced and authoritative body in the country in industrial relations it would, I think, be appropriate if our procedures for solving disputes were to progress to a point where resort to the Court for a verdict would not be seen as part of the on-going business of negotiation.  In other words, for the Court to be successful there must be a genuine commitment by all concerned to negotiate seriously from the outset without holding back. I realise, of course, that this is a counsel of perfection; yet in these trying times one can no longer afford to ignore the claims of perfection.</P>
    <P>On 1st January, 1973, a third division was established in the Labour Court.  This involved the appointment of an additional employers' member, an additional workers' member and also an additional Deputy Chairman to the Court.  The National Agreements have added considerably to the volume of work coming before the Court; secondly, the processing of claims for equal pay is expected to generate extra work for the Court; finally, section 9 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, provides for the inclusion of Labour court members on arbitration boards in the Public Service.</P>
    <P>I believe we have good reason to be pleased with the success of the Rights Commissioner Service.  The service was inaugurated in March, 1970, and since then it has gone from strength to strength.  Generally, the commissioners are asked to investigate and recommend on disputes involving one or two workers in regard to what are commonly referred to as &ldquo;rights&rdquo;. In 1972, the commissioners dealt with 382 cases.  This represents an increase of over 100 per cent on the number in 1971.  A very gratifying aspect is <Col N="1118" /> the number of cases in which the parties concerned have agreed in advance to be bound by the commissioner's recommendation.  I welcome all developments which bring finality to industrial disputes without recourse to industrial action.</P>
    <P>Rights Commissioners' recommendations may be appealed to the Labour Court and, in such event, the finding of the court is binding on the parties to the dispute.  Since this service was established, 617 cases were referred to the commissioners for investigation and in only 20 of these were the commissioners' recommendations appealed to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems facing this and other Departments concerned with contemporary social problem is the lack of adequate research into major problems.  In recent years, this difficulty has begun to be tackled but not nearly to the extent which would be desirable.  It is encouraging to note, however, the decision to establish a Chair of Industrial Relations at University College, Dublin.  This Chair is in fact being endowed by Esso and it is to be hoped not just that this new department will expand and make some very worthwhile contributions to our understanding of the problems involved in industrial relations but that other firms will follow the example of Esso and begin what could well develop into a very useful tradition of worthwhile endowments for research into areas of national importance. I hope that practitioners in industrial relations, from both union and employer bodies, will assist this venture by providing personnel as required.</P>
    <P>I remain convinced that legislation in itself will not ensure good industrial relations.  Where I feel, however, that a particular measure would improve the dispute-settling or other machinery provided by the State, or would improve the structure of employers' and workers' organisations, I shall bring appropriate proposals before the House for consideration.</P>
    <P>The present Department of Labour was established in 1966 through an amalgamation of various elements of the Departments of Industry and Commerce <Col N="1119" /> and Social Welfare in an attempt to bring about a more co-ordinated approach by the Government to the problems of people in their working lives.  As can be seen from the earlier part of my speech, the Department has consolidated its position as a new Ministry but has in a number of areas also branched out into new and vigorous activity.  The most notable areas are AnCO, the National Manpower Service and the establishment of the very important innovation in the industrial relations field of the Rights Commissioners.</P>
    <P>These are indicators that there is a very real and active role which can be played by the Department in our industrial life.</P>
    <P>Whilst it will continue to be my endeavour to pursue the constructive work of the Ministry, I would hope now to commence a new period of positive action, in line with the reform commitment and social objectives of this Administration, on behalf of working Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Department is essentially in a reactive position.  It deals with the residual aspects of Irish industry whether these be in the shape of unemployment, poor industrial relations or bad safety records.  External circumstances prevented it becoming in the past a shaper and anticipator of events, or a generator of positive change.</P>
    <P>My efforts will be directed to redressing that situation.  I want to make it clear, therefore, to the House and to all sides in Irish industry that I do not regard it as being the role of my Department to wait for others to bring about necessary reforms and changes.  Neither do I see it as our role to defend sectional interests where these are not in the overall interests of working people.  That is not to say that I believe that massive legislative programmes can change the face of Irish industry; as a former practitioner in the field of industrial relations, I know only too well that the process is a much more subtle one than that.  What I do intend, however, is that the Department should move increasingly into the area of policy formation and create <Col N="1120" /> an awareness in the public mind about those major problems which confront us, such as the employment of disabled people, the situation of the lower paid worker, the opportunities for young people in industry, the nature of the new jobs which are being created.  Where this can make a positive contribution, such as in the areas of safety at work, trade union rationalisation, aspects of worker participation in management, <i>et cetera,</i> these will be supported by necessary legislation, developed insofar as possible in consultation with the interested parties.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the question of job creation.  Clearly a priority here is the quantity of new jobs and, given the nature of our unemployment problems, it could not be otherwise.  However, we must begin to look increasingly at the nature of the jobs which we are creating and the steps which can be taken to improve the jobs already in existence.  While in the past we have shown a great concern about the safety aspects of individual jobs, the ways in which they are carried out and the environment in which they must be carried on, we have given little concern at Government level to the actual nature of the job itself which may have as big an effect on the mental health of the person as a bad environment does on his physical health.  Very valuable work has been done by individual industries in this country and the Irish Productivity Centre is to be commended on research work which it has sponsored in this area.</P>
    <P>In addition, this question of the nature and design of jobs has a grave bearing on the problem of the lower paid worker.  Regard must be given to the nature of those jobs which are lower paid and effective means to facilitate the transition of workers from them to work of a higher and more rewarding status.</P>
    <P>All this demands a more co-ordinated approach to the questions of employment creation, training, geographical relocation of workers, the incentives necessary to bring this about and information about job availability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> I have said that the Department should not become the defender or supporter of traditional social structures in industry.  In my view it should facilitate change in this area and perhaps the most urgent priority here is in the area of worker participation and industrial democracy.  In a number of recent speeches, I have made it clear that I do not regard the election of workers to the boards of companies, be they State or privately owned, to be the be-all and end-all of this question. Such a concept of industrial democracy would be no more tenable than to suggest that political democracy should consist of electing a national parliament without any intermediate institutions.  Initially my major concerns are to ensure that we start taking some positive action in this area and that we should not accept as dogma what has been done in other circumstances.</P>
    <P>We, in Ireland, because of our relatively underdeveloped industrial sector, have an opportunity denied to most other European countries of experimenting and developing methods and structures relevant to our needs. In this area, the initiative of the Employer/Labour Conference in setting up a sub-committee on the question of industrial democracy is a progressive step which my Department welcomes and encourages.  However, since I believe that this drive towards more humane and democratic relationships in industry is one which lies at the heart of many industrial relations problems, I will ensure that the Department, within the powers and facilities available to it, plays a major role in advancing thinking and research in this area of critical socioeconomic importance.</P>
    <P>My experience suggests to me, to a much greater extent than might be readily apparent, that we suffer from grave problems of discrimination in industry and in particular in the labour market.  The recent report on the Status of Women should have brought home to us the degree of sex discrimination which exists.  This has now been highlighted and will, I pledge, be dealt with.  There is also totally unjustifiable discrimination against people on <Col N="1122" /> grounds of age, of mental or physical incapacity, because of prison records, because of an insufficient level of educational attainment and because of lack of information on job opportunities. In most of these areas, I am convinced that while legislation has a role to play, and I will be saying more about this later, it must be backed up by a strong placement service and for that reason I will be devoting particular attention to the development of the National Manpower Service.  Many of the vacancies which the National Manpower Service has been unable to fill are in the industrial sector, despite the fact that about 70,000 people are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Apart from structural difficulties&mdash; the unemployed workers not having the right skills for the jobs on offer&mdash; there seems to be a prejudice among some people against industrial employment. This may be due in part to the absence of an industrial tradition in certain areas; it may also be based on wrong impressions or wrong information. Parents and teachers sometimes appear to encourage young people to seek employment which, for some reason, they regard as having a certain status even though the wages and conditions offered may compare unfavourably with jobs in industry.  What is required here is a change of attitude mainly among people who are concerned with career guidance.  The National Manpower Service, in co-operation with the Department of Education, hope to produce a booklet entitled <i>Working in Industry</i> which should help to disabuse some sections of the public of wrong impressions which they may have about industrial employment.</P>
    <P>Apart from Britain, we are the only member of the EEC who tolerate a situation where the vast majority of jobs and job vacancies are handled through private agencies.  I am reasonably satisfied with the way in which these agencies operate since this is adequately treated in the Employment Agency Act, 1971, which came into operation last November. But I am gravely concerned about the fact that, while the vast majority of jobs are filled in this way, information about vacancies may not be disseminated <Col N="1123" /> as widely as one would wish in a democratic and progressive society, and, secondly, that standards of selection may be used which are discriminatory.  I would emphasise the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; here as I am absolutely convinced of the valuable job being done by private agencies at present and because no research has been done in this field in this country I regard it as a matter of urgent priority, therefore, to build up the capacity and competence of the National Manpower Service so that it can increase its penetration and influence in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Policy making in the manpower and industrial fields in Ireland is bedevilled by a lack of information.  When one considers the sophisticated requirements of manpower and regional planning, it is extraordinary&mdash;and indeed to be deplored&mdash;that previous Governments have not put much greater resources into the development of our information and research services in this area.  Most of the information on the labour market which the National Manpower Service use is derived as a bi-product from other activities; for example, unemployment benefit, Census of Population <i>et cetera.</i> The service has no ready or measurably accurate means of monitoring trends on a regular basis or for interpreting the limited information available for the purpose of initiating action in a particular area.  At present, there is no complete occupational breakdown of the Live Register although moves are afoot to remedy this situation.  While there are still not enough jobs for all those people seeking work, there is scope for reducing the number who are unemployed if a more accurate picture of the composition of the Live Register could be got.  For instance, how many unemployed workers would be interested in retraining or some form of rehabilitation or reactivation?  It would be useful to know how many are partly disabled or handicapped, and what proportion of older workers are suitable for, or capable of, retraining.  In other words, a stricter qualitative and quantitative analysis of the Live <Col N="1124" /> Register would give a more accurate picture of the true unemployment situation and a clearer indication of what services and types of industry are needed to achieve full employment.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive and up-to-date information on general trends in employment, for example, demands for new skills, obsolescent industries, <i>et cetera,</i> would be useful to enable remedial measures to be put in hands in good time if further structural imbalances between labour supply and demand are to be prevented.  In other words, proper labour market information is necessary to ensure that as far as possible timely corrective and preventative measures can be adopted. This, let me stress, is no reflection on the Central Statistics Office and the various Departmental information services who have soldiered on with inadequate staff and facilities over the years but quite clearly, if we are going to get at the root of many of our problems, particularly in the employment field, we must devote increasing attention to this.  It is not that we need information to convince us of the gravity of many of the problems facing us, but in many cases we do not even have the information on which to arrive at the correct solutions.</P>
    <P>When our man power policy was being formulated in 1965, it was hoped that manpower forecasting would be an important element of the policy, that is, forecasting the changes which were likely to occur in the supply of a demand for labour so that remedial measures could be put in hands in good time to remedy imbalances.</P>
    <P>However, when the possibilities of forecasting were subsequently studied, it became clear that there were serious shortcomings in the statistical information available and necessary as a base for forecasting and, furthermore, that techniques have not yet been developed anywhere which are capable of producing reliable forecasts and manpower projections suitable for policy formulation.</P>
    <P>Some of the inadequacies of our manpower statistics include a lack of knowledge of movements into, within <Col N="1125" /> and out of the labour market, information on mobility and substitution, information on the extent of underemployment, the occupational structure of emigration, <i>et cetera.</i> As the National Manpower Service expands, our information on local labour markets will improve.  In addition, the OECD examiners have made certain recommendations aimed at improving our manpower statistics and these will be considered when the final report becomes available on or about the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In outlining my view of the role of the Department, I have been emphasising two main concerns.  The first of these is that as the Department charged with the responsibility of maintaining the primacy of the Social Dimension in Economic and Social Planning, we should not be concerned solely with ameliorative measures.  Their positive role as generators of solutions and as contributors to policy formation in the areas adjacent to it, such as employment creation, must be an active one. Secondly, the Department have a role in the advancement of social change in industry so that we may bring about a transformation to a more democratic and humane industrial society.</P>
    <P>What Nye Bevan once said of the British House of Commons I feel applies to my Department and its work, &ldquo;Parliament must not become a public mourner for private economic crimes&rdquo;.  I should now like to go on to the key areas of action which will be concerning me in pursuit of this policy in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>I believe it is essential that the House in its debate on my Department should concern itself not just with an analysis of what has happened over the past year but should especially address itself to key factors in the year ahead.  In the issues with which I am now going to deal, it will be clear that some of them arise (such as future National Wage Agreements) irrespective of any initiative by the Government, whereas others result from the obvious political commitment of our administration to advance the concept of social policy as a <Col N="1126" /> major criterion of all activity within the State.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anybody inside or outside this House would deny that one of the most critical events facing us in the coming year is the ability of the Employer/Labour Conference to arrive at a third National Agreement. No one would suggest that this will be other than a daunting task.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the Fourteen Point Programme of the National Coalition, are strongly committed to voluntary wage and salary bargaining. This is based on the belief that voluntary agreements contribute to a reduction in the rate of inflation and a reduction in industrial strife and that they have been clearly demonstrated to benefit the lower-paid and women workers more than would have been the case in a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo;.  In addition, and despite what critics have had to say, they have, in a period of high inflation, resulted in real increases in the standard of living of workers.</P>
    <P>Except in its role as an employer, the State has not intervened in the proper work of the Employer/Labour Conference nor does it intend to do so. Where its role does lie is in the provision of services which will facilitate the work of the Conference and, through the Labour Court, in ensuring the equitable application of any agreement. In addition, it will through its action on price control and wealth redistribution be making a major contribution to the creation of a climate in which trade unions can feel confident in signing long-term agreements.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the experience gained by the Employer/Labour Conference negotiators in their previous agreements.  That they are garnering and learning from that experience is evident in the work of the sub-committee which has been considering the harmonisation of terminal dates for agreements for different workers and various proposals which have been made regarding the nature of the escalator clauses seem to me to strike at the very heart of the problem facing both sides.</P>
    <P>Efforts should be made in the next round to make positive advances in <Col N="1127" /> other important sectors related to working conditions and particularly in the area of pensions, job security and consultative machinery within industry. I am confident that they will continue to emphasise the position of the lower paid worker and, in the light of legislation which will be introduced shortly, the position of women in industry.</P>
    <P>The 14 point programme of the National Coalition contains an overall and firm commitment to advance worker participation in industry and a specific commitment to provide for the election of workers to the boards of State industries.  Legislation to effect the latter will be introduced as soon as possible having regard to the complexities of the question.</P>
    <P>In addition to the straight-forward provision for the election of worker directors the legislation will also provide for their training and for the necessary facilities and time for them to carry out their role effectively.</P>
    <P>This is an enormously complex area touching as it does on the structure and geographic spread of each company, the degree of trade union organisation of the workers in each company, the nature of our company law, the legislation on which each State company is based and so on.</P>
    <P>Much detailed consultation will, therefore, have to take place with the trade unions, the managements of the companies concerned, the responsible boards and Departments of State.  It is my intention, therefore, to set up a section within my Department concerned solely with the question of worker participation since it is an area to which increasing concern will be given and which will develop into one of great importance in our industrial life.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Commission on the Status of Women has given added impetus to the commitment in the National Coalition Programme for the advancement of women's rights.  In so far as my own Department is concerned, some weeks ago I committed myself to the introduction of legislation on the question of equal pay.  For a number of practical and economic reasons it will be necessary to bring <Col N="1128" /> about the transition to equal pay in a lot of areas on a phased basis but it is my intention that this should be done in as short a period as possible.</P>
    <P>However, the status of women in our society and in particular in the industrial sector of our society is a much more complicated one than that simply of equal pay.  Nortoriously women are confined to the most menial tasks in our enterprises and it is going to require a considerable change of attitude by society, particularly on the part of parents and male workers, to bring about a change in this situation.  I believe it is one in which legislation has a large part to play as I do not subscribe to the view that women should be expected to wait for major shifts in attitudes within our society before they receive just treatment.  It is my intention, therefore, to introduce legislation on discrimination on grounds of sex in the selection of workers for industry and of their advancement. This will also cover the field of married women in employment.</P>
    <P>The appointment last year of a Commissioner for Equal Pay was an important indication of my Department's forward thinking on this issue for the changed circumstances of the new Government's commitments and the Report of the Commission. It is my intention to considerably strengthen the role of the equal pay function within my Department and to recruit a number of specialist staff and advisers on the issue.  In particular I can see that the evaluation of jobs will become a critical area particularly if there are attempts made to circumvent equal pay legislation by changing the nature of women's jobs.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise, however, that this is not a function which can be carried out solely by the State.  The trade unions and employer organisations have a special responsibility to ensure that the spirit of the aspiration of our people for equalisation of rewards and opportunities as between men and women in society is realised. Women themselves can help to advance their position in industry by increasing their degree of trade union organisation and by playing a more active role in trade union affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> To this end it is my intention to discuss with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions the allocation of additional funds to the training of women trade union officials and representatives so that they may be able to play a more active part in their organisations and in industry generally.</P>
    <P>The question of the training of women workers currently in the labour force and those who are about to enter it is an important area in the recommendations made by the commission. I am asking AnCO for an immediate study to be carried out into the area of apprenticeships for women and the training facilities available for them.  This is an area to which it may be necessary to make special financial provisions and if this is the case the Dáil may expect that I will be seeking further funds from it later in the year under this heading.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare on the special needs for disabled and handicapped workers who constitute a disproportionate share of our unemployed people.  It is my intention that co-operation between the National Manpower Service and the National Rehabilitation Board will be further developed so that the widest range of opportunities available can be opened up to them.  However, I am convinced that, despite the considerable contribution which is being made by some firms to the employment of workers in this category, many are avoiding their obligations.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, giving urgent consideration to the need for legislation&mdash; a handicapped persons' Bill&mdash;which would establish a quota system for the employment of disabled and handicapped workers.  Such a proposal was first mooted by the late Deputy Seán Dunne, whose Private Member's Bill on this subject was rejected by the present Opposition party in 1967. Legislation on this question would not only, therefore, help to meet a pressing social need but would be a fitting tribute to the work of the late Seán Dunne.  I would like also to pay tribute to the work of Deputy Dr. John O'Connell in this area.</P>
    <P>The draft EEC Social Action Policy <Col N="1130" /> prepared by the Commission will be discussed at a Council of Ministers Meeting on Monday, 21st May.  The full consultative process involving the employers and trade unions, the Economic and Social Committee and the European Parliament will not be completed until later in the year, and no doubt considerable changes will be made in the document during that period particularly in the formulation of concrete action issues.</P>
    <P>For the moment the most important aspect of the document is its commitment to the position of social policy in the development of the Community, and as a necessary counter weight to economic and monetary policies, the much recalled &ldquo;human face&rdquo; aspect of Community Policy.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal here with the specific response which we will make to the various proposals in the present document.  A major area of concern will, however, be from our point of view to ensure that rigid models for behaviour in particular areas are not laid down, particularly where these would ignore the special economic and social conditions of Ireland.  We would hope, therefore, that while agreeing on general objectives and guidelines the role of the commission would be to facilitate developments in those general directions.  Of particular concern here is the field of worker participation which in the context of social policy is obviously a key area.  I have said on a number of occasions recently, both at home and in Brussels, that we in Ireland require the right to develop our own worker participation systems appropriate to our own needs and that furthermore we would expect to be facilitated and aided in this process by the Community rather than hindered by it.</P>
    <P>At a general level, therefore, I believe that the most useful contribution of the social policy is to bring about a degree of harmonisation and in particular to create structures and institutions within which views and experiences can be exchanged.  For this reason we strongly welcome the proposal to set up a vocational training centre.  This would clearly be of great benefit particularly in the restitut <Col N="1131" /> training field where we can expect a continuing and perhaps increased demand in the years immediately ahead. The co-ordination of work force information systems proposed in the draft programme may not on the surface appear to be a particularly important area but in practice, as I have stated earlier in my speech, it is of considerable significance in the co-ordination of policies across national boundaries and in dealing with Community institutions which can dispense resources, such as the Social Fund, crucial to our development.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour have been designated as the central agency in this country for the submission of claims to the EEC Social Fund.  It must be emphasised, however, that the Department does not have the sole right of initiative nor does it have the function of allocating priorities to particular claims.  This is done by the Social Fund Committee itself and at its meeting last week the representatives of my Department laid particular stress on the need to give high priority to programmes related to unemployment.</P>
    <P>Apart from acting as a co-ordination point for claims, I am concerned that my Department should be active in ensuring that every industry and economic grouping in the country is aware of the ways in which the Social Fund can assist in the funding of development programmes.  In addition I am building up a group of export advisers who can help in the formulation of claims and in the presentation of them.</P>
    <P>We can obtain considerable benefits from a correct use of the fund and it can be of enormous advantage in enlarging the field of social policy and action in this country.</P>
    <P>In an earlier part of this speech I have recorded the achievements which have been made in the advancement of the workers' protection on shop floor through legislation such as the Factories Act, the Dangerous Substances Act, the Mines and Quarries Act, the activities of the factories Inspectorate, the National Industrial Safety Organisation and so on.  During <Col N="1132" /> the next year I intend widening the concept of working conditions and environment to take account of other factors which are becoming evident in this area.  Considerable publicity has been given in this country to the proposal in the draft Social Action Programme of the EEC in relation to the examination of industrial practices such as conveyor belt production systems.  This is only one aspect of industrial life which is of growing concern to many people in this country and I would like to see a further examination of the effect which many modern production and management techniques have on workers.</P>
    <P>As a starting point following discussions with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and in conjunction with other relevant groups, I propose commencing an initial survey of mental health and stress in industry and to begin to widen the concept of good working conditions in this area.  The questions of absenteeism and alcoholism, for instance, have been the subject of some discussion and investigation in this country in recent years but there appears to have been a failure to regard these as symptoms and a failure to establish the fundamental causes.  While work in this area will commence in the coming year the House will, I am sure, appreciate that it will be some time before we can get to the stage of preparing a code of practice, let alone legislation, in the area.</P>
    <P>Also on this front it has been suggested to me that the provisions in the Factories Act regarding safety committees and their powers requires strengthening and elaboration.  I have asked for a report on this matter. Should it be necessary to do so I would introduce legislation later in the year on this question.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some concern to me that grave difficulties are experienced by many employers and trade unions in ascertaining the precise requirements of the Factories and Office Premises Acts in relation to facilities and working conditions.  I am, therefore, setting about the task of reviewing and codifying ministerial orders in this and other areas of legislation under my jurisdiction with a <Col N="1133" /> view to improving public access to this information.</P>
    <P>The fourteen point programme of the new Government will have a major impact on the work of the Department.  That programme includes measures to combat inflation, an effort to halt redundancies, reduce unemployment together with an overall commitment to voluntary wage agreements.  The introduction of worker participation, and the election of workers on to State boards, is a challenge which as Minister I am happy to meet.  A commitment has also been given to end all forms of existing discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>The removal of discrimination against women will involve examination and formulation of complex legislation covering such matters as equal pay, access to employment, opportunities for advancement and continued employment after marriage, maternity leave, return to employment after absence due to family responsibilities, <i>et cetera.</i> Reducing redundancies and unemployment will involve increased work under the industrial training legislation and the National Manpower Service.  Membership of the EEC will, of course, exert further pressure on work in this area.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned overall with helping to shape community social policy for the benefit of those who work, the major item of work for my Department in relation to the EEC is concerned with the European Social Fund.  So far, we have lodged seven claims for a sum amounting to £3½ million and further applications for aid are in preparation. Three of these applications are for a total sum amounting to £1 million which will be sent to Brussels early in May.  Formulation of these applications has involved a high degree of preparatory work.  Such work can be expected to increase as our applications go through examination by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is clear that there will be increasing pressures by public opinion, particularly trade unions, and justifiably, to obtain maximum benefit from the fund.  This will involve the Minister in work of a pioneering <Col N="1134" /> character both in Ireland and in Brussels, to develop and expand the type of activities in Ireland which would qualify for fund support and to convince Brussels that support for these activities from the fund is justified. Regulations governing the Social Fund require that checks will be carried out by the national authority on how the monies granted are disposed of and they provide for on-the-spot checks by officials by the co-operation of the national authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department will be involved in this work as responsibility for it devolves on the Department of Labour. As I have remarked, the focus of attention of my Ministry is the action by the EEC to develop a social policy. A draft social policy document prepared by the Commission for Social Affairs shows clearly that my Department will be deeply involved in the elaboration of the policy through 1973 and its implementation from 1974 onwards.  An examination of the draft document on EEC regional policy means that we will be involved also here because the use of the Social Fund must have a close connection with formulation of regional policy.</P>
    <P>I began this Estimate in the context of our membership of the European Community.  I should like to conclude responsive, I hope, to the new times and new tasks which our membership of the European fraternity of states imposes.  As a people we have in history displayed perhaps too touching a faith in help from abroad as an answer to all our problems.  The <i>Aisling</i> inspiration gave us fine poetry, but it was bad politics even in the 17th century.  The <i>Aisling</i> mentality in the context of the European Community, the belief that benefits from the European Social Fund or regional policy grants are the panacea for all our economic ills, must not distract us from the recognition that only the Irish people working at home possess the seals that will earn us a society in which all our citizens can be socially and economically secure, free, at peace and self-reliant and, sharing in responsibility on equal terms.  In that work I hope my Department will play a full part.</P>
    <Col N="1135" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to say much on an Estimate for a Department in which one was involved for the greater part of the period covered by the Estimate.  Nevertheless, I am interested in the Minister's appraisal of things as he found them and I look forward with interest to the development of that great Department to which the Minister has the honour to be assigned.  I wish him every success in it, whether his term there be long or short.</P>
      <P>The Department of Labour is one that has evolved.  Many people have the misconception it was established in order to have a Department to deal with industrial relations.  That is not quite true.  Older Members of the House would be more competent to speak of the evolution of industry in this country; indeed, many of those who were involved in the development of industry have since died.  I am thinking particularly of the late Seán Lemass, who was a pioneer of industrial revolution.</P>
      <P>We can complain easily now about many of the things we did not foresee but we should remember that until recently industrial development was an uphill battle.  Members who have been in the House for 22 years, as I have been, will remember the discussions that took place particularly when the annual Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce was debated. We listened to the most eloquent speeches from people like Deputy James Dillon, who spoke about workshops in the back lanes of Dublin, about tariff walls to make the people buy inferior products they could buy more cheaply from other countries and about the futility of developing wheat, peat and beet.  I am not saying this in order to denigrate anyone but to show the difficult uphill battle in the establishment of the industrial arm of which we can boast today and which has contributed so much to our exports in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the days when it was proved, not without necessary and sometimes expensive protection, that, given the chance, industry could evolve into a strong arm.  It was the profound changes in the political and economic structure that necessitated <Col N="1136" /> the setting up of the Department of Labour.  As the Minister has pointed out in his long citation on the achievements and hopes of the Department, membership of the Department was garnered from the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Social Welfare and other Departments, to make up what is now one of the most important if not the most important Department in this State.  In spite of what some reasoned press correspondents have been writing, this has been the most active Department, as well as the most progressive. I read some of what political correspondents have been writing recently.  Of course they have been supporting the Government in their early days in office, but they have been suggesting that the present Minister would lift the Department out of the doldrums into which the Department had fallen in recent years.</P>
    <P>In reply I would refer all to the volume of major legislation which I put through the Oireachtas and had passed in the last few years for a Department which I found most active, most efficient and painstaking, very much alive to the requirements of such a progressive and important institution of State.  I, as the former political head of that Department, can take all the knocks, but I should like at the outset to pay the tribute to the officials of that Department that they deserve.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to this Department which has been evolving into the leading Department in this country.</P>
    <P>This Department has sprung from difficult beginnings.  It was said that the leading function of the Department would be that of industrial relations. The functions of the Department in their order of precedence are a manpower policy, worker protection and industrial relations.  It was for that purpose that the Department was originally founded, and to foresee the direction in which the Department should immediately move in respect of these three functions was not easy.</P>
    <P>I think I should digress here to remark that when we talk so much about forecasting, estimating or predicting, I have sometimes not condemned <Col N="1137" /> but have had little confidence in the possibility of the accuracy of forecasting.  It is always difficult to foresee the direction in which a Department should move.  One of the services for which this Department are responsible is manpower forecasting. We found that even that was not practicable. My experience in Government has been that forecasting is a most delicate area, the one most susceptible to error.</P>
    <P>We have booklets on social and economic expansion which are most useful in so far as they apply targets at which to aim.  However, they can be very much off the mark.  They are, nevertheless, desirable in that they provide a nucleus of effort and a direction in which to move.  That is the most that manpower forecasting can do.  Entirely unrelated to the Department of Labour, I remember a Minister for Agriculture coming in here to make a tremendous case for an increase in beef subsidy because all the experts, not merely of this country but nearly universally, had forecast that the price of beef would drop to below 80s per cwt.  The Government agreed that in such a serious situation we should ensure that the farmers' economy would be bolstered against such an eventuality.  From that day to this the price of meat has kept going up and we never again saw the figure of 80s per cwt.  Indeed, it had reached 112s in three months.  So much for forecasting or for estimating what the future holds.  Forecasts can go like the best laid plans of mice and men.</P>
    <P>A manpower policy is one of the foremost services the Department of Labour have to give to society and it entails training, placement guidance, manpower forecasting and related matters.  Of these, as has been said here frequently, training is the most important.  Indeed, the others are but related matters no matter how significant they are in relation to manpower as a whole.  We have always had training at different levels.  There has been training of pupils in primary schools, in post-primary establishments particularly in technical schools and now in colleges of technology and comprehensive schools.  Heretofore technological training, adult training <Col N="1138" /> and retraining and apprenticeship training were not catered for on a proper basis and it was to fill that vacuum that AnCO were set up.  It was established on a very firm footing, all our recruitment being with the design to get the best men for the job.  In his examination of the Department the Minister will find that this rule was strictly followed, whether in the case of recruitment in the manpower service itself, in the regional services or in the placement division. This is becoming more and more difficult because private enterprise is prepared to syphon off the best men in the executive field and they will not be prepared to enter the services of the Department if they are not paid the proper salaries.  As well, we have to face the situation that if we are to retain the best people in AnCO we must pay them proper salaries because otherwise they will be syphoned off to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>AnCO got off on a sound footing and the board, composed of representatives of FUE, ICTU and the Department, are doing an excellent job.  I have always tried to ensure&mdash;I hope the Minister will continue to do so&mdash; that there would be no overlapping in the work done by the vocational educational authorities.  That work must be complementary to the training activities of AnCO&mdash;that there will be sufficient co-operation to ensure that the necessary dovetailing takes place in relation to training and background education.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the lack of desire on the part of some to take on industrial employment.  I am not too sure that in the west of Ireland they would lag in the matter of taking on any kind of employment.  There is a need, which I am sure we will overcome, to ensure that the social status of academic education is not unduly pressed over technological training and technical education generally.  I think people are coming to realise now that the end product is sometimes much more remunerative than having persons qualified for professions for whom there is no outlet while many of the highly skilled occupations on the technological side are unmanned and in <Col N="1139" /> spite of the 60,000 odd unemployed, we have to bring in foreigners sometimes to do particularly skilled jobs.</P>
    <P>Training generally is moving and I would hope as I always hoped from the time we found it was possible to get assistance from the Social Fund in the EEC that that fund would at some stage match our increased effort by giving generously towards our training programme.  It was one of the applications which we had early prepared and to which we had given a dry run, so to speak, along with others, even before we became members.  When I mention the three particular services the Department set up, I should have added that in recent times the EEC has given a new dimension to the Department in so far as it is the channel through which all applications to the Social Fund must go.  That I propose to deal with towards the end but the training policy has, I think, always had the backing of this House.  There may have been complaints at times that we were not moving fast enough, and the Minister on the Opposition benches may have been one of those who made the complaints, but we were moving as fast as our resources would permit us to move and I think the record will show that in the Capital Programme, the Government were never unkind to us in permitting an increase to enable expansion to take place.</P>
    <P>It was not all a financial problem because there was the question of the recruitment of training staff.  It was a new service and one which, if it were to be worthy of the gigantic task it was set to perform, had to be established on a proper basis.  To inclucate confidence in industrialists themselves, we had to have a proper type of staff to deal with training.  I think that still applies and the rate at which that staff can be provided apart from the financial resources required does necessarily set a limit to the pace and rate of development.  Nevertheless 1,400 places which, on a six months turnover basis gave double that number of output in the year on courses is not bad. It is a very rapid expansion and further expansion is planned and I hope will take place as early as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> Of the manpower service, placement is a very important part and I was glad to note recently that the number of offices has now gone up from 11 to 13 with the recent opening of some new offices.  This is a tremendous service which can be of great value if it gets the confidence of the people, particularly of the employers.  There is no difficulty whatever in getting unemployed persons and job seekers to turn into the employment agencies looking for work but the agency cannot do much for them if the employers have not got confidence in the agencies and are prepared to place with them early notice of their vacancies and their requirements and to recruit through them. If our employers do that with our placement service, our National Manpower Service, they will be giving it a great fillip and strengthening it and creating the necessary prestige which will enable it to be the success it should be.</P>
    <P>One thing which will be immediately said to the Minister, as it was frequently said to me, is &ldquo;What is the good of your placement service when you have not got a job for everybody going into these offices?&rdquo; This is something which these offices must overcome.  The manpower service must generally be able to overcome this.  The same has been said of training&mdash;&ldquo;What are you training people for when you have not got the jobs into which to fit them?&rdquo; That is not the answer.  Training is always training and the trained man, no matter where he goes, has a skill which is never a burden to him.  He has always a skill which can command respect and with which he finds job satisfaction and the type of thing he wants to do, receiving the remuneration that goes with it.  The approach of people who say &ldquo;When you have not got the jobs, why have a placement service and a training service?&rdquo; is a pessimistic approach because there are many people in employment who would like to change, many people who require to be trained and retrained to take up other occupations, and the placement service, in spite of all this, has succeeded in placing a tremendous number of people in employment over the past few years, particularly in the last year <Col N="1141" /> since they were organised.  One of the things that has happened since I left the Department is that this report on apprenticeship has come about.  We have been waiting for some time for this and AnCO has been promising it. They have done a reasonably good job in producing this document for consultation which I hope many people will peruse and come up with their opinions, particularly, employers and trade unions.  I would have little quarrel with the suggestions they make. All of us would be delighted to reduce the period required for apprenticeship and everybody knows, whether trade union, employer or otherwise, that the old system of apprenticeship for five years, with the boy sweeping the floor for two years was a waste of time and that the adopting of this method of off-the-job training on a six months intensive course with AnCO and back to the job again means a much better finished article in the three years suggested here than he was under the old five year system.  I suggest that after a year the boy would be better qualified.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure but looking over the Minister's speech, for the advance copy of which I thank him, he mentions that employers would have to have changed thinking about the intake of apprenticeship.  I think the unions are the most recalcitrant people in this matter.  There is a certain jealousy amongst people in skilled employment by reason of which they do not want to see too many people becoming skilled in the same employment and the scarcity value of a particular skill is something of which they are particularly jealous.  Trade unions are the people to whom he will have to speak loudest and strongest to ensure that the number of apprenticeships made available each year is increased and that there will be no shortage of skilled labour, which could be one of the greatest incentives for industrial development after industrial peace if that could be established.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the placement service, I would hope that placement officers would take an active interest in things other than placement, and I think it <Col N="1142" /> is only correct to say that they do, but my intention was always to have the returns to the IDA and the other bodies who should get them regarding the type of skills needed in an area, the returns to AnCO regarding the type of training needed in an area, and manpower information generally fed back to the proper source.  This, in itself, could be a very useful function, apart from its placement function. I hope that the placement officers will not merely continue to concentrate in that direction, but that they will step up their activities in that direction.</P>
    <P>The guidance service consists of guidance information.  Quite a number of leaflets which were up-dated and, I suppose, continue to be up-dated, and which were availed of by many schools and institutions, provided a great service.  Occasionally I had complaints that certain professions, or occupations, or vocations, were not properly depicted or outlined in the leaflets.  Whenever there was a complaint about that we examined the leaflets in question and made changes if the complaints were genuine. This guidance service was just for information.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education are moving towards the appointment of a career guidance officer in every sizeable school and, when they reach that complement, they will have provided a very good service.  The guidance information service which is administered by the Department of Labour will fit in very suitably with the requirements of that career guidance service.  In the many exhibitions which we attended, the career guidance stall was one of the most frequented, and one of the most sought after by the pupils, many of whom had not made up their minds on what they wanted to do.  All the girls wanted to be air hostesses, and all the boys wanted to drive steam-rollers. With the assistance of their teachers they were able to get a very wide view of the many occupations there were and, as they became older and were entrusted to the assistance of the career guidance officer, these leaflets <Col N="1143" /> were of tremendous use to them.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from the apprenticeship aspect I should like to comment on the proposal to set up industrial training committees.  I wonder are we setting up too many committees. Some of the existing committees in the manpower services might be capable of doing that work for AnCO. That is only a small point but I think it would fit into the work they are already doing.</P>
    <P>CERT is the branch of training to which the catering industry is entrusted and it has been doing excellent work since it was set up.  It is the subject of some divided opinion at present as to whether it should cover the hotel industry alone or catering generally, including institutions, and so forth.  The Minister's speech gets over that nicely by saying it can do both and that it should ultimately be under AnCO, which is where I think it will land ultimately.</P>
    <P>At a time when it was difficult to get places to train pupils, CERT took over other institutions and set up very good training schools in places like Shannon Airport, one of the earliest, Maynooth College and Rockwell. These places adapted themselves for the training of people in the catering industry and did what I thought was an excellent job.  It is true that the colleges had the benefit of this training.  They had the practical service for their staffs which I think is an essential part of any training&mdash; like on the job training&mdash;and, if they had, good luck to them.  If a good job were being done I would not grudge them that service and that, certainly, is not a reason why it should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>So many places have now been provided in Galway that they may be sufficient to absorb them and, indeed, take on more than would be available if these other centres were allowed to continue.  I would hope that there would be a place for all of them, and I would hope that the basic requirement for an increase in this direction could be attended to, that is, that, when qualified, these people would command a minimum wage or salary. <Col N="1144" /> If they are being trained for something and they find at the end of the road that they are not as well paid as semi-skilled workers in a textile factory, or somewhere else, they can hardly be expected to take on the important work that is involved, with the high standard of training that is required, and the many other requirements and qualifications which are necessary in the catering industry, particularly in the tourist industry. I hope that CERT will continue to do more and even better work than it has been doing, and that it will take a keen after-training interest in the students and give them the opportunity to return time and again for refresher courses as they do in their early training.</P>
    <P>Turning to the protection of workers, the Minister laid stress on the need for legislation and the need to move more rapidly in this direction.  I would remind him with regard to accidents in industry and the conditions under which people work that, in the last analysis, this is up to the people themselves. All that NISO can do&mdash;and they are struggling to do a tremendous job &mdash;is to get the necessary voluntary co-operation so that people will take care of themselves.  All industrial accidents and fatal accidents arrive on the Minister's desk almost immediately after they happen and, if you examine them, you will find that mostly they relate to persons who are highly qualified and skilled at their work.</P>
    <P>They are persons who have come to taking risks because they have been doing the same thing habitually and, perhaps, getting away without conforming to the necessary requirements which, very often they think are all nonsense anyhow.  One day, dismantling a scaffolding, they take the same risks as they took a thousand times, the worst happens, and a life is lost, or somebody is maimed.  To eliminate this requires a good deal of voluntary and personal co-operation between management and worker and a realisation of the dangers involved.  I doubt that any legislation can do this.  Certain conditions are laid down in present legislation; indeed, enough to ensure that safety measures could <Col N="1145" /> eliminate practically every accident that takes place if they were followed. They require the attention of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>One thing that might be dealt with in any new legislation is the period of exemption in respect of short duration jobs.  If I remember rightly a job has to go on for over a month in order to require a person to conform to all the conditions in the Act.  A job that lasts for only a day could create an accident just as quickly as one of long duration. I think that is one of the things which legislation might provide for but any sensible management will ensure that everything possible is done to eliminate accidents in the workshop, the factory, the construction works, the transport service or any other type of employment. The Act lays down a certain minimum which must be provided. This is calculated to provide for the safety of the worker.</P>
    <P>In the course of the big programme of legislation which I had the pleasure of putting through in my time in the Department we had the Dangerous Substances Act, which made better provisions than before for the safety of workers dealing with dangerous substances, many of which had come into existence in modern times due to technological development which was not foreseen at the time when substances were specified in earlier legislation when there was little other than petroleum, spirits and kerosene.  In recent times many dangerous substances have come on the market so that it was necessary to have that piece of legislation brought in to provide for the safety of those handling dangerous substances, whether in carriage, storage or packaging. At the time we were accused of bringing this in in an attempt to control explosives, as a defensive measure but it had nothing whatever to do with that.  From our point of view it was an Act to provide for the better safety of workers involved and also for the property of the people involved with those dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>The NISO organisation have improved and expanded as a result of the efforts of those at the top in recent <Col N="1146" /> years but it has not got the general support it should get throughout the country.  One wonders if NISO would improve if there was a provision in legislation to make it compulsory to have these committees.  In the last analysis it is the voluntary effort of individuals which will save lives.  NISO try to highlight how accidents happen. They have slides and give demonstrations at their many exhibitions. The best supporters of the NISO are those who turn up and the detractors are those who are not there to see what they should do. This is one of the weaknesses in the safety legislation.</P>
    <P>The other big arm of the Department's functions is industrial relations. I shall only deal with a few aspects of this.  In this matter I often found it suited to keep one's mouth closed and sometimes one had to speak hoping one would be listened to when making general reference as to why people should behave in a particular way.  The Minister will find that when a serious strike occurs people point the finger and ask: &ldquo;What are you doing about that? Why have you not settled the bank strike? Why have you not settled the cement strike?  Why have you not settled the CIE strike?  Why have you not settled the fertiliser strike?&rdquo; They seem to think that the Minister should take off his coat, beat them all and tell them to go back to work.  The Minister sets up institutions which make provision for the proper negotiation and methodical handling of these disputes and if these institutions are not adequate then one has to think of others.  I frequently found myself at the stage when I had to try to think of others but at that stage all one is thinking of is something new to see if it will work better than something there before.</P>
    <P>We had our conciliation committees and we appointed rights commissioners under legislation brought in by my predecessor.  We had the Labour Court. All these things provided adequate means by which negotiations could be carried out before the serious stage of a stoppage of work was reached.  I am afraid the whole question of our society <Col N="1147" /> and our whole political set-up has changed so much that in trade unionism there are certain elements with so much economic power that they know perfectly well they can extract almost any concession from their employers, whether the State or some individual if they threaten a stoppage of work which in some cases can bring the whole economy to a standstill over night.  This is a sensitive area in which one has to move very gaurdedly and very carefully. It is not an area where stunting will have any positive effect.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that all the institutions provided would deter people from taking the serious action which has wrought so much havoc in the economy in the past.  When I say that I am not saying the blame was either here or there.  The fact remains that man days were lost and other industrial concerns were deterred from coming in here when they saw what the industrial scene was like.  The best move we made in that direction was the national agreement.  We set up the Employer/Labour Conference and brought in these agreements after they sweated over them for many days. They were not ideal agreements.  They had an element of inflation in them already and one would probably be more than justified if one was to be concerned only with increased productivity and the increase in the consumer index.  Nevertheless, they made for some stability and they reduced, as the Minister said in his speech, the number of man days lost as a result of strikes.</P>
    <P>This is a move in the right direction. Now that I am out of office I would like to ask if anybody can contemplate this thing going on <i>ad infinitum.</i> Do we have an increase each year?  Must we have an agreement at the end of which there will be an increase another increase and another increase?  Do we carry on with this spiralling until money loses its entire value?</P>
    <P>In the 14 point programme which the National Coalition Government announced before the general election a prices and incomes policy was mentioned.  The worker says if prices are kept stable he will not demand <Col N="1148" /> an increase in wages and the trader says if he does not have to increase his overheads he will not increase his prices.  It is a question of whether the hen or the egg came first.  Every country in the world has tried a prices and incomes policy and I have not seen one which has shown any sign of success.  We have our own as we set up the National Prices Commission representative of all sides of industry, including trade unionists.  This, to my mind, only tended to make people feel that things were going mad because usually on the radio they heard an announcement that the prices of 17 articles had been increased by agreement of the Prices Commission.  If the Prices Commission were not there they would have been slipped in time and again and people would not have noticed them.  Now the Prices Commission give their assent, as they must, when the facts are presented to them and you have a report released that the price of ten or 11 articles has been increased.  In face of that this Government are committed to bringing in a national prices and incomes policy.  I seriously doubt whether they can do so.  While everybody would desire it we would be the first country in the world to have achieved it if we do succeed.</P>
    <P>There must be some end to the spiralling of incomes; it cannot go on forever.  Nobody could contemplate a situation of perpetuating annual increases with many different terminal dates, with each party coming along saying: &ldquo;It is our turn now; the other fellows got 50p a week more than we did; we must get that now.&rdquo;  There are questions of parity and selectivity, differential rates and so on, all of which must be recognised.  One compares with what others get; the teachers with the gardaí; the gardaí with the civil servants and the civil servants with dentists and they all go mad to ensure that the other fellow does not catch up.  Nobody stops to think of the interests of the national economy.  Although individually they will agree that this is creating inflation and that money is losing value, collectively they all want these adjustments. This is the problem any Government <Col N="1149" /> must face and that no Government will succeed in settling.  If you reach the stage where money is increasing in value you have depression with mass unemployment.  In the early thirties we lived through a time when the cost of living was going down each year and that is the only time in the memory of the present generation when that happened.  Nobody ever wants to see it happen again.</P>
    <P>Inflation with all its evils, as somebody at the IMI Conference in Killarney said the other day, puts money in the way of those who would not otherwise get it and it helps generally to improve people's standard of living. If the institutions provided by the Department of Labour can ensure that the increase demanded each year will not be higher than what is justified (1) by the consumer price index increase and (2) by increased productivity, then inflation will not operate deterimentally. There is nothing I shall watch more keenly than how the Coalition Government will deal with the prices and incomes policy because we have been the subject of continuing criticism from the Government when they were in Opposition while we struggled with one of the most difficult world problems.  Then they asked: &ldquo;What are you doing about it?  Why do you not settle it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Employer/Labour Conference took the first step towards bringing sanity into the situation and at the same time providing satisfaction, providing a new institution which I, at one time, thought could be provided by the Labour Court.  I thought the Labour Court could take part in that exercise but the Labour Court held the view that they are akin to a statutory judicial body which must be completely free to make absolutely impartial decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  I do not mind.  It was my opinion that they could undertake work that could <Col N="1150" /> be theirs to do and which they had the expertise to carry out better than any other body.  I was invited to speak at a symposium of the Dublin Trade Union Council after the national agreement and the members present were loud in voicing threats of what they would do if the bankers or any other persons who held themselves to be outside the agreement infringed its conditions even though they were not a party to it.  With the assistance of the Minister for Finance I did my level best to ensure that the latest agreement negotiated by the banks would conform to the second national agreement of 1972.  I was not concerned with what the banks got or did not get, what they were entitled to or not entitled to, other than in seeing that they would co-operate.  We had the Fogarty Report on the original bank strike which quoted the bankers as saying that national agreements were no part of their interest; that they were a body by themselves.  Neither I nor the Government liked that: we felt that whatever improvements in conditions they could bring about, it was necessary for everybody to co-operate in ensuring that the terms of the national agreement were observed in relation to pay adjustments and conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I submitted the banks' proposals to the Labour Court under section 24.  They found that many of these did conform to the national agreement.  We then proposed that these parts of the negotiated agreement should be implemented and the others left aside for discussion. We said we would bring in legislation to curtail them if they went ahead against our wishes.  We asked them to come and see us.  I shall say no more about that because I do not know where the matter now stands.  The election intervened and the legislation, which as far as I recall got its first reading, was shelved and it remains to be seen what will happen.  The banks may have had a very good case, but being members of a most important institution, the financial system of the country, they must have realised that we were trying to deal with a major national crisis in attempting to <Col N="1151" /> curb inflation and get some sanity into the economy and reach a situation where a man's take-home pay would be of real value rather than that he should grasp something out of which he would have to pay more income tax, and find the purchasing power of any increase in pay diminished almost as soon as he got it.</P>
    <P>These were the problems which the Department of Labour set up institutions to deal with.  The Minister devoted a great part of his speech to the rights of the female sex&mdash;and rightly so; we had already appointed an officer in the Department to deal with that situation.  These are the serious problems the Minister must tackle. Whether the Minister is better suited to deal with them than I was remains to be seen.  I sincerely hope he is.  If he can deal with the trade unions, with ICTU and the FUE, and with the banks, better than I could and get them to come into line and get people generally to accept the terms of whatever national agreement it is, all the time negotiating a better agreement, we will give him every support in that because this constitutes an overall national problem affecting not merely the lives of the people but the whole future development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Again, the whole question of full employment is closely wrapped up in this.  One of the greatest incentives to any industrialist, whether he be a national or from another country, is a reasonable measure of industrial peace.  Until such time as we can guarantee that industrialists will opt for other areas.  I am not introducing now a note of despair.  I have always pointed out that the Department of Labour was one Department in which one could not play politics.  It is a Department requiring the co-operation of both sides of this House.  Perfunctoriness has no place in it.  Very often common sense ordained that one should hold one's tongue.  I made major speeches on suitable occasions pointing out what was involved in continually rising wages chasing prices and prices chasing wages.  I pointed out what was involved, but nobody took the slightest notice.  Demands <Col N="1152" /> came along again the next year.  First it was 10s a week; then it was £1 a week; then it was £4 a week and, finally, in one case we had workers demanding an increase of £20 a week. The sky was the limit.  It seemed to me a matter of thinking of a number, doubling it and then negotiating to see how much one would get.</P>
    <P>There are signs now that some order has entered into this.  I have no intention of being in any way facetious. I have no intention of trying to impede in any way what the Minister is trying to do, but I do want to point out that those who negotiated these two agreements will want the full support of all of us in their next effort so that they will negotiate an even better third agreement.  That will be the best approach for all of us, particularly for those of us who will be taking over government again in a short time.</P>
    <P>When I took over in the Department of Labour I found that my predecessor, Dr. Hillery, had prepared an omnibus Bill covering trade union legislation. He ran into very heavy weather with all concerned.  The Bill was beaten to it by an election.  It was put aside for some time but we eventually decided to take out of the Bill those provisions which were acceptable&mdash;to use the modern terminology, those provisions on which we could get a consensus&mdash; and we had dialogue with the FUE and the trade unions and got general agreement.  We were proceeding to do piecemeal the provisions in the original omnibus measure.  Each Bill dealt with a specific area.  One of the Bills being prepared&mdash;I hoped to bring it in&mdash; dealt with the proliferation of trade unions and supported any move which would tend towards the amalgamation of trade unions.  Proliferation of trade unions was making negotiation impossible. The prevention of proliferation would, in the last analysis, be very definitely to the advantage of the unions themselves.  There are many hazards involved in bringing about this situation, but a move could be made in that direction and it would be a very, very useful move indeed.</P>
    <P>The Department has had foisted on it, or acquired, or accepted, a new <Col N="1153" /> dimension from the point of view of EEC involvement in that it is the Department responsible for applications to the Council for payment from the Social Fund.  The applications are channelled through and many of the applications are directly concerned, as the Minister knows, with the Department itself.  The one meriting the earliest attention is that for some extra finance for the training service, AnCO and the IMI.  The latter is on occasion a much maligned body.  It is one for which I have the greatest admiration.  It started out with a number of top executives here coming together for the purpose of placing their expertise at the disposal of others.  Initially, we did not have many of them.  We had, in fact, fewer than were lost in a tragic plane distaster not so many months ago.  But their numbers multiplied.  The IMI grew out of the pioneering effort of great men who had made a success of their own businesses, some of which sprang from very small beginnings.  These were the men who formed the nucleus of the Irish Management Institute. They did a tremendous job.  Irrespective of what other institutions, be they universities, vocational schools or colleges of technology, can do there will always be a need for the Irish Management Institute.  This Institute holds refresher courses designed to bring people up to date in skills and techniques and in the evolution of industry generally and in the requirements of management in particular. They do an excellent job.  Any money we can get from the EEC&mdash;I will not quote some of the things the Minister said about the EEC when we were thinking of joining it&mdash;to improve training in these directions will be very welcome indeed.  It will also be of tremendous help to the State.</P>
    <P>During the general election I went to Brussels.  I am glad the papers did not take too much notice of it.  If one goes over now one gets a great deal of publicity.  I attended a most important meeting in the midst of the election campaign of the Ministers for Social Affairs.  I attended only because this was a link which, if we lost it, could have repercussions.  From my earlier attendances in Brussels I feared that <Col N="1154" /> some of the smart alecks representing other nations might see the solution to our unemployment problem as the bringing of our people across to Germany, France or elsewhere and telling them there was plenty of employment for them in these countries.  I made the case that we were interested in bringing the work to the people and not the people to the work.  That argument&mdash;it was taken up by the British on the same occasion&mdash;was accepted and I am glad the Minister is now pursuing the same line.  I fully support him.  It was a crucial meeting. These are the things we must insist on in ensuring that we pull our weight in an association in which we are equals and in which we should not suffer from any inferiority complex.</P>
    <P>That is most of what I have to say on a great Department.  It is a Department which is becoming the most important one in the State.  This Department will have to spearhead much of the economic drive that will bring longterm results.  What is done in the Department of Labour may not be evident today or tomorrow but what is done there will provide the launching pad for future developments.  This is particularly bound up with the manpower policy and with training in particular.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some of the legislation introduced during my term of office. A measure which gave me great satisfaction was that which amended the Redundancy Bill.  I was warned by some members of the Labour Party at the time that I was not going far enough in providing for the using-up of the huge surplus which had accumulated in the Redundancy Fund at that time.  In return, I pointed out that in England the Government had had the same experience.  They accumulated a great surplus and after a time they became more generous but found then that the surplus was eaten up and they had to increase contributions.  Even in spite of the generous Amendment Bill, although I thought I was reasonably conservative and doubled the benefits while holding out against retrospection. I warned that we might have to increase the contributions.  We had to do so.  In the first quarter of this year the numbers of redundancies were <Col N="1155" /> somewhat down compared with those in previous years.  I hope the Government do not take credit for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of the things which they were handed on a plate.  It was a good scheme.  It provided for people at a time when they might have been dismissed and told they were unemployed.  Reasonably generous provision was made for such people.  The more industrial development we have the more &ldquo;musical chairs&rdquo; we will have.  There will be new techniques and new industries. Some industries will become obsolete. That is the normal experience in countries which are fully developed. Training and retraining are required.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to say about the Estimate, most of which was prepared while I was Minister.  The Minister, while giving a full and long explanation, did not number the pages in the speech.  I had to do that myself.  They came to 51.  My original script had 24 pages.  The Minister added a few sections based on aspirations and hopes founded on the present basis of the Department as it is working at present.  I hope the Department will continue in that way.</P>
      <P>One of the drawbacks which haunted me in my efforts in the Department was that people were breathing down my neck about a blue book manifesto.  Mention was often made about bringing in socialism of a new type.  A conference in Galway suggested our ideas were wrong.</P>
      <P>I hope that Fine Gael and Labour have merged to form one party and that we will not have any wildcat schemes proposed in the future and held up as an alternative.  The Government are comprised of two parties agreed on certain policies.  I understand that they have agreed to merge and to be one party.  If not there must be the inevitable dichotomy and this will manifest itself at some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for presenting us with such a first-class document from his Department. Great credit is due to him.  I have known him over a number of years and know that he is well-fitted for his job.  His years of experience in the trade union movement have qualified him to deal with the work in his Department.</P>
      <P>The great event last year was our entry into the EEC.  As a result of that many attitudes must change.  In his statement the Minister laid great emphasis on industrial training.  We are now in a highly-industrialised unit in Europe.  While there will be aids, these will be mostly financial.  Without proper training, particularly industrial training, we in this country would be annihilated as an industrial nation. That will not happen.  We will be able to measure up to change because we have geared ourselves by AnCO. AnCO are doing a fine job in training and resettling people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention the report on apprenticeship training.  The reduction in age is very important.  I served my time, and while doing so I realised that the period of apprenticeship was too long.  My opinion has not changed by one iota.  The last speaker mentioned the trade union restrictions on <Col N="1157" /> the intake of apprentices.  In a sense they restricted the numbers of apprentices in certain fields for good reasons. Apprentices have to be trained.  If there is a flood of apprentices into an industry they will not be trained, but will be used as cheap labour.  The policy of the trade union movement in restricting the numbers of apprentices was correct, because they had an obligation to their members and to the young apprentices.  Educational standards are rising.  Technology is becoming more widely used.  This is a technological age.  In these circumstances apprentices must have a higher basic education and a shorter training period.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the trade union movement for their participation in national wage agreements.  They signed agreements at a time when living standards were rising.  When inflation outstripped wage increases they honoured the agreement.  In that way they showed themselves to be a most responsible body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan considers that a prices and incomes policy would not work and said that it has been tried in other countries.  The fact that a policy has been tried and has failed is not sufficient reason for not trying it again. If inflation is allowed to continue we will be in serious trouble.  We will not be able to compete with other European countries.  We are in a sophisticated market and if we are not competitive we will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement should consider productivity agreements in the context of raising the standard of living of their members.  This is a matter which should be explored.  Productivity agreements would mean something for everybody and a real rise in workers' standard of living, which is what we all want to ensure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan pointed out that at the IMI meeting last week it was suggested that in a period of inflation some people made money.  That is quite right.  The rich make money. Those who suffer in an inflationary situation are the poor, the social welfare recipients.  While we look forward to their being given some relief in the forthcoming budget, that <Col N="1158" /> is not good enough.  Both management and unions must keep a close eye on high inflationary trends because of the great hardships involved for the less well-off section of the community and because of the danger of pricing ourselves out of markets.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service is working very well.  This is a most important development within the labour movement.</P>
    <P>There are two labour exchanges in Dublin and they are a disgrace.  They are degrading.  A man could only lose his will and his spirit by having to attend at one of these places two or three times a week in order to sign. These monuments to the last century should be demolished and replaced by buildings more suited to the technological age.  Trained personnel should be employed to deal with the problems of unemployed men.  Unemployment is a cancer in our society.  Regrettably, unemployment has increased over the last number of years.  One has only to visit a labour exchange to see the despair and the hardship caused by unemployment.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.  An effort should be made to re-employ persons who have been unemployed.  There should be proper buildings staffed by trained social welfare workers who could meet people, talk to them, sort out their problems and help them to regain confidence in their ability to work.  There is a tendency to regard persons who have been unemployed for a few years as persons who do not want to work.  That is not the case.  We all want to work.  In some cases a person's confidence is undermined by reason of his being unemployed.  An effort must be made to restore selfconfidence and a sense of human dignity.</P>
    <P>Discrimination on the grounds of age is developing in our society.  It is a good thing that AnCO is there to re-train men but if an employer decides that a man who is 40 years of age is useless as far as he is concerned, re-training becomes irrelevant. We talk about taking action in regard to other forms of discrimination but do not appear to take any action in regard to discrimination on <Col N="1159" /> the grounds of age.  For employment as a general worker in one local authority a person who is 40 years of age or more would not be considered. That is not the kind of society of which I want to be part.  I know the Minister will consider this matter.  He is a man with a keen interest in the human aspect of his position.</P>
    <P>Industrial democracy has been a subject of debate over the last few years.  I suspect that management and unions do not take the matter too seriously but I feel that as long as people are talking about it nothing will happen.  A whole new outlook can be developed in industrial relations so that both sides in industry will be able to talk with one another rather than to one another.  The works council idea must be promoted.  The Minister should encourage that development in every way possible.  Persons who want to participate in works councils should be provided with the necessary training and opportunity. An employer who releases employees for this purpose will benefit by the fact that his workers are being trained in this area.</P>
    <P>The question of training is involved in the implementation of industrial democracy. It is not industrial democracy merely to have a man sit on the board of management because he can be ignored and shut out.  This may happen if we do not tackle the matter of industrial democracy in a proper manner. Management training for workers is necessary.  The industrial college at Sandford Road, which I attended for four years, does a good job.  The Minister should ensure that this college, and perhaps another one on the north side of the city, operate for the purpose of training workers in management so that when they are on the boards they will know what is going on and can participate in discussions.  It is important that workers should know the problems of management so that they may be able to explain to their colleagues what is happening.</P>
    <P>Time and again we have seen where firms have closed and receivers appointed; in these instances workers <Col N="1160" /> have been left penniless except for redundancy payments.  If we had worker participation this would not happen because there would be greater knowledge of what was going on.  In addition, workers should receive the auditor's general report just as do the shareholders. Management frequently talk about their responsibility to shareholders but rarely about their responsibility to workers.  Many firms act as if they had no responsibility to the man who works for them every day&mdash;in their view their only responsibility is to the shareholders.  This is ludicrous and it is the main reason for the bad industrial relations we have had for the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Industrial democracy cannot be imposed on anyone.  It can be eased in on the State bodies and, when outside industry see the effect it has, they will be only too anxious to participate in industrial democracy.  In addition, workers must participate in profit-sharing as do the shareholders.  A worker is entitled to a dividend quite apart from what he earns.</P>
    <P>Employers who participate in profit-sharing should be given tax incentives. For the worker, it gives him a real share in his job and a sense of responsibility and, in turn, this means he is willing to give of his best.  We should strive to achieve this.  We are a small country, we are supposed to be Christian, although one might not think this when one sees the trade disputes that occur.  The previous speaker blamed sections of the trade union movement for disrupting industry but I do not agree with him.  In many instances these disputes arise because of bad communications or because management are not prepared to listen but want only to dictate.  These human failings occur because people are not prepared to sit down and to talk together; rather they talk at one another.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister intends to set up a separate section in his Department to deal with the problem of industrial democracy.  We hear much about management training and it is true that our standards are rising in this regard.  We had the tragedy of losing some of our great men last year <Col N="1161" /> and it will take a number of years to fill that gap.  Some management training should be done at shop floor level so that the problems and fears of people on the shop floor are recognised and appreciated.  Management cannot remain aloof.  They are only a function&mdash;although a major one&mdash; in the operation and they must remember that.  They must remember they are working for the good of the community.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour deals with people.  I am glad that the Minister's speech spells out the concern that exists for all sections of industry. This is the correct attitude to adopt. I was pleased the Minister spoke about women's rights because in industry they have been treated as second-class citizens and, as the Minister has pointed out, they have been given the menial jobs.  This should be changed as a result of the report of the Commission on the Status of Women, but I think the Minister will have to keep a close eye to see that women are not deprived of their rights in industry. If this can be achieved it will help to improve industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The disabled and handicapped workers have been neglected and, because of their infirmities, they have been passed over.  Firms who take on such people should get special concessions and every encouragement should be given them so that the disabled and handicapped will not be treated as second-class citizens but will be involved in general activities.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker wondered how Fine Gael and Labour stood in relation to all these matters.  The 14-point programme is a clear indication of what we stand for.  Both parties stand for social reform and, when the term of this Dáil ends, I have no doubt this Government will be recognised as a Government of social reform, a Government who have shown concern and have made the necessary changes.  The statement by the Minister is a clear proof of the kind of changes that will take place and I should like to compliment him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his speech.  It is a very impressive volume which takes a long <Col N="1162" /> time to absorb and I am afraid I have not been able to do so fully in the couple of hours at my disposal.  Deputy Brennan has had experience in this Department whose importance he emphasised.  He pointed out that its main importance was not in the role of industrial relations, as people had thought.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we are dealing with a very important Department. One of the main functions of the Department is to train our workers to produce goods which will be competitive in the markets of our partners in Europe.  We will succeed there only if the training has been done properly. Referring again to Deputy Brennan, it amazes me how Fianna Fáil must have thought about this Department because when they were in Government they had only a part-time Minister in charge.  He also took care of the Department of Social Welfare which dealt with an annual expenditure of £250 million.  Of course, it was in that Department he spent most of his time.  As well as that the staff of the Department of Labour had to be picked from various other Departments. Without that staff the Minister could not have carried on.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister spoke about unemployment figures in 1972 and up to the end of 1972.  He said that from then on the figures had abated.  That is so because it was only then that the Government took action.  They spoke about a ten point programme but it was only when they were pushed by Labour Party policy that they began to move.  The only time they took action in the past seven or eight years was when they were pushed.</P>
      <P>To some extent we have eased the emigration rate but we still have 68,000 people unemployed and the new Government must now get down and do something about this.  One reason for the fall in emigration is that there was high unemployment in Britain and, therefore, many of our unemployed workers did not go there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of retraining, I visited training centres in Galway where people were being trained in the building trades&mdash;plastering and joinery. <Col N="1163" /> Of course, retraining is only half the task because side by side with it must be the creation of jobs.  The difficulty about training is the cost to the State.  For instance, some years ago professional people, doctors and engineers, educated in Ireland at immense cost to the ratepayers and to the State, emigrated to England.  That is one of the reasons why parallel with training we must have industries in which to absorb our trained workers. I agree that some of them, such as engineers, must go to other countries for experience in bigger projects. During the past number of years we have been giving grants to foreign companies in the hope that they would give employment here.  We were promised thousands of new jobs but we ended up getting only a few hundred. I give Potez as an example.</P>
    <P>One important sphere in industrial training is that of design and in this respect I mention the Kilkenny Design Centre which caters particularly for cloth and pottery.  We will never compete on an equal basis with many European countries, particularly with Finland and Denmark, the leaders in furniture, unless we have expert designers.  Italy specialised in making refrigerators but American companies buy them and stamp their names on them.  As I have said, unless we concentrate on design we will not be able to compete in European markets.  Navan is one instance in which proper design would be of immense benefit.  Indeed, with proper designers there they could be leaders in Europe in furniture production.</P>
    <P>As well as design what we must aim at is greater productivity.  Productivity will come only if workers are interested in the jobs they are doing.  We must also have a design and I feel that in this country where transport is not a great charge, although it is a big charge where a product is big and bulky we should go in for the smaller expensive item, for quality rather than quantity.  To do this, again we must look for these designers and these skilled workers.  I feel that some of these workers could be sent abroad. Sometimes you will lose them but <Col N="1164" /> some will come back and if they come back with greater skills, we shall be in a position to compete with other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>There are in every company three sections: there are the workers who are the most important, there is management and there is money which is usually the shareholder in the bigger companies.  The worker must be skilled and must give good productivity for which he must be paid on a proper basis and particularly in relation to his skills.  With management, and I have often blamed them here but they have improved tremendously, goes the salesmen. Are these as good as they should be?  Then we have management and management are thinking of tomorrow rather than five years ahead.  I cannot blame them for that because the previous Government never thought ahead further than the next election or the next week.  In relation to shareholders' money in a company run by the management, it is their duty to use this money to the best advantage.  This does not apply so much to this Department but it does apply, and money from Europe can usually be got at a cheaper rate and like most Departments of Government, they like to pay for everything as they go along, particularly capital expenditure.  My feeling about that is that this is completely wrong.  Let the present generation pay for the next generation do nothing else but enjoy it and drink it.  My feeling is that if you are putting capital into it, that capital can be paid over 30 or 40 years and the money saved, if you can get it cheaper on the world money market, can be used for day to day work.  How often do we see businesses in this country selling their property and leasing it back so as to have working capital? This does not apply to the Department so much but it does apply to management in a company, that they are inclined to play it too safe.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that training is not particularly a matter for the Government.  I feel that the trade unions have to train the worker in particular essential skills, but management and trade unions have a part <Col N="1165" /> interest with the Government in it, and I agree that where possible, a grant should be given to unions if they have to use their money for training purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the matters of apprenticeship and career guidance and I feel that his Department have done a tremendous amount in this regard but very often this could be given to a child as young as 12 or 13 years of age.  How often do we find that people leaving school from 18 to 21 who do not know what they are going to do?  If they have shown a particular inclination towards mathematics, English or science, they should be steered that way and this is not happening.  It is the case with certain teachers but not generally.</P>
    <P>Another point is that we have in this country what amounts to a crisis in apprenticeship and I believe the reason for this is that there is no promotion for apprentices.  A boy goes in as an apprentice and ends up as a worker.  He may become manager of a section but he is finished at that.  How many of them become directors?  Leaving out the accountant or financial controller, how often do we see a man who starts on the floor getting to the top in a business he does not own himself?  They always bring in some university man or a man with an English accent.  Far away hills are green and they want somebody who speaks nicely rather than the man who knows his job.  I am not saying here that there should be no such person as an accountant or an engineer.  When it comes to special training, these men have to be used as they are essential to a business, but one thing is that many of these people who own these businesses, who are managing directors themselves, started without any training or university degree, but these are the men who when they get to a certain rank do not want the men who started on the same level to get charge and become a director.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the levygrant in relation to various trades.  I agree with this&mdash;from a vested interest point of view, it may be biased&mdash;but particularly as regard the tourist trade which is one of our biggest moneymakers, <Col N="1166" /> those in the licensed trade have to pay the same as those in the hotel business.  In the licensed trade, the workers are trained and trained well.  I am not saying that the hotels do not train their workers, but the Government are already helping to provide a tremendous number of grants&mdash;some very badly placed by the last Government and very often on a political basis &mdash;for hotels to carry out improvement of their business, whereas most of those in the drink trade and many of the bigger hotels which did not get grants, had to do it out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>In relation to apprentices, I must say that the Minister and the Department have done quite a bit in discussions with AnCO and we are told that people are conducting an intensive campaign to get intake raised, that the results have been most encouraging and that the people in Paris are prepared to cooperate. I do not know exactly what they did but whatever it was, I am quite happy about it but I feel that here again much of it has to do with snobbery. A person will prefer a pen-pushing job if it pays less rather than appear at home in dirty clothes though he may have a better future in them.</P>
    <P>Starting at the top, because it does happen in most companies&mdash;and by the top I mean the Government&mdash;there should be a five-year if not a ten-year programme, so that a person can feel: &ldquo;I will stay in this business for a ten-year span and, after the eighth or ninth year, I will have a look at it.&rdquo;  I believe that industrial democracy is essential. When a person has worked for seven or eight years he should have sufficient information to know if it is time to get out of that business because he is wasting his time.  As Deputy O'Brien said, when you are a man of 40 everybody shies clear of you.  Most of the bigger business companies have at least a five-year programme and they would have a ten-year programme if they had sufficient money and knew where the money was coming from.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this because it is political, but it happens to be political. Everything is greater before an election and then there is a second budget in the open.  Then we have a tough time for two years and we spring <Col N="1167" /> forward again for the next election. That may be all right to win an election but it &ldquo;bunches&rdquo; the country.  There is no doubt about that.  Nobody can plan ahead and least of all can the Department of Labour plan ahead.  The civil servants spend time trying to work out how long the Government will last and how they will get in the next time.  It is the same case of a man who is stuck for money&mdash;and this happened to myself. There is a bad period and you are lodging money in the bank as quickly as you are writing cheques.  You spend more time doing that than you do running your business.  This is what has happened for the past 16 years.  Until we can plan ten years ahead, or at least five years ahead, this country will not succeed in Europe.</P>
    <P>The education available now is tremendous.  We may have rushed ahead a bit quickly.  Years ago I knew the building trade, and I still know it. At that time it was a closed shop. Father was followed by son.  It was tough enough for an uncle to get his nephew taken on as a carpenter.  Now, with the education available, most of the men who work in the building trade hope that their sons will be top civil servants or TDs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be some way of raising the status of tradesmen.  The best example I can give is probably teachers, taking into account the amount of hard work and nerve-racking work teachers have to do.  All over Western Europe teachers are very badly paid whereas in Eastern Europe they are very well paid.  If the glamour end of a job could be increased you might be able to get more people to undertake it.  I do not know how this could be done.  I have no great ideas about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that, with a limited amount of capital, training has improved tremendously since I first spoke about it, but we have a long way to go.  We should be spending more money on it.  I know there is difficulty in getting teachers, and so on, and I agree that a great deal should <Col N="1168" /> be done on the floor of the factories. Some employers said that if they trained their apprentices the apprentices could go to another firm and give their ideas to that other firm.  Therefore they were disinclined to have apprentices who could move in and move out in a couple of years.  In America and West Germany the idea is that they take in machinery and in two years they take in more machinery and, if you walk out, you are out of date by the time you are in the other business.  Employers must have apprentices who are properly trained.</P>
    <P>Either with the help of grants or through the enterprise of firms, managers should spend a period abroad either in, say, Germany or England or America.  This is happening more often now than was the case.  We should provide every encouragement for these people to go abroad, particularly when we are starting a new industry, so that they will get more technical knowledge and will realise how competitive they really are.</P>
    <P>The National Wage Agreements have been very successful particularly in the case of the underpaid worker but the underpaid worker is still very late in getting an increase, or he is not getting it quickly enough to catch up on other workers.  There is a feeling in trade union circles that the differential between the lower and the higher paid workers must stay.  I hate to say this, but I feel it is up to the Government to make up some of the deficiency by social welfare benefits.  We have been a long time trying to make up the differential and we have not done it yet.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has gone up in the past number of years and the workers must get a wage increase to meet it.  I do not know, but I hope that tomorrow there will be many increased social benefits in the budget.  This, together with the reduction in the rates. and with VAT being removed from certain commodities, will help a tremendous number of people, and will give them more spending power.  They are entitled to get an increased wage to meet the increased cost of living as well as those increased benefits.  I know that if we overdo it we will become <Col N="1169" /> underproductive in competition with Europe.</P>
    <P>While I was speaking about retraining and training it struck me that the number of old people who are being trained is negligible.  Some 18 months ago I asked a question about this and one person over a certain age was being retrained.  I think the position has improved since.</P>
    <P>There is something else at which we should be looking.  Because of the lack of thought by the previous Government we have at the moment the amalgamation of various motor companies. We had one particular company where there was a lock-out or a strike and their workers are likely to become redundant.  Some years ago we should at least have got in touch with the big British companies, European companies or American companies who over the years have got a tremendous amount of money from exports to this country.  We should have had some deal with them in regard to spare parts&mdash;in relation to for example, springs for cars which are mass produced&mdash;so that when those people lose their employment they could obtain employment on spare parts production.  I do not think anybody ever thought of this.  The only thing they thought of was putting off the day; the less they thought about it the fewer votes they would lose.  We were promised that nobody would lose their jobs in the car industry until 1980 but the number is reduced by half already. Many of them have got jobs in garages and repair shops but there are still many out of work.  Alternative employment in the same line of business should be available to workers who become redundant.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a man from the IDA last year who told me that an American company wanted to come to Ireland. They wanted to be in Europe when they knew we were joining the Common Market.  They were waiting for the referendum and in the meantime went to Brussels.  I asked &ldquo;Why go to Brussels?  Why not go to England, where there is training and knowledge?&rdquo; I was told that there were too many man hours lost by strikes.  They <Col N="1170" /> said the one thing about Ireland is when they have a strike they have a long one.</P>
    <P>The car industry affects workers in Dublin and in Cork.  You have Japanese and Italian companies who have to bring their cars long distances. It might pay them to assemble them here.  We certainly could be making spare parts for cars here.  I see that one company is spending £350,000,000 within the next few years.  We should be able to obtain something from such a company if they made spare parts in this country.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Brien in regard to what he said about worker participation.  This is coming.  We can put it off and say that people do not like it, but it must come.  Until you get workers, management and shareholders working together you will not get the best result possible for the company.  Ireland, as a small country, has a better chance and it is much easier to start here.  I believe it would be very hard to start in England.  This is something which can be done gradually. Some industries have a big turnover and small profit while others have a low turnover and a big profit. However, they work out at about the same money, but not on percentages.</P>
    <P>One problem which is common to both Ireland and England is that in some industries we have even up to 30 trade unions.  Recently we had a case of too many unions in the one business.  I am not saying that we should have one industrial union in a particular firm but I think we should try to reduce the number of unions. Where there are two unions in one particular industry they should be amalgamated so that the decision of one union, which might cause a strike, would not automatically affect the other.</P>
    <P>In the hotel industry we have not very many skilled workers but I am sure that, when things return to normal in the North or greatly improve, the tourist business will boom again so we will need more trained workers.  We would also need to produce the food at a competitive price. We cannot have restrictive practices. If there are any, they should be got rid of as quickly as possible so that <Col N="1171" /> hotels can provide cheaper holidays and a cheaper tariff.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour have a tremendous amount of information to give to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They can advise them in regard to many things but eventually the Department of Labour have to carry the baby when people become redundant.  This is particularly so in the case of takeovers and mergers. In themselves they are a good thing for the country, but very often there is permanent unemployment.  This is something which should be looked at and there should be some power given to the Department of Labour or the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to takeovers and mergers.  As the Department of Labour are involved in relation to redundant workers they should be able in some way to stave off the day when sackings come.  Some pressure should be brought to bear on the Government to bring in legislation to see that the number of redundancies are reduced to a minimum when takeovers and mergers take place.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to refer to is I believe the kernel of a lot of trouble between workers and employers. When firms go broke there is no pre-warning that this is likely to take place.  A worker in such a company should be able to see the writing on the wall.  I know this is a particular problem of the IDA but it is also a problem of the Department of Labour because there will be redundant workers.  I am not worried about the person who has just started in a job and is under 30, but you get the person of 45 or 50 who has perhaps worked for 20 years in a company and is suddenly left without work; the most he can get is a part-time job.  It would be better if there could be ten years' warning; at least you would not have people becoming redundant.  In concluding, I should like to congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his new office.  It was once said about Conservative and Labour Governments in England that we could get anything from a Conservative Government <Col N="1172" /> because they could bring the people with them.  Let us hope the present Minister will be able to bring the unions with him.  The previous Minister had a fairly tough time and agreement among unions might be of great benefit.  The previous Minister did a great deal in preparing workers for industries by setting up AnCO, for instance.  This was a very important thing and so was the emphasis placed on schools of technology so that workers will be fully equipped for the type of industry that will be set up here.  We shall be advancing each year and there will be redundancies. This is bound to happen when you must adopt new methods and new training.  The Minister can be sure that in any attempt he makes to achieve industrial democracy he will get support from this side of the House.  I hope he will also get it from some people who have very odd views on that matter.</P>
      <P>I have all my life advocated industrial democracy.  I am a member of various committees of the co-operative movement and I have tried to get industrial democracy to work.  The trade unions are not always in favour of it. When some of them were approached they said: &ldquo;We prefer to be on our side of the table and let you be on yours.  We shall get all we can out of you and you can get all you can out of us.&rdquo;  We are bound to have industrial unrest while that situation continues. I shall always support the Minister in any attempt he makes to bring about industrial democracy of the type in which a company will have worker members elected to the board and when it brings in its annual budget and provides for capital expenditure and profits, any profits over and above that will be distributed among all in the company including the workers.  I suggested this in co-ops and I have got it working in one case very successfully. The worker knows that if he does his job well and if there is a surplus profit at the end of the year he will share in it.  He will not tolerate somebody working next to him who is not doing his job.  Therefore you will have greater efficiency and higher production and harmony within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> This is what I have been advocating but the Minister will not find this easy to realise and he will encounter difficulties from the trade unions.  In some cases&mdash;not all&mdash;they do not want this type of industrial democracy and prefer to argue from the opposite side of the table to see what they can get.</P>
    <P>There is much thought about the lower income group.  I have fought for them all my life but I could not get many unions to agree with me on one thing for a long time&mdash;thank God they are now coming around to it. I remember when all salary increases were on a percentage increase.  I recall a very good speaker from the Labour Party coming to my town to lecture on the late James Connolly, a man who, with the late James Larkin, I considered to be among the greatest advocates of trade unionism, people who went on the streets of Dublin when workers were slaves.  This man gave a beautiful lecture.  At that time I was agitating strongly against unlimited subsidies on the farming side. He said he agreed with me that there should be a limit.  I said that was all right but what about the percentage increases given for increases in the cost of living.  I was talking about the ordinary county council worker of that time who got £2 per week.  The man higher up got £6 a week to do the same job.  I could not get the union man to agree with me there because he was one of those fellows himself.</P>
    <P>This is what you have to put up with: the higher-paid man in any job, whether a big farmer or a high official of the trade union, will give lip-service to the lowly-paid workers but will not agree to touch percentage increases.  I have always fought for the man at the bottom and if the present Minister does anything to improve the situation I, and the majority of my party who, no matter what anybody may say about them represent the plain people of Ireland and they have fought all their lives for the lower income group, will support him.  I have seen people at local bodies fall asleep when I was preaching this gospel ten years ago. They talked about it outside but because they were highly-paid officials <Col N="1174" /> themselves they did not want to touch the percentage increases because it would affect themselves.</P>
    <P>Let us therefore, talk about everybody and especially the people comprising the lower income group.  Everybody talks about them so long as it will not affect themselves.  It is just like the case of the itinerants: we must house them but do not house them at my back door.  If the present Minister can bring all his party with him on this matter I shall be very pleased but I doubt if the water and the oil will mix.  From my experience in the country they are trying to mix water and oil where industrial democracy is concerned.  I shall be very interested to see the outcome of the Minister's efforts to bring it about because I have tried it in the co-operative movement and I know the opposition it met from certain sections. I believe it is the only cure for industrial unrest, that is, to have workers and management sitting around the same table discussing and deciding what they want and that when all expenditure is covered and provision made for future capital requirements whatever profit is over will be shared equitably.  That would be the ideal situation.  If the Minister can bring it about I shall certainly shake hands with him but he has a tough job even from the union point of view.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look into the whole matter of people becoming redundant.  I think a Deputy on the opposite side spoke of people becoming redundant when they are over 40.  It is sad to see people who are well qualified but not wanted by anybody.  It is a sad state of affairs. There is a great deal of talk about women getting their own way and so on. Married women are now being allowed to continue working outside the home. This is happening in many spheres of activity.  It is happening even in our hospitals.  There are certain advantages but the advantages may ultimately be outweighed by the disadvantages because in time an imbalance is bound to occur.  Great care will have to be exercised to preserve a proper balance.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that he <Col N="1175" /> will have no worries as far as this side of the House is concerned.  The probability is that his worries will be caused on his own side of the House. That is my honest belief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last few years the most significant development so far as the Department of Labour are concerned has been the evolution of national wage agreements with employers and unions sitting down togather to hammer out agreed increases in wages in industry, in agriculture and in other spheres of the economy.  The benefit of these agreements has been reflected in the harmony and peace prevailing at the work-bench.</P>
      <P>A great change, a change for the better, has come about in the strike situation from the point of view of man days lost.  That is borne out by the figures the Minister gave us in his introductory speech.  In 1970 over 1,000,000 man days were lost through strikes.  In 1971, with the national wage agreement in operation, the figure fell to 273,000 days and, in 1972, the figure fell again to about 200,000 days lost.  Most of the days lost in the last two years were lost as a result of strikes in big employment units and not as a result of a proliferation of strikes in small employment units.  This reflects the satisfaction induced by the national wage agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreements have, of course, had their limitations and their drawbacks. Fortunately, the second agreement eliminated some of the drawbacks of the first one.  The first agreement was deficient in that the increases given did not meet the rise in the cost of living.  Under the second agreement account could be taken of a sharp rise in the cost of living and the duration of the agreement was shortened.  The first agreement, negotiated for a two-year period, was far too long in duration.  The changes which took place over that period of two years meant that a very big adjustment had to be made on the expiry of the agreement.  A steep rise in the cost of living went on right through 1970, 1971 and 1972.  The <Col N="1176" /> increase was very marked towards the end of 1972 and early this year.  An agreement of shorter duration was the only solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister, together with the employers and the unions, now has the responsibility of hammering out a third national wage agreement.  If this is satisfactory&mdash;there is no reason why it should not be&mdash;the present healthy trend towards a continuing decrease in man days lost through strikes and disputes will continue and our country which, for some years, had the worst record of strikes and man days lost will find itself in a better position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other countries in the EEC.</P>
    <P>We know workers were not satisfied with the second national wage agreement and it was only as a result of great restraint on the part of the workers that the agreement got off the ground.  The record on the prices front has not been a good one.  Factors outside our control resulted in higher prices for imported raw materials.  As well as that, prices increased on purely internal commodities.  In 1972 there was an average 10 per cent increase in the cost of living and there was a huge increase of 16 per cent in the prices of essential foods.  The lower paid worker spends the largest percentage of his wages on food.  When food prices rise by as much as 16 per cent one cannot blame the worker for seeking compensation in an effort to restore his pay packet to its value at the beginning of the previous national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>As the former Minister said, the real problem is the hen and the egg.  Which came first?  The worker seeks an increase in wages because of rising prices. An increase is granted and prices rise still higher.  The real problem is knowing where to draw the line. Undoubtedly this will be the real headache for the Minister in the months to come.  He will have to bring all his expertise to bear, particularly at the Employer&mdash;Labour Conference, in order that a satisfactory 15th round, or third national wage agreement, may be agreed on.  This will not be easy.  The problems which will arise, if there is failure on this front, do not bear <Col N="1177" /> thinking about.  We do not want to go back to a free-for-all situation.</P>
    <P>No one wants to go back to where the strong will be able to make demands and the weak will have to accept what they can get.  There are some sections of the community who, because of their key position, want to get a greater share of the &ldquo;cake&rdquo;.  It was accepted, while negotiating the last two wage agreements, that the weaker sections must be treated better than they had been treated in previous rounds.  The weaknesses of the percentage increase system were highlighted by the giving of a certain amount to the lower-paid people and a gauranteed amount over the period of the agreement.</P>
    <P>It would be tragic if we cannot agree on a third national wage agreement, particularly for the weaker section of the workers.  Employers, workers and the Department of Labour must strive to see that the agreement will, in the main, satisfy everybody.  Employers may say that certain agreements are inflationary and that they will not hold up the rise in prices if the national wage agreements continue giving traditional increases, or that the rounds are becoming shorter thereby causing even more rapid inflation.  All these problems will have to be discussed and satisfactory solutions to them found.</P>
    <P>We have become a member of the EEC.  We cannot afford to lapse into the use of a free-for-all method.  One feature of the second national wage agreement which was welcomed by the weaker sections of the community was the attempt made to have national wage agreements come into force for all workers in or about the same time. Some people are as much as 18 months behind on the last national wage agreement. Further shortening of the span of the agreements must continue so that over a period of 10-12 years everybody will come under a particular agreement at the same time.  Another feature of any national wage agreement will have to be a levelling up of income for the lower-paid people.  This was a feature of a previous agreement.  I hope it will continue in the next agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned one section <Col N="1178" /> of the community which was outside the last agreement, the bank clerks. I cannot understand why they are not under the umbrella of the national wage agreement.  It has been said that their rights and conditions apply on both sides of the Border and that this is one reason why they cannot be brought under the wages agreement.  If the improvements in their conditions and salaries are such that they are better than those of the national wage agreement it would be very difficult to reach agreement about them.  The newspapers have already commented on the position of the bank clerks.  People in all walks of life are watching closely the increases obtained by the bank employees and will find there are exceptions to the rule.  If there are exceptions there can be no agreement.</P>
    <P>I hope that more professional people can be brought under the umbrella of the national wage agreements.  Too many people in professions are able to obtain increases beyond the percentage increases given at the higher end of the national wage agreements.  Those of us who occasionally require the services of professional people are aware of the huge increases in their fees over the last two or three years.  I hope that the incomes of the professional people can be examined, and that there is some section of the Minister's Department which can keep some surveillance on the increases in fees among professional people.</P>
    <P>When the late Mr. Norton, who was Tánaiste in the Inter-Party Government some years ago, brought about the industrial revolution in this country, problems had to be faced.  In later years there was need for a Department of Labour.  It is to the credit of the Fianna Fáil Government that they separated the Department of Labour from the Department of Industry and Commerce, and introduced a Department which will have increasing importance in the economy in the years to come.  The National Coalition Government have given the Department of Labour separate status under one Minister who is responsible for it only, without any need to visit other Departments. The Minister has full authority over his Department.  This is very <Col N="1179" /> necessary in prevailing conditions.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court have played a great part in the working of the Department.  Any of us who have had dealings with the Labour Court is aware of the great work done by the Labour Court since it was set up.  The officials in that court have saved the country from prolonged strikes on many occasions.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about strikes that occur, the duration of strikes and the court findings.  These matters are given great publicity in the national press.  It is amazing that the Labour Court hearings and the findings arrived at in that court do not get publicity. Publicity should be given to the hearings of the Labour Court on the same basis as it is given to other court hearings.  In that way people would be made aware of the great work done by the Labour Court and would be appreciative of the personnel of that section of the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Department of Labour which has done tremendous work are the Rights Commissioners. There is now only one Rights Commissioner in operation, Mr. Con Murphy.  Formerly there was a Mr. O'Kelly there also.  I understand that he has now left the section.  The record since the Rights Commissioners were established as part of the Department of Labour is very impressive.  Last year there were 372 cases before the Rights Commissioners.  Since 1970 there have been 617.  These Rights Commissioners do a fire brigade service, so to speak, for the Department of Labour.  If one or two individuals in a company are at variance with the rules or procedures in operation in the company and create a dispute, not in regard to pay, but in regard to conditions of employment, and if there is danger of a strike occurring, then both sides, workers and employers, may ask for the services of a Rights Commissioner.  There is right of appeal to a full hearing of the Labour Court should either side not agree to the findings.  In that case the findings of the Labour Court would be binding on both parties.</P>
    <P>Since 1970, 617 cases have been <Col N="1180" /> heard by the Rights Commissioners. There have been only two Rights Commissioners and arguments and submissions may be very protracted. Of the 617 cases only 20 have been appealed to a full hearing of the Labour Court.  In 99.9 per cent of the cases heard the findings have been accepted by both sides.  I hope this section of the Labour Court will be extended should the need arise.  I hope that the vacancy will soon be filled because this is one of the most valuable services to industry rendered by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a particular tribute to Mr. O'Kelly, who has left the service, for the work he has done for industry as a Rights Commissioner and, of course, also to Mr. Con Murphy who is well known for his work in other fields.  He also deserves every credit for his work as a Rights Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the hotel and catering industry.  The Department have a special section to deal with employees and the training of employees for this industry.  This is a most valuable service.  There is a great need for trained staff for this industry. Unfortunately, due to events in the North, the tourist industry suffered a setback last year but the indications are better for this year and if the position in the North improves we can expect that tourists will return in large numbers to this country.  In that event there will be need for expansion of catering staffs.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are responsible for some of the money which goes into the training of hotel staffs.  An industry which earned £100 million in 1970 should receive every encouragement from the Departments concerned.  In certain areas staffs have not received the treatment and the conditions and the wages to which they are entitled. This may be due to the seasonal nature of the work.  Many of the employees are on a temporary basis and are recruited according as need arises.  An industry that requires highly-trained staff must pay proper wages at all levels not just to the highly-trained personnel such as managers chefs, cooks, and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> Proper wages must be paid to those who wait at table and to those who work in all areas of hotels.  In some instances these persons have been exploited.  I hope the Minister will keep a closer watch on the type of establishments which are inclined to take advantage of the fact that they are located in areas where the tourist industry is the only source of income. There is a need to watch conditions and wages in those areas.  I hope the Minister will take a particular interest in the poorer paid hotel staffs.</P>
    <P>Some of the information leaflets on careers do not deal with the subject in any great depth.  Leaflets are available in employment exchanges and in schools.  They are of a rather flimsy nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do so because I am concerned that, for the purpose of higher education grants it is proposed to credit two honours to a student who obtains honours in the subject Irish. Because the Minister for Education <Col N="1182" /> made this proposal only very recently I hope he will be prepared to have a second look at it with a view to guaranteeing that the fundamental principle of equality of opportunity will be honoured.  In the matter of education we have struggled and are still struggling to ensure that this principle is honoured.</P>
      <P>In the last few decades advances have been made to achieve this laudable objective but there is not equality of opportunity.  There are economic and social circumstances attaching to the homes and to certain areas that do not allow equality to every student. Since I came into this House I have said on many occasions I was not satisfied with the curriculum or with the examination system generally because I considered schools were still geared to cater for the middle and upper middle classes.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the fact that there was not equality of opportunity for boys and girls attending primary and post-primary schools in Dublin city because, in order to be successful at Irish, it was required of them to have knowledge of the language and of a way of life they had never experienced. When I took Irish language classes with my students I spoke in Irish about, for instance, Georgie Best, Sandie Shaw or Dickie Rock, about flats, about fish and chips, or about anything else in which the students were interested rather than about life on the bog, or at sea, at the forge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that the students had never seen a bog, had never been at sea, had never been on a mountain, had never been to the forge and had never been at a wake. Why should these students be asked to study a language that dealt with a life that was totally unfamiliar?  We know there are areas where Irish is still the spoken language.  We should all like to see a Gaelic Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>We encourage students to visit the Gaeltacht areas so that they will become familiar with <Col N="1183" /> the language spoken there.  Parents whose children speak Irish get a special grant of £10 per child and receive another grant of £20 per child when he attends a post-primary school.  We spend approximately £100,000 to encourage students from my constituency and other areas to visit the Gaeltacht to acquire knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I have referred already to the lack of equality of opportunity in education. It was decided to award grants to children whose parents were not in a position to pay for third-level education. The grants are given to students who obtain four honours in the leaving certificate.  However, on the basis of figures given to me by the Minister, it is clear that a student from the Gaeltacht, or one who has the good fortune to go to an all-Irish school, has a five to one advantage in getting an honours in Irish over a student who lives in West Finglas, Cabra, Ballyfermot or any other place in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that as being fair?  Does he accept that that is in accordance with this fundamental principle, this wonderful objective we all have, that in the matter of education there should be equal opportunity? Does he accept that in circumstances where we are advising and exhorting the child from Cabra to go to the Gaeltacht so that he may learn the language which is being spoken by another student who is attending a school in Carraroe, Spiddal, that apart from the fact that he will be competing with that student in the examination, he should be expected to have the same chance in that examination as the master?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we send students to the Gaeltacht we tell them to mix around and play with muintir na háite.  At the same time we are putting those students in competition with the local boys and girls in the matter of education grants. To me it is quite obvious that the proposal is not sustainable in the matter of equal opportunity.  Answering a question put by me in respect of last year's leaving certificate examination, the Minister said that of the students from <Col N="1184" /> Gaeltacht areas who sat for the examination, practically 63 per cent obtained honours.  I am sure that position will be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the students attending all-Irish schools, practically 50 per cent obtained honours.  Subtract these figures from the total who sat for the examination and we get less than 20 per cent for the rest of the country.  Do these figures not demonstrate the case I am making?  The Minister, answering a question put by me, No. 24 on the Order Paper for 10th May last, said that I should be happy when he told me that 5,206 pupils from non-Gaeltacht areas secured grade C or higher. Looking at it in that way, the Minister might appear to be making a case for himself.  The case I am making is not for those students who succeeded in passing.  When we add to that figure the number of students from all-Irish schools we get, in respect of last year's leaving certificate for which a total of 24,000 sat, only 4,000 from non-Gaeltacht or non-all-Irish schools who passed.  I am concerned about the 20,000 students who sat for last year's leaving certificate examination and did not obtain honours in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is for the 20,000 students.  I am concerned for the 22,000 students from non-Gaeltacht and non-all-Irish schools who will sit for this year's examination and who will not get honours. Were it not for the fact that they are competing against the favourites in the matter of Irish they would have had, possibly, an opportunity to get at least honours in Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all appreciate now that competition in Irish, as the Minister has said, is influenced by the incentive, but who will most benefit from that incentive?  It is the student who already has such an advantage over the others&mdash;the student from the Gaeltacht, the student who has the good fortune to be living in close proximity to an all-Irish school.  If we had all-Irish schools available to all students, <Col N="1185" /> if the Twenty-six Counties were a Gaeltacht, there would be no objection to what the Minister proposes. His proposals, I suggest, stand slightly suspect in so far as an effort is being made to demonstrate that this is being done to remove what was called the psychological antagonism which existed to having what was called compulsory Irish.</P>
    <P>I wish to say in passing that I was one of the first Members of the House to advocate that the award of the leaving certificate and the intermediate certificate should not be dependent on students passing Irish as a subject.  I did so because I had convinced myself that such a requirement was creating a certain fear, a certain anxiety in the minds of the children, which was being transferred to the parents and was manifesting itself in an antagonism towards the Irish language. The Minister has removed that and it is the compensation which presumably he feels he is offering.  As far as I am concerned&mdash;I have no doubt about this&mdash;within a year or two, as a result of what is occurring this year, there will be far greater antagonism towards the Irish language than ever existed because of what was called compulsory Irish.  That antagonism will arise because we are introducing a system of inequality which, on the figures supplied by the Minister to me, and which are no record in the Official Report, amply demonstrate that there is a decided advantage for children who have the good fortune either to live in the Gaeltacht or to attend an all-Irish school.  I hope that while the proposal is still young the Minister will have a second look at it. I am sure he and his officials have the ability and the desire to introduce some other scheme which will be acceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must say I fail to understand even at this point what the Deputy has in mind in relation to his approach to this matter, or what he hopes to achieve.  I would have thought that in regard to his statements in the House in the past he would have been among the first to advocate every reasonable inducement to pupils in the non-Gaeltacht areas to study Irish to a high level and to acquire a mastery of the language.  If all past utterances in regard to the importance of Irish mean anything&mdash;as far as I am concerned they do&mdash;then, equating higher grades in Irish as equivalent to higher grades in two subjects for higher education grants purposes is a very logical move. If in doing this we benefit a higher proportion of pupils from the Gaeltacht as against the non-Gaeltacht areas, we are simply dealing equitably with children from areas where the language is being kept alive, notwithstanding all the forces operating against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time we should never lose sight of the fact that these Gaeltacht children, from the examination point of view, are at a disadvantage when it comes to English.</P>
      <P>As I say, the more I analyse the Deputy's approach, the more I am mystified, but dealing purely with figures, we have the situation, as the Deputy mentioned, where 324 pupils got Grade C or higher in the higher level paper in Irish in the case of Gaeltacht schools, whereas the comparable figure for schools in the rest of the State was 5,506.  This latter figure was a commendable one when it is considered that no special inducement was offered.  That is an understatement, but with the inducement now offered, I am satisfied that not only will this figure be substantially increased but there will be a large growth in the number of pupils seeking to achieve higher grades in Irish, and surely any Deputy who has an interest in Irish, as have Deputy Tunney and many other Deputies, must welcome this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> But if one examines the figures for those who took the higher level papers in the 1972 leaving certificate Irish examination, an interesting picture emerges.  Of the 7,482 pupils who took the higher level examination, 5,530 or 70.5 per cent obtained Grade C or higher; from schools in the Gaeltacht areas, 375 took higher level, of whom 324 or 86.4 per cent obtained Grade C or higher; and from all-Irish schools in non-Gaeltacht areas, 941 took higher level, of whom 788 or 83.7 per cent obtained Grade C or higher.  This shows that there is little difference in results as between Gaeltacht pupils and non-Gaeltacht all-Irish school pupils at this level and also that the general standard at this level is very high. These figures demonstrate that so far as pupils who take higher level papers in Irish in general are concerned, no serious disadvantage arises in the case of pupils outside the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Unless my memory is playing tricks with me, I can clearly recollect the Deputy in this House expressing&mdash;and he has done so again tonight&mdash;doubts about the wisdom of the policy of compulsion adopted by the previous Government.  I suggest that the courage of his convictions should impel him to welcome the policy of non-compulsion <Col N="1188" /> being followed by the present Government and the supplanting of compulsion by tangible inducements. One thing above all others that has heartened me in relation to the announcements I made was the degree of acceptance it received from various organisations operating on behalf of the Irish language.  It would, I suppose, be too much to expect that even at this stage we could remove it from the realm of party politics, but at least let us not question one and others sincerity or bona fides in this matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to express my gratitude to the Deputy who on Thursday last, to facilitate me, agreed to the adjournment of his question until this evening.  I want to thank him very much for that.  May I say in relation to his statement on Thursday of last week when I was accused of arrogance that&mdash;and I think he realises this&mdash;there was no question of arrogance, any more than there was a question of arrogance when the tens and twenties of Ministers before me answered questions from Deputies of the Opposition in the form of tabular statements.  I hope he will accept that statement.</P>

      <P>Special inquiries have been made from the British Department of Health and Social Security and it is understood that the majority of claims which became the liability of that Department from the 1st April, 1973, when the European Community's Social Security Regulations became applicable in this country, have been paid without delay on receipt of the appropriate claim forms and medical certificates.  Because of some differences in the qualifying conditions under the sickness benefit schemes of both countries it may have been necessary for the British authorities to make inquiries about certain claims and this may have given rise to delay <Col N="1031" /> in some cases.  If the Deputy has any particular cases in mind I will be glad to have further inquiries made on receiving the details from him.</P>
