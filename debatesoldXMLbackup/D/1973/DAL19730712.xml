      <P>This is a motion of concurrence in the setting up of a Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>The First and Second Stages of the Bill have been agreed to by the Seanad. On completion of the Second Stage the Seanad passed the resolution set out on the Order Paper with a view to having a Joint Committee appointed to consider the Bill.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House seeks the concurrence of the Dáil in the Seanad Resolution and, if it is agreed to, the Seanad will be notified accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad will then make an Order appointing a Select Committee and later the Dáil will be asked to make a <Col N="790" /> similar order.  The two Select Committees thus appointed will be joined and will form the Joint Committee to consider the Bill.</P>
    <P>The members of the Joint Committee are nominated by the Joint Committee on Standing Orders (Private Business) which will make its report to each House.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Joint Committee to consider the Bill is appointed by the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad jointly.</P>
    <P>In due course the Joint Committee will consider the Bill, and on its issuing a report the Bill will be considered by the Seanad and Dáil in turn on Report and Fifth Stages.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the House that the All-Party Committee originally formed to contribute to a peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland situation, is, with the agreement of the three main parties, being reconstituted and reconvened.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference are as follows:</P>
      <P>With a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland situation, it has been agreed to set up an inter-Party Committee to establish the common ground between the Parties represented on the Committee on the constitutional, legal, economic, cultural, social and other relevant steps required to bring about lasting reconciliation of all the people of Ireland so that conditions may be created conducive to a united Ireland; and, if thought appropriate, to make recommendations.</P>

However, this is no significant change in the structure or the purpose of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is envisaged that the proposed measure will be a temporary one.  This section provides that the Act will come into operation. It just sets out the temporary nature of the Act.  It is my intention to introduce the Bill forthwith, unless there is a change in the situation, as I mentioned on First Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section makes reference to &ldquo;national agreements&rdquo;, in the plural.  This looks like retrospection. It is not &ldquo;national agreement&rdquo; or any particular agreement, it is in the plural.  The Minister could, if he was dissatisfied with the past, take action under this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (a), to delete lines 39 to 44 and substitute the following: &ldquo;prohibit the payment by those banks, on or after a date not earlier than the commencement of the order, of the increases aforesaid and the implementing or continued implementing by those banks, on or after a date not earlier than the commencement of the order, of the amendments or variations aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is just a drafting amendment.  In this section the draftsmen considered that to make it absolutely clear they wished to add this amendment.  It is to prohibit the payment by those banks, on or after a date not earlier than the commencement of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask if this amendment is designed to meet the point that was raised from this side of the House on the Second Stage to the effect that it appeared that sections 3 and 4 were, on their face, retrospective although the Minister said that it was not intended to apply them retrospectively.  I understood the Minister to say, on the Second Stage, that he would consider this matter and introduce amendments.  On the face of it, it would appear that this amendment is designed to meet the point that was made.  If it is, it seems that the effect of this amendment would be that although the Bill would apply to agreements negotiated prior to the passing of the Act that there would not be any prohibition of payment which might have been made on foot of an agreement in contravention of the national agreement until the Minister makes an order.  No matter what the terms of a prior agreement the <Col N="796" /> effect of this would be that the Minister could not prohibit payment on foot of it prior to the date of the order.  Am I interpreting the amendment correctly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the problem raised by the Deputy during the Second Reading on the retrospective element is not what the draftsman is aiming at.  This is not the situation being met by the draftsman here.  When we come to the section which deals with the retrospective element I will explain the matter more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not the purpose of the amendment what is its purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem was that the draftsman felt that perhaps in a current situation payment had been made prior to a certain date it would be possible to argue that it was not covered by legislation.  That is the exact situation that this is meant to meet but it does not refer to retrospection. The general problem of retrospection referred to by the Deputy in the Second Stage Reading is not covered in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to convey that the object of this amendment was to deal with the case where payments had been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is correct, and my interpretation of the amendment is correct, what the amendment is saying that even though in the current situation a payment might have been made before the passing of the Act the Minister is specifically taking away from himself power to interfere with that.  He is saying that he cannot deal with anything that occurred earlier than the commencement of the order. Let me take a hypothetical case: if an agreement was concluded today before the Bill goes to the Seanad, and if <Col N="797" /> payments were made today, and the Minister was to make an order from tomorrow, he could only operate from tomorrow rather than today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely anxious to feel that my powers, in so far as possible, are circumscribed in this legislation.  I have no desire to have wide powers in this area at all. I have stressed from the very start that the legislation is aimed at correcting a problem which has arisen in current negotiations.  Therefore, in this legislation I am anxious to curtail any excessive powers that may be given me.  I do not wish to have these powers and I am limiting myself to the narrowest compass of action that I regard as necessary in the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that this is a delicate situation and I do not want to probe too deeply.  I should like to ask the Minister is there any element of constitutionality or legal necessity involved in this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, as I understand it, is to take any doubt of retrospection out of section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as I have explained, the element of retrospection is in the next section and I will discuss it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To be quite honest, I am not too clear, from the Minister's explanation, what the amendment <Col N="798" /> does.  On reading the Bill, I was of the opinion that it circumscribed the area in which the Minister was permitted to take action and the definition section, which we have just passed, refers to the two past national agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is worrying about retrospection, section 4 (d) covers this area, I think, and, when we come to that, I will discuss the question of retrospection with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does appear to have all the provisions necessary for retrospection; the definition section refers to national agreements and says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the National Agreements&rdquo; mean the Employer-Labour Conference National Agreement made on the 21st day of December, 1970, and the Employer/Labour Conference National Agreement made on the 31st day of July, 1972;</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;national agreements&rdquo; occur.  We have passed that section. However, we have no objection to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that all the action contemplated here is the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I have made it quite clear that I have bound myself; I have said this does not relate to agreements made in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>This is an important section from the point of view of any curb the Minister may put on the banks in relation to agreements.

      <P>This gives me power to impose a stay for six months pending clearance by the Labour Court.  It is designed to meet the situation referred to by Deputy Brennan about having a listening post in College Green or somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it quite meets the Minister's difficulty or the <Col N="801" /> points raised by Deputy Brennan.  All this will enable the Minister to do is to make an order which will, in effect, hold remuneration at the level at which it was at the date of the making of the order pending a Labour Court investigation and report and the procedure that would follow from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the point raised by Deputy Brennan, and this is not a hypothetical matter because we are speaking from some experience, an agreement could be concluded without the Minister's knowledge.  It is less likely, I know, that actual payments would have been made on foot of it, but it could be argued that the level of remuneration of employees on foot of the agreement concluded without the Minister's knowledge was X and the current level is Y, the new level.  As I understand it, the Minister's intention would be to hold the remuneration at X pending the Labour Court investigation.  Under subsection (2) (a) it seems to me all the Minister could do would be to hold the remuneration at the level at which it is when he makes the order and this makes the question of notification to the Minister much more crucial.  The purpose the Minister has in mind may not be possible by the making of a stay order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have, possibly as a result of experience, a poor estimate of bankers' morality. I have been anxious not to arm myself with any excessive retrospective powers of legislation.  At the same time, as in the last amendment, I was anxious to see&mdash;and I discussed this with the draftsman&mdash;that we had the minimum retrospection that would be necessary related to the present settlement and negotiation.  That is why we had the previous amendment.  I do not think what the Deputy suggests is realistically possible.  It is a way-out possibility I suppose, but I do not think we will see a situation in which the banking authorities will take the course he suggests.  This will be the law as soon as we pass this Bill, and they would be <Col N="802" /> in breach and would be subject to the rather heavy penalties envisaged later on in this legislation, heavy penalties even in bankers' language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister has got the point which I am trying to make.  Maybe I have not made it very clearly.  It is this.  Bankers would not be subject to any penalty if, in fact, they had concluded an agreement and the Minister made an order. They could conform to the order at the level at which the new agreement provided for it.  They would not be committing any breach of this Act and would not, therefore, be liable to any penalty.  I understand that the Minister's anxiety is to make it clear that he wishes in this Bill to deal only with the current situation.</P>
      <P>When I refer to experience the Minister will recall that on Second Stage I referred to the conclusion of what I might call the first agreement in this saga between the banks and the IBOA. Speaking from recollection I said that it could, perhaps, be said that that agreement was concluded in secrecy. There is no doubt at all that it was concluded without the Department of Labour or any other official organ being aware of what was happening until it was too late.  That being so, it is not unreasonable or hypothetical to raise the point at this stage when we are dealing with the same parties.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that it would appear under subsection (2) (a) of section 3 that it could happen that an agreement would be concluded to provide for a higher level of remuneration than at present, a level of remuneration which could well be in breach of the national agreement, and that the Minister would find himself in the position that he would be making an order which would, in effect, be holding remuneration at the new level and not at the old level which, presumably, is the purpose.  If I am wrong in that, that is all right, but if I am not I would suggest that the Minister should give even more serious consideration to the suggestions made from this side about obliging the parties to inform him of an agreement before it operates.</P>

      <P>Section 9 might help the Deputies because under certain other Acts our authorised officers have certain powers of entry, examination of documents, and so on.  This might meet the legitimate points raised by the Deputies opposite arising from their experience of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of being able or unable to ascertain when something is happening between the banks and the IBOA, would it not have been better to make this a more positive section which would require all agreements to be submitted to the Labour Court?  The Minister has power under section 24 of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act to submit any agreement to the Labour Court. This does not do much more than what is already in the 1946 Industrial Relations Act.  It would be a positive section if it provided that all agreements negotiated by the banks should be submitted to the Labour Court.  I take it that the Minister's reassurance on the question of retrospection means that if the banks complete an agreement today he can do nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this with draftsmen to ensure that in the current negotiations we have the power of dealing with retrospection within the current negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with people with whom Deputy Colley and I had to deal and he is depending a lot on their being a reliable body.  We were slightly disappointed on that score.  We asked them specifically not to do something and they actually did it.  We are dealing here with one of the most astute negotiators in the game.  I am sure the Minister found it as distasteful as I did to have to take any action.  It was only because we did not find that element of responsibility which one would expect in the higher echelons of industrial activity if one might put it that way&mdash;they regard themselves as being in that category&mdash;that we took action in the hope that it would not be necessary to implement it.  Since the Minister <Col N="804" /> has taken action, the machinery with which he is arming himself is not adequate to deal with the situation. There are ample escape routes in this legislation.  One of the weak points is that negotiations may take place and a new agreement may be implemented and the Minister cannot penalise anybody for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan says from his experience that this is undoubtedly a difficult problem to deal with.  In effect, I believe we have sufficient powers to deal with that situation even if there was the lack of good faith to which the Deputy refers: the powers of the stay on the conditions at any particular time, the on or after retrospective provisions relating to the present negotiations.  Take that in the context of section 9, which we will be discussing later, which gives us power of examination of documents and we have what adds up to authentic information on the state of wages at any particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In supplement to what Deputy Brennan has said, I agree with his comment but would qualify it by saying that our view of what may be a display of responsibility may not coincide with those of the parties concerned. It would be legitimate in one sense for negotiators, for instance on behalf of the bank employees, to say that they are showing a sense of responsibility if they achieve the best deal they can for their members.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I would not wish anything that was said to give the impression that we believe that the parties involved would willingly break the law.  The point we are trying to make is that they may well succeed in doing what the Minister is trying to prevent them from doing without breaking the law.  For that reason I should like to pursue the matter further.  Subsection (2) (a), lines 38/41, reads: &ldquo;...the Minister may by order under this section prohibit the payment ... of increases of the remuneration...&rdquo; Deputy Brennan points out that this has now been amended but I think the point still applies.  The amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> ... prohibit the payment by those banks on or after a date not earlier than the commencement of the order, of the increases aforesaid...</P>
    <P>My reading of this subsection at the moment is that the Minister may not prohibit the payment of a level of remuneration which is in operation at the commencement of the order.  I would like the Minister to tell me is that correct, that he cannot prohibit payment of remuneration which, in fact, is in operation at the commencement of the order and, secondly, is it possible, under any provision of this Bill, for the Minister to have the commencement of the order made retrospective or does the commencement of the order date from the making of the order?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy, at the very start of that section we state:</P>
      <P>Where any banks, whether before, on or after the commencement of this Act, pay or agree to pay increases of remuneration to any of their employees or amend or vary or agree to amend or vary any other terms or conditions of employment of any of their employees...</P>
      <P>That appears to me amply to cover the possibilities raised by the Deputy of payments today, yesterday or this week, in relation to the current dispute. As I said from the start, I have been reluctant to give myself excessive powers that would relate to settlements of the past few years in the banks.  That has not been my concern. What is past is past.  I repeat, it is in relation to the current negotiations that I have been anxious to see that they accord with the national agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this with the Parliamentary draftsmen to see that the legislation we would carry would not be weakened by its inability to cover any stages in the present negotiations. We think we have armed ourselves sufficiently in this area with legislative power.  We have discussed it with the draftsmen.  They have agreed with our interpretation of it.  But, if the Deputies are still uneasy that I do <Col N="806" /> not have sufficient power here, I will discuss it further with the draftsmen during this Committee Stage or will have discussions take place and on Report Stage will come back to this point again.  I think I have sufficient power but if the Deputies can persuade me at this stage that I do not have, I will be ready to meet them.  I think I have ample power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to clarify the position, am I right in thinking that, as the Minister sees it, the power he has is to prohibit the payment of any increases even though they might have operated before he makes the order, the only limitation being that the prohibition cannot date from earlier than the order?  In other words, they might be receiving increases but those increases will have to stop and they will revert to their previous level of remuneration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be a series of transactions.  As the Deputy knows, this Bill gives us ample power to deal with series of transactions in the present negotiations.  I think that is covered in:</P>
      <P>whether before, on or after the commencement of this Act.</P>
      <P>I have ample powers of inquiry and information through section 9 under which an authorised officer may enter in and find what the current rates are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that he would be prepared to consider tightening it.  If he is satisfied that the Bill when enacted will give him the power necessary to do what it sets out to do, that will satisfy us. Apart from the Minister's assurance that he will not go beyond what is happening currently, I have doubts whether that is made clear here.  If he has sufficiently strengthened the legislation to ensure that it will not be retrospective or that any question of retrospective that was implied is removed, then I would say that he may also have removed the power to take any action in relation to an agreement which may be negotiated before the Bill becomes an Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that we accept what the Minister says, that he intends to operate the powers given here only in relation to the current situation and not to what we call the previous two agreements. We certainly accept that.  I cannot appreciate that there are enormous drafting difficulties involved if one wants to set that out, say, in section 3 but I think one would have to start from scratch and approach it on a completely different basis.</P>
      <P>The only point I want to make is that whatever may be the Minister's intentions and whatever he may do, the fact remains that on the face of it section 3 would allow the Minister, if he so wished, to deal with the previous situations.  Section (c) is so drafted that he could do so, the only limitation on him being that introduced by the amendment which would mean that he could not reduce remuneration retrospectively: he could only do so from the date of the commencement of the order.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that on the face of it section 3 would enable the Minister to deal with the previous agreements.  We accept that he does not intend to do so for his own reasons and that he is satisfied that he has powers under section 3 to deal with the current situation.  We accept that.  If he is satisfied, then it is not for us to push him any further in it but I do want to place it on record that our view is, whatever the Minister's intentions may be, that section 3 is so drafted that it would enable the Minister or another Minister for Labour to deal with the previous agreements if he chose to do so.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;National Agreement&rdquo; is defined as that made on the 21st day of December, 1970, and the agreement made on the 31st July, 1972.  I think it is explicit that if the Minister, or some other Minister, as Deputy Colley has said, wishes, he can.</P>

      <P>I understand what the Minister has in mind and I sympathise with the views he has expressed. As he is aware, the report from the Labour Court in a case such as this could embody certain specific recommendations in regard to terms of remuneration but with regard to certain conditions of employment the Court might recommend further consideration of these matters in some other forum or with certain guidance that might be brought in.  The effect would be to delay for some period a decision on certain aspects of the agreement the Labour Court were examining.  If that happened, would the terms of this amendment make it difficult for the Minister to make a report?  If the <Col N="810" /> Labour Court said it was necessary to do something else before a decision might be made on a particular point, would the Minister find himself in a position that he could not make an order which accorded with the report of the Labour Court?  I wonder if there should not be another word in this amendment?  I am sure the Minister will appreciate I am just thinking on my feet at the moment because we have had this at short notice.  I wonder if the following might not meet the situation: &ldquo;It shall accord with the relevant terms of any report or recommendation of the Labour Court in so far as this is possible&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised a real problem.  When I spoke to the draftsman about this matter, I asked him to incorporate the phrase &ldquo;shall accord&rdquo;.  The Deputy has rightly pointed out that the recommendation could include disparate elements difficult to put into form. However, the advice I had when I raised this matter was that the phrase &ldquo;relevant terms&rdquo; would appear to cover us in that eventuality.  It is the opinion of the draftsman that the phrase &ldquo;shall accord with the relevant terms&rdquo; will have the effect the Deputy is anxious to achieve.</P>

      <P>Although I am not an expert in draftsmanship, I think section 4 is superfluous and is a duplication of section 3.  One or other of these sections could be taken out of the Act and it would not materially affect the legislation.  They both tend to do the same thing except that section 4 has not the reference to the Labour Court that is contained in section 3.  Section 3 also contains other provisions, but I am sure the draftsman had his reasons.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides that where (a) any banks whether before, on or after the commencement of the Act <Col N="811" /> pay or agree to pay increases in remuneration or improve or agree to improve any other conditions of employment of their employees and (b) the Labour Court determines in a report furnished to the Minister that the increases or improvements are at variance with the provisions or purposes of the National Agreements or this Act, the Minister may by order determine the remuneration etc. in respect of the period to which the order relates.  The Minister may also prohibit the payment of increases in remuneration, etc. in excess of those determined.</P>

      <P>Once again, I must inform the Deputy I regard this as purely a temporary piece of legislation. When the need for it disappears, I shall be the first to rescind this measure and ask for permission to do so.  I hope this legislation will not remain for long on the Statute Book and that it will become an unhappy memory.  I do not welcome any such legislation being introduced.  However, as I am sure Deputies opposite will agree, there is a need for it in regard to the present situation and it is to meet that unique set of circumstances that the legislation is necessary.  I emphasise that the retrospection sought here and in the previous section relates solely to the series of transactions involved in the present negotiations between the banks and their employees.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Second Reading debate on Tuesday I stated that the legislation prepared by the previous Government contained provision for imposing penalties on the IBOA and employees which could lead to imprisonment.  Deputy Colley took issue with me on this and while I concede that the word &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; did not occur in the text approved by the previous Government, there was provision for fines on workers or trade unions.  Therefore, I was wrong in saying that imprisonment was envisaged in the text of the Bill approved by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that while the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, which was mentioned so frequently by Deputies opposite during the Second Stage debate, did not make provision for imprisonment of workers, it contained provisions for fines.  These fines were directed against the unions. Unhappily what happened on that <Col N="813" /> occasion was that trade unionists found themselves in jail.  It will be seen, therefore, that while that Bill contained no reference to imprisonment, it resulted in workers going to jail.  That is why, in relation to the present Bill, while it was necessary to intervene legislatively, I considered that it would be both undesirable and ineffective that any fines or penalties be directed against the bank officials or their organisation. Therefore, we are not proposing any penalties for workers or trade unions either by way of fines, seizure of property or otherwise in this Bill.  This is the difference that I wish to emphasise and I withdraw the suggestion that there was a reference to imprisonment in the original Bill.  In drafting the present Bill it was my wish to avoid any possibility of any trade unionist or worker being penalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the original Bill, I recollect distinctly considering at the time the position the banks would be in if penalties were directed against them only.  I take it that in bringing in legislation of this nature, the first consideration is that it be effective, otherwise, there is only a pretence at doing something that would not be effective.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Reading, the banks will now find themselves in a situation whereby they face negotiations with the IBOA and will be forced to concede certain changes in pay and conditions.  If they do not agree to such changes they face industrial action in the form of a strike whereas if they agree to the changes, they may find themselves in breach of the national agreement and, consequently, subject to penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interest of rendering this Bill an effective piece of legislation and in ensuring that negotiations would be conducted in a more responsible way by both sides, penalties should be imposable on either side.  It would be a unique situation if the people who carry on the negotiations and who create the conditions were not to be penalised.  I do not think there is any parallel for that in any legislation.  As Deputy Colley has pointed out, these people will negotiate in the belief that <Col N="814" /> what they are doing is right and is not a breach of the national agreement since they are not a party to that agreement and that what they are doing should be nobody's business but their own.</P>
    <P>I hope that nobody on either side of this House would wish to interfere in any arrangements being made between employer and employee regarding conditions and pay so long as any such agreement did not have serious national repercussions in so far as that it could upset the national pay agreement which event could lead to such a serious situation that nobody would benefit.  This is the reason for this extraordinary piece of legislation which is opposed entirely to the ideals and principles of those who regard free collective bargaining as being sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>To have that legislation without the penalty being shared equally is, to my mind, a political ruse and takes from the effectiveness of the Bill.  It is all right to say that the banks are well able to pay these fines and that it may not look too bad even if their people go to jail but the line between the people involved in the negotiations is very thinly drawn.  I cannot see the difference between the people who constitute what is known as the banks's side and those who constitute the official side, which side goes along the line to managerial level.  I do not think there is any parallel for that slender line of demarcation in the whole history of trade unionism.  Here we are taking action that is not to penalise the people concerned but which is to prevent them form doing something that would upset a matter that is of tremendous importance to the whole national economy, namely, the national pay agreement.  It is only fair, and also essential to the effectiveness of the Bill, to ensure that negotiations would be conducted with particular regard as to whether the Labour Court would hold any decision to be in accord with the national agreement.  That can be assured by providing that penalties be applied to both sides.</P>
    <P>Regarding the reference to imprisonment, <Col N="815" /> what is to happen if proceedings are taken against any corporate or incorporate body or individual acting in the name of any such body specified in the Act?  The Bill provides for the seizure and the sale of property.  If the person involved barricades his door, what happens? Is he not taken off to jail?  Is that not the natural sequence of events in the ordinary process of the law?  That is nothing more nor less than what happened in the ESB case.  Or do you stop at that?  Do you go back home and say: &ldquo;Sorry, boss, we could not get your goods so you may go.  The buck stops here.&rdquo;  This is something which I should like the Minister to explain fully.  If a person or body refuses to pay a fine and an attempt is made to seize property, if the attempt is resisted does the normal process of the law take its course?  If it does that person or persons may ultimately find themselves in jail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that this section, the heart of this Bill, is a political ruse.  Our experience in industrial relations would suggest that penalties directed against employees or their trade unions are both ineffective and undesirable.  The big difference between our Bill and the Bill of the previous administration is precisely in this area.  There are no penalties directed at the employees' organisation in this Bill.  Deputy Brennan said that both sides are equally guilty.  In my reading of the situation the employer is the person who makes the final decision in relation to any pay claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling on the Second Stage was struck by the misery that might occur for people in the bank.  I assure the Deputy and others that the penalties arising from breaches of the national agreement under this Bill relate only to employers&mdash;the banks, their directors, secretaries, members of committees of management.  The only case in which a bank official might be found guilty of an offence under this Bill would be where he obstructed or impeded an authorised officer under section 9 in the exercise of his powers. Under section 9 the authorised officer <Col N="816" /> would have the power to look at wage and salary records.</P>
    <P>Clearly the purpose then of our legislation is not to prohibit normal industrial action by bank officials.  This legislation is not designed, as was the Electricity Act, to deprive bank employees or any other section of workers of their right to withdraw their labour. That is an absurd objective to have in any legislation.  I am not aware of any legislation that could bring about a situation where you could force any individual or group of individuals to work against the exercise of their own free will.  That was the disastrous culmination of the Electricity Act, that it sought to take on that impossible task. I do not know the answer to that kind of situation.  There is no legislation under the sun that can prevent a man from withdrawing his labour.  Similar provisions allowing authorised officers to come in and look at records are contained in the Industrial Relations Acts of 1946 and 1969.  Officers of the Department of Labour may require the production of wage sheets and so on. It would only be in the case of a person obstructing such an authorised officer in the carrying out of his duties in looking for such records, and it would be only physical obstruction that could lead to legislative action being taken against such a person who was not an employer.  All of the penalties are directed against the employers &mdash;the secretaries, the directors, members of the committees of management. I would emphasise that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we are getting into never-never land largely due to the doctrinal difficulty of the Minister and some of his colleagues to which I referred on a previous occasion.  The first piece of never-never land we get is the Minister's assumption that employers are the only people who should be held responsible for the terms of an agreement which is in breach of the law. What we are talking about here would be, under this Bill, a breach of the law.  He takes the view that the employers are the only people who should be responsible in that regard because they make the final decisions. <Col N="817" /> The Minister knows as well as I do that this is never-never land especially when you are dealing with employers who are wealthy, who are making substantial profits.  Of course, unless there are restrictions on them, they will make a settlement for what is the least cost to them and the least cost to them may well be far above and beyond what is legal under this Bill but it is cheap to them because they avoid a close-down.  Of course, in any negotiations on salary and wage agreements both parties do their best to achieve their own objectives but it is a fact, in relation to the banks, and this is one of the reasons why we have had all the difficulty we have had in recent years, that the power in these negotiations rests with the officials and not with the banks.  That is why we have had all the difficulties. The Minister knows this as well as I do but for doctrinal reasons he comes in here and says blandly that if there is a breach of the law the parties are not equally guilty, that the employer is guilty because he makes the final decision.  I submit that that can only be described as never-never land talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I forget it I want to thank the Minister for his acknowledgment that what I said the last day was correct, that the legislation which the former Government had approved in relation to this situation did not provide for imprisonment.  It did not provide either that people could not withdraw their labour but it did take the view, in the event of a breach of the law by reason of an agreement entered into between the banks and the IBOA, that then both parties to the agreement logically are in breach of the law, not one party.  The Minister cannot seriously hope to convince anyone of the proposition that two parties to an agreement which breaks the law are not equally guilty. It is quite clear that it is a doctrinal difficulty, a mental block or political expediency that is preventing him acknowledging what logic tells him is correct.  He says that is the difference between this Bill and the Bill prepared by the previous Government.  Of course it is because we take the view that if there is to be legislation which <Col N="818" /> in particular circumstances, such as obtain here, lays down what is or is not in breach of the law then the parties to agreements which breach the law are guilty of an offence and should be treated accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister brings us further into never-never land when he provides in subsection (2) (a) as follows:</P>
    <P>A person who is fined upon conviction of an offence under this Act shall not be liable to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine....</P>
    <P>I am as aware as the Minister is of the difficulties that arise here.  To make this Bill effective, which is presumably what the Minister is trying to do or otherwise we are all wasting our time, he should provide for penalties against the banks and, in particular, against the officials' association.  If the officials' association conclude an agreement with the banks in breach of this legislation they will be equally guilty, and should be treated accordingly.  They are not people without substantial resources; they are not as substantial as the banks but, nevertheless, they are substantial and I can see no reason why, if they are parties to an agreement, they should not be equally liable, and their resources equally liable as those of the banks who are equally guilty.</P>
    <P>The point that I am making is that the Minister, having spelled out that a person convicted of an offence would not be liable to imprisonment in default of payment of a fine, went on to provide that the court may, by order, direct the payment of the fine to be secured by the seizure, entry into possession and, where necessary, sale of the property of the person by the appropriate sheriff or county registrar. What does the Minister think is going to happen in cases of this kind?  Is he not aware that there are far more precedents in this country for resistance to sheriffs than there are for workers going to jail for non-payment of fines in relation to industrial relations offences?</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell the House clearly what he thinks will happen if, on foot of this section, a sheriff who <Col N="819" /> goes to seize property, or to enter into possession of a house, is resisted.  There is ample precedent for such a situation. What does the Minister expect will happen then?  As Deputy Brennan asked, will the sheriff go home saying: &ldquo;Sorry, I cannot do anything about it&rdquo;?  Therefore, is complete defiance of the law, and the courts, going to be successful or will the law take its course in the normal way?  Will a person who so resists be dealt with in the normal way by being put in prison?</P>
    <P>There is no declaration by the Minister in subsection (2) such as he has put at the top of it to alter the situation. It does not enable the Minister to run away from the responsibility, unpleasant though it is.  The responsibility of bringing in legislation which will be effective, and will be enforced is the Minister's.  If he does intend to bring in such legislation he should spell out to us what precisely he thinks will happen in the kind of circumstances I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it rather unlikely that the bank directors will engage in the kind of resistance contemplated by Deputy Colley.  Sheriffs do not have a long history of animosity towards bankers and I do not think we are going to see this spirit of resistance grow up amongst bank secretaries and bank directors in the future.  They are law-abiding people and do not have, whatever the public might think in their understandable prejudice at times when they look at their bank balances, any desire to go against the spirit of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley, and Deputy Brennan, mentioned that these fines may not mean a great deal.  However, in any one year that the banks insist on breaking the law and disregarding the legislation passed by the Oireachtas money to the tune of almost £4 million could be exacted by the courts from the bank directors.  This is big money, even in banking terms.  The legislation is directed to add a heavy constraint on the bank managements, ensuring that they do not breach the <Col N="820" /> national agreement in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley spoke of my doctrinal aberration in the kind of legislation I have brought in in this direction. I would put it, perhaps, more charitably by saying that I have addressed myself to a solution of this problem.  I have not lost myself in ideological never-never land.  I have addressed myself to how we get compliance with the terms of the national agreement in the current situation.  As I have explained throughout, it is a temporary piece of legislation, as is this section.</P>
    <P>I understand that the present wage claim of the majority of the bank employees could be met in full under the current national agreement. Naturally, I would endorse any immediate payment to employees whose claims could be met under the agreement. According to the officials' association secretary these claims could be met under the national agreement.  As I approach this section, and other sections, I must ask who would deny that the history of legislative intervention by the Oireachtas over the past few years stretches back to the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, which attempted to make it illegal for work people to withdraw their labour.  I was opposed to that legislation and recently, when talking about it, I described it as being absurd.  I repeat, that was absurd legislation.</P>
    <P>This present statutory instrument which we seek, seeks to make it impossible, or as impossible as we can make it, for the bank directors, the employers in this case, to break the national agreement.  The final and ultimate responsibility for ensuring satisfactory staff relations rests with the management in every industry in our country.  Whether we like it or not, that happens to be the present current situation.  Since I recognise that I believe that legislation must, in the last resort, lean heavily on the managements, on the employers, who may break the agreement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has stated that he feels the employers are equally to blame but I suggest to him that the <Col N="821" /> history of legislation directed against the second negotiating party in a case like this, even where, as in his legislation, the idea of imprisonment was expressly excluded and instead rested on fines and other penalties, should discourage us from any experiments of that kind again.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's party did attempt it in the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act where he imposed fines against the workers in that utility industry.  Though in that legislation he excluded the provision of imprisonment he did, however, impose fines on such workers. The intention of the legislation was to keep workers at work.  The legislation said: &ldquo;You must remain at work and, if you do not, you break the law.&rdquo;  Fines were imposed to compel the workers to remain at work.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will agree that legislation directed against individual workers is both undesirable and ineffective.  My aim is to bring the banking authorities to a true recognition of their obligation both to the people and to the economy and that is why I propose to make it very difficult for them irrespective of how copiously Deputy Dowling may weep about the penalties imposed against bankers.  The penalties have to be large if we are to force management in this very powerful industry into abiding by the terms of the national agreement.  In my desire to be practical <Col N="822" /> I have to make the penalties very large.  I doubt if we will find those in control of the banks coming into conflict with the law we make here. Banking authorities are law-abiding people.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said nothing to convince me in regard to the one-sided effect of the penalties proposed under this measure.  Neither has he answered Deputy Colley's question as to whether people may ultimately find themselves in jail.  He says the banking authorities are responsible people; in other words, they will pay up and not allow things to reach the point at which property might be seized.  In the same breath he says millions could be involved.  If a man knows he will not go to jail I do not see why he should not afford £1 million.</P>

The Minister made a great deal of play about the alleged difference in this legislation as compared with the legislation to deal with the ESB strike. The situation in the case of the ESB was much more serious from the point of the national interest.  It could have crippled the economy.  It could have led to a loss of lives.  The Minister might find himself any day in a similar position with chaos facing industry and he would have to take the same distasteful steps.  In the present situation the proposition is to penalise <Col N="823" /> people for negotiating around the table and reaching an agreement.</P>

      <P>The Fogarty Report said that the bank strike was not as serious as people might think, even from the point of view of the economy.  It was not nearly as serious as an ESB strike, or a bakers' strike which could result in people dying of hunger.  The ESB legislation was absolutely necessary in the national interest and, if the same situation arose tomorrow, it would be necessary all over again.  Nobody will die as a result of a bank strike.  Those involved will find work in Britain and elsewhere.  Their credit will be good.  They will have their cheque books and, when the strike is over, they will get a bonanza by way of agreed overtime to clear off the back-log. The only person to be penalised is the employer, if he gives in, and, if he does not, he will be penalised too.  We all agree that, however distasteful the legislation may be, it must be passed in the national interest if there is no other way of protecting the national agreement, but let us not try to pretend it is something nice while the ESB legislation was something ugly.</P>

      <P>There is a difference. It is, of course, the employers who must take the ultimate responsibility. The object here is to make it impossible for the employer involved to breach the national agreement. I have no reason, as I said, before, to believe the bank authorities will break the law.  They have a record as law-abiding people and I am sure they will obey both the spirit and the letter of any legislation passed here.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the bank authorities.  They obey the law.  If they break the ordinary laws of the land then, like all other people, they will be in breach of the <Col N="824" /> ordinary laws of the land and the courts will have to deal with them.  I do not regard that as realistic or even remotely possible.  I believe that the bank authorities will obey any legislation we have here in common with any other citizen.</P>
      <P>We do not want to go into the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act.  I do not think we should spend our time scoring points.  In our industrial relations system, whether we like it or not, the management are the people who have to make the final decision.  This legislation is directed towards making it impossible for banking management to breach the national agreement.  It is a temporary measure and, if today or tomorrow, both sides of the current negotiations would meet and agree to pay out the sums of money that could be paid out immediately to the majority of the bank officials&mdash;and I understand that the claims of the majority even in the context of the present negotiations could be satisfied in full in compliance with the national agreement&mdash;this would be a big improvement in the situation.  We have a genuine difference here.  Deputies opposite believe that equal penalties should be applied to both management and employees. I believe that to apply these penalties to the employees or their organisations would be undesirable and ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the Minister I am not convinced that penalties directed against the officials' association in this case would be ineffective. The Minister could be right, but it has not been demonstrated because it has not been tried to my knowledge.  It was the one we intended to try if we had to bring in this legislation.  The principle whereby the Minister claims that, in the event of an agreement being concluded which is in breach of the law, only the employers' side is guilty in law is a proposition which I cannot accept and I doubt that very many people could accept it.  The thinking behind it is based on political expediency and will be seen to be such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad day when you hear a Minister in Dáil Éireann saying, in <Col N="825" /> effect, that he does not believe that certain things will happen&mdash;things which would be extremely embarrassing for him and his colleagues&mdash;because, in effect, he is depending on the respectability and law-abiding attitude of the bankers.  That is no way to approach legislation.  I suggest that the situation may not be quite so cosy and respectable as he anticipates. He seems to think that what would be involved in bringing about a situation where a banker would have to go to jail would be something like physical assault.  Of course it need not involve that at all.  It could be just plain obstruction.  It could be simply the bolting of a door, and nothing else.  I want the Minister to consider this.  If he were a banker&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if he saw legislation like this going through which picked him out and let off scot free the people who had put a gun to his head, and if he could see a way whereby he could avoid the consequences of what he would regard as a most unfair picking out of him, and the creation of a legal offence which was not one in his view, would he not take any chance he could which would probably result in his not having to suffer in any way financially or otherwise.</P>
      <P>If a person looks at this and sees, &ldquo;a person who is fined upon conviction of an offence under this Act shall not be liable to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine...&rdquo; that puts him in a very happy position for a start because, even if he reaches a situation such as the Minister has described where he might become liable to imprisonment because of, say, obstruction of seizure by a sheriff, I would guess that he would rely fairly heavily on that to try to ensure that the court did not send him to jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also knows that, with this kind of situation developing, the Minister will be in chaos if that happens.  The Minister thinks it will not happen because he thinks bankers are respectable and law-abiding.  Bankers are <Col N="826" /> human too.  If they think they are being very seriously discriminated against, as they are in fact in this Bill, even they may be prepared to go a certain distance in order to demonstrate the discrimination being operated against them in this Bill, and to demonstrate to the Minister the ineffectiveness as well as the unfairness of the approach he is adopting under this section.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this will happen.  I cannot say with certainty. But I can say that the Minister cannot say with certainty that it will not happen.  I believe that the whole approach demonstrated by the Minister and the Government in this section is one of&mdash;I think Deputy Brennan, on a previous stage, referred to it as cowardice&mdash;political cowardice and not facing up to the responsibilities of Government.  If you have the responsibility of bringing in this kind of legislation, objectionable as it is, you should accept the responsibility and carry it through, and not pretend you are accepting responsibility and when you look at the fine print find that you are trying to get out from under.</P>
    <P>This is my view of the Minister's and the Government's approach in this legislation, particularly in section 5 which relates to penalties.  The whole approach involved in this section will be ineffective as well as unjust. I warned the Minister on Second Stage that, since the whole object of this legislation is to support the national agreement, it was his duty to ensure, as far as he could, that when he had to bring in this legislation it would be effective.  This section, in my view, demonstrates clearly that the Minister is going through the motions, but is not, by any means, trying to ensure that the legislation will be effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The sheriff is mentioned in one section.  It appears to me that, if the banks decide to pay, the Minister for Labour will run out of sheriffs.  It also appears that the banks are subject to penalties but the people pursuing their claims are not. The Minister indicated that there was <Col N="827" /> no question fo penalising the workers or the trades unions and they are free to withdraw their labour.  I accuse the Minister of endeavouring to create a situation here.</P>
      <P>He understands fully that, where two parties are involved and one is pursuing a claim and is unable to have it met, the next step is industrial action.  The Minister is suggesting to the bank officials' union that they should withdraw their labour, that they still have this course open to them, and thereby create a serious financial crisis.  Is there any reason behind this line of thought?  On the one hand, he has imposed penalties to ensure that the claim is not met and, on the other, he tells the people who are pursuing the claim that they are free to withdraw their labour.  The Minister cannot have it both ways, as Deputy Colley and Deputy Brennan have already stated.  He must look at the situation right across the board.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter.  I do not know if it is aimed at breaking down the financial structures here by inducing people pursuing their claim to withdraw their labour, which they are free to do.</P>
      <P>I hope there is no withdrawal of labour.  I hope the wish of both Deputy Brennan and Deputy Colley will be realised and that the national wage agreement will be maintained. The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He knows well, with his experience in the trade union movement, that when people are pursuing a claim, if the claim is not met, they must resort to industrial action.  He has told them that they are free to do so and perhaps this is the step they will take. I do not know why the Minister has indicated this.  This is a very serious matter.  If the Minister has something in mind, if he is endeavouring to create a bank strike, then he has gone a good way towards doing that this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of section 5 provides for a fine not exceeding £200.  Assuming a man has a bank overdraft and has no property, how does the Minister propose to obtain the £200?  A man can have an overdraft and can <Col N="828" /> have substantial property.  How does the Minister propose to collect the fine?  Is he going to resort to paragraph (b) of section 5 and introduce the battering ram and have the sheriff knocking at the door of every bank manager?</P>
    <P>The introduction of the sheriff here is probably in keeping with the Minister's outlook.  The battering ram and the sheriff have been firmly built into this Bill and a new situation will develop in Irish life.  The Minister should broaden the scope and decide that the situation must be rectified in some way other than by the means he has outlined here.  This section does not do justice.  The Bill is a dirty Bill, as has already been stated.  The Minister should come down to earth.  He is clouding the issue.  This piece of bluff that he has presented will not be effective because of the reasons stated by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Colley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that this section will not be effective.  One could think of a number of possibilities.  One possibility has occurred to me during the course of the discussion.  If tomorrow morning the bankers were to inform the officials that they would agree to the officials' demand on condition that the officials would support the bankers in their action, what would be the position then?  You could have a nation-wide strike on your hands.  The Minister knows that he is using the banks as a stop-gap to prevent violation of the national wage agreement. If the bankers get the support of the officials, is it the bankers who will be imprisoned or will there be a nation-wide strike of all trade unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the Minister's point here. In this legislation he is pleading simultaneously to both parties to be sensible in their negotiations.  There is the possibility that the bankers will plead with the officials that they cannot meet their request even though they want to do so.  They could say: &ldquo;Let us come to an agreement.  We will do it on condition that the officials will support us in our action.&rdquo;  I could see a nation-wide <Col N="829" /> strike in that case of all trade unions. I would like the Minister's views on that.  This is a very dangerous section. It is ineffective.  There are many possibilities arising out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Wyse in his interpretation of section 5.  This is a self-defeating section.  The Minister admitted today for the first time that bank people could go to prison under this Bill.  If he sends a bank official to prison because the official has broken the law in making agreements outside the national wage agreement, I cannot see the bank officials' association standing by and not agitating for the release of that man and protesting in the most vehement way.  The Minister will then find that he has not avoided the trap that he sought to avoid by not penalising the bank clerks but has, in fact, succeeded in uniting the two parties.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the ESB incident a few years ago.  That is not a true analogy.  At that time there was an unofficial strike.  ESB men continued to work and men were sent to prison for not paying the fine imposed for picketing.  Most of the men were still at work but there were some men picketing.  As I stated at that time, I deplore the idea of sending any worker to prison for this type of action.  In this case the Minister has sought not to be accused of sending workers to prison.  I regard the secretary of the bank as a worker.  If the Minister sends him to prison he will unite the parties behind that man and cause a great deal more chaos than now exists with the threat or suggestion of a strike.</P>
      <P>If it is not too late, I would suggest that the Minister should reconsider the section.  Otherwise, there may be a breach of the national wage agreement, a strike, and somebody going to prison.  There was a prolonged bank strike some years ago. If there is a strike brought about as a result of section 5 it will be a much more bitter confrontation and it will do a great deal more damage than the last bank strike did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 provides for <Col N="830" /> a fine not exceeding £10,000.  In other words, it is not a mandatory fine of £10,000.  Suppose, for example, that the banks decide to ignore this Bill. The judge may decide that £10,000 is excessive and he may impose a fine of £100 a day or £200 a day until the position is put right.  The banks might decide that they could afford this.  As far as I can see, the Bill does not do anything.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have stated that if the bank officials decide to go on strike because they cannot get an increase, their argument is with the Government, not with the banks. What the Minister is trying to avoid is a bank strike.  This Bill appears to be a big bluff.  I should like the Minister to explain how he believes it will solve the problem we are facing at the moment in relation to the increases being demanded from the banks by the officials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without unduly labouring the provisions of section 5, I should like to remind the Minister about the one-sided effect of penalties. He may think he is not infringing on the principle of not penalising members of trade unions but to tell the officials that he will penalise their bosses is an indirect, back-door, sinister method of getting at the people concerned.  The Minister might as well have come out openly and told both parties that they would share the responsibility equally if they entered into an agreement and that the Government would impose fines on them either as bodies corporate or as persons acting in the name of corporate bodies.  Nobody would have taken offence if that had been done.  The method adopted by the Minister is a sinister way of attempting to prohibit agreements being freely negotiated and it amounts to the same thing.  It may appear not to breach the high principle of not moving against members of trade unions but it is merely a subtle device that will have the same effect.  I am not opposing the section but I do not think it is the way to do it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his assurance that he will <Col N="831" /> not oppose the section.  In reply to Deputy Wyse, there is no legislation that could prevent people withdrawing their labour.  No such legislation exists and I am not aware of how it could be drawn up.  This legislation is designed to meet, in a practical fashion, the situation that exists between the banks and their employees.  I emphasise that the penalties arising from breaches of the national agreement under this Bill relate only to employers, namely, the banks, their directors, secretaries and members of the committee of management. I do not think the doors in question would succumb to the battering-ram of Deputy Dowling's imagination. I believe that the controllers of our banking system are law-abiding people and that they will obey the law in letter and in spirit when we pass the legislation.  In my assessment of industrial relations, especially in the current situation, I am afraid that the banking management are the people who, in the last resort, decide on the end result of any series of negotiations.  Our legislation is directed against any decision on their part that would breach the national agreement.  I thank Deputy Brennan for his co-operation.</P>

Everything in the Bill hinges on section 5 but everyone must know it is ineffective. I can see the officials rallying around the bankers on this matter and it will cause considerable embarrassment to the Minister if the officials support <Col N="832" /> the banks in violation of the Bill.  I am sorry this has been done now because I think the Minister should have waited to see how negotiations proceeded between the parties concerned.</P>

Is it not the position that in a sense the Minister has brought the Government into a direct battle with members of the Irish Bank Officials' Association?  Will not every employer welcome this kind of protective legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what employers or employees will welcome.  In reply to the Deputy's question, I can do no better than repeat what I said on the Second Stage, namely, that the legislation embodies no general principle of intervention by the Government in free collective bargaining.  It is a temporary measure, designed to meet a unique situation. There are no general lessons in this legislation for employers in general or for employees in general.  It is designed solely to meet a unique set of circumstances known to us for the past three years.  The situation was known to the Opposition when they were in Government and they were preparing to deal with it in legislative form.  An election intervened and now the Government propose to deal with the situation with the distinct difference of approach that we do not propose penalising the employees and their organisation.  That is the only difference between us.  Our course is more practical and is designed to reach a solution.  Our legislation is designed for the purpose of reaching a solution to the present dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that there is no provision in this Bill that in any way would inflict hardship or impose penalties on the workers.  He made a distinction between the workers and the bank managers and specified that no penalties would be imposed on the workers. At the same time, he indicated that these people were free to withdraw <Col N="833" /> their labour and that no penalty would be imposed on them.  Therefore, they would have nothing to lose by going on strike.  The Minister is creating a very serious situation in this regard.  There may be good reasons why the Government want legislation of this type and why they are anxious to tell the bank officials that it will be all right for them to go on strike in pursuance of any claim. The Minister is aware that the logical reaction of any group whose claim would not be met would be to take strike action particularly when they have been given to understand that they have nothing to lose.  As I see it, the Minister is extending an invitation to these officials to take strike action. There may well be very sinister reasons for this attitude on the part of the Minister.  It may be that the banks are causing some embarrassment now.  It may be that the Government wish to nationalise the banks.  Perhaps there are a number of matters uppermost in the minds of Ministers in regard to the banks and that they wish to create a certain situation within the banks, a situation that is one-sided.  From the national point of view it would be undesirable to have any break in the continuity of the banking services. We are all aware of the problems that were created by the last bank strike but it is appalling that the Minister would sow the seeds of the withdrawal of labour in the minds of the other party concerned who are not mentioned in the penalty clause.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Briscoe pointed out so rightly, this is the type of legislation that every employer would wish to have at his disposal.  A precedent is being created by these proposals.  Perhaps we will have more of this sort of thing in the future.  The question of imprisonment is very important.  The Minister admitted this morning that, under this proposed legislation, people could be sent to prison in so far as circumstances could develop as a result of actions that might be taken which would result in their imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving from this important section, I should like <Col N="834" /> to ask the Minister briefly if he has considered whether this legislation will lead to the very necessary improvement of relations in the bank between employer and employee.  We went to considerable trouble to have the situation examined after the last strike.  The terms of reference at the time were not such as to probe into the cause of the strike but to find out what was wrong within the whole structure of industrial relations in the banks.  A long and very well probed report ensued.  This report makes useful reading.  It provides a very interesting background to what can go wrong when huge commercial concerns grow into complexities without having the proper structure built in to meet the rapidly changing conditions.</P>
      <P>The Fogarty Report indicated how improvements would have to be made if the situation was to improve.  When we discussed the matter with the banks, the one thing that impressed me was that the banks considered they were moving towards implementing some of the recommendations of the Fogarty Report.  They also made a claim with regard to productivity, to public amenity and to general improvement and the bank considered that there was rationalisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can develop this matter further on the question &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.  If I were not prevented by the Chair I would like to have indicated in detail that this type of legislation, because of the one-sided nature of the penalties, does nothing to help towards improving relations within the banks. If anything, it has a divisive effect in this regard in that it will leave dogs tied and stones loose.  The only hope that one can have in regard to the Bill is that (1) it may not be necessary to invoke the powers being sought and I would hope that everything possible would be done to ensure that this will be the situation or, (2), that if the powers provided here must be <Col N="835" /> invoked, that they will be invoked only for a very short duration.  Of course, in the event of their not being another national agreement, the Bill would be obsolete.</P>
      <P>In relation to the penalty clause, I would hope this would not have the effect that I can foresee it having, that is, of disrupting further relations that were improving, which needed to improve and which were the cause of all the trouble in the past.  The Fogarty Report showed the weaknesses on each side in the banks dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Some aspects of the penalty clause of this Bill are appalling, apart from the penalties in relation to finance, for instance, in subsection (2) (a) we read that:</P>
      <P>A person who is fined upon conviction of an offence under this Act shall not be liable to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine, but the court by which the person is convicted may by order direct that payment of the fine be secured by the seizure, entry into possession and, where necessary, sale of the property of the person by the appropriate sheriff or county registrar and may by order provide for such subsidiary and ancillary matters as may be necessary to secure such payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheriffs all over the country have now been alerted to meet this new situation. We go a little further and find that the property includes the man's home.  A man's home is no longer safe.  One would have thought that at this stage of our enlightenment people would not enter a man's home either by crowbar or otherwise.  They will raid building societies, friendly societies or other places where a man may have money deposited and his family will suffer as a result.  It is appalling that a man's home is no longer safe, that the sheriff has now been alerted by the Minister for Labour to be ready in the event of the banks deciding to pay.  Badges will be issued to new sheriffs because there will be a substantial number required to meet this situation.  The appalling factor is that the home is no longer safe.  I can <Col N="836" /> see an extension of this, as time goes on, to include other people who want to make payments which are outside agreements.  Their homes will be at risk.  This is a serious situation and one that will not win any admiration for the Minister.  The Minister has now clearly indicated his line of thought, with his sheriffs, his crowbar brigades and the seizure of homes. Perhaps he would give some consideration to leaving out the home of the individual.</P>

      <P>Under this section the typist in the manager's office or anybody concerned with what is regarded as management could have fines or penalties imposed on them. The gist of the case that we have been discussing under section 5 is emphasised by the fact that these personnel are subject to the rigours and penalties being imposed and could very well find themselves more exposed to the likelihood of whatever action might be taken.  When tempers become frayed one can easily visualise rather nasty conflicts taking place between staff and the law.</P>
      <P>This only highlights the fact that only one side is involved in the penalties.  I do not wish to hold up the passage of the Bill.  We do not regard it as our job to help the Minister to make it a better Bill.  It may not be relevant at this stage but there are amendments which could have been produced when the Bill was being prepared and would have made tremendous sense and logic.

      <P>This section, and the following one, have always led to lengthy debates when Bills of this type were being piloted through this House because they involve the appointment of authorised officers to probe into the private affairs of a firm.  In this case banks are involved. Many confidential records are held by banks.  One could talk for days about the wisdom of this action or the calibre of the people to be appointed as authorised officers but I am prepared to accept, having sat in the Minister's seat for so long, and having <Col N="840" /> had to appoint authorised officers in relation to other Bills, that the powers being conferred will not be abused.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be pretentious about this or to act the filibuster but these powers always tread on dangerous ground.  A Minister who appoints authorised officers to probe into the private records of any company, or bank, should see that those powers are not used unnecessarily. There can be trespass on the private affairs of individuals, and in this case on the financial records, by people who are appointed by the Minister.  However, I am prepared to accept that these powers will be used with the utmost caution and only if they are absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>The public would resent very much any abuse of these powers.  In recent years banks have ceased to be the private institutions they were once looked upon.  One cannot hide in the ledgers as they could in the past.  If one wishes to hide money now one has to go to Switzerland or some other country.  Authorised officers with all the powers that must be given them to enable them to encroach on the private affairs of people are an essential part of legislation of this type.  It is not possible to make legislation effective unless such powers are taken.  I am sure the Minister will not hesitate to give the usual assurances today that these powers will not be used except when it is absolutely essential, and then only to the extent that is necessary without probing into the entire privacy of an important institution which holds so much of the public, and individuals, private and confidential records.</P>

We found out earlier that the bank manager or the owners of the bank could go to jail if there was continuity of an offence but, written into the Bill, is immunity from imprisonment where bankers are concerned.  It is not written in for the trade unionists and they are not immune to the same degree.  They would be carrying out the instructions of their employers and, for doing so, they would be liable to imprisonment, but the man who gives the instructions is immune from imprisonment.</P>

It goes on to say that it will be an offence for any person not to comply with these requests of the authorised officers. Surely if the Minister is to be absolutely straight on this matter he must agree that, by the introduction of this Bill and particularly in section 9, Part II, he is extending the scope under which prosecutions can be brought or under which somebody can break the law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all deplore the fact that it was necessary to bring in this Bill in the national interest and as a last resort.  Having gone through this tedious and hateful procedure in my time, I appreciate what was involved here.  As I have already said, the Press endowed the incoming Government with a special kind of genius which I thought might manifest itself in this first trial when negotiations had to take place, but the remedy is as before.  No particular genius is brought to bear on this serious problem. We are faced with ugly legislation which none of us likes but we must admit that it is in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national pay agreement must be protected at all costs because, if it is not, it could lead to a serious situation. We found ourselves in that situation a few times.  As I mentioned already, and I do not want to labour or repeat it, on two other occasions this type of legislation came before the House.  One was the ESB case, where the country was in a serious state.  The other occasion was when we were failing to get any agreement or sanity brought into ever increasing demands.  We brought in the Prices and Incomes Bill.  After long and happy discussions&mdash;which ended on a happy note&mdash;with ICTU representatives, they gave an undertaking to see the first national agreement through and we withdrew that legislation.  It was in the national interest, too, because it sought to do exactly what the national wage agreement did.  I am certain that, if we had not taken steps at that time and brought the legislation <Col N="849" /> to the point of being processed in this House, we would never have got the first national agreement.  I say that in all seriousness because I am convinced that it is true.</P>
    <P>It brought about a very happy situation.  I remember that, on the occasion of our sitting in with Congress representatives, I said we would be accused of a complete about face and they assured us that that should be the least of our worries. Indeed it was.  What we were doing was in the national interest.  We were scourged here for it and by the Press, too, as a weak Government who changed their minds.  After due consultation we got the necessary assurances, and what is more, assurances we felt would be honoured and which were honoured as far as humanly possible.  That was the start of the first national pay agreement.  For that reason we have a special interest in this legislation.  I hope that the little genius in the present Government which has not yet manifested itself may come to the fore and bring about some solution to this problem that will obviate the necessity for this ugly legislation to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The legislation covers banks only.  I do not want to start any hares that have not been already aroused but it might have been left a little bit more open in its scope because there might be others that it could deal with also. The banks are not the only people who are contravening or in breach of the national agreement.  The difficulty here is, when you have free collective bargaining, to know who is in breach of what because it is their private right and privilege to make an agreement, to negotiate it freely between management and employee and to continue it.  Nobody need know.  You depend on the grapevine to find out.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Bill has provided no machinery for knowing what will happen in the banks.  Unless he has a listening post in College Green he must depend on the banks coming to him and saying: &ldquo;We are now going to breach the national agreement.  We are warning you.&rdquo; Perhaps they will but there are, as we <Col N="850" /> know ways and means of finding out these things.  I say with all due respect to the Department of Labour that there was not much going on on the industrial relations front or the pay front that they did not know about.  For that reason I am not making any great bones of the fact that there is no machinery provided in this legislation to ascertain at any particular time whether an agreement is on foot or not.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister with regard to this Bill, which is directed at the banks only, that the Labour Court or some body set up by the Labour Court could, perhaps, have a look at the Fogarty Report and see to what extent any agreement being made is an attempt to bring about the type of relationship and the structures that are recommended and pin-pointed as being necessary in that report.  This would leave the situation in the banks where you would have harmony, good relations, better output and, indeed, greater facility for the public and, generally, an institution of which the State could rightly be proud.</P>
    <P>The commercial banks do an important job.  They are a very important factor in the national economy, not indispensable; in fact, people came from other countries to see how we survived the bank strike for so long. Other countries were interested to know how a country could survive when the commercial banks were on strike.</P>
    <P>The remarkable complexities of our monetary system were underlined by some of the happenings during those strikes.  I knew people who paid their debts and overcame their difficulties and had no money at all, simply by using cheque books.  They were able to carry out deals and to leave the necessary security to clear the cheques when they were presented after six months.  There were many others who went to the wall. It was an interesting study but not a situation which the nation would wish to face again.  Neither the banks nor the IBOA gained by it even though the officials had the privilege of earning very special overtime rates in clearing the huge backlog subsequently.  It was a serious threat to their health and <Col N="851" /> one which no conditions of employment legislation would tolerate.</P>
    <P>I would hope that relations between the banks and their officials could be allowed to improve and that the Minister and the Department, even in enlisting the support of the Labour Court, would do everything possible even at this stage to obviate the necessity to implement this legislation.  Then we will all be happy and everybody will be pleased.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister the task of attempting to do that but commonsense should now prevail and attitudes could change and perhaps certain assurances could be given that to bring about conditions in the banks, as visualised and pin-pointed and recommended in the Fogarty Report, would not be a breach of the national pay agreement but something which everybody would welcome.</P>
    <P>There was an element of productivity in the last agreement.  There was evidence that it was leading to rationalisation which, in the last analysis, would be to the benefit of the banks.  While it would be an improvement to the existing officials, it could mean less employment in the banks in future.  With the huge amalgamations now taking place and the competitiveness that has crept into banking, where you actually have banks advertising, banks indirectly getting into the hire purchase business, the whole complexity of banking has grown far beyond any of the structures that were originally provided to deal with changing circumstances. This is one of the things highlighted in the Fogarty Report.  These things should be kept in mind when we are going out to penalise anybody.</P>
    <P>My final word is that a Bill which leaves the stones loose and the dogs tied is not the proper type of legislation. The bank people now find themselves in the position that if they do not accede to the request of the IBOA they may find themselves faced with industrial action and if they do accede they may find themselves faced with penalties from the Government. That would be an extraordinary situation and I hope it will not arise.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Brennan and the members of the Opposition for their approach to this Bill which, as Deputy Brennan said, attempts to meet the requirements of the national interest in the present case.  Like Deputy Brennan, I would hope that it will not prove necessary to use the powers given to me under this legislation.  I understand that the present wage claim of the majority of bank employees in the present negotiations could be met in full and in compliance with the national agreement and I would recommend to both sides that agreement should be found on the legitimate salary aspirations of the majority of employees and that payments should be made to that majority as soon as possible under the national agreement and that, in relation to the salaries of the minority and that part of their salaries on which there is dispute, this could be further considered and at least put aside from the present area of contention.  However, in the national interest it has been necessary to proceed with the legislation.  I thank Deputies opposite for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement the Minister for Finance said that the Government's aim was to have a new and better Ireland. Obviously, this would be the aim of all Governments, but it is difficult to reconcile this wish with the Finance Bill.  However, there is much confusion regarding some of the benefits proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To illustrate this point I should like to refer to a notice issued by Dublin Corporation to tenants.  A person had been given a waiver of rates by the corporation, had received the benefit of the reduction in the rates because of the removal of the health charges, and he had also received increased social welfare benefits.  Up to recently <Col N="853" /> the man had been paying £2.05 per week but now he must pay £2.63p. Irrespective of the largesse in the budget and the reduced amount of rates the pensioner had to pay an extra 57p per week.  It makes one wonder if the entire system is not out of gear when this situation arises. Irrespective of the Minister's pious hope about making this a better land, the budget has not brought about any changes and it is not likely that the Finance Bill will alter the situation of pensioners.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of wishing the Minister for Industry and Commerce good luck when he meets the members of RGDATA next Wednesday with regard to the price limit order. Although VAT will be removed from food next September it will not mean a reduction in prices.  In this morning's papers members of RGDATA stated that because of existing circumstances they cannot sell certain lines within the limits imposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce even though the association would like to keep down prices.  We cannot be confident that the removal of VAT from food will mean reduced prices.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest that although VAT has been imposed on clothing and fuel, exemption is granted to the horse and greyhound industries.  It may be that those industries are very important to the economy but clothing and footwear are essential items and the increased costs will hit the poorer section of the community.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Finance has his difficulties and I wish to be helpful in my comments.  The Government have said that they will provide 25,000 houses each year.  I hope they achieve their target but I have my doubts about it.  In section 64 the Government make provision for increasing the stamp duty on office block buildings from 10 to 15 per cent.  Some years ago the then Minister imposed 10 per cent stamp duty on office blocks; at the time I thought this was not an entirely desirable tax because the developer will get his percentage by way of increased rents.  It will be the firms or the Government <Col N="854" /> Departments who rent these buildings who will pay the extra amount.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government might consider removing the tax from office blocks provided the owner or the developer guarantees to allow 25 per cent of the area to be used as living accommodation for those in need.  If the Government adopted this suggestion it would provide much-needed living accommodation in central areas. This would be a much better social and financial investment rather than imposing a 15 per cent stamp duty.  It would help towards easing the housing problem and towards achieving the target of 25,000 dwellings per year. Whatever social aims the Government may have, housing must have a high priority.</P>
    <P>VAT is charged on building components at a rate which works out at approximately 3 per cent.  If the Government are prepared to give exemption to the industries dealing with greyhounds and horses, they might consider giving the same exemption to building components.  The cost of these items is aggravating the present housing situation.  I am sure most Deputies would agree that this matter should be examined.  Homes for people must come before horse-boxes for horses or kennels for greyhounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the question of VAT in the context of the building industry in order to see whether its removal from this industry would help towards the achievement of the Government's target of 25,000 houses per year.  Apart from the question of finance, the Government will have great difficulty in achieving that target but it would be my wish that they would achieve it during the next year.  Certainly, they will have the support of this side of the House in their efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his brief that the budget was designed to lift the growth rate appreciably and to help reduce the level of unemployment.  I do not think the Finance Bill will have that effect.  There are inflationary tendencies inherent in this Bill.  Of course, it is much more difficult to solve the problem of unemployment <Col N="855" /> or any other problem, for that matter, in an inflationary situation rather than in a deflationary one.  However, I have read that some economist holds the opposite view and says that inflation can help in some cases but he did not go to any great lengths to explain the reasons for his assertion.</P>
    <P>I admit that the social welfare aspects of the Bill are good.  Let us not forget, though, that for many years budgets produced by Fianna Fáil Governments provided also for increased social welfare benefits.  It was part of the social thinking in all our budgets that we help further those people who were most in need.  Because of the way in which price increases are eroding the extra benefits being paid, it may be necessary in the autumn to consider the position of those people in our community who are dependent on social welfare benefits. The case I cited last night of an old age pensioner being allowed a rates waiver but having to pay an extra 57 pence per week in rent is an indication of what can happen as a result of any increases being given in payments.</P>
    <P>We are glad to note that some help is being given to the parents of thalidomide children in so far as any money that may be paid by the German firm concerned will not be taxable.  I hope the Minister will go further in this respect and will ensure that any seriously handicapped child would have an adequate income for the remainder of his life.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the position in relation to illegitimate children who inherit property.  About a year ago a case was brought to my notice of an illegitimate child who had been left property by her mother but she found that in her case the amount of stamp duty payable was much greater than would have been the case in respect of a legitimate child.  The then Minister made some change in this regard but this did not go the full way to meeting the problem. This is another area that the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>I note that in section 19 there is provision for tax remission in respect <Col N="856" /> of contributions to certain charities. Am I right in thinking that these charities are only those set out by the UN and by the Council of Europe so that, perhaps, if a person in this country wishes to donate money to a charity, he would not be entitled to any tax remission on any such donation?</P>

      <P>Charities would benefit greatly if tax remission were given to donors.  In section 19, also, it is proposed to give remission to persons who donate money to universities for such purposes as industrial relations. That is welcome because the field of industrial relations is a very important one.  I hope the Minister will expand in this area in his next budget.</P>
      <P>I fault the Minister for not giving any concession to working widows. There are thousands of widows who find it necessary to go to work so that they can rear their families but there are also many others who, after their families have grown up and left home, find it necessary to earn their own living.  These people should be given every possible concession in so far as taxation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax concessions, too, should be greater in respect of single persons who maintain aged parents.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I have raised.  Perhaps he would table <Col N="857" /> some amendments along the lines suggested.  I am sure they would meet with general acceptance in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister and I will have a quiet half-hour at the end of which I will have succeeded in convincing him on a matter to which I have already referred in parliamentary questions, that I will have extracted from the Minister some sympathy in respect of the wage-earner whose net income is in excess of £2,500 and that, even at this late stage, an effort will be made to correct the injustice which I consider this Finance Bill proposes in respect of quite a considerable number of people.  The figure which the Minister's office has given to me is 40,000.  I accept that they may not all be married but I think it is in order to accept that in the country there are at the moment 40,000 wage-earners who, because of the fact that their net income can be shown to be in excess of £2,500, are not going to get the increases which other families will get in respect of children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of children's allowances in this and other countries was welcomed.  To help indicate the injustice which I think is proposed we can take the case of two civil servants earning an annual salary of £3,000 gross.  There are many such people in the country.  Civil servant A has two children but, maybe in anticipation of what has happened in respect of children's allowances, he has invested in a house which exceeds considerably his housing requirements but which he realises has an appreciating value and which is a worthwhile investment to him.  To do this, he has got accommodation from a bank and he is paying £300 or £400 interest.  In his income tax returns he is entitled to have that waived and in respect of what has been called a net income he is getting an allowance for that amount by that means and by additional borrowing, necessary not to keep his wife and two children but because of the investment and because of the speculation in which he has indulged, all of which bring his net income below the figure of £2,500. <Col N="858" /> Under the proposals in this Finance Bill that gentleman is entitled to receive the additional children's allowance in respect of the two children.</P>
    <P>Let us take civil servant B on the same gross salary of £3,000.  He is not a speculator, cannot afford to be, but believes in paying his way.  He is a thrifty man.  He invested in a house, sufficient to satisfy his housing needs. Civil servant B has six children but because of the fact that his attitude and his philosophy and his idea about economics consist of paying for everything he requires as he goes along, because of the fact that his idea does not allow him to enter the field of speculation, he does not owe the bank £400 a year in respect of interest.  He cannot gain credit for it in his income tax returns and, accordingly, when all the appropriate deductions have been made his net income is £2,510.  Notwithstanding the fact that that man has six children, notwithstanding the fact that he is a more useful member of society in that he believes in paying his way, under this Finance Bill he is being denied children's allowance.</P>
    <P>That is indefensible.  When the Minister is replying I would be happy if he could dispel my fears, but I am afraid he will confirm them.  Lest there be any doubt I would ask him to clarify the position.  If and when he does so, I shall then endeavour to table a suitable amendment to this Bill so that the true spirit of children's allowance will obtain, so that the thrifty man will not be penalised, and so that we will not have a situation where we are encouraging people to do as civil servant A did.  I am sure that already some wise people have done so; and I would say to them that, unless the Minister can come up with something better, they should do it.  They should go to the bank, mortgage their house, get credit in their income tax return for the repayments and then they will qualify for the children's allowances. The house need not be required for ordinary housing accommodation but may be used as an investment.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Government should encourage that situation and I hope that the Minister will accept, in <Col N="859" /> respect of the 40,000 people who are being deprived of the children's allowances to which I believe they are entitled, that an amendment should be made at a later stage.  I know the Minister will ask if I am advocating that anybody with a net income of £20,000 per year should be paid the children's allowances.  I am not making that case. If the Minister were to say that there are 200 people whose net income is in excess of £15,000 and asked me if I agreed that they should not be given children's allowances my reply would be that they should not.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are approximately 30,000 people whose net income is between £2,500 and £3,000. These people are not the recipients of any form of assistance from any State agency.  They have commitments in the matter of housing, education and maintaining a certain standard of living and I do not think that our legislation should be critical of the efforts they are making.  I do not think legislation should dull the edge of their husbandry and force, or encourage them into a situation where they realise that there is more respect, and consideration, from the present Government for those who have wilfully put themselves into debt than those who are endeavouring to pay their way.</P>
    <P>I assume that any Minister, when he has made a decision, will be reluctant to depart from it.  On the other hand, I hope the Minister, if he is convinced that an injustice is being done, will accept a suitable amendment. I hope that he will accept one which will cater for the number of people to whom I have referred and which would show <i>inter alia</i> to the people that we have respect for, and that society generally depends upon those people who practise good husbandry, are thrifty and by their activities generate extra which makes it possible to give a helping hand to the helpless.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue disrespecting the thrifty, if we are to continue indicating to people that the only way they can benefit from concessions <Col N="860" /> which are being granted is to put themselves in debt, we are preparing the way for ultimate disaster.  It may not come immediately, but a continuation of this policy must inevitably lead to the position where we will all be practising indebtedness, where we will all be borrowing.  One does not have to be an expert economist to realise that such a system cannot be sustained or operate effectively.</P>
    <P>In connection with this deprivation which has occurred in the matter of children's allowances in respect of the man whose net income is between £2,500 and £3,000, I venture to say that we are showing a certain amount of disrespect towards that man's wife. It is no harm to repeat that over the years wives have begun to accept that children's allowances are, in one form or another and however insignificant, a recognition by the community of moneys which directly, and correctly, might go to the housewife.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposals, and in respect of the earner whose net income exceeds £2,500, the allowance will go to the wife but must be given back by the husband.  The Minister said in respect of some other provision in the budget that he was anxious to avoid situations where the administration of any concessions or the administration of any scheme which he had would not be excessive.  I hope that he will be able to show us what it will cost to administer this deprivation scheme.  It will be necessary to have civil servants looking at the man's earnings, allowing him a certain amount and disallowing him other sums, ascertaining whether he is in excess of or under the £2,500.  The Minister will have another group of civil servants working on the children's allowance books, preparing and arranging for the payment of the children's allowance to that gentleman's wife.  Another group will be ascertaining whether, in the overall position, the allowance is to be withheld from the husband.</P>
    <P>It would be a very interesting exercise to discover what the total cost of that would be as against a situation in which the allowance should apply all round, again with the exception, <Col N="861" /> as I said, of those people in excess of £10,000 of £15,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, and more generally, in respect of the children's allowances the Minister has said that the allowances apply to everybody, or to practically everybody, and what are we complaining about?  I have shown that they do not apply to at least 40,000 people, 40,000 who would appear admittedly to be reasonably well off and, because of that, I suppose we do not generate the same emotions on their behalf.  But most of these 40,000 are, in my opinion, as poor as other sections which are perhaps more obviously poor.  They are 40,000 whose way of life prevents them from advertising the poverty I know exists.  In some of these homes you have the situation in which the child is going to school, apparently well clad, in an 8 or 10 hp car, but whose lunch does not contain the same nutritional value as does the lunch of many other children who are actually regarded as poor.  I do not think it is right for us to penalise a person who is not making a living out of claiming that he is poor.  Rather, there is an obligation on us to respect the person who has self-respect, who is contributing, who is paying for everything he gets.  Whether it is because of a traditional attitude towards that section of our community, there may not be the same political mileage in it, but that is irrelevant as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are people in the salary bracket to which I referred and, when they have paid for all that is required of them, paid their way in the matter of housing, education and food, there is very little remaining and their standard of living and their way of living is not very pleasant.  Their holidays and their entertainment are not as lavish as these things are in the lower salary brackets, for people who, for one reason or another, perhaps because of the assistance they get from certain areas, seem to enjoy an easier and a better way of life.  I would appeal to the Minister not to make capital against these people by quoting someone in the £10,000 a year bracket.  I <Col N="862" /> have no concern at this level for the person in the £10,000 a year bracket and I am hoping the Minister will not throw that back at me.  I am concerned with the wage earner in the £3,000 a year bracket.  Figures show that these constitute a substantial number.  It is desirable that we should indicate to the Minister that we no longer welcome or respect the contribution he is making.  Rather would we encourage him to pull his coat behind him by the sleeves, to pay for as little as he can get away with paying and to desist from the thrift and good husbandry which has characterised his way of life to date.</P>
    <P>I am now back to where we came in.  When I spoke on the budget a few weeks ago I concluded my remarks in the presence of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government and one or two other Deputies.  I shall avoid ending on the note on which I ended on that occasion but I would, with the permission of the Chair, avail of this opportunity to put on the record the fact that, since my arrival in this House, I have never directly or indirectly referred to any member of any family of any politician in this House and I would hope that on some future occasion the Minister who availed of the opportunity on that occassion to attribute to me remarks I did not make and say that I was in the process of selling my political soul would withdraw those remarks.  The record will show that nowhere in my contribution since I came into this House did I refer to any member of any politician's family.</P>

      <P>The matter came to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights, not just in the original submission but a collection were added subsequently.  What happens more commonly is that complaints are raised and the question is raised of taking them up with the British Government because, indeed, you cannot get to the Commission on Human Rights in the first recourse unless all other recourse is ruled out. In fact, we do not have any significant number of such complaints posed formally and in a form in which they could be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>The fact is that we had a debate here on foreign affairs and, within the limits of what is possible under diplomatic protocol which does not permit one to announce such an intention in advance of communicating with the Government concerned, I indicated clearly the trend of my thoughts.  I might add that the previous Government had the same understanding of diplomatic protocol. During the debate in the House I raised the question of closer diplomatic relations and other relations with countries in eastern Europe.  Within the limits of diplomatic protocol I could go no further than that.  Having done that, and having had regard to the mood of the House and of public opinion, the Government took a decision which I notified to the Soviet Foreign Minister at Helsinki.  That was in accordance with correct diplomatic practice and in strict accordance with the procedure laid down by, and insisted upon, by the previous Government.</P>

The view of the Irish delegation, which I summarised in my speech, is that any such concept, which was pressed very hard by the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, would be quite inappropriate to the circumstances of this country and, indeed, to some other countries, where frotiers existed that could and should be capable of being altered with the consent of the people and Governments concerned.

      <P>I did receive from the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement the text of the resolution referred to by the Deputy.  As I said in the Dáil on 21st June last, in reply to a question about the trial of this Irish citizen, the accused's consular and legal interests are adequately protected and the necessary facilities are afforded to him.  Consequently the need for representations to the authorities of the country concerned does not arise at this stage when his appeal is pending.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the Terrorism Act of South Africa is that the United Nations keeps under close and continuous review the operation of this and all other legislation designed to enforce the deplorable policies of apartheid in that country. The United Nations General Assemby, of which Ireland is a member, has repeatedly condemned all such repressive legislation in South Africa and demanded its repeal.  Hence, there is no necessity to ask the United Nations to determine whether the Act in question is in accordance with the Charter of the Organisation.  I may add that Ireland has sought all occasions in the United Nations to join its voice to those condemning the apartheid system.</P>

      <P>In response to an invitation from the General Assembly of the United Nations last autumn, the Economic and Social Council, of <Col N="884" /> which Ireland is not at present a member, considered the question of capital punishment at its recent session and adopted a resolution on 16th May, 1973, re-affirming that the main objective to be pursued is that of progressively restricting the number of offences for which capital punishment might be imposed with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment.  Ireland has in the past been in a position to vote in favour of resolutions on the subject at the United Nations, having regard to our existing law and practice, and I have no doubt that we will find it possible to do so in the future, if and when the question comes before the General Assembly again.</P>

      <P>The Classified Directory, Golden Pages, is compiled and produced by the company named by the Deputy under a contract placed by the Department following competitive tendering.  Under the terms of the contract, the contractor is responsible for all the costs involved in producing the directory, he collects all the revenue from the sale of advertisements in it and he pays the Department a certain percentage of the advertising revenue or a guaranted minimum royalty, whichever is the greater.</P>
      <P>The current contract expires this year and a new contract is being placed with the same company, with the approval of the Government Contracts Committee.  The company were advised by my Department in January last of the acceptance of their offer and I am satisfied that the Department are now committed to accepting the firm's tender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions there.  Departmental revenue has been of the order of £32,000 per year.  The company concerned sustained a loss on their initial contract.  However, they were the only company that tendered for the present contract to which my Department indicated agreement in January last.  The Department have taken the view that the contract relieves the Department of the mainly specialised work which is involved in producing the directory, that is, the selling of advertisements.  The Department took the view that they had not the necessary specialists to undertake the work that is considered more appropriate to advertising agencies or similar organisations who engage in this type of business.</P>
      <P>That was the view taken.  I think the Deputy has done well to raise the matter.  It is of interest.  It might be considered that the Department could have made an effort to get this going on their own but the decision has been taken and the company were notified in January that we were prepared to enter into the contract and although the formal contract has not been signed I think we are morally, and probably legally, committed to it.</P>

      <P>While appreciating that the contract for this year must inevitably go through, does the Minister consider it to be in the national interest that a commercial monopoly has now, in effect, been given by his Department to an international company specialising in this work and likely to make, in the years ahead, a very handsome profit from it when, in fact, if the original decision of the Department had shown <Col N="891" /> some imagination and less pre-occupation with private enterprise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The cost of relaying signals from the Continent to this country and the technical problems involved effectively rule out at present and in the foreseeable future any question of making the television programmes from all EEC countries available here; there is, therefore, no need at present for communicating on this subject with EEC countries, other than the one which is our nearest neighbour.</P>

      <P>It will be appreciated that the plan involves many factors besides harbour works.  My Department is concerned with the proposals in the plan for the harbour works involved viz. dredging, reclamation, and the construction of berths.  The question of the provision of such works is under consideration in relation to the plan as a whole.  Of course, should an industry decide in the meantime to locate at the harbour the question of the provision and financing of its specific requirements by way of harbour facilities will receive immediate attention.</P>

      <P>I do not regard the establishment of one or several oil refineries, irrespective of their location, as necessarily desirable in the national interest.  While I am, of course, anxious to encourage the establishment of industries which would give employment of a high quality to Irish workers and help improve our balance of payments position, each project must be examined to ensure that it will benefit the country and not injure it, taking account of both economic and environmental aspects.</P>
      <P>I might add that I share the concern which I take is implied in the Deputy's question and I have initiated discussions with colleagues in other Departments to decide if the policy which we inherited is satisfactory or whether we need a new policy in regard to the location of oil refineries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has offered me a choice as to whether it is an emotional or an economical decision. The answer is neither.  It is a decision that will be taken in the light of all the relevant considerations, none of which is emotional, some of which are economic and some of which go far and beyond the bounds of economics and concern matters of environment and of long term visible planning.</P>

There are other beautiful areas in which it would be better not to have oil refineries, but I think both needs can be reconciled if there is some thinking ahead, some planning and some policy.  We want the refineries. We want the amenities and we want to preserve the environment as well. I believe we can do both if we think ahead.</P>

      <P>I agree with the importance of decisions being made in Brussels and other institutions of the Community.  While Irish industry is making a considerable effort, there are areas of omission where important decisions in the preceding discussions are not participated in and also that decisions are not sufficiently rapidly communicated.  We all have responsibility, Government, Opposition, media, CII, and all of the other agencies in this respect.  There is a real difficulty in regard to the extent of the financial burden on some of the voluntary organisations in maintaining staff or sending people to Brussels.  This is a matter which might be looked at in regard to whether they should receive some form of assistance because it is in the public interest that they should be well informed and should be able to attend as much as possible.</P>

Total receipts for 1972 amounted to £125,933. There may be some adjustment in these figures when profits in certain cases are finally assessed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence that the price of pigs has dropped slightly in recent weeks and, allowing for the usual interval for processing, this may result in a slight reduction in the retail price of bacon in the near future.

In view of that fact does it not seem reasonable that the cost of production of pigs is bound to rise? Has the Minister any comment to make on that?  He seemed to indicate that there was a possibility of a drop in the price of bacon.  How can he reconcile this with the steep increase in the price of protein for animal feeding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, for example, in regard to Grade A Special the price on 4th June was £26 to £27.50 per cwt, whereas on 25th June it was £25 to £26.  The price of the raw material of the pig per cwt has come down.  While there is a certain delay, because you do not get an instant product in the case of bacon, it is to be expected that this drop in price will be passed on to the consumer. I share the Deputy's concern for the escalating world price of protein supplements and particularly soya beans, largely resulting from the recent action of the United States Government. The Deputy knows as well as I do that we have very little control over prices of commodities on world markets and if he can make representations <Col N="915" /> or suggest representations to the United States Government in regard to their releasing soya beans, I will be very happy either to support them or initiate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission in March last published an occasional paper on the marketing of fruit and vegetables in which the margins referred to by the Deputy are mentioned.  The commission stated in their report for April last that they proposed to invite the main supermarkets, the Federation of Trade Associations and RGDATA to comment on these conclusions.  The organisations mentioned have since been invited to furnish their comments, and when these are received, the commission will be making recommendations <Col N="916" /> to me as to whether I should use my powers under the Prices Acts to fix maximum retail margins for fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the effect of the Prices (Stabilisation of Profit Margins of Retailers) Order, 1973, which I made on 26th June, is to fix the retailer's margin on fruit and vegetables at the cash margin taken on 23rd June, 1973.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the fact that the import of bananas into this country will be subject under <Col N="917" /> EEC regulations to a duty of 20 per cent while those into Britain and Northern Ireland will be exempt from duty will have any adverse effects on this country's import trade; and if he will take steps to ensure that the Irish housewife will continue to have access to quality bananas at reasonable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty on bananas applicable to imports from our present sources of supply will be 8 per cent on 1st January, 1974, and it will increase on a gradual basis annually to 20 per cent on 1st July, 1977.  It has been represented to me by the trade that this duty will have adverse effects on the import trade in bananas. I have recently asked them for further information in this connection to help me to decide what action I should take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister in this matter have regard to the fact that apparently Great Britain will be exempt from this duty when it comes into operation?  Could he tell me what situation will obtain after April next in the case of bananas which will go into Great Britain exempt of duty? In the case of those bananas coming into this country will they have EEC duty on them or will they come in free of duty from Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they will not come in.  The basis of the difference between the UK and Ireland is that the UK supplies come from the West Indies, Jamaica and Windward Islands, which are associated territories, whereas, ours come from Equador and Columbia, which are outside. If it were to be a circumstance that they could simply be put into Great Britain from these supply sources that are associated and then put into Ireland without any tariff, this would defeat the object.  We are in circumstances where I understand there is some difficulty in total supply from the associated areas.  I have conflicting advice from two Irish groups.  I am watching the situation consistently and I would be very much guided by their advice in this context but it is my concern that the existing import <Col N="918" /> trade and the jobs, particularly in Cork, that are related to this trade, should be preserved.  I am not quite clear at this moment as to what the best mechanism is but the matter is under continuous investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would bear in mind that Great Britain has been successful in procuring this, as it were, free import of bananas from her associated territories, whereas we will incur the duties?  When a similar situation happened between France and Germany and when the French were able to get an arrangement about bananas from their associated territories the Germans insisted as a <i>quid pro quo</i> that they would get a duty-free quota and would he consider raising this matter with the EEC that we should be granted a similar type of quota to what the Germans have been able to get <i>vis-á-vis</i> the French?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion of Deputy Haughey is one of the possibilities. When it was negotiated prior to our accession it was a decision that it was inappropriate that we should seek this special waiver.  It is one of the paths open to us.  I am inclined to feel that if the matter can be settled in another way it is probably better to do it the other way, but that alternative certainly remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right in assuming that if these bananas are bought by the importers through Britain they will, therefore, be liable to no duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem about certificates of origin and there is also a problem about volume of supply and, of course, we do not wish to have the imports that come through Irish firms through Irish facilities supplanted by the imports that come from the UK.  It is for that reason that we want to avoid that situation because that would put out of business Irish people and Irish firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that there is a certain monopoly situation existing in the fruit import trade of this <Col N="919" /> country.  In effect, is he aware that on occasions it happens that fruit ordered by Irish importers in transit from places like Africa is diverted because the price on the market here has gone down at the particular time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations that the retail prices fixed for domestic margarines and cooking fats in the Maximum Prices (Household Goods) Order, 1973, which I made on 26th June, 1973, are too low in the case of a few specific brands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am concerned that the housewife should get the cheaper rate it is also a fact that many shops will have to boycott goods such as corn flakes and other items.  The profit on butter is 2 per cent and the shopkeeper is expected to pay VAT out of that.  Therefore, would the Minister not abolish the price freeze, not rush into it as he must have done for some peculiar reason of his own?  Obviously, there was no careful consideration given to the small shopkeeper.</P>

In regard to the substance of the Deputy's question, today I received a deputation and I am seeing RGDATA next Wednesday.  I made the matter clear at the time of the introduction of this order.  If there is evidence that in specific instances we have pitched the price in an anomalous way, I have the power to rectify that and I shall do so.  I must be satisfied that this is so but if I am satisfied I shall do it.  It is not my purpose to penalise shall shopkeepers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The retail price of beef is kept under constant review by the National Prices Commission, who have been asked to report to me, with their recommendations for dealing with the situation, if they find evidence that downward trends in cattle prices are not reflected in the retail price of beef.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is an inevitable time-lag.  There has been a significant drop in the price of cattle per cwt.  When comparing the dates 8th or 9th of May with 19th or <Col N="921" /> 20th of June, there is a drop in the retail price of sirloin, round steak and rib steak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that soya beans were being offered for sale last week at £280 per ton, an increase of about £100 per ton in one week, when the normal imported price is £80-£90 per ton; and the steps he is taking to stop the increase in the price of soya beans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>All supplies of soya beans are imported and the information available to me indicates that the present world market price for this commodity is £250 a ton or more. I understand that the present high price is due to the world scarcity of soya beans and to the recent controls on exports imposed by the US Government. Increases in import prices are, of course, outside my control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prices (Stabilisation of Profit <Col N="922" /> Margins of Importers and Wholesalers), Order, 1973, made by me on the 26th June, 1973, controls the margin of profit on soya beans which may be taken by the importers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the announcement of the restriction on US exports is a matter of some three weeks.  Because of the switching off of the supply to livestock producers throughout the world, this has produced rather explosive rises. There is some evidence that there is the beginning of a rethinking of policy in the United States.  For the sake of Irish livestock food, particularly that containing soya bean meal, I hope this rethinking continues.  The Deputy is aware that there have been representations made at Community level to the United States Government in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot make representations with regard to prices because they are not settled by the supplier but by the supply and demand situation on the market.  While we participated in the representation at Community level, we did not make representations at national level.  The Deputy has made a useful point and I shall raise the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, as a livestock producing country, this decision by the US bears very heavily on us and we think it should be reversed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state if he has looked at paragraph 3 in Order No. 167 and in Order No. 168? Those orders refer to the stabilisation of profit margins for importers and wholesalers and profit margins for retailers.  I would point out to the Minister that the fixed price profit margin he has ordered must apply even if the price is reduced.  Even if the price to the importer and the retailer is reduced, the fact is there is a fixed margin which they must charge.  The figure cannot be reduced and, therefore, it is unfair.  Is the Minister aware of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is so aware.  I wish that the point the Deputy is making had more substance. Unfortunately, it does not have much substance because in the existing raging world inflation the number of things we import whose price is likely to fall over the price on the starting day, 23rd June, is extremely small. When I introduced these measures I made it clear I would be very happy to lift their application and that I would do so as soon as we had good evidence that inflation was under control.  Part of the accruing evidence that it was under control would be precisely the kind of drop that would be measured in products coming in at cheaper rates.  If that started to happen on a significant scale, I am sure the Deputy would be happy, as I would be happy, and I would <Col N="924" /> promptly lift the order.  I wish it was a more real point in existing world circumstances.</P>

Study can mean anything from looking at current opinion in this country and in other countries to an extremely detailed analysis.

      <P>I am satisfied that the point is a valid one&mdash;that if one has £X million to spend, it is better to direct it straight at people, by way of social welfare, rather than by way of a food subsidy which would apply to every person, both rich and poor. The food subsidy is a very blunderbuss technique and, regardless of what government advocates that point of view, it seems to me to be a rather fair argument.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to motor insurance, I would again draw attention to the existence of the special machinery operated by the Minister for Local Government for helping to secure <Col N="928" /> cover for persons who have been unable to obtain it from insurance companies in the normal way.  Any specific cases of difficulty should, therefore, be referred to the Department of Local Government.</P>

Such premiums are prohibitive and are tantamount to a refusal to give cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he considers that, because of the audio-visual aids now available in schools, a singing test for female applicants should still be retained as part of the primary teacher training college entrance examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Singing is an essential element in the curriculum of the primary school, and I think that few will doubt that it should be so. Furthermore, in junior classes particularly it is integrated with the teaching of other subjects as, for instance, in the singing of simple rhymes in Irish or in English.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, therefore, that as many teachers as possible should be able to sing to the extent necessary to enable them to teach the primary school curriculum in full.  Audio-visual aids, though extremely useful in education, would not compensate for a lack of ability to sing, or to teach singing, on the part of the teacher.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I am not prepared, at this stage at least, to modify the requirement that girl candidates for admission to training must qualify in a singing test unless they have attained a very high standard in the other subjects which comprise the competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education his plans to ensure that the schools will mobilise every possible educative influence to help in the task of dealing with the total development and the total life of the student.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I suppose that the answer to this question is that I plan to fulfil conscientiously my duties as Minister for Education, in accordance with the philosophy that the true purpose of education is the development and equipment of all the powers of the individual person&mdash;moral, intellectual and physical&mdash;so that, by making the fullest use of his talents, he may responsibly discharge his duties to God and to his fellowmen in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My activities and the activities of my Department in assisting the schools to serve this philosophy will be manifold. They include: curricular development based on experience and research; improvement in teacher training, both in the basic courses and by the provision of a comprehensive in-service training system; the extension of the educational psychologist service to meet as fully as possible the particular requirements of pupils who, for one reason or another, have special learning difficulties; a closer involvement of parents in the work of the schools, both in management and in a consultative capacity; the establishment of an organised system of adult education, <Col N="945" /> the adjustment of the imbalance between what is generally referred to as academic education and education which has a practical content.</P>
    <P>These are some&mdash;perhaps the more important of the elements in my educational planning&mdash;but the list I have given is not by any means exhaustive.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell used to say to me that when one gave a long answer the person asking the question was told nothing.  What we have just had from the Minister is a typical example of that.  It was a long answer but it did not answer my question. It was obviously written by some civil servant.  It was a magnificent answer.  May I ask the Minister if, in view of the technological advances taking place, he is satisfied that the ordinary school curriculum is fitting children properly for their roles in life?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on a number of occasions since becoming Minister about the imbalance in second level education, but I do not think we should take it necessarily for granted that turning out people with an academic education is a bad thing because I was assured by an Opposition Deputy that it is his particular experience that those who were given a broad general education were better suited to take up posts in a factory where there was need for technical expertise.  In general, I think one could say that a broad general education is required up to <Col N="946" /> about 16 and, after that, perhaps specialisation.</P>

If there is an alleged offence against this man it would not have been committed within the jurisdiction of this State.  I am asking why he should have been arrested.  Even if it is a matter for the Garda to enforce the law, as the Minister said, surely a funeral is scarcely the place to do it when the same man could have been apprehended in several other places over the past few months.</P>

I would expect that every Member of this House would want to give the Garda full support in a very difficult situation such as we have at the moment.

      <P>There is no question of being disrespectful to the dead. <Col N="951" /> The Garda have a duty to arrest suspected criminals wherever they can come across them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the steps he is taking to protect County Donegal salmon net fishermen fishing off the northern coast some of whom had their nets confiscated yesterday following an apparently arbitrary decision taken without notice that the traditional one-mile fishing limit is now extended to three miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a disadvantage. I heard of this matter less than a quarter of an hour ago and had considerable difficulty getting here, never mind getting the answer. I have to apologise to the Deputy that owing to the short notice I have been unable to get any information <Col N="956" /> on it.  All I can say to the Deputy is that I will seek further information this evening and I will communicate directly with the Deputy as soon as I get any information.  I am sorry I cannot do more than that at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the difficulty in the Minister getting here and the very short notice.  I thank him for coming.  Because of the urgency of the matter, I have sought to get it brought to the attenion of the appropriate Minister so that immediate action can be taken.  I would ask the Minister whether he is aware that the situation is that one fisherman out of, perhaps, 12 or 20 participating in fishing in this area had his entire nets and gear confiscated, which effectively puts him out of business.  The season is very short and he may lose his livelihood, which is from fishing, in the next few weeks.  Secondly, I would ask whether the Minister is aware that all those who escaped the patrol boat on the night in question are now at risk if they proceed to fish where they have traditionally fished.  In view of the very short salmon fishing season, I would ask him if he would take all possible steps to have the matter rectified quickly.  If there is any information that I can supply the Minister with, I will give it to him immediately the House adjourns rather than take up the time of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Blaney's drawing the matter to my attention in this way.  If the facts are as stated, that a fisherman fishing in an area in which he is entitled to fish and where it is accepted that he is entitled to fish had his gear confiscated, then certainly we will take immediate action in the matter but, obviously, I am not familiar with the facts at this time.  I will institute immediate inquiry into it and will get in touch wih Deputy Blaney on any results I get from that inquiry.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> It would appear that some wildfowl species, for example, snipe, are declining, due mainly to drainage of habitat and changes in agricultural practice in marginal land.  The peregrine falcon had also shown a decline for some years past, due apparently to the ingestion of persistent organochlorine pesticides but surveys sponsored by my Department indicate that this species has recovered somewhat in recent times.</P>
    <P>Casual variation in numbers may arise from year to year as a result of good or bad breeding seasons, weather conditions, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
