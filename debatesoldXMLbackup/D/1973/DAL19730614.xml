    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to extend the statutory limit on the amount of capital available to Fóir Teoranta to finance their operations. The opportunity is also being availed of to write off Exchequer loans equating to certain investments which were transferred to the company from Taiscí Stáit Teoranta and which are now worthless.</P>
      <P>The company were set up under the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972, and began operations in April, 1972.  Their function is to provide reconstruction finance for potentially viable industrial concerns which are unable to raise capital from the normal commercial sources. Fóir Teoranta are, therefore, the last link in the chain of State assistance for industry.  In order to be eligible for assistance from Fóir Teoranta the governing legislation requires that industrial concerns fulfill a number of conditions.  The employment and capital employed in them must be significant, the promoters must have made a reasonable contribution to the initial capital and there must be evidence that failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions at national or local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have already disbursed approximately £5 million to firms requiring assistance.  Some of this finance was used to honour investment commitments inherited from Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, which was dissolved in March of last year, but the greater proportion was in respect of applications made to the company. To date they have provided assistance to 56 firms with a total employment content of approximately 8,500 persons. For the most part this finance has been disbursed as longer term loans and the amounts of assistance provided in individual cases have ranged from as little as £2,500 upwards. In a few cases the company have undertaken to invest £250,000 or more in individual firms and in these cases the prior approval of the <Col N="454" /> Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce has been obtained because of the very significant amounts involved.  As the State lender of last resort, the company's objective is to take all possible steps to strengthen the position of a firm which have reasonable prospects of succeeding in the longer term.  Therefore, they adopt a positive attitude towards applications for assistance.  At the same time they must be prepared to refuse assistance where the evidence suggests that the applicant firm has no reasonable chance of ultimate success. Where necessary, they have insisted on management changes and the nomination of some directors as a condition of providing financial assistance.</P>
    <P>The legislation which established Fóir Teoranta provided that the company could borrow to a limit of £7.5 million to finance their operations and it was expected at the time that this limit would suffice for a few years. The demand for reconstruction finance, however, has far exceeded what was anticipated.  As I have already indicated, the company have disbursed approximately £5 million to date; in addition to this they have had to borrow £1 million to recoup the Industrial Credit Company in respect of bridging finance provided to Taiscí Stáit Teoranta and they have undertaken further commitments which have brought it close to the existing statutory limit on their borrowing powers.  Amending legislation to increase their resources is therefore necessary to enable them to continue the useful work they have been doing to date.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the present Bill proposes that the new limit on borrowing by Fóir Teoranta be fixed at £17.5 million, an increase of £10 million on the present limit.  Virtually all of the finance required by the company up to now has been provided from the Exchequer, as the returns on the company's share and loan investments. including those inherited from Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, have been negligible so far and this position is likely to continue for some years ahead at least. There is no prospect that the company will raise finance from alternative sources because the return on its investments <Col N="455" /> would not enable it to meet the cost of servicing commercial borrowing in the foreseeable future.  It is proposed therefore-in section 3 of the Bill-to raise from £7.5 million to £17.5 million the limit on the power of the Minister for Finance to provide loan capital to the company.</P>
    <P>On the dissolution of Taiscí Stáit Teoranta its liabilities and investments were transferred to Fóir Teoranta. These included investments in Aviation Development Ltd., Cloth Manufacturers Ltd., (Cootehill), Everfresh Foods Ltd. and Fenian Gun Company of Ireland Ltd.  These four companies have ceased trading and the amounts accruing to Fóir Teoranta from the realisation of their assets will be negligible.  The book value of these investments stands at £1,142,000 and Fóir Teoranta carries a liability of an equal amount to the Exchequer in respect of them.  The company proposes to write these investments out of its balance sheet and it is desirable that it be relieved of its liability to the Exchequer in respect of a similar amount. This is the purpose of section 4 of the Bill.  It is inappropriate that the company should continue to carry a liability in respect of worthless investments which it has inherited from Taiscí Stáit and the write off of this liability will help towards giving a fairer reflection of the cost to the Exchequer of Fóir Teoranta's activities.</P>
    <P>The high level of demand for reconstruction finance may be attributed to a number of factors such as the rapid technological change in industry, the continuing impact of free trade and the falling value of money as a consequence of which individual firms require larger amounts of assistance than had been envisaged.  It is predictable that in this situation a number of basically sound industrial concerns will experience temporary trading difficulties and it is very desirable that the State should take positive action to ensure that these firms are not forced out of business unnecessarily.  Fóir Teoranta provides an orderly and expert procedure for dealing with this problem and it constitutes a valuable element in the range of facilities designed to <Col N="456" /> assist our industrial development.</P>
    <P>The present legislation will make available to Fóir Teoranta an additional £10 million to carry on its functions. It is envisaged that this additional provision should suffice for at least two years ahead.  I should qualify this, however, by pointing out that in the field of reconstruction finance it is even more difficult than usual to prediet requirements in advance.  Apart from increasing the limits on the finance available to Fóir Teoranta no further changes in the company's governing legislation are considered necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that, as far as this side of the House is concerned, this Bill will have no difficulty in securing passage through the House.  When the decision was made to set up Fóir Teoranta, I regarded the provision of a company such as Fóir Teoranta as a very important link in the range of assistance, both financial and otherwise, available to Irish industry in a difficult and very competitive situation.  However, the fact that the Minister has had to bring this Bill before this House, even allowing for the fall in the value of money to which I referred, is itself confirmation of how important a role Foir Teoranta is playing in regard to Irish industry.  I think we can be grateful that this is so and that we can be reasonably certain that if we did not have Fóir Teoranta a number of the Irish industries which have received assistance might well not exist today. Consequently, the proposal of the Minister to increase substantially the money available to Fóir Teoranta is, as far as we are concerned, an acceptable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few matters I would like to get some enlightenment on if the Minister could give it to me when replying.  First, the arrangement when the company was set up was that it would, in the first instance, avail itself of the Industrial Credit Company to provide the management of Fóir Teoranta. This was necessary obviously when the company was being set up at the beginning and did not have its <Col N="457" /> own management.  Provision was made, however, to allow the board of Fóir Teoranta to decide in due course, after experience, whether it wished to continue with this arrangement or to recruit its own staff for administration and management.  I should be grateful if the Minister could indicate whether the board has made any decision in this regard as yet.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a matter of very considerable importance and a matter which was adverted to both in this House and the other House when the original legislation was going through was the problem of notice being given by the firm when it was getting into difficulties, and by &ldquo;notice&rdquo; I mean adequate notice.  The experience has been that very often the request for assistance came when the company seeking assistance had not alone exhausted all other possible resources but needed assistance very quickly or was about to close down.  I am speaking of experience before the setting up of Fóir Teoranta.  This was quite unsatisfactory, as it meant that adequate examination of all the factors involved was hindered by the shortness of time and the urgency of the request.</P>
    <P>There are very great difficulties involved in trying to overcome this problem.  One of them is that any firm which finds itself in some financial difficulty usually comes to the conclusion that it is far better to conceal that difficulty than to disclose it, and frequently the disclosure of the difficulty might result in the closing down of the firm whereas the non-disclosure and the making of other arrangements could well enable the firm to carry on and overcome the difficulties.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions on the discussion on the original Bill that Fóir Teoranta ought to insist that a firm which had not given adequate notice would automatically be debarred from availing of facilities of Fóir Teoranta. That, however, is not a practical proposition which can be applied in all cases.  The board of Fóir Teoranta was concerned about this problem and realising all the practical difficulties involved.  I would like to know whether the board of Fóir Teoranta has yet <Col N="458" /> succeeded in devising a method which would ensure that more adequate notice of problems arising in different companies is given to Fóir Teoranta than was available in the past in the case of Taiscí Stáit.</P>
    <P>The other matter I wish to raise is this.  The experience not only of Fóir Teoranta but of its predecessors has been that in many cases where assistance is required the kernel of the problem when it is examined lies in a lack of management expertise in the company seeking assistance, and for very good historical reasons in this country we do not have a large pool of management skill.  In a number of cases where various steps were necessary in order to put a company which was in difficulties on a sound footing, the one most important step was to provide adequate managerial skill.  The practical difficulty involved here is that when a company has reached that stage of difficulty a man who has the requisite managerial skill normally will not take on a job of that kind in a failing company because there is no great future for him if the situation has gone so far that he fails to retrieve the fortunes of the company and his own reputation goes with it.  If, on the other hand, he succeeds it may be that the compensation, not only in monetary terms, available to him may not be such to induce him to give up an adequate and satisfying position.</P>
    <P>I had some discussion with the board of Fóir Teoranta about this problem. We discussed the possibility of Foir Teoranta recruiting some people with adequate management skill who could be placed for a temporary period in charge of companies which were in difficulty and which, in the opinion of Fóir Teoranta, needed this kind of management skill.  The general idea was that since this pool of people would be employed by Fóir Teoranta, their job would be to go in and rescue one particular firm and, having done that job. go into another firm at the direction of Fóir Teoranta.  However, the same kind of problem would not arise, as I have outlined, if one wanted to recruit someone who is already in another successful firm.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell us <Col N="459" /> if any progress has been made with Fóir Teoranta in regard to this matter. If it has not yet been executed, is there any indication it is likely to be dons in the near future?  There are other ramifications in this of some importance to industry other than what I have outlined.  I think this approach, or something similar, is essential not only to enable Fóir Teoranta to do the job they have been required to do by the Oireaohtas but also as a general line of approach in dealing with industry in these increasingly competitive days. If the Minister can throw any light on this I should be grateful.  In the meantime, so far as this side of the House is concerned, we support fully the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Colley for his remarks and his support of this Bill.  As he has pointed out, the fact that we have had to come back to the House within a year of the commencement of Fóir Teoranta in order to seek additional monetary assistance indicates how urgent was the need for such an organisation.  We would expect, as the years go by and as we overcome the transient difficulties of moving into a free trade situation, there would not be the same need. That may be so in the long run, but it is necessary that we have this assistance available at this sensitive time.</P>
      <P>The present position is that Fóir Teoranta are operating with ICC staff who are in a separate section under an ICC divisional manager.  It is working very successfully and the board of Fóir Teoranta do not see any need at the moment to set up a separate unit.  If the necessity should arise to do it, and if ICC were unable to render this service in the future, then the matter would be looked at again.  Apparently it is not required at the moment and, as Deputy Colley has recognised, Foir Teoranta are working successfully.  It is useful that ICC would be dovetailed into the operation because one hopes that in the long run they would be taking over the credit requirements of these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley also raised the question about notice.  Many of the occasions <Col N="460" /> in which Fóir Teoranta have to provide assistance arise because of inadequate management, because of a Micawber-like attitude on the part of the firms who hope that the difficulties will pass and that they will not need to look to a State-sponsored organisation or to their own bankers to get monetary assistance.  It is surprising and disappointing to discover how many firms leave it to the last week before closure before they seek financial assistance elsewhere.  Obviously it would be wrong for Fóir Teoranta to say that firms would not get assistance unless they gave a warning of one, two or three months because the cases that most require assistance are those who leave it to the last moment to give notice.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are aware of the desirability of getting the longest possible notice.  Sometimes the firms do not need money but an injection of new enterprising management.  They have taken measures to advertise the availability of finance and management advice from Fóir Teoranta and they are anxious to generate this so that people will not look to Fóir Teoranta as a kind of fire brigade service to dampen down the fires.  It is important to stop the fires developing in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the difficulty of putting enterprising and efficient management into firms that are on the brink of collapse.  That, of course, is not the most encouraging situation for any manager to enter but, nevertheless, there have been a a number of occasions where good management, introduced by Fóir Teoranta, not only saved the firms from collapse and thus saved employment but they have also developed the firms to such an extent that they have great promise fur the future.</P>
    <P>With the passage of years we expect that the considerable investment being made by the State will be refunded. The loans given have, in the main, provided for postponement of the date of repayment and this is as it should be.  Most of the firms in difficulty are in this position because of a shortage of liquidity.  The longer the period they are given for repayment of the loans <Col N="461" /> the better but one would see money coming back in the future.</P>
    <P>This covers most of the points made by Deputy Colley but if there are specific matters I have omitted I can assure him I will shortly be having discussions with the Board of Fóir Teoranta and I will take up the matters with them.  I shall communicate with the Deputy on the matter because I am aware of his continuing interest in this important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purposes of this Bill are to increase the statutory limits on Exchequer participation in Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann Teoranta, to provide that the company may borrow in foreign currencies and that the Minister for Finance may guarantee such borrowings and to provide for a larger board of directors for the company.  The opportunity is also being availed of to make administrative changes desirable as a consequence of the integration of the food project with the other activities of CSET and to introduce certain minor amendments to existing legislation which will give the company more flexibility in relation to its managerial structure and to the submission of its annual accounts to the Minister for Finance.  A provision in relation to the position of directors and staff of the company who may become members <Col N="463" /> of either House of the Oireachtas is also included.</P>
    <P>CSET has begun work on a major programme of modernisation of sugar plant which is estimated to cost in the region of £7 million over the next four years.  Primarily because of the heavy demands in recent years on available capital to support the food processing project&mdash;to which I will refer in more detail later&mdash;the renewal of plant and equipment in the sugar factories has been unduly delayed.  As a consequence some of this plant and equipment is now obsolete and its replacement is an urgent priority.  The programme of modernisation will bring about an improvement in conditions and create a more satisfactory working environment at all four factories.  The greater part of the investment will be at Carlow and Mallow where existing handling and processing facilities are insufficient to cater adequately for the quantities of beet which they receive.</P>
    <P>The expectation is that within the EEC the production of Irish beet sugar can be maintained at a level of 170,000 to 190,000 tons and investment in the sugar factories is essential if CSET is to be as efficient as other Community producers of sugar. The present EEC arrangements, which remain in effect until July, 1975, provide that this country may produce 150,000 tons of beet sugar for which the full EEC support price will be guaranteed and a supplementary quota of 52,000 tons.  Last year CSET processed 154,000 tons of sugar from 83,000 acres of beet.  The yield was disappointingly low because of the abnormally poor weather.  The company has contracted for 76,000 acres of beet in the current season and, given average weather conditions, this should yield approximately 170,000 tons of sugar.  CSET is confident that its growers will continue to favour the beet crop despite the enhanced attractions of other farming pursuits within the EEC.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory provisions relating to borrowing by CSET have been interpreted as empowering the company to borrow in Irish currency only and it is now essential that the <Col N="464" /> company be empowered to borrow in foreign currencies.  I am pleased to be able to say that on Tuesday last the company completed negotiations with the European Investment Bank for a loan of £2.8 million to finance in part its factory modernisation programme. This, in fact, is the first loan of the European Investment Bank in the new member countries of the EEC.  Further suitable opportunities for foreign borrowing by CSET are likely to arise from time to time.  Provision is made in section 4 of the Bill to empower the company to borrow by means of debentures in foreign currencies.  Borrowing by the company otherwise than by debentures is not governed by legislation. As a consequence of the company's intention to borrow abroad, it is necessary to extend the existing guarantee powers of the Minister for Finance. For instance, the European Investment Bank, to which I have already referred, requires a ministerial guarantee as a condition of making a loan to the company.  Sections 2 and 7 of the Bill extend the Minister's powers of guarantee; section 2 relates to debenture borrowing by the company and section 7 relates to borrowing otherwise than by debenture.</P>
    <P>At present CSET is required to submit its annual accounts, duly audited, to the Minister for Finance within 90 days after the end of each accounting year.  For many years the company have been unable to comply with this requirement because its activities are too diverse to allow for proper completion of audit within the period specified.  It is usually up to six months after the end of the accounting year before the accounts are ready for submission to the Minister and it is proposed, therefore, in section 3 of the Bill to extend the time limit to six months.  The section also removes a requirement in the 1933 Act that all changes in the format of the CSET accounts shall be prescribed by the Minister for Finance in statutory regulations.  This requirement is unnecessary and, in fact, the Minister has not at any stage issued such regulations.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation provides that <Col N="465" /> the board of CSET shall consist of seven members.  It is now proposed to provide for a maximum of ten members and the necessary provision is included in section 4 of this Bill. The extension of the board to ten members is desirable because of the wide variety of operations for which they are responsible, particularly now that the food processing project has been fully integrated with the other activities of CSET.  In addition to the changes relating to the number of board members and to foreign borrowing, to which I have just referred, the section removes the requirement that the company must have a managing director.  This requirement is too restrictive and, in fact, the company has not had a managing director for some years.</P>
    <P>Qualifications regarding the financial interest of the Minister for Finance in the company and the duty chargeable on sugar are also being removed as these are no longer relevant.</P>
    <P>CSET will require assistance from the Exchequer towards the financing of its sugar factory programme and, as the company's average level of borrowing is already considerably higher than its equity, the company has made clear its preference for share capital.  Shares to the existing authorised statutory limit of £5 million have already been issued&mdash;£4½ million to the Minister for Finance and £½ million of preference shares to private sector interests.  Section 5 of the Bill proposes an increase in the existing authorised share capital of £10 million. It is intended that the existing £1 million Exchequer loan to the company will be converted to shares, bringing the issued share capital to £6 million, and a provision for a further £4 million should on present indications be more than adequate for a period of at least four to five years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is also intended&mdash;in section 8&mdash; to increase from £5 million to £10 million the statutory limit on advances and guarantees from the Minister for Finance to CSET.  The existing advance of £1 million is, as I have indicated, to be converted to share capital and all <Col N="466" /> that is guaranteed at present by the Minister is a debenture loan of £900,000.  The Minister will be called upon to guarantee borrowings by the company from the European Investment Bank and possibly from other sources in future years and in order to cater adequately for this contingency, a new limit of £10 million on advances and guarantees from the Minister is proposed.</P>
    <P>In an effort to reduce the very serious losses on food processing this operation has been integrated with the other activities of CSET under the direct responsibility of the CSET board.  The advantages to be derived from this integration are an improvement in overall efficiency and the elimination of costs arising from the operation of two separate companies. Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill arise as a consequence of this change.  Section 9 enables CSET to take over the Erin Food's investments in associated companies as Erin Foods is now a dormant company.  Section 10 removes the obligation on Erin Foods&mdash;which is an approved subsidiary company of CSET within the meaning of the 1962 Act&mdash; to seek the approval of the Minister for Finance for alterations in its memorandum and articles of association and to submit its accounts to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes certain provisions in section 11 as regards membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors, officers and servants of CSET.  Provisions relating to Oireachtas membership have for some time past been included in legislation pertaining to State-sponsored bodies and it is considered that the opportunity afforded by the present Bill should be taken to extend them to CSET.</P>
    <P>The position of the food processing project is one of serious concern to the Government.  Since its establishment more than 12 years ago there has been a total investment of £25 million in the project and up to £10 million of this investment has been written off as irrecoverable.  The main causes of these losses have been over-production in earlier years, and the continuing inability to achieve export prices sufficient to cover production costs and <Col N="467" /> overheads.  The proliferation of small processing units has significantly inflated production costs.  Bulk sales to major food manufacturers, particularly in Britain, have accounted for a high proportion of exports and profit margins have been entirely inadequate because of very keen competition. There are no prospects of profitable operation in the bulk export market and in the past 12 months intensive efforts have been made to find new and profitable export markets.</P>
    <P>In the financial year ended on 30th April last, the food project had an operating loss of the order of £660,000 and there is unlikely to be a significant improvement in the current year.  This level of performance is unacceptable as it involves a degree of subsidisation from the other operations of the company which they cannot support in the longer term.  In addition, deliveries of raw materials for processing have fallen short of requirements.  The company have had to import potatoes on a limited scale this year to meet essential requirements for the Tuam potato factory, when a large number of growers failed to honour contracts, and this situation cannot be continued as a permanent arrangement.  In any event, such a development would be contrary to the basic concept of the food project which was designed to assist the development of horticulture in this country.</P>
    <P>The board of CSET are committed to taking all steps necessary to reduce food losses short of any steps which might lead to redundancy of full-time employees.  The number of production units, however, which operate well below full capacity, adds very considerably to company costs and some rationalisation of these may be inescapable.  The board of the company have been asked to give special attention to this problem and the Government will be prepared to consider favourably any constructive proposals which they may submit to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>CSET is one of our major industries both in terms of output and employment. In its latest financial year it has <Col N="468" /> achieved an estimated turnover of £34 million, comprising £17½ million on sugar, £9½ million on processed foods and £7 million on associated agricultural activities.  Average year-round employment by the company is almost 4,000 and in addition payments exceeding £10 million are made to more than 20,000 farmers.  The bulk of the employment given by the company is in provincial centres, in some of which alternative job opportunities are few. Ireland's entry into the EEC presents a strong challenge for the company in that it no longer has a right to a monopoly position on the home market on production and sale of sugar while export opportunities for items such as agricultural machinery and food products should improve.  The company must be properly geared to meet this new challenge.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to aid improvements in company efficiency and to facilitate financing arrangements. These steps are an essential part of the company's adjustment to the new EEC situation and I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Bill was prepared by me when I was Minister for Finance the House may take it that I certainly will not be opposing it.  It is important to underline the point made by the Minister towards the end of his speech when he referred to the significant role of the Sugar Company in our economy and particularly in provincial centres in the provision of employment where alternative employment is not available and is unlikely to be available for some considerable time.  Therefore, the activities of the Sugar Company, and its associated activities in food processing, are of great importance to the whole economy and to everyone in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Sugar Company's operations in regard to sugar are concerned, it is true to say that by and large they have been extremely successful and efficient, despite the fact, as the Minister has pointed out, that certain reinvestment in new equipment which, in the normal way would <Col N="469" /> have taken place over recent years, did not take place.  This was primarily due to the fact that the profits being made by the company on sugar were being ploughed into food processing to an abnormal degree.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the making available of additional capital to the Sugar Company principally for the purpose of reinvestment in new equipment to make the company more efficient and to enable it to compete satisfactorily within the Common Market.  There is a problem attached to this.  One has to make a decision and take a particular line on it.  I am quite certain the Minister knows what I am referring to here.  In fact he touches on it when he says:</P>
    <P>CSET is confident that its growers will continue to favour the beet crop despite the enhanced attractions of other farming pursuits within the EEC.</P>
    <P>The problem is to forecast the extent to which farmers will continue to grow beet in a situation where other crops are becoming very much more attractive than they were in the past.  A reasonably accurate forecast of what the farmers are likely to do is very important because if, in fact, they are likely to reduce substantially the acreage of beet which they grow, then a considerable amount of the proposed new investment would not be necessary and, indeed, might well be wasted.  On the other hand, if the company are to have an opportunity to compete successfully within the Common Market, it simply is not possible to do so on the basis of existing plant and equipment. Consequently it is necessary to make an estimate, with the best information available, as to the likely level of production of beet and to provide the necessary re-equipment for that likely amount of production.</P>
    <P>Despite the best information one can get, one ends up with what cannot be described as anything better than a &ldquo;guestimate&rdquo; in this connection.  I am simply drawing attention to this problem because I think it is important. I am not suggesting that the answer provided in this Bill is the correct one, or that the Minister should know that <Col N="470" /> it is or is not the correct answer. Nobody can know positively.  There is a problem.  I believe that the longer term interests of the farmers themselves lie in a continued substantial production of beet.  Apart from their interest, I also believe it is in the interest of the economy that there should be a continuing substantial production of beet and sugar.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there have been groups who have tried to argue that the production of sugar in the future will be very substantially increased over and above recent production. There have been suggestions that our existing quota, which is due to be renegotiated fairly soon, is totally inadequate. I do not profess to be an expert in this regard, but I do not believe that is true.  The nearest one can get to the likely outcome is the basis that is being operated on in this Bill.  If that basis is reached, then the proposed investment here is fully justified and required.  If, in fact, the level of production is much lower than is envisaged, this investment may well be wasted.  I, for one, will not blame the Minister if that happens.  He has no way of knowing positively what will happen, and he can only make the best decision open to him with the knowledge available at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should also like to comment on the announcement the Minister made with regard to the completion of negotiations with the European Investment Bank.  I very much welcome this development.  I think the Minister for Finance is a governor of the European Investment Bank, speaking from recollection.  On the occasion when I, as Minister for Finance, became a governor of the European Investment Bank, I said I regarded that bank as potentially a very important source of investment into this country.  I still so regard it.  In fact, and I do not wish to be invidious in this matter, I regard it as potentially far more important to us than the World Bank.  I think the European Investment Bank is likely to be better geared to our requirements and more closely allied to the kind of thinking we have about our requirements for the development of this country.  I welcome the conclusion of <Col N="471" /> the negotiations for investment by the European Investment Bank in the Sugar Company.  I am quite confident this is but the beginning of a very important flow of investment by the European Investment Bank into this country, investment which need not and, I am sure, will not be confined to the public sector only.</P>
    <P>The whole history of the food processing operation conducted by or under the aegis of the Sugar Company and, in recent years, through Erin Foods, is a chequered one, to say the least of it.  The present position is, as the Minister says, quite unsatisfactory because a substantial portion of the market available to us is an uneconomic market.  The Minister said that the amount of profit available on the market is inadequate.  It is true to say, I think, that in some sectors of it it is not a profit that is available but a loss.  Certainly there is no future for the food processing operation in the bulk market and a great deal of effort, of money and of time will be required to make the food processing operation a viable proposition.  Indeed, there is no guarantee that, with a tremendous amount of investment of money, of time and of effort, it will become viable.  This is not to say that the effort should not be made because, in measuring the importance of the food processing operation, it is simply not getting a true perspective of the picture to count the investment in terms of pounds.  There are other factors involved which are extremely important factors.</P>
    <P>As far as the farming community are concerned the food processing operation of Erin Foods has been of very great importance, sometimes in areas where there was no adequate alternative crop available.  This is a situation which may be changing because of our advent into the Common Market, but it has not changed substantially as yet and, even if it does change substantially, in some areas for a long time to come growing contracts available from the food processing operation will continue to be of very great importance.</P>
    <P>The employment available in the <Col N="472" /> food processing factories is also very important.  As the Minister said, the board of the Sugar Company is committed to taking all steps necessary to avoid losses short of those steps which might lead to redundancy of full-time employees.  This was an undertaking given by the previous Government.  It was a directive to the board of the Sugar Company.  I am well aware that there are considerable grounds for rationalisation of the operations of the food processing carried on by Erin Foods.  Some of these would involve the closing down of certain units and, perhaps, a reduction in the size of some others, plus the switching of certain lines of production from one factory to another.  I am well aware that there is a very strong case financially for carrying out this rationalisation and I think the board should be urged to do so to the greatest extent possible, subject always to the proviso that it will not result in redundancy of full-time employees of the company. This is vitally important particularly at a time when our unemployment rate is still quite unacceptably high, although it is falling, and especially where the employment involved is in areas in which there is no alternative to the Erin Foods employment.  So long as that situation continues I do not think a State company is entitled simply to make people redundant in order to get the balance sheet looking right.  This is important, but there are more important things than that.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the company to rationalise must be accompanied by efforts to provide alternative employment in certain areas for full-time employees rather than throw these people on the scrapheap.  I am aware that the company has been making efforts in this regard.  I am also aware that the Industrial Development Authority has been making special efforts in this regard too.  I take it from what the Minister has said that, as far as the present Government are concerned, they are honouring the pledge given by their predecessors that there will not be redundancy of full time employees.  Consequently, I would assume that the present Government will agree with the line of approach <Col N="473" /> I have suggested, namely, that the board make every effort to rationalise the food processing operation and, at the same time, in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority, make special efforts to generate alternative employment in those areas in which, in order to rationalise properly, employees will have to be laid off.  This is essential if rationalisation is to be fully effective.  Subject to that, the Bill does not deserve any opposition.</P>
    <P>Since it was originally my own Bill I naturally think the concepts in it are the correct ones and the matters to which I have been referring I have been referring to because I think they are of importance but not because of any opposition to any of the proposals in the Bill which I fully support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer, having a little to do with the Sugar Company and the food business, I am glad to note that there is nothing contentious in this Bill and that both sides of the House are aware that the company must be treated from a financial point of view.  We must not forget the purpose for which this company was set up which was social and developmental. In so far as it was set up for that purpose I think it has fulfilled its role admirably down the years.  It created jobs in small towns, it helped to put new life into the west and it helped farmers at a time when they really needed help.</P>
      <P>For a number of years I would say sugar beet was probably the most valuable crop grown on our farms. At this stage of our development when we are making a case at the EEC for regional development concessions, we cannot have a State company retracting on its commitments in development areas.  This would be a very bad headline for people who now see the State has not been able, in the context of the EEC, to overcome State company problems.  It might be a good thing to remember when we compare the Sugar Company's operations with those of private enterprise that this company has operated down the years without the grant facilities normally given to private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been critical in the past of <Col N="474" /> one aspect of the company's operation, that was the importation of raw sugar.  We were told at the time that this was to help the budgeting of the company.  Maybe this was so and maybe it was necessary but it was a pity because if sugar beet contracts had been freely available in the past a lot more of it would have been grown.  We would have a different picture today if this had happened. Contracts given to farmers were so small that many of them considered that they were not worthwhile and abandoned the growing of beet.  Now again, however, I hope and I believe that beet growing will come back so that we can provide sufficient sugar for our own requirements not just for table consumption but for home processing and export as well.</P>
    <P>At the moment sugar beet growing in the west of Ireland is falling back a little but there are many farmers in the west who appreciate their sugar beet contracts and it is a very important crop for those people.  If we are serious about the west we should be serious about the Tuam Sugar Beet Factory, bearing in mind that this part of the country and this company will be entitled to special concessions from the EEC.  This will also apply to the beet growing areas of Kerry and West Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley expressed very legitimate doubts with regard to the future of sugar beet growing as a crop.  He is quite right to have doubts especially having regard to the counter attractions, dairying, <i>et cetera</i> but I am a bit nearer to the fields than Deputy Colley and I believe that the growing of sugar beet will always be an important part of our farming and that in the case of beef and dairying there will be a levelling out.  Now that substantial beet contracts are available to farmers, I believe they will consider it a worthwhile crop.  Because of new technological developments sugar beet is now no more difficult to grow than grain.  The crop can be sown and sprayed and it does not entail any manual labour.  With the new varieties of seed and the new price structure in the EEC&mdash;they, too, are conscious of this crop&mdash;I see it as a <Col N="475" /> very useful crop for the farmer and a very important crop for the nation because if beef and dairying are to survive and prosper we need the byproducts of sugar beet.  Where there is sugar beet there is grain growing and we need all those crops for a good beef and dairy industry.  I do not have to remind the House that animals have to be fed over the winter.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing if the company in future could plan their programme well in advance and get together with farming representatives and indicate in time what they intend to do by way of contract and price conditions and forget this foot-dragging that has been going on.  Farming, like any other business, has to be planned well in advance.  This, also, would be a big help.  Lest we as a nation should be inclined to concede some of our programmes to developing countries, which seems to be a popular concept at the moment, we should bear in mind that our first responsibility is to our own people, the farmers, the workers and the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to hear that this type of investment is being made at this time because in places like Mallow and Carlow there is an abnormally long processing season.  This has hindered sugar beet production in both those areas.  Farmers are expected to lift sugar beet from 20th September until February.  It is not profitable to do this.  Sugar beet production can improve by two tons per acre between mid-September and mid-October.  I welcome the Minister's announcement this morning. This type of expenditure is bound to help the shortening of the campaign and to lead to a campaign of 100 to 110 days, which is normal on the Continent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the food processing industry referred to this morning, I have been involved in setting up one of those industries.  I agree that we have had tough times and a chequered career.  Some people may claim that the whole concept was a bit premature.  We have taken a decision <Col N="476" /> to have a food processing industry and there is no good going back on that now.  We have survived some very bad years from a grower's point of view.  We have survived some very rough times with regard to sales and processing.  It must be remembered that this was not the fault of anyone.  We were just victims of circumstances as happened also with our dairy products and other things.  We were compelled to sell in competition with Canadian peas, which had been dumped into the UK market, and dumped South-African products and even in competition with some products dumped from east European countries.  The bulk of our product is in a frozen condition.  This makes it expensive to hold.  We were compelled to get rid of some of our products at bad prices.  Now that we have joined the EEC I would like to look towards a new situation.  The Department of Industry and Commerce should ensure that this does not happen again and that our friends in the UK and elsewhere in the EEC should toe the line with regard to dumping.</P>
    <P>I have been on farming delegations and I believe that even in Europe some countries were not toeing the line with regard to horticultural products, and that these products are still being dumped.  This position must be carefully examined.  If we had got realistic prices over the years for our products we would not have so many problems today.  It does not matter whether we sell by bulk or by package.  It would be much better, of course, if we could go completely over to labelled products.  Even selling by bulk we would have been well able to compete had it not been for the fact that we were competing against products which were being given away for very little.</P>
    <P>With regard to potatoes, which have been mentioned specifically, we acknowledge that there are problems. The whole potato industry is chaotic. One year fantastic prices are paid for potatoes and the next year a farmer might have to give away potatoes. Some solution to the problems will have to be found.  When a housewife <Col N="477" /> pays high prices for potatoes she is entitled to a quality product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Tuam potato plant and how the problems there can be solved.  It will be appreciated that the Bill, which deals with the financial structure of the factory, is important to the nation.  My remarks about the potato industry are, therefore, relevant.  In the future the solution for the Tuam potato plant will be to have all the potatoes in the country graded and the very large and the very small potatoes made available for processing at Tuam.  The factory would then have adequate potato supplies.  I am confident about the future of the company.  The farming community will retain the interest which they have always had.  The investment about to be made and the extension of the borrowing powers should prove helpful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley pointed out that such industries are valuable situated as they are in places where employment is important.  It would not be easy to replace these industries with other ones because the people involved in them have been disciplined and trained over the years to do certain jobs.  It would not be easy for somebody trained in food technology to switch over to something else.  We should have confidence in the industries which we have got.  Everybody involved in these industries should be committed to them.  In the past we have received much loyalty from the farming community and the workers in the factories in order to keep these industries operating.  The onus is on us, as a Government, to do everything possible to ensure that these industries flourish and prosper in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that there is a very good future for the industry if it is given a break.  This break, I believe, is about to come because more people are going in for the more sophisticated <Col N="478" /> type of foods and easily prepared meals.  It might well be that when we get down to considering our position in the EEC we will only have one food exporting corporation and that all aspects of food exports will come under the one brand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it goes.  With that qualification I have a number of substantial reservations.  The company have received authorisations now to borrow foreign currencies and the Minister for Finance is now in a position to guarantee such borrowings and to provide for a larger board of directors for the company.  This is a move which is welcomed on all sides of the House.  I have no doubt that there will be no reservations on the part of any Member of the House to that proposition.</P>
      <P>I should like to inquire in relation to the negotiations referred to by the Minister, which the company completed with the European Investment Bank for a loan of £2.8 million to finance, in part, the modernisation programme, the cost of such a loan. I have a view about loans, not merely foreign loans or those from any of the investment banks, and I think that where State-sponsored activities are involved the full cost should be stated.  I should like to know the interest rates involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that the Sugar Company have begun work on a major programme of modernisation of the sugar plant.  I am a little perturbed that this particular renewal of plant and equipment in the sugar factories has been so contingent on the work done and the capital made available to support the food processing <Col N="479" /> project.  One would have hardly thought that the integration which has been talked of and which seems to have been in operation over the past four years was in operation.  It appears from the Minister's statement that the renewal of essential equipment on the sugar side of the operation has been somewhat rundown, somewhat retarded, and held back because of the need to divert.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has no direct responsibility for this but the implications of the Minister's statement should be carefully thought out, particularly by those engaged in the food processing arguments on the food processing side.  Nevertheless, I welcome the decision to invest £7 million over the next four years to build up a modern sugar complex in the sugar plants throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Colley's concern in relation to the statement made by the Minister that the Sugar Company are confident that their growers will continue to favour the beet crop despite the enhanced attractions of other farming pursuits within the EEC.  In the context of my own projections, those made by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and agricultural economists, that particular statement, in the years ahead, may be regarded as a serious understatement. There is no assurance that, if beef production continues to hold its attractions with the less labour intensive involvement in the area of beef production, looking at European trends growers in Ireland are going to favour the beet crop in the future.</P>
    <P>We need considerably more information in that field.  It is a problem which is going to beset future operations of the company and will, inevitably, reflect on the Exchequer in the years ahead.  I must confess that I have some misgivings looking at the whole problem of beet-growing and the processing and the change of farm structures.</P>
    <P>Regarding the legislation providing that the board shall consist of seven members, the existing legislation and the current proposals to provide a <Col N="480" /> maximum of ten members, I should like to suggest to the Minister, if he intends to fill all ten positions in due course, to keep open some of these positions for an expanded worker representation on the board of the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>I welcome the current trade union representation and congratulate the past representation on the board.  It is fair to record the tremendous contribution made over the years by a former member, Mr. Ruairí Roberts, who resigned in order to contest the Seanad Election, and the current representative on the board, Mr. Stephen McGonagle.  This member, I feel sure, will make a very good contribution.</P>
    <P>I should like to see representation made to the Minister, on the staff side, to expand the role of elected worker representatives on to the board of State-sponsored companies, l should like to see this initiated on a broad scale, in the Sugar Company itself.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 years there has been, at consultative level, a fair degree of elected worker representation of a consultative nature.  I must confess that I never liked the type of paternalistic aroma on the part of some former general managers which surrounded that particular exercise but it was a necessary exercise in democracy and one which had great potential.  No doubt, that local structure could have been expanded considering that in the past half decade the company have become more open and more responsive locally in the democratic sense.  If I might say so, they have experienced less fear during that time, and I speak as a trade union official who has travelled widely throughout the country, who has met many members of the Sugar Company's staff and who is a member of a union that organise the Sugar Company factories around the country and my knowledge is not speculative but is based on the direct experience that I have had since 1957.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider this question of worker participation.</P>
    <P>It was with much concern that I read the section of the Minister's <Col N="481" /> statement relating to the company's food projects.  The very serious ramifications of the past and current positions of this State-sponsored body in relation to food processing have not dawned yet on the electorate.  I am reluctant to accuse former Ministers for Finance of having failed to face up to the problems involved in this regard but it is my opinion that because of the employment implications concerned, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, vacillated a good deal in relation to the food processing side of the company.  That was obvious from statements he made in this House.  I do not blame him particularly for that because the problem is a major one for any Minister. Indeed, I allocate the blame in the context of the expectations, the diversifications and the tremendous dispersal of production units that were created during the past six to eight years.  For example, while I do not claim any particular competence in the field of accountancy, I have reservations regarding the authorisation of the purchase of Matterson's. Those reservations were shared by many other people also.</P>
    <P>As a trade union official my duties included attending meetings of the Committee on Industrial Organisation and of prices advisory bodies, <i>et cetera</i>, and it has always been my opinion that the Sugar Company should have bought Batchelors.  Such a move would have been logical at the time.  I am not anxious to name persons here but some of the earlier optimism of the former general manager of the company, laudable though that optimism was in a regional context&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to talk about this State-sponsored body when down through the years two or three personalities have been running the show&mdash;as has been the position in respect of a number of other State-sponsored bodies that I could mention. The personalities, policies and <Col N="482" /> attitudes of these people emerged in company policy and these were very obvious at national level, as any glance at a newspaper will show.</P>
      <P>I would question seriously the wisdom of some of the policy decisions taken by former chief executives of the company.  I shall leave it at that. I do not wish to delay the House but this morning I obtained from the Library the annual reports of the company from 1969 onwards.  The report of 1969 tells us that the company find it gratifying to report that food processing is continuing to make progress, that losses have been reduced to £249,000 as against a forecast of £250,000 and that turnover was up £6 million, which was double that for the previous year.  Nevertheless, the losses were substantial.  The difficulties were becoming obvious at that stage and even then I had reservations regarding the magnitude of the scale of production and the overcapacity that was being laid on.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the birds are coming home to roost now and that they will do so again in the years ahead if the trends that are obvious in the 1969 to 1973 reports continue.  The report for 1970 tells us that food turnover increased by approximately 1.7 per cent to 7.7 per cent but that a loss of £296,000 was little change from the previous year.  That report tells us, too, that export sales increased from 2.82 per cent to 4.04 per cent.  The 1971 report says that although a record turnover of £8 million was achieved, the food project losses for the previous three years which had been contained at about £300,000 increased to £777,000 and that this forced the company to re-appraise the direction they had been following in attempting to enable the project to break even.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the April, 1971, report there is reference to the confirmation by the consultants, A. D. Little of Cork, that in the short term little could be done with existing products that would make an appreciable contribution to reduction of losses.  They emphasised that competitive pressures were severe in all markets particularly in regard <Col N="483" /> to bulk products as distinct from dehydrated vegetables.</P>
    <P>The 1972 report tells us that under difficult trading conditions, turnover increased from £8.17 million to £8.92 million but that for the reasons indicated in the previous year's statement, the company were unable to make a substantial reduction in the level of losses which, after providing £491,000 for depreciation, amounted to £756,000, compared with £777,000 in 1970-71.</P>
    <P>I could not in any way hold the Minister responsible for the situation in the company during the past ten years because responsibility in this regard must be shared.  In the Minister's statement we are told that since the company's establishment there has been a total investment of more than £25 million in the project and that up to £10 million of this investment has been written off as irrecoverable.</P>
    <P>The main cause of these losses was over-production in the earlier years but who authorised that production? Who authorised a wide dispersal of plants in earlier years?  One hardly needs to be particularly erudite in the economic field or to be well-informed in terms of cost and production to appreciate the effect of the proliferation of small processing units, with an integrated national set-up at head office level, dealing with products which are inevitably very expensive to process even in the context of interest charges or even in terms of storage.  One needs to be rather bland to accept that position.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government has a very serious situation facing it, and the magnitude of the problem facing the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, has not been made any less by the vaccilation of the previous Government who did not face up to the problems.  The Minister makes the proposition in his speech :</P>
    <P>The Government would be prepared to consider favourably any constructive proposals which they may submit to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> May I suggest to the Minister and his advisors that this is a rather difficult way of going about it?  It is rather like saying to a couple in a broken marriage: &ldquo;If you have second thoughts about reuniting, come along and we will see you, and if you want to look after the children we will give you every help.&rdquo;  In other words, the buck is being passed back.  As far as I know, since the days of the former Secretary of the Department of Finance successive Ministers for Finance have been saying to General Costelloe and to Mr. Tony O'Reilly : &ldquo;If you have any constructive proposals bring them forward.&rdquo;  There is need for a mandate from the Government to the company, to say to them: &ldquo;Go out and diversify.  Get involved, if necessary, in pig breeding; get involved in the expansion of the agricultural machinery side of your business.  Do not keep coming back to us every six months with a project,&rdquo; which, with respect to the Department of Finance, will lie on the desk of the Department of Finance for perhaps another six months until it is studied by consultants brought in by the Department who will assess the viability of the project and, of course, there will be another six months delay, and the merry-go-round will get merrier.</P>
    <P>One ought to say to the managing director of the Sugar Company : &ldquo;Maybe we are losing a fortune on the food side.  You should rationalise, and while this may mean some redundancy we should cut back rationally rather than have major surgery in four or five years' time.&rdquo;  Having read many of the published reports in relation to food processing, I think this country may have over-stretched itself in earlier proposals put up to the Government, proposals which the Government accepted at that time.  According to the Minister's speech, in its latest financial year the Sugar Company has achieved an estimated turnover of £34 million, comprising £17½ million on sugar&mdash;nobody here will question the expertise of the Irish Sugar Company in handling their own affairs at sugar level&mdash;£9½ million on processed foods and £7 million on associated agricultural <Col N="485" /> activities.  What is the point in having a turnover of £9½ million on processed foods if you are going to lose £750,000 on them?  That might be all right for an exceptional year but if that trend were to continue I am afraid one would finish up next year, for the sake of argument, adding 10 per cent, with a turnover of £10,500,000, and a loss of over £1 million, and so on. Looking at the inflationary trend and the wage levels involved I submit, with respect to any company accountant in Ireland that things are not going to be that much different in two years' time, in terms of production costs, as against this year.  I do not entirely share the view of Deputy Hegarty in this regard that it is not anybody's fault that we find ourselves in that situation. Whether we like it or not, it is our fault in the sense that we are responsible. We may not be responsible for one or two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not say it will be that much different with the EEC.  I would suggest strongly to the Minister that he should personally ensure that the board be given more direction from the Government.  Having regard to the fact that the food side of the business is generating disturbing losses which look like continuing, they should be told to engage in viable diversification.  I would see nothing wrong with substantial joint venture projects being developed.  There is a statement in the 1972 report that a number of interesting projects are being examined.  I think it is the function of this Government to say: &ldquo;If they are interesting and if you are not going to lose as much as you lost on food processins, go ahead and keep up employment in the regional towns.&rdquo;  It may be difficult to diversify in some of the areas because food processing plant is virtually the sole employment there.  Anyway, where possible, they should get involved in agricultural machinery, the export side of which should be a major growth area, and perhaps they could get involved in the beef side.  Let us be quite open about <Col N="486" /> a State sponsored company; let us not limit its mandate.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would make a small point on section 11 as regards membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors, officers and servants of CSET.  I have always believed that there Should be some differentiation between Deputies and Senators in this regard.</P>
      <P>Section II (1) states :</P>
      <P>Where a director of the Company is nominated either as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or as a member of Seanad Éireann, he shall thereupon cease to be a director of the Company.</P>
      <P>Senators earn £1,860 per year.  I wonder if it is necessary that a Senator should cease to be a director of a company?  I agree that Deputies should be bound by this restriction but I have some reservations as far as Senators are concerned.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement from the Minister.  I do not want to be regarded by Fianna Fáil as an advocate of redundancy or of the closure of factories in the food processing industry. The record of Fianna Fáil in relation to the advice they have given to the Sugar Company is a bad one and they should not start on this now because they will not get far with it.  They will get cold comfort from the annual reports of the Sugar Company.  I have tried to be helpful in this debate and have endeavoured to give the warnings that are necessary in this operation.  I should like to thank the Minister for introducing the Bill and would urge him to consider the points I have raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill before the House.  In Carlow we are concerned with the sugar factory and the food processing plant of Erin Foods.  I welcome the statement of the Minister that the greater part of the £7 million investment in the next four years will be spent at Carlow and Mallow.  This is necessary because the existing processing facilities are not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the processing <Col N="487" /> industry.  I have been closely associated with this industry for a number of years, and I can assure the House that the help of the Department of Finance is necessary.  The position of the food processing plant in Carlow in the last few years has not been good and there is widespread uncertainty and dissatisfaction among the workers.</P>
    <P>With some of my colleagues in the House, we have discussed the matter with the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance and with farmers in Carlow.  The Ministers undertook to meet the people in Carlow before the end of the summer and I know they will honour that arrangement.</P>
    <P>There has been comment on the heavy losses incurred in food processing. I should like to make it clear that, to all intents and purposes, Erin Foods in Carlow have been closed for the past two years.  This year they will process peas which, in effect, means they will have a campaign of only four to five weeks.  There has been diversification at other plants throughout the country in the last few years. Formerly the Erin Food plant at Carlow processed beans also.  It is a mystery to me how any company or processing plant can remain viable if it is processing only one kind of vegetable.  It is no wonder heavy losses have been incurred in the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the last Government, workers and representatives from Carlow, together with some of my colleagues here, met the then Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance.  It was on the evening the House went into summer recess.  At that meeting we were given an undertaking that Erin Foods in Carlow would not close until an alternative industry was obtained to replace it.  In the meantime we heard various firms were interested, but nothing came from the negotiations. In passing I might add that the former Ministers did not have any further consultations about the matter. However, the present Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce <Col N="488" /> met us shortly after the new Government came into office, and they gave an undertaking to have a further meeting in Carlow before the end of the summer.  It would be a fruitful exercise for the Ministers to see the situation for themselves.  I pass the factory every day and I am despondent when I see the lack of activity.  I doubt if it is due to the fact that the factory find it difficult to get the farmers to grow the crops. Some members of the workers' committee in their spare time called on the farmers in the area and, from the feedback I got, the results were favourable.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the House and the Minister that this industry must be kept going.  Its doors must never be allowed to close unless there is some alternative industry available to absorb its employment content.  I am not referring to its present employment content.  A few years ago the campaign ran from eight to nine months each year and now it lasts only four or five weeks.  Something must be done about it.  I cannot stress the point too heavily for the Minister that this is an urgent matter which needs immediate attention from him and the Government.</P>
    <P>One matter which struck me is that the legislation provides for seven directors. I understand that 12 months ago there was a complete change in the board and now only two of the original board remain.  The Minister mentioned legislation to provide for seven directors and not more than ten.  I understand that at the moment there are nine.  Is there some error here?  Are there more directors on the board than the legislation provides for, or has the legislation been passed?  I welcome the Bill and I hope everything will be done by the Minister and his colleagues to ensure that this is a viable industry which will continue to give full employment at the processing end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly on a Bill which I welcome because it provides for an extra £7 million in the next four years to modernise and develop the sugar industry, to provide new machinery <Col N="489" /> to replace present obsolete plant. Although I am pleased to see this injection of money into an industry which needs it, I am disappointed that the greater part of the investment will be at Carlow and Mallow.  I had hoped that the Government would inject more capital into the Tuam factory.  In the past few years we have had certain difficulties there trying to achieve an acreage of beet growth which would keep the plant going as a viable unit. During the years efforts have been made by various organisations, farmers and others, to try to get farmers in the contiguous areas to grow more beet.  The farmers cannot be blamed for turning to more lucrative methods of farming.  Milk and beef have become very attractive in recent years. However, I am satisfied that if the right price is paid for beet and potatoes our farmers will grow them, as they would have in the past if the proper inducements had been offered.</P>
      <P>In the Tuam factory the machinery is not as modern as it should be arid it has therefore lagged behind in the modernisation drive.  This should not be permitted because the West of Ireland is a small farming area and beet has provided an amount of cash during the years.  It has always been regarded by small farmers as a good cash crop and they grew it when times were worse than now and when they had not the benefits of mechanised farming.  If farmers were given a fair deal they would continue to grow this crop.  As well as the beet itself, there are the by-products&mdash;pulp and beet tops&mdash;which farmers can use as feed for their stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Present EEC arrangements until 1975 provide that this country may produce 150,000 tons of beet sugar at the full EEC price and there is a supplementary quota of 52,000 tons. Our farmers are capable of achieving this target and I hope the Sugar Company will provide the right incentives. As I have said, my main concern is for the Tuam factory.  That is why I am dissapointed that Carlow and Mallow are to get the bulk of the £7 million.  The Tuam factory is one of the main industries in the town, providing not only work for a number of people <Col N="490" /> in the town but also for farmers in the outlying areas who go in to help during the campaign, thereby supplementing their farming incomes.</P>
    <P>Last year we had serious trouble in the food processing plant in Tuam because of a shortage of potatoes brought about by the high prices obtaining on the open market.  It was very hard to expect farmers to sell their potatoes for £13, £14 or £15 a ton when they can get £45 a ton and, as at the present time, £75 a ton for certain varieties on the open market. The company therefore should make every effort to ensure that higher prices will be paid for those products. Farmers are at a great disadvantage if they are to honour their contracts and it is hard for them to do so when they see such high prices prevailing on the open market.  That is why we had to import potatoes from England last year.  I understand that is only a temporary arrangement, that we will not continue to import potatoes.  If farmers in the West of Ireland are offered a few pounds per ton more they will provide potatoes.  It would be a pity to have a repetition of last year's situation because the West is particularly suited to the growing of such crops.  I do not think it should be necessary for us to import potatoes from England.  The employees in this factory are very worried.  Over the past 12 months they were working under a threat because they did not know what week the factory was likely to close down.  If potatoes had not been imported from England, it is quite possible that many of these workers would be out of work now.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's speech that the number on the board of directors of the Sugar Company will be increased from seven to ten. This is a good idea because it will bring new thinking into the board of the Sugar Company.  However, I recommend that, in appointing those new members, we have three members from the West of Ireland because they will be able to put forward the viewpoint of that area to the company.  They will ensure that Tuam will be maintained as a viable unit and that that area will get its fair share <Col N="491" /> of any benefits deriving from the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Last year the food project had an operating loss of £660,000, which is a tremendous loss in one year and could not be allowed to continue.  I hope in the years ahead, particularly for the sake of those interested in the farming community, that this company will prosper and that further developments will take place, particularly in the Tuam plant.  All Deputies from the West of Ireland are very interested in this and I hope the Minister will consider developing this plant in whatever way he thinks fit.  I am sure there are many other things could be carried on there and all these avenues should be explored so that this factory can be maintained as a viable unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill and to congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I am very glad of the extra investment being put into this company because it is very necessary, particularly in the area I know, the Carlow sugar factory area.</P>
      <P>In regard to Erin Foods, during the first few years of the effort by this company it was apparent to people working in the process industry that contracts for crops were given but no research was made into whether there was any sale for those crops after they were processed.  There were cases where farmers had to be compensated for their crops and, at the same time, they were told to keep them.  In such circumstances the company simply could not pay.  I agree an industry should be given some time to get off the ground, but there should have been some survey of the market available before the company rushed into contracting for the growing of crops.  It is necessary for the company to have some idea of the sales potential of those crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Erin Foods should be a viable industry in the areas where vegetables grow well, where a reasonable price is paid for them and where a reasonable price can be obtained on the market. The harvesting of some crops by Erin <Col N="492" /> Foods needs to be looked into.  It should have been realised earlier that it is not a practical proposition to operate over an area of 15 miles radius with Erin Foods doing all the harvesting themselves.  The farmers should be allowed harvest those crops and bring them into the factory.  I am very glad that the machinery in Carlow and Mallow is to be improved so that the intake of beet will be speeded up in this area.  The Erin Foods plants in this area should be kept going as it is a source of employment.</P>
    <P>It must be apparent that we will not be able to increase the acreage of beet under the EEC arrangements.  We will probably be producing less acreage of beet.  Farmers as well as the workers in those areas must have an alternative means of providing the rotation of crops that is necessary.  The growing of vegetables will be a very necessary part of our farming programme in those areas.  I believe, that with proper organisation and perhaps for some time limiting the output of Erin Foods, we will be able to produce good vegetables in competition with anybody. Our vegetables are good and our land is capable of growing good vegetables. It would be a retrograde step if we thought of curtailing or closing down any section of the Erin Foods vegetable activity.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a board of ten members is very welcome.  If people from all sections of the community, such as farmers and those who know the problems of the growers, were appointed on the board it would improve the board very much.  The growing of beet down through the years was of great advantage to hauliers and if some of their representatives were appointed to the board I am sure they would be able to produce a plan, in co-operation with the farmers and the company, which would be of great advantage to everybody.  The Minister should take great care when he is appointing new people to the board and he should consult locally before he decides to appoint them.  He needs people with knowledge of the agricultural side of the industry as well as the hauling and processing sides of the industry. <Col N="493" /> He needs also the views of the workers in the industry, who know things that the management are not in a position to see, or are not let know. It would be a big advantage if those types of people were put on the board.</P>
    <P>To any ordinary layman it was obvious that the losses on the vegetables were due to the methods used.  It would have been a miracle if that section had made money with the methods used by Erin Foods.  The sugar industry was always efficient.  It was a pity that investment in machinery had to be let run down, according to the Minister's statement, because of the losses in the vegetable processing section of the industry. That may have been inevitable, but we did make mistakes and they are apparent.  We should see our mistakes and admit them.  The vegetable processing industry must be viable.  It is not practical to say that a vegetable processing industry is not viable in this country, especially in the area about which I am talking.  There must be a replacement for what I see as a reduction in the beet acreage next year if we are to keep a proper rotation of crops.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be careful about the kind of people he appoints to the board.  They must be people who know the different sides of the industry.  I am not saying that anyone will know all the angles, but the agricultural industry, the workers, and those who haul the produce from the farms to the factories should be represented.  The method used to bring the produce from a radius of 15 to 20 miles into the factory is very important.  It must be dealt with quickly and at the right time by arrangement with CIE or private hauliers.</P>
    <P>The farmers in the different areas will grow vegetables if they can have continuity and if they know that they can arrange a proper rotation of crops.  Farmers are not backward people any more.  They want to plan their farming over a number of years. We would also need on the board people with an interest in the sales <Col N="494" /> organisation not only here but in Britain and in Europe, so that we would know what we were doing and that, if we contracted for a certain amount of cabbages or swedes, they would be taken.  It is important that all these people be represented on the board even if the Minister has to make more than three extra appointments.</P>
    <P>The farmers want to be sure that there will be continuity and that they will not be asked to grow so many thousand acres of swedes this year and then told to keep them.  That kind of thing has done great damage to Erin Foods.  We must be sensible and work out a method by which the farmers will have a regular income. We must be able to tell them what will be required next year and the year after.  That will entail having a proper sales organisation throughout this country and Europe.  I am sorry if I delayed the Minister too long but the points I have made are valid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the extension proposed in this amending Bill in the borrowing powers of the Sugar Company.  Everybody in the House is aware of the difficulty which has arisen for Erin Foods and the Sugar Company, mainly because of the partial failure of the Erin Foods project.  Deputy Governey spoke of the length of the campaign season.  The original concept behind the setting up of the Erin Foods project was a desire on the part of the people interested in the production of sugar beet to extend the campaign season by the introduction of other vegetables.  As we all know, the Erin Foods project, after a very ambitious start&mdash; probably too ambitious&mdash;began to run down and run into difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be the business of the new board to determine the reasons for the poor performance of the Erin Foods products on the market.  It is fair to say that it is not the fault of the producers of the vegetables.  It is accurate to say that the people who undertook to grow carrots, or peas, or beans, or whatever, for Erin Foods knew their job and produced the <Col N="495" /> commodities at the contracted price in an efficient manner.  It is also true to say that the workers in the factories were efficient.  I know this because I have a particular interest in the Erin Food plant in Carlow.  One must search in the area of marketing to determine the reasons for the poor performance of Erin Foods.  It is not part of my intention to try to affix blame or responsibility on the shoulders of any person or group.  I am merely pointing to the self-evident fact that the performance was poor and that the reasons for this poorness of performance must be determined by the new board and put right.  I believe it can be put right.</P>
    <P>As other speakers said, we can be pretty certain of our competence over a large area of the production field, whether in actually growing or processing vegetables.  One of the undesirable results of the Erin Foods standard of performance was the retarding effect it had on the sugar beet wing of the industry.  The situation in the sugar factory in Carlow is, as far as I know, that there is extensive retooling to be done and it will be very expensive.  It could not be undertaken to any great extent in the recent past, because of the drain of the Erin Foods project.  I am glad it will be possible to undertake it under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The reason for our anxiety about the whole project is, of course, the commitment that the Government have, and that the Sugar Company has, to the people in the industry, both growers and workers.  There is considerable anxiety in Carlow concerning the future of those who, in a sense, committed their lives some years ago to what appeared to be a promising and growing Erin foods industry.  We must accept that we have a responsibility to these workers and we must ensure, if there is a running down of the Erin Foods part of the enterprise, the provision out of resources available to the Government of alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Earlier on I mentioned the length of the campaign.  I believe the Erin <Col N="496" /> Foods vegetable processing project could be made successful and it will be made successful if the reasons for its failure are determined and corrected. If this is done, the seasonal nature of sugar manufacture will be levelled out to a great extent.  By processing different varieties of vegetables it should be possible to provide virtually continuous employment, first of all, in the handling of sugar beet and then during the remainder of the season in the handling of crops like peas, carrots, celery and so forth.  These have been very successfully handled so far in the Carlow plant.  This would ensure continuity of work&mdash;indeed, almost a full year's employment&mdash;for those involved in the industry.  This is the idea that was originally aimed at and it is regrettable that it has not yet been achieved.  We ought not, however, to despair of our ability to compete with the vegetable processing giants of Britain and the Continent.  We have the land.  It is fertile.  We have a congenial climate.  We have the people to do the work.  Without being flamboyant we can, I think, say that the assets are there for the using if they are properly harnessed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I ask the Minister and the Government to take note of the widespread anxiety that reasonably exists about employment prospects in this industry in Carlow and elsewhere and to remember that, if it is necessary to have retrenchment, special measures must be taken to provide alternative employment for those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and the greater borrowing capacity it gives to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.  Increasing board membership will, I hope, prove fruitful.  I should like to compliment the board on their success, particularly in the production of sugar, with consequential benefit to the farmers by providing them with a lucrative crop, though possibly not as lucrative now as other farming operations in which the farmer can now invest.  At the same time, this is something concrete to which the farmer can look forward from year to year.  I note that £7 million is earmarked over the next four years for the <Col N="497" /> improvement of the sugar plant.  I have no doubt the farmers will continue to grow beet.  Many of them are anxious to get these contracts.  Some failed to get them recently unfortunately. Farmers in South Kildare are very anxious, I know, to continue these beet contracts.</P>
      <P>We should not write off food processing because of the lack of success Erin Foods have had.  The employment position in Carlow and South Kildare is, I know, adversely affected.  Perhaps our initial plans were too ambitious but I think we should still pursue this particular facet of our economy. Carlow has much to offer in the line of expertise and in the line of crops that can be grown successfully.  Even if food processing continues on a smaller scale we could eventually build up to something very considerable later.  In the beginning Erin Foods were going quite well in Carlow and South Kildare.  The diversity of crops was a tremendous benefit and an asset from the point of view of rotation.  I am told it is not the producers who are to blame.  The crops were as good as could be got anywhere and I am a little disappointed that the venture has not proved a success.  I do not know the reason for failure. Perhaps the new board will discover that.  We really ought to be able to grow food well because we have many advantages as compared with other countries successfully operating in this field.  We have a market on our doorstep, a market we did not have before, and it is vitally important that we should not put all our eggs in one basket.  If we do so, we will be in a very vulnerable position.  If we can successfully branch out into growing suitable vegetables that will give a longer season and ensure continuity of employment and the factory should be in a position to keep going from practicaly one end of the year to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that the life of our bogs has been set at another 20 years.  There has been a big capital commitment in housing the workers on these bogs and some alternative employment will have to be found for them in due time.  Experiments carried out in Lullymore expenmental farm have proved conclusively that vegetables, <Col N="498" /> particularly celery and carrots, can be grown very successfully, indeed, on worked out bogs.  An effort will have to be made to cultivate suitable vegetables on areas of bog which can be dealt with mechanically.  There is no reason why we should be afraid to compete with producers in other countries from both the food growing and processing points of view.  I feel strongly about this and I hope the new board will give the matter consideration. I hope they will not decide that all their activities must be devoted to one particular process confined to Cork or the southern part of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope Carlow will not be written off.  In the immediate vicinity there is a vast potential.  There are people with the expertise to grow the crops I have mentioned, people who have grown them successfully and who would still grow them if they had a market for them.  In a short time there will be cutaway bog there and this has been proved to be an ideal ground for the growing the best, taking on the great social problem if we make an effort to ensure that we will have a ready market for them.  We will have employment for our workers who will become redundant in 15 to 20 years' time and we will prove to the world that we in Ireland are capable of growing the best and taking on the best and selling our goods in competition with anyone else as we told the people we were prepared to do on our entry to the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Members on all sides of the House for the generous and responsible way in which they approached this Bill.  I detected a note of grave concern on the part of all Deputies, indeed of serious disappointment, that the great hopes of the food processing industry are not being realised.  We all share the hope that Ireland's special position as one of the best producers of high quality food in the world will present us with an opportunity of generating a profitable and viable food processing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a combination of reasons for the lack of success.  The principal one is that to which Deputy J. Gibbons <Col N="499" /> referred, that is, the question of marketing. We can produce goods at a price and we can sell the goods at a price but the price we can charge for the goods we produce depends on the price which the market is prepared to pay for our goods.  The tragedy is that these prices have not kept in line.  I think it would be very wrong to proceed to apportion blame either on the agricultural sector for failing to produce goods at a price which they found unattractive or to blame management for failing to sell the goods in foreign markets when in fact they could not sell them except at a loss because of the prices which they had to pay to producers to produce the food in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We are on the horns of a dilemma. I can assure Deputy Desmond and others that the Government have said very clearly to the board that they expect the board to take realistic and businesslike decisions, but we would also expect the board to have regard to the obligation to do no injury or injustice to any people who were recruited into the labour force and who have not readily available to them alternative opportunity of employment in their own location.  I think it is possible over a period to match these two very serious and substantial obligations and we will certainly render every assistance we can to the Board to help them to meet their responsibilities.  I think they are meeting them.  The fact that they have such a wide spread of factories, about 10 in all, some of them in undeveloped areas, is an indication, first of all, that the industry was geared to try to provide outlets for agricultural and horticultural production.  It is, of course, a great disappointment to the board and to us all that, although these outlets were provided, the prices available in the market are not sufficient to encourage people to avail of the industrial outlets which are now available for their agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey was naturally concerned about the position of the Tuam factory.  It must be emphasised that the main difficulties in Tuam today are not related to the plant, which is quite capable of coping with all the beet <Col N="500" /> offered to it.  Even if it is an old plant it is still capable of coping with everything that is offered to it.  The difficulty which faces Tuam today is not one over which the board has any direct control.</P>
    <P>It might be useful if I gave a breakdown of the proposed expenditure towards which the loan of £2.8 million is being obtained from the European Investment Bank.  In reply specifically to Deputy Desmond, I will mention that the rate of interest on the loan is £7? per cent, which is unusually attractive and, even allowing for whatever disadvantage may attach to a loan beyond our shores, when you get it at that price today it is very worth while taking up.  We should congratulate all concerned that Ireland, of the new members of the EEC, should be the first to negotiate a loan with the European Investment Bank.  It is a great tribute to the Sugar Company and to OUT producers that the EEC and the European Investment Bank should have sufficient confidence in them in this time of change and difficulty to give them this very substantial loan.</P>
    <P>Perhaps all this money might not have been required if Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann had not lost so much on the food processing industry over the last decade but there is no use crying over spilled milk.  What was tried was well worth trying.  Some of the mistakes will teach us some lessons but so will some of the successes teach us lessons for the future.  It would be wrong to think that the day of food processing here is over.  I think it is only beginning.  It is worthwhile keeping the plant and the organisation ticking over if only to be in a take-off position as soon as opportunity should present itself to the full.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of investment is : Carlow £3.699 million, Mallow £2.8 million, Thurles £.29 million and Tuam £.72 million.  One should not accept that either Thurles or Tuam are in a position inferior to Carlow or Mallow. There is a very substantial need to improve equipment in both Carlow and Mallow.  The Thurles plant is in a much better condition.  It is more upto-date than either Carlow or Mallow. <Col N="501" /> The Tuam plant is capable at the moment of coping with what is on offer to it and the money which will now be expended will simply help to maintain the equipment and improve it where it needs improvement and replacement. Carlow and Mallow are operating very well indeed at present, not only in relation to the plant itself but also in respect of the supply of beet to the plant.  The same cannot be said of Tuam.  I hope it will be possible to arrange the market in a way which will ensure that Tuam will have sufficient produced in its own catchment area without necessitating what has occurred in the past, that is, taking beet from the catchment area of the other factories.</P>
    <P>Deputy Governey made a very strong appeal for Carlow and I think he is quite right to be concerned with Carlow. His remarks were supported by Deputies J. Gibbons and Power.  In the Carlow area the farmers are producing sufficient on the beet side to meet all the requirements of the Carlow plant. Unfortunately they are not finding present prices attractive enough to produce sufficient peas for the Carlow plant.  Even though that is so, because of the performance of growers in other parts of the country some of the beet has been taken from the Carlow catchment area.  One does not wish to set up any chain of rivalry between Carlow, Mallow, Thurles and Tuam.  That is wholly undesirable and the objective should be to stimulate each catchment area to develop sufficient for its own requirements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Governey mentioned the construction of the present board which stands at nine members.  It was at ten members until the tragic death of Mr. Naughton.  Quite frankly, I am not pleased with the present position. I think it is wrong that any State company should assume that it may go beyond its legal powers.  The present legal position entitles the board of the Sugar Company to be composed of seven people.  That does not entitle them to go to nine or 10 people.  I know that the decision to expand was taken in anticipation of legislation but I would prefer that steps of that kind should not be taken <Col N="502" /> until the legislation was put through. Therefore, I would hope to have this position rectified as quickly as possible. I accept the need to expand the board.  I will bear in mind what Deputy Desmond said about worker representation.  I have already indicated to the workers that we accept this in principle and propose to apply it in practice.</P>
    <P>As the Members of the House probably know, the Minister for Labour is at present preparing a scheme which will probably be applicable to all State bodies to ensure that there is adequate worker representation on the board of management.  I would like to point out that it is not necessary to make any provision in this Bill to give effect to the application of that principle.  It is one which we will bear in mind when the board of the company is under consideration by me.</P>
    <P>Also I will endeavour to bear in mind the remarks of Deputy Bermingham, who spoke, very properly, of the importance of having adequate representation for the transport element involved in the collection and distribution of beet and the other products.  We all know that one of the difficulties of sugar production is that it is for a very limited period of the year.  In fact, disadvantages can arise if the period is extended because the quality and value of the crop can be considerably diminished if the production period is extended over too lengthy a period of the year.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring to produce a balanced industry.  There is the prospect of doing much better in the future than in the past.  We can have every confidence in the management and workers of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  They will endeavour to keep this, one of our greatest industries, at full output.  They have worked well in the past.  They ran into a period of temporary difficulty which, I hope, is now coming to an end.  Some of the steps which we have taken today will assist us in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my gratitude to all Deputies for the points which they made.  I realise that the House is under some pressure today <Col N="503" /> because of the urgency of the Social Welfare Bill.  I will deal with any outstanding points raised by direct reply to Deputies' questions.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the extensions and improvements of the existing social insurance and social assistance schemes for which financial provision was made in the budget.  It also includes provision for the abolition of the remuneration limit of £1,600 for social insurance.</P>
      <P>Bills such as this which consist largely of amendments to existing legislation tend to be difficult to understand in places and a special effort has been made this year to make the text of the Bill easier to follow than in former years.  In addition an explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill to clarify those provisions Which might still cause Deputies some difficulty and to illustrate the effects of others.  I hope that, as a result of these efforts, Deputies will have been helped in their examination of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the budget proposals provide for a very substantial increase in the rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, for a considerable alleviation of the means test and for the reduction of the qualifying age for pension from 70 to 69 years.  The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory pension is being increased by £1 from £5.15 to £6.15 for those under age 80 and from £5.65 to £6.65 for those aged 80 and over.  Because, however, of the significant easing of the means test, whereby the first £4 of weekly means will be ignored, all those existing pensioners under the age of 80 whose existing pensions range between £4.90 and £1.90 will now qualify for the maximum pension of £6.15, while those aged 80 <Col N="504" /> and over with pensions ranging from £5.40 to £2.40 will qualify for the new £6.65 pension.  In addition increases of pension for qualified children of pentioners are being raised by 50p a week to £1.65 for each of the first two children and to £1.25 for each further Child.</P>
    <P>Thus some 108,000 persons will shortly be enjoying the maximum rates of pensions as against some 21,000 at present.  The easing of the means test will also improve the position of existing pensions with pensions of less than £1.90 a week and will not only help to encourage thrift and avoid penalising persons who save towards their old age but will also enable an estimated 10,000 persons who are at present debarred from receiving pension by reason of means to qualify for pension. The reduction in qualifying age will bring several thousand new pensioners into the scheme.</P>
    <P>Non-contributory widows and orphans pensions are being similarly improved; the weekly maximum personal rate of pension will be increased by £1 and the first £4 of weekly means will also be ignored.  The weekly amounts payable for qualified children, however, are being increased by 65p by the inclusion of a special increase of 15p in recognition of the special problems of such one-parent families. The new maximum rate of non-contributory pension for a widow will thus be £6.15 weekly with £2 for each qualified child.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with the existing amounts of annual earnings which may be disregarded in assessing a widow's means, the ignoring of the first £4 of weekly income will give a widow much greater scope for supplementing her income by earnings from either full-time or part-time employment without affecting her title to pension. Thus a widow with no other means and with no children could earn up to £4 a week and still draw a full non-contributory pension of £6.15 a week, while if she had two children she could earn £7 a week without affecting her right to a full pension, including increases for children, of £10.15.  A widow with four children will be able to earn up to £10 a week without <Col N="505" /> affecting her entitlement to a full pension of £14.15.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the changes now being made in the means test will enable some 15,600 widow pensioners to qualify for increased pensions and some 3,000 widows not already receiving pension will qualify for pension.  I might also point out that reduction of the qualifying age for old age pension to 69 will mean that some 1,100 widow pensioners will transfer over to old age pension thus entitling them to the benefits of the free electricity and free television licence schemes, assuming they meet the other conditions necessary.</P>
    <P>The new weekly rates, and the easing of the means test in the case of non-contributory widows pension, will apply also to deserted wife's allowance and to the scheme of allowances for unmarried mothers to which I will refer later.  The position of deserted wives is also being improved by some amendments which do not involve legislation but which I am having made in the statutory regulations covering the scheme. These changes will, in particular, considerably ease the position in regard to what constitutes desertion.</P>
    <P>In the case of unemployment assistance the maximum weekly rates of payment for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by £1 in the personal rate, with 50p for the adult dependant and for each child dependant.  This will raise the maximum rate for a single person to £5.35 in an urban area and to £5.05 elsewhere; while the rate for a married couple will go up to £9.25 in an urban area and to £8.85 elsewhere.  The rates for children go up to £1.65 for each of the first two, and to £1.25 for each additional child.  These increases in the rates of unemployment assistance have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualification.</P>
    <P>Two major changes in the general scheme of children's allowances are being made in the Bill.  The first is a general increase of £1.50 a month in the amount for each qualified child. This will bring the monthly amounts up to £2 for the first child, £3 for the second and £3.75 for each additional <Col N="506" /> child.  The rate for a one child family will thus go from 50p to £2 a month; for a 3 child family from £4.25 to £8.75 a month, and for a 5 child family from £8.75 to £16.25 a month. The new rates compare favourably with the rates payable under the general family allowances scheme in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where a one-child family receives no allowance, a 3-child family receives £8.23 a month and a 5-child family £16.90 a month.  In the Six Counties and in Great Britain, however, a payment of £4.33 a month is made for each qualified child in a family after the fifth.</P>
    <P>The number of families already receiving allowances who will benefit from the increase in rates is approximately 359,000, involving just over one million qualified children.  This very high proportion of our population which is under the age of 16, some 33 per cent, is, of course, a factor that weighs very heavily when any consideration is given to improving or extending the children's allowances scheme. The second major improvement being made in the children's allowances scheme is the extension of the qualifying age limit for allowances from 16 years to 18 years where the child concerned continues in full-time education, is apprenticed or is physically or mentally incapable of self-support.  It is estimated that some 85,000 additional children will qualify for allowances under this extension.</P>
    <P>From the extensive publicity it has already received Deputies will be aware of the proposal to offset the increased rates of children's allowances by a reduction in the tax free child allowances in the income tax code in the case of persons whose taxable income exceeds £2,500 a year.  The object of this exercise, popularly or unpopularly known as the &ldquo;claw back&rdquo; is the introduction of a measure of selectivity into the payment of children's allowances, and the necessary legal provision is being made in the Finance Bill.  I merely wish to point out here that everybody concerned will get the increase in children's allowances, that the recoupment will be slightly less than the full amount of the <Col N="507" /> increases and that it will only be affected in the case of families where the taxable income is more than £2,500, which, in fact, means that the actual income will be well in excess of that figure.  I may mention too that in Northern Ireland not only does a &ldquo;claw back&rdquo; operate in respect of recent increases in family allowances, but the total family allowances themselves are treated as taxable income.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of pensions and short-term benefits under the social insurance system are similar to those I have outlined for the non-contributory schemes, that is to say, there is the £1 a week increase in the personal rates and 50p for adult dependants and qualified children.  In the case of widow's contributory pensions, however, the increase for qualified children is 65p, including the extra 15p provision for children in one-parent families.  In the case of retirement or old age contributory pensions the increase for an adult dependant who is aged 69 or over will be £1 a week.</P>
    <P>The pensionable age under the social insurance system is being reduced to 69 years.  This affects not only the qualifying age for contributory old age pension but also the maximum age up to which the short-term benefits, such as disability and unemployment benefit, can be paid.  The reduction  in the age limit at such short notice may give rise to some transitional problems in the matter of transferring current recipients of these benefits to pension but I am taking steps to ensure that in such cases payment of benefit will continue until such time as the pension comes into payment.  Liability for payment of social insurance contributions will, of course, also cease at 69 years instead of 70 as at present.</P>
    <P>The new weekly rates of unemployment and disability benefit will be £6.55 for a single person with an increase of £4.25 for an adult dependant and of £1.85 for each of the first two qualified children and of £1.50 for each further child.  This will give a married couple with two children £14.50 a week, and a couple with four <Col N="508" /> children £17.50 a week.  The personal rate of widow's contributory pension will go up to £6.60, and the amount payable for her qualified children to £2.15 for each child.  Thus a widow with two qualified children will get £10.90 a week as against £8.60 at present and one with four such children will get £15.20 as against £11.60 at present.</P>
    <P>In the case of retirement pensions and contributory old age pensions the personal rates go up to £7.20 a week where the pensioner is under the age of 80, and to £7.70 a week if he has attained that age.  The amount payable for an adult dependant will go up to £4.65 for one who is under the age of 69 and to £5.15 for one who has attained that age.  Thus a married couple both of whom are aged over 69 would get £12.35 by way of weekly pension, or £12.85 if, in addition, the pensioner is aged over 80.</P>
    <P>Social insurance benefits and pensions are paid out of the Social Insurance Fund to which employers and insured persons contribute, the Exchequer meeting the annual deficit, which hitherto has varied between 33 and 42 per cent of the total expenditure. To meet the extra cost of the improvements in the social insurance services provided for in this Bill it will, of course, be necessary to increase the rates of social insurance contributions payable by employers and insured persons. Hitherto it has been the practice that employers and insured persons shared their part of the burden almost equally.  On this occasion employers are being required to carry a much larger proportion of the extra cost. This is being done partly to bring the basis of financing the social insurance system more into line with the pattern in most other member states of the EEC and partly to take account of the relief in liability for rates which employers in general will enjoy as a result of the budget proposals for transferring part of the cost of the health services from the rates to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>A total increase of 57p in the rates of contribution which cover all benefits of the social insurance system is necessary and I propose in the Bill that <Col N="509" /> this should be apportioned as to 42p on the employer and 15p on the employee.  Lesser increases will be imposed Where all the benefits are not covered.  However, in the case of female agricultural workers and female domestic workers I have arranged for the making of regulations to remove a restriction on their entitlement to unemployment benefit.  This follows a recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women which I am glad to be able to meet.  As a consequence, however, it is necessary to increase somewhat sharply the special reduced rate social insurance contributions hitherto payable in respect of such employees because of their restricted right to unemployment benefit.  Thus, while the employees' element in each case is being increased by only 15p. as in the case of other workers, the employers' shares of these contributions are being increased by 45p and 54p respectively.</P>
    <P>The new ordinary rates of social insurance contribution will be £2.80 for men. of which the employer will pay £1.62 and the employee £1.18.  For women the new ordinary rate will be £2.69 of which the employer will pay £1.57 and the employee £1.12.  These rates include the element for occupational injuries benefit but do not include the health contribution of 15p. Neither do they include the present redundancy contributions of 8p for men and 6p for women which I understand the Minister for Labour proposes to increase shortly.  I may mention that the 15p health contribution will cease to be payable on the social insurance stamp when the Revenue Commissioners take over the collection of pay-related health contributions from 6th April, 1974.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system provided for in the Bill, it is proposed also to increase rates of benefit pavable under the occupational injuries scheme. The increases in weekly rates will be the same as those provided in the general social insurance benefits.  It is not proposed on this occasion to increase the weekly contributions to the Occupational Injuries Fund from which the <Col N="510" /> cost of occupational injuries benefits is met.</P>
    <P>While it is not in the brief that has been distributed to Deputies, I might point out that, although there will be no increase in weekly contributions under the occupational injuries scheme, the basic rates of injuries benefit and disablement benefit are now being increased from £8.10 to £13.35, and if he has two children from £14.55 to £17.05.</P>
    <P>Pensions for widows under the occupational injuries scheme are being increased by £1 a week to £8.60 with an increase of 65p for each child bringing the new payment for children in this case to £2.15 for each child.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides two further improvements in the occupational injuries scheme which will be of considerable value to the beneficiaries concerned.  These relate to unemployability supplement and constant attendance allowance.  In order to qualify for unemployability supplement a disabled person must be permanently incapable of work, but a claimant may be treated as being so incapable if he is unable, due to loss of faculty, to earn more than £104 a year.  This figure has not been altered since the scheme commenced in 1967.  It has now been decided to increase it to £234.00 a year, thus bringing it into line with the current corresponding limit in the British industrial injuries scheme.</P>
    <P>Constant attendance allowance is payable to persons in receipt of 100 per cent disablement pension who require such attendance as a result of loss of faculty.  The normal maximum weekly rate of this allowance has been increased from time to time to keep pace with the prescribed relative and old age care allowances under the general social insurance and assistance schemes, and is accordingly now being increased to £3.50.  No increase has, however, been made since 1967 in the higher limit of £4 a week which was then provided for cases of exceptionally severe disablement and it is <Col N="511" /> proposed to increase this limit now to £7.  This restores the original position whereby the higher limit was double the normal limit.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in this Bill for the abolition of the remuneration limit of £1,600 for social insurance which applies only in the case of non-manual workers.  This distinction between manual workers and non-manual workers is a survival from the days when the levels of pay and working conditions of &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; workers were greatly superior to those of manual workers.  These differences have now largely been eroded and, indeed, the borderline between what constitutes manual work and non-manual work is now very blurred in many areas because of technological advances and developments in skills, as for example, in the field of electronics and computers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the limit is inflexible and does not have regard to marital condition or family size.  Thus a married man with a family earning £1,601 from non-manual employment is not insurable, but a single man in the same employment earning £1,599 is insurable.  There is no similar limit in the national insurance scheme in Britain or Northern Ireland or, indeed, in any of the member states of the EEC.  Finally, the forthcoming introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme for which the legislation has been enacted and in respect of which the detailed arrangements for benefit payment and contribution collection are now being finalised, is a further strong reason for removing the limit and leaving manual and non-manual workers to be treated equally under the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the proposal to abolish the limit for social insurance purposes will meet with general approval and, if it were not for other considerations, I would seek to have it abolished immediately.  However, a person who is insured under the Social Welfare Acts is <i>ipso facto</i> eligible for the limited health services available to members of the middle-income group.  Thus, any extension of the coverage of the social insurance <Col N="512" /> system has implications for the health services and just what the full effect of these would be is a matter which is at present under active consideration. The Minister hopes to be in a position shortly to reach a decision in this matter but, in the meantime, it is necessary to secure the legislative authority to abolish the limit for social insurance purposes. The provision in the Bill will do this and will also enable him to bring the provision into operation on a date to be fixed by ministerial order.  I am sorry that at this stage I cannot be precise at to when that will be.</P>
    <P>The position of deserted wives in this country has been the subject of considerable public interest in recent years.  The deserted wife's allowance scheme introduced in 1970 was somewhat of a step into the unknown but experience of its administration since then has brought the problems associated with it into sharper focus.  The scheme has helped many families and there are at present some 2,150 allowances in payment.  Many difficulties have, of course, been encountered, particularly in regard to the question of what constitutes desertion, but the bulk of these have now been resolved and I am making amending regulations to clarify the position in these respects.</P>
    <P>One criticism of the scheme has been that while it equates the deserted wife with the widow, it only does so in relation to the non-contributory scheme which is subject to a means test, and no regard is had for the fact that in very many cases the deserting husband had been insured and, if he had died, his wife would have qualified for contributory widows' pension.  It has been decided to remedy this situation by providing a specific benefit in the social insurance system for deserted wives on broadly the same lines as the widows' contributory pension scheme. This benefit will be payable without a means test on satisfaction of contribution conditions by either the husband's or the wife's insurance as at the date of desertion, the fact of desertion being established on the same basis as for deserted wife's allowance under the revised regulations.  Any special additional <Col N="513" /> conditions which may be necessary to safeguard the scheme from abuse or fraud will be prescribed by regulations.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able in this Bill to provide for four developments, which are designed to meet recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of Women.  The first of these is the introduction of a scheme of allowances for unmarried mothers who keep their children.  This will be a non-contributory social assistance scheme and will broadly be on the same lines as the scheme of deserted wife's allowance, particularly as to rates of payment and means levels.  We are, however, entering into rather unexplored territory in this matter in so far as my Department are concerned and, accordingly, while the basic conditions are being laid down statutorily there will be power to prescribe detailed conditions by regulation.  I propose to use this provision flexibly to ensure that the scheme operates effectively to help the genuine cases and is safeguarded against abuse.</P>
    <P>The second development relates to the special condition which requires that in order to be eligible for unemployment assistance widows and spinsters with no dependants must have paid 52 social insurance contributions at the ordinary rate in the four preceding contribution years.  It is most difficult for a woman whose main occupation is in agriculture or domestic service to satisfy this condition because she pays special rates of contribution in either of these employments. The Bill will ease the condition by allowing any paid contribution other than voluntary contribution to be reckoned.  This will help those widows and spinsters who work in agriculture and domestic service without weakening the control necessary to ensure that persons seeking unemployment assistance are genuinely in the labour force.</P>
    <P>The third development, this time in the field of social insurance, is the removal from widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers who are receiving pensions or allowances as such under one or other of the Department's schemes and who take up insurable <Col N="514" /> employment, of the liability to pay the employed contributor's share of the social insurance contribution.  This concession will be worth up to £1.12 a week to the widow, deserted wife or unmarried mother involved as a result of the consequent reduction in the social insurance contribution, and should they become ill or unemployed they will, as widows do at present, be paid the half rate of benefit in addition to their pension or allowance.  The employer will, of course, be liable to pay his share of the contribution and these special contributions will count in full for all other benefit purposes.</P>
    <P>Finally, also on the social insurance side, I propose to remove a further long-standing source of grievance among insured women workers who marry.  At present such women are paid marriage benefit on marriage regardless of how much insurance they may have had before marriage, but are disqualified for disability benefit, maternity allowance or unemployment benefit until they have worked in insurable employment for at least 26 weeks after marriage. The Bill will abolish this disquailification, and also marriage benefit, thus allowing married women to invoke their pre-marriage insurance for benefit purposes immediately after marriage subject, of course, to the normal conditions governing entitlement.</P>
    <P>All except three of the proposals in the Bill will come into operation from the beginning of July next.  Apart from the proposal to abolish the remuneration limit for social insurance which, as I have already indicated, will be brought in by Ministerial Order, the exceptions are the proposal to ease the conditions for unemployment assistance in the case of certain widows and spinsters, and the proposal to abolish the condition which requires married women to have 26 contributions after marriage, both of which will come into operation at the beginning of October, 1973.  Thus the main budget increases will be brought into operation much earlier than in previous years.</P>
    <P>This will put a very heavy strain on the resources not only of my Department but also of the other Departments involved, particularly the <Col N="515" /> Stamping Branch of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, in regard to staff, accommodation, equipment and in getting the essential printing done. I would like to thank the staff there and also in the post offices throughout the country, who will be inundated with work as a result of these provisions, for their efforts to ensure that these payments will be made in time and efficiently.  This extra work must be done while the normal day to day work of all the Departments concerned, which cannot be held up, continues.  The magnitude of the task will, perhaps, be appreciated from the following figures.  We must get a total of 23 million new social insurance stamps at 22 different rates, printed and into stock in post offices before 1st July next.  At the same time, it is necessary to get new or revised pension order books into the hands of some 260,000 existing pensioners apart from dealing with the claims of the thousands of new pensioners who will be brought in by the new conditions. In addition, provision must be made for the payment of increased rates of children's allowances to some 359,000 existing families, again apart from the many thousands of new cases which the extension of coverage of the scheme will bring in.  Then there are, of course, the new schemes and other changes in the existing schemes to be implemented.  I must, therefore, sound a note of warning&mdash; while those payments which are made by cheque from head office or in cash at local offices of the Department will be increased immediately the new rates are due, as will also all payments made by way of pension order books or allowance books, there may be some little delay&mdash;a matter of a week or two&mdash;in getting the new increased rates of children's allowances into payment.  In addition, of course, due to the exceptionally heavy pressure of work some isolated individual cases of delays may, not unreasonably I suggest, be expected.</P>
    <P>It will, I think, help Deputies to appreciate what this Bill involves in money terms if I summarise the costs involved.  On the social assistance side. <Col N="516" /> in which for convenience I include children's allowances, it is estimated that the increased cost to the Exchequer of the proposals in the Bill will be £41.1 million in a full year and £30.68 million in the current year.  On the social insurance side, the gross increase in expenditure is estimated at £21.14 million in a full year of which £16.45 million will be met by increased contribution income, leaving £4.69 million to be borne by the Exchequer in a full year and £3.52 million in the current year.  These figures are a measure of the impressive achievements in the field of social welfare which this Bill will bring about.</P>
    <P>I am proud therefore to sponsor this Bill and I have great pleasure in recommending it to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to support the improvements which this Bill envisages and which will come into operation shortly.  Nobody in the House appreciates more than I do the satisfaction it must give everybody to see that it is possible to do these things as generously as they have been done this year.  I have had great pleasure year after year in bringing up the social welfare payments, particularly in relation to the aged, the blind and the widowed.  As well as that I have had the pleasure of introducing many new schemes which I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary sees fit to improve and which I did hope would be improved as time went on.</P>
      <P>When we were pressing the EEC legislation and when we had the earlier debate on the White Paper which was issued in relation to membership, the Parliamentary Secretary was very loud in his condemnation of our proposal to join as were the other members of his party.  It is ironic that it falls to him to allocate and to announce here in the House the benefits which we pointed out would undoubtedly accrue from membership.  At column 2327. Volume 259, of the Official Report of 23rd March, 1972, I said on the debate on membership of the EEC :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to savings on agricultural subsidies I have the authority of the Government to state that social requirements <Col N="517" /> will be a first charge on savings in this respect.  I would hope that the improvements in social welfare rates, the expansion of existing schemes and the introduction of new schemes as outlined in the Third Programme for Social and Economic Development would be accelerated and the day brought nearer when we can achieve that improved position.  We have at the moment preliminary arrangements made for bringing in pay-related benefits so far as some of our social welfare benefits are concerned.  This we would hope to extend to pensions.</P>
    <P>In that speech I outlined what I hoped would be done.  We did that to encourage people to vote in favour of our entry into the EEC and it was fortunate that we succeeded. It is ironic that members of the party who opposed our entry have now to implement the promises we made in relation to improved social welfare benefits.  However, we welcome that and we are glad it is possible to do now what previously might have taken two years.</P>
    <P>Before the general election we spelled out what we proposed to do in relation to social welfare improvements generally and I still back our proposals against those announced by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Overall, our payments were more generous; for instance, we proposed an increase of £1 for adult dependants whereas the present provision is for 50p.</P>
    <P>However, the most important part of our scheme was the selectivity we proposed with regard to family allowances. This would have enabled us to give to the poorer families more generous benefits than the amounts set out by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The best part of our social policy was in relation to family allowances.</P>
    <P>The children's allowance scheme is one of our best schemes in that it brings the earnings of the married man more in line with those of the single man.  As the Parliamentary Secretary probably knows, in some continental countries commercial firms pay employees on a differential basis; <Col N="518" /> if they are married they get higher rates of pay.  In this country there is no difference, with the possible exception of the teaching profession.  The children's allowance scheme is the one scheme that gives the necessary income support to bridge the gap.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Social Welfare I was subjected to a lot of pressure, particularly from members of the Labour Party, to introduce a measure of selectivity in the children's allowance scheme.  I was in accord with that but I wanted to avoid having a difficult means test where officials would call on the people concerned to carry out an investigation. We had worked out a scheme, after carrying out an inter-departmental study, whereby we could have had a means test without it being necessary to have a person call to make an investigation. It was an excellent scheme and I look forward to putting it into operation on the same basis at some future date.</P>
    <P>We are neither grudging nor jealous of the improvements in the social welfare system.  A lot of nonsense was spoken about our social welfare code.  On 28th June, 1972, when I was replying to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare, I pointed out that our social welfare code embraces practically every person who should be covered by it and leaves little to be done.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in the Press and elsewhere about the abolition of the limit of £1,600.  We abolished that limit before we left office and it is on record as a government decision.  The next step that must logically follow from that is the extension of social insurance to all persons from school leaving until retirement and this is the approach that should be adopted with regard to welfare payments.  This will bring people in line to qualify for the various payments and, like contributory pensions, they will not be subject to a means test.  This is the direction I outlined and which I have mentioned many times in the House. It is the approach that must be <Col N="519" /> adopted by any Minister for Social Welfare in future.</P>
    <P>One realises the importance of social insurance when it is seen that only £4.69 million will be borne by the Exchequer in a full year for social insurance payments.  This means the employer will have to pay almost the entire amount because the amount of the stamp for the employee has been reduced considerably.  Sometimes when we speak about employers we are inclined to think of them as people in the millionaire class.  There are very few wealthy employers in this country; many of those who have to contribute are barely above the income level of their employees.  When we think about laying everything on the employer or of standing on his neck, we should remember he is the source from which stems all wealth, which makes it possible for us to give any kind of benefit to the people.  We should not forget that the employer is the most important, indispensable and the integral part of the economic and social make up of the country.</P>
    <P>In operating any scheme for the betterment of the economy, we cannot always be unmindful of the position of the employer.  We should not try to make it more difficult for him; at present, he has the onerous job of keeping many records, of making many payments and of contributing by way of taxes in very many ways.</P>
    <P>The budget debate is over and it would be irrelevant to discuss matters relating to it except in the context of these improvements.  If these improvements had been brought about, as we would have done, without increased taxes or increases in prices generally, they would have been of infinitely greater benefit.  Last year we made a generous contribution to social welfare without a penny of extra taxation and in its own context it was a much more commendable performance to social welfare than this is, however welcome this is.</P>
    <P>The budget proposals generally, in so far as they have blown up prices, and accordingly tended to create greater inflation, will negative to a great extent the benefits recipients can <Col N="520" /> expect to glean from the changes introduced through this Bill.  There are things which are not easy to keep in check, but we must always strive to work towards what will keep us as far as possible from aggravating an already very sensitive inflationary spiral.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the improvements in regards to widows.  Last year the benefits we gave were weighted in favour of widows.  We gave better benefits in respect of their dependants and in the year before last I announced an increase in the upper age limit of those dependants.  The provision which ignores the first £4 of income per week before a widow can get an allowance means that widows may work and still get their pensions. Representatives of widows' organisations who visited me wished to have the scheme amended so that, when widows applied for unemployment or sick benefits, they would still get their pensions without the overlapping regulations being operated.  At present, under this Bill, they would get only half their benefits.  Deputies who are now Ministers were loud in their criticisms of this but it still has not been changed.</P>
    <P>Women in domestic and agricultural employment are being put on a par with male workers.  Their rates of contribution will still be lower but they will carry the same benefits irrespective of classification.  I noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary in his speech said that the required qualifications in regard to women's availability for work will still be pursued. I have found that, if the full term of the Unemployment Acts in relation to availability, capacity and the genuine seeking of work were pressed, many female workers would have great difficulty in qualifying for any benefits because every employment agency, including the manpower section of the Department of Labour, have huge lists of vacancies for women at all times.  There is no difficulty in finding employment for female workers.  Therefore, if the qualifications required by the Unemployment Acts were fully administered those people would find great difficulty in <Col N="521" /> qualifying for unemployment benefit. They are not, because one must take the humane view at times.  If doubts are held and benefits are given notwithstanding, it is all to the good.</P>
    <P>The decision to include deserted wives in the contributory scheme is interesting. It is a situation I examined in my time in the Department and all the advice I had available to me was that it would be unworkable. How can you always find out the deserting husband's record in regard to insurance and whether you have the legal right to use his contributions for his deserted wife's benefits? They are difficulties which to my mind will not be easily overcome.  Of course the wives can be given non-contributory allowances if it is impossible to find out the husband's contribution record.  If a husband is in some unknown place it may not be possible to get any particulars of his record. I appreciate it is possible to go on the deserted wife's insurance record if she has one, but like widows, in most cases it is the husband's insurance that qualifies the widow.</P>
    <P>It was heartening to hear that the divorced wife returning from another country and living here will now be eligible for a deserted wife's allowance. It will benefit a few, not many, deserving causes.  The number of deserted wives at the moment is about 2,000.  It was below that figure last year when I spoke in the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary admitted that here the Department are entering new territory which is difficult to explore.  As was proved when we reduced the age limit for those without dependants, if those who are administering the scheme were allowed to give their opinions they would have to agree it is a difficult scheme to administer, one in which a good deal of what we might call rule of thumb must be applied, with exceptions taken into account.  Positive proof is not always available.  It is a scheme that has given considerable benefit to a fairly deserving though small section of our people and any improvement in it is a welcome addition to the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister for Social Welfare brought in generous benefits <Col N="522" /> the cost of the stamp was always harped on by the Opposition.  I was amused when I brought along a decent social welfare Bill to give effect to budget proposals that the Opposition kept harping on the increased cost of the stamp.  I liked to keep the information about it as quiet as possible because it was the hateful side of this exercise of improving social welfare benefits and pretending that the Minister was almost taking it out of his pocket to give it to the people, whereas he was actually putting his hand in other people's pockets up to the elbow and he would like to conceal that as much as possible.  I would not like, for that reason, to make too much play of the increased cost of the stamp which is brought about by this year's increased benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to make too much play of the cost of the stamp but it is getting to a pretty high figure for the small employer at the present time.  Those who have to meet demands in that respect must feel that the cost is too high.  The Parliamentary Secretary today referred to my redundancy legislation.  At the time I said I was afraid the cost of the stamp would have to be increased further.  I think there is a second increase added today and that must be added to the cost of the other stamp.  The figure mentioned for a stamp here is £2.69p, but remember you must add to that 19p for occupational injuries and 8p for redundancy, which is being increased today to 10p, and 15p for health which brings the cost of the stamp up to £3.13p.  That was more than a week's pay for a road worker when Fianna Fáil first became a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer contribution to the social insurance fund is now at a lower percentage than for a long time.  If I remember my sums correctly before I left the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="523" /> that amount added to the stamp in respect of the improvements in social welfare today must be taken into consideration and a much reduced contribution by the Exchequer to the social insurance fund is now likely. If the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Social Welfare are anxious to protect the employer in this respect they should see that the Exchequer contribution in the social insurance fund is kept at the 30 per cent, 32 per cent or 40 per cent.  They should do something for the people who are paying the piper and cannot call the tune in so far as this legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The future course of social welfare has been charted.  The Department, with their limited resources in manpower have been trying to prepare schemes for the foreseeable future as far in advance as possible.  The pay-related benefit scheme was one of the things which imposed more than a little burden on the Department.  The amount of strain this has put on the available resources and personnel is more than anyone in the House can appreciate.  If it were not for the assistance and the intervention of the Revenue people this would not be practicable at all.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of criticism with regard to agricultural workers not being included.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has now had the pleasure of bringing that section in with the operation of this Bill.  I gave reasons why it was not possible to do it at that time but I am sure he was so strong in condemnation of my failing to bring them in that he will not now fail to have them brought in when the pay-related scheme is got under way.</P>
    <P>When we decided to abolish the insurability limit of £1,600 we did not announce it because we could not fix the date it would come into operation. I notice the Parliamentary Secretary has not made any great progress in this respect because he is not yet able to announce a date, although he took credit for announcing it.  Indeed, the media dutifully toed the line and made all the necessary noises.  There is a difficult problem here with regard to health but it is not insurmountable.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will <Col N="524" /> find that the movement into the field of pay-related benefits has opened the way for great new developments in the whole field of social welfare.  I found it a most difficult piece of legislation to get off the ground but I was convinced that it opened the way to considerable expansion and improvement in the whole social welfare code. It will eventually have to be applied to pensions and other payments.  The most difficult thing is to have it applied in the first instance.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will lose no time in having this extended to all the other fields where it is so necessary, particularly in regard to pensions, because people naturally expect that if one benefit is to be related to income other benefits should also be so related.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the staff and the officials of the Department for the assistance I had when I was Minister for Social Welfare.  I do not think I would be out of order in wishing the new secretary of the Department every success and in wishing the retiring secretary many years of success in his retirement.  The Department of Social Welfare receive little thanks.  They are the football of every politician and every commentator in the country.  It is one of the most unpopular Departments.  Its personnel are faceless people who cannot stand up in public and defend themselves, but they have to take the thrust and parry of every person wishing to find a scapegoat in regard to something for which, perhaps, they were to blame themselves.  I am delighted, for that reason, to have this opportunity of paying that tribute to a very excellent and faithful staff.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to fix a standard case load for each welfare officer because of the different kinds of duty involved and other factors, but the present average case load for officers on prison and court duties is 32.</P>
    <P>The welfare service for the courts and prisons has been kept under constant review since it was re-organised in 1970.  The duties of the principal welfare officer include staff training and development and general planning for the improvement and expansion of the service.</P>

      <P>Consequent on the resignation with effect from the 1st February, 1973 of the surgeon at the <Col N="538" /> Sheil Hospital the hospital board applied to Comhairle na n-Ospidéal for approval to appoint a replacement.  I am informed that the comhairle had agreed to the making of a temporary appointment for a period of six months while the situation was being examined.</P>
      <P>I understand that the comhairle have recently indicated to the hospital authorities that the level and quantity of the surgical workload arising at the hospital would not justify the appointment of a consultant surgeon based solely on this hospital but that they are prepared to consider the continuance of the present arrangements for a further limited period while detailed arrangements for the future are being finalised, but only for the purpose of finalising detailed arrangements for the future which do not conflict with the principle they have laid down.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 41 of the Health Act, 1970 it is the comhairle's function to regulate the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staffs in hospitals engaged in the provision of services under the Act and I have no power to change their decision.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal have to do with the appointment of the consultants and surgeons under <Col N="539" /> section 41 of the 1970 Act but I question whether that gives them the right to discontinue surgery in a particular hospital.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that south Donegal, southwest Donegal and a part of Leitrim have been very well served, for surgery purposes, in the Sheil Hospital in Ballyshannon and that a considerable amount of money has been expended in bringing up to date the facilities there for surgery in recent years, in fact, as recently as last year when some new extensions were opened?  Would he consider it wise to permit the closure immediately of this hospital or even after six months when it is rendering a continuous service to the area, granted a limited service but an essential service, and if surgery is discontinued there will be a tremendous hardship to a big area of the county?  Surely the Minister can intervene to ensure that it is continued in a temporary capacity for a number of years?</P>

      <P>In relation to the general problem of drug abuse by young persons a co-ordinating committee was established last year comprising representatives of relevant Government Departments and other bodies to ensure that there is a full exchange of information on the various measures being taken and that, where necessary, effective action is taken as speedily as possible to deal with matters arising in relation to this problem.  The committee meets at regular intervals and in the intervening periods my Department is in contact with the bodies concerned as frequently as the situation demands. The activities of the committee enable effective surveillance of the drug scene as a whole to be maintained and ensure that the arrangements for safe custody of drugs, the prevention of the use of forged prescriptions and other such measures designed to prevent an increase in drug abuse receive adequate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the educational side a special committee is examining the general question of communicating information on drugs to young persons, to <Col N="541" /> provide guidance for school authorities and to indicate where research is needed.  I understand that the committee has made considerable progress and expect to be able to furnish its report later this year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime my Department in co-operation with a number of other bodies has been holding a series of seminars on drug abuse for school teachers, clergy, doctors and nurses. In addition, special lectures have been provided for adult and parent groups.</P>
    <P>The abuse of drugs by adults is specially stressed at these lectures and seminars.</P>
    <P>While the general psychiatric outpatient and in-patient services are available for the treatment of drug abusers, special supplementary measures have been taken in Dublin where the problem is more acute.  Currently a detoxification unit is being planned at Jervis Street Hospital and the provision of additional specialised accommodation is also under active consideration.</P>

It is only fair to say that in general the vast majority of the fathers live up to that responsibility and no problem arises between the husband and wife with regard to the children's allowances.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The title to unemployment benefit of any claimant is a matter for determination by a statutory deciding officer or, on appeal, by a statutory appeals officer, through the application of the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and I cannot interfere with it.  I am aware that some claims from school bus drivers in respect of school holiday periods have been disallowed on the grounds that they have other regular occupations of a nature so substantial as to make them unavailable for employment other than for the part-time job of school bus driver.  It will be appreciated that persons who already are self-employed in another occupation, such as farmers, shop-keepers, publicans, may be attracted to school bus driving as a second occupation by reason of its generally part-time nature. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, one of the fundamental conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit is that the claimant be available for employment.  This condition has always been interpreted as meaning that a claimant must be available for full-time employment in the ordinary sense.</P>

The law of this State states that the Army is only called out to aid the civil force, and this must be done by a high ranking officer of the civil force.

He was only so informed because it had happened. There was no need for the Army on that occasion but I would remind the House that in that part of the country the most modern radio communications are available so that if the Army had been needed they would have been there.

      <P>I cannot tell the Deputy that because, among other things, I am endeavouring to encourage young men in this country to realise that they have not only a duty but an opportunity to serve their country by joining the Army, even for a short time.  The whole matter of Finner and Dundalk is tied up with Border security.  Traditionally, Finner Camp was used as a summer training camp and minimal staff were provided during the winter period for maintenance purposes.  However, since autumn of 1969 the camp has been occupied by a substantial number of military personnel on a year round basis.  Under present arrangements, units based at Finner Camp rotate every three months.  This period was determined with a view to achieving the maximum operational efficiency without causing too much domestic hardship.  I regret that some domestic hardship is necessary.  With the establishment of the two new battalions mentioned in the reply, Finner Camp will become a permanent military <Col N="556" /> post and the appointment of an officer commanding the post will be a permanent appointment.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1973 : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was concluding on the Social Welfare Bill, I was paying tribute to a staff that is very often made a scapegoat by many people who want, for ulterior motives, to cast aspersions on the social welfare system.  I have taken this as my first opportunity in opposition to pay a tribute to a loyal and hard-working staff, to a staff which is frequently wrongfooted, and in the meanest possible manner, public servants who have not the opportunity to come back, who are doing an excellent job in one of the largest Departments of State, which has a huge volume of work.  The percentage of administration costs in relation to the overall disbursement of the Department is very favourable indeed, and if we were to move towards the point of instant social welfare, as I frequently used to call what people were demanding, we would have to do one of two things or both, that would be, to turn a blind eye to many abuses, not to look for qualifications but to hand out money <i>ad lib</i>; or, alternatively, to double the amount of staff which is there at present.  Thousands of cases have to be processed daily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If some of these critics had access to the Department to see the sparse information that is often supplied with <Col N="561" /> claims or applications, they would appreciate the difficulty involved in getting quick decisions which we would all dearly love to have.  In saying that, I would hope that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would continue, as I have been trying to do, to expedite decisions in all cases.  There are cases where there are unavoidable delays, but there are others where there are perhaps occasionally avoidable delays, and these should be eliminated.  They have now installed a computer, which I took the decision to purchase in my time, and I hope this will lead to better and more expeditious handling of the growing volume of work in the Department.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is ironical that it falls to a man who opposed entry into the EEC to administer the largesse which is made available by the EEC for social welfare in this country.  I am glad it is one of the fruits of EEC membership that has become available to us.  Winding up on the Social Welfare Bill last year I pointed out, and it is on the record, that apart from the money made available to us in savings on the agricultural subsidies, the EEC would be a necessary incentive to impel us towards harmonising our services with those of EEC member states, which means we must ultimately bring them into line with those countries.  It is not that there is harmony between the services of existing members.  They are all very different, but all of them are better than ours.  This we admit.</P>
    <P>We are a small country with a small population and a relatively small number of persons contributing, and we are inclined to milk very heavily the resources available to us in order to redistribute the national income to the best of our ability.  I do not think anybody could accuse us of not doing that. The evolution of social welfare is one of the most commendable features of the whole of the Government's activities over the past number of years. All the talk about a comprehensive scheme, restructuring, bringing in a new code, is the greatest nonsense.  Social welfare is something which evolves, something which improves from year to year.  New services have come in; new schemes have been adopted, and, no matter <Col N="562" /> what the public conscience or the Minister's social conscience dictates, he must be limited by the availability of resources.  The many beautiful things we would like to do tomorrow very often must wait until the day after.</P>
    <P>The Minister will now have to move towards social insurance for the population as a whole.  This will bring everybody within the social insurance scheme, and we shall thus get the necessary contributions from the people who are in a position to pay them.  As in the case of the income tax code the more people who contribute the easier it will be on all.  By casting the net wider, the amount of the weekly subscription to social insurance should become less rather than more.  This is the direction in which I was hoping to move rapidly and in which we ware moving in the past.</P>
    <P>One has only to look back to see the number of schemes that have been implemented since the last war.  It was actually 1947 before any improvement's were made, contributory pensions for widows and so on, ultimately bringing in every person who should be covered by the social welfare code.  I would like to see self-employed people being able to share in some of the social welfare benefits which are now available only to insured persons, such as under the occupational injuries legislation which gives tremendous coverage to employed persons and will apply to self-employed persons when they are brought within the contributory system.  This will be a more comprehensive contribution system when it is extended to self-employed persons and to all other persons, as it is in the UK.</P>
    <P>These are the steps one would like to see taken.  Our ambition was to reach a stage when we could not be adversely compared particularly with the six North Eastern counties or with Great Britain, and we can no longer be compared adversely with what they are doing there.  Indeed, some of our social welfare schemes were brought in before they brought in some of their schemes. Granted, the greater resources available to them has enabled them to be more generous than we have been, but <Col N="563" /> for a small country we have been moving as rapidly as the people expected us to move, always having regard to those who were responsible for providing the resources out of which any Government boasts of its generosity in doing things which the public conscience these days progressively wishes them to do.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to dwell any further on this piece of legislation. As I said at the start, it was my great pleasure year after year during my time in Social Welfare to announce improved benefits and extend the scope of the scheme each year.  I hope that progress will continue, especially with regard to the most deserving sections&mdash;the aged, the infirm and those who are unable to assist themselves.</P>
    <P>The Coalition grouping came together hurriedly before the general election and they were inclined to make many promises to attract extra votes.  In their over-enthusiasm they made promises they were unable to carry out and this was inevitable.  If they follow the course we had charted, which any Minister for Social Welfare must follow in the years ahead, we will have as good a social welfare code as any other country.  I hope that the economy will be able to develop in the same progressive manner as formerly otherwise it will not be possible to provide any worthwhile benefits for the needy.  It is a tribute to the soundness of the economy that the Coalition Government, a few weeks after taking office, were able to do certain things.  I wish the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary success in this interesting, successful, and sometimes unduly criticised work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time in the history of our country a Government had an opportunity this year to do something worthwhile for those in receipt of social services.  The money was available and a substantial increase in the social services should not have necessitated a tax on the public.  However, a great opportunity was lost when the Government presented the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the general election the <Col N="564" /> public were given many promises with regard to social services.  In his statement today the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned an increase in the allowance for home help to £3.50. Sufficient emphasis has not been put on this important service.  When a boy or girl gives up employment to look after an aged relative it should be worth more than £3.50 per week to the State.  In such a case the person who gives up employment should be entitled to draw unemployment benefit.  They have contributed to it and are entitled to the money but unfortunately the Act states that a person must be available for employment. I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter.  If an old person is sent to an institution it will cost the State £20 per week to maintain him there, but yet the State appears to consider it sufficient to pay £3.50 to a person to look after his or her old relative at home.</P>
    <P>If in the event of a dispute and, in the heat of the moment, an employer dismisses a worker the employee on going to the Labour Exchange is informed he is not entitled to unemployment benefit until his case is investigated by the Department.  We may be speaking about a man with a family but, nevertheless, he will be obliged to sign at the Labour Exchange and will not receive any money apart from home assistance. I have always maintained that in the event of a dispute between the Department, the employer and the employee, the latter should be paid unemployment benefit.  He has contributed to it and is entitled to the money.  I am surprised the Parliamentary Secretary did not refer to this matter in his statement.</P>
    <P>The same injustice applies to a person in receipt of disability benefit. Doctors differ and patients die, but in some cases the patient may die from starvation because the Department's doctor differs with the private doctor and, consequently, disability benefit is not paid.  The person concerned will not receive disability benefit until the Department's doctor agrees with the claimant's doctor.  People who have contributed perhaps for 20 years <Col N="565" /> should be allowed payment while a dispute is going on between the Department and a doctor, or between the Department and an official of the Labour Exchange.  The Parliamentary Secretary as a trade unionist should know the great hardships.</P>

      <P>I want to endorse what Deputy Brennan said about the hardship being inflicted on small employers. Before I came in here I worked for a small employer who employed about 20 people and who was at his wits end to try to keep them in employment. The State comes down on him and demands that he pays the contributions for his workers.  We have been inclined always to ask people who can least afford to pay.  In this budget the middle class people carry the burden. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to give serious thought to the position of small employers who form an important arm of industry and who carry the heaviest share of the burden.</P>
      <P>There is another injustice which the Parliamentary Secretary might look at. A man between 69 and 80 years will get £7.20 a week contributory old age pension.  A contributory widow living alone will get only £6.60.  Why does this distinction exist?  Both have contributed and both are living alone.  I am surprised the Parliamentary Secretary did not avail of this opportunity to bridge that gap.  After all, both must purchase the same food, clothing and fuel.  Indeed, the widow is not entitled to free electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy <Col N="566" /> Brennan when he said that everyone should be brought into the social services. It is vitally important that everyone should contribute and that everyone should share the benefits available.  I know Deputy Brennan spent a lot of time exploiting this possibility and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to follow it up.  It is the wish of us all that every person in the State should come under the umbrella of the social services.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment and I wish him success in the efforts he will make to improve the social standards of our people.  I have no doubt he will receive the co-operation of every Member of the House.  After all, we on this side of the House are the foundation of the social services and, therefore, it is only natural and logical that we would give the Parliamentary Secretary every possible support in endeavours to improve living standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> First of all, I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment. He is a colleague of mine in my constituency and I am quite sure he will make a very able Parliamentary Secretary.  Although I cannot wish him a long term in office, I am convinced that for as long as he is there he will carry out capably the functions of one of the most important Departments in the State.  The Department of Social Welfare deal with the section of our people who are most vulnerable, those who cannot look after themselves.  I have stated many times before that this is a Department which must be geared to the job of looking after the affairs of the people they are dealing with. Because it is vital that no mistakes be made&mdash;those people are depending on their benefits from week to week and on many Friday evenings they have come to me to tell me they had not received their benefit&mdash;it must be efficiently staffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was fortunate in being appointed this year because the benefits which we see here and which we welcome are due <Col N="567" /> in no small measure to the good housekeeping of the previous Government. It was due to the buoyancy in the economy and the revenue and to decisions taken in past years that the Department of Social Welfare have been able to increase the benefits which we are now about to implement. These increases have been brought about by the policies which we adopted throughout the years, one of them being the attaining of EEC membership which in itself meant a considerable saving to the Exchequer so that the Minister was able to transfer these moneys to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The only thing I am sorry about is that the increases are not greater.  If they were greater everyone in this House would have welcomed them. As I have said, the Minister on this occasion had every opportunity to present one of the best social welfare budgets ever.  Indeed, the majority of the people thought this social welfare budget would be something unique in the social welfare field.  Unfortunately, it can be said there is nothing extraordinary about the benefits being given. I doubt if any Minister could come in here in 1973, with inflation and rising prices at their present level, and have the neck to offer anything less than £1 a week.  I, therefore, give no thanks to the Government because nobody would have the audacity to offer old age pensioners and others anything less at this time.  Anyone who circulates among the people and knows the massive price increases that are occurring and the consequent polarisation in our society will agree with me.</P>
    <P>If the rate of inflation is to continue as it has been over the past 12 months, I am convinced that the benefits given here will be eroded in a very short time.  I welcome what is given but I believe more should have been done with the money available.  I certainly welcome some aspects of this Bill, particularly the new contributory benefits and those regarding the means test.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that certain allowances should be made for people who <Col N="568" /> were self-employed and, perhaps, find themselves in the situation where they have a small income of £2 or £3 a week which was subject to a means test in regard to the non-contributory pensions.  I know that Deputy Brennan had this in mind in regard to the social welfare field.  I believe if we were in Government now that we would certainly have followed those lines.  The present Government have not lived up to the promise they made prior to the election when they stated that there would be a complete abolition of the means test.  However, I welcome the increases, which are a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances in my opinion have always been the best way to direct assistance to married people. This reaches the section to whom it can be of most benefit.  The increase of £1.50p is certainly welcome but to many in our community very little has been given in view of the restrictions placed on a man earning £2,500 a year.  An income of £2,500 a year is not very excessive and the people this restriction will hit are those who are buying their own houses and who have always played their part in the community.  Before free education was available they paid their way in education. They never looked for any social welfare benefits and they never had any health contributions because they were outside the social welfare limits. This section of the community has been taxed too heavily down through the years.</P>
    <P>Discrimination in regard to people earning £2,500 a year cannot be justified. If the Minister for Health and the Government had accepted a figure of £3,500 I would not criticise them because I believe at that bracket and over it you would be fully justified in having some drawbacks.  I know those people are most disappointed.  I have spoken to many of them recently as regards this restriction.  Many of those people who are buying their own houses have only gone into them during the past 4 or 5 years.  The argument will be made that they have an abatement of rates but that is of very little value to the people on a seven years remission of rates because they do not get the full benefits here.  It was <Col N="569" /> totally unfair of the Government to fix a figure of £2,500.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated in his brief that 359,000 families would benefit from the increase in children's allowances.  I do not know how he arrived at this figure unless he went to the income tax code in order to see how many will be caught in the drawback. I doubt if the Revenue Commissioners have supplied the necessary data to indicate this figure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the children's allowances to 18 years where the children are obtaining a full education or are apprentices.  I do not know how you will define the apprenticeship section of it.  Trades vary as regards. apprenticeship and quite often people in apprenticeship for a short time who arc efficient qualify for senior wages. I can see certain complications in this but I am sure the Department will have some rule of thumb by which they will decide at what age they will go outside this category.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wyse that the increase in contributions is very substantial both from the employers' and the employees' point of view.  There is an increase of 42p on the employer and 15p on the employee.  This is becoming a considerable burden especially on small employers who are operating on a very tight margin.  We never hear about these changes in the budget statement and whether we like it or not they are additional taxation. The Parliamentary Secretary stated that the contribution from the Exchequer runs from 32 per cent to 42 per cent.  Is it intended, with the astronomical charge now being put on the employer, to reduce the contribution from the Exchequer from the normal guidelines or is it intended to increase it?  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give us some indication of what the subvention from the Exchequer will be.</P>
    <P>Is the full rate of contribution being charged to apprentices?  I have always felt that charging the full rate of stamp to a young boy or girl starting a career, who are only earning £10 to £12 a week, is an enormous amount to stop weekly.  I am sure they are paying in the region of 10 per cent of their <Col N="570" /> wages in stamps.  A sliding grade should be drawn up whereby those on the junior rate of wages should have a lower stamp rate until such time as they qualify in their trade or business. Some of the people in the lower grades will not be able to pay the increased stamp rates.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at that section and see if something could be done to ease the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated during the past week that it was his intention to abolish the upper limit of £1,600.  We all welcome that.  Unfortunately, no provision is made for the small self-employed man.  Evidently he is to continue to pay his own way.  Quite often he is in a far more vulnerable position than many people in employment who have the protections outlined in the Bill.  If a self-employed person falls ill he is dependent on Voluntary Health Insurance which is limited in what it can do and covers only hospitals, doctors, surgeons and specialists.  Eventually we will have to see if the self-employed person can be protected.</P>
    <P>There are other factors which the Parliamentary Secretary could have taken into consideration this year when we all expected so much because of the amount of money available.  Fringe benefits such as free travel were introduced by Deputy Haughey and Deputy Colley when they were Ministers.  With the moneys available this year, a further extension of those fringe benefits could have been introduced for widows and various other categories. The Parliamentary Secretary had a glorious opportunity this year to do something for the weaker sections of the community but he failed to do so. He failed to realise that they exist in our community.  They are in his own constituency of Dublin Central.</P>
    <P>Many of the weaker sections of the community are still badly catered for and not given the protection they require in an age of rapid inflation.  The Government missed this opportunity and the general feeling is that, while the increases are very welcome, they did not go far enough in this day and age, and having regard to prices.  Down through the years the policy of this party was to introduce social welfare <Col N="571" /> schemes.  I trust the same policy will be continued and accelerated along the same lines as it would have been continued by Deputy Brennan if he was still in office.  Let us hope that these benefits will continue to be paid.  No thanks are due to the Government for distributing money which was already accumulated by sound Government policy over the past number of years.  Some people who are now Ministers advised the people not to go into the Common Market but they did not accept that advice.  Because of the sound advice given by Fianna Fáil we are now a member of the EEC.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> While we appreciate the benefits given in the budget they do not go far enough.  Promises were made by members of the Government prior to the general election.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Corish, said that there would be a massive review of the social welfare benefits and a vast increase for all sectors right across the board.  I did not hear the Minister for Finance state in his budget speech that there has been any full review of the social welfare benefits or a restructuring of the Department of Social Welfare. Has there been any increase in the staff of the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome these increases and, now that we are a member of the EEC, I hope that our social welfare benefits will move into line with those of the EEC countries.  I am delighted that we are moving towards having equal benefits with those in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is due to the policy of successive Governments to try to provide the same benefits as the benefits in Great Britain and Northern Ireland step by step in each successive budget.  We have nearly attained that situation through the <Col N="572" /> policies of the party on this side of the House.  I hope the present Government will adopt that guideline and ensure that, eventually, our benefits match those in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have very little to add, except to say that we welcome the Bill.  As I said at the outset, there is no Government which, in this year of 1973, would have the brass neck to come in here and offer less than £1 per week to social welfare recipients, such as old age pensioners and others who are trying to fight inflation.  We have really nothing for which to thank the Government and there is no reason for the song and dance.  The economy was sound.  Revenue was buoyant and these factors contributed to the present budget.  Had they not done so this Government would have found themselves in a very difficult situation indeed.  We are delighted these benefits have been given.  Old age pensioners have served the country in the past and they are deserving of some consideration.  So are unfortunate widows and orphans.  No one will deny these any benefits the Government will give them.  No one will criticise such benefits.  The only criticism we can make is that the increases are not enough.  Let us hope that, as time goes on, we will be able to give more. Those of us who go around this city know the price of food and clothing. Even with only one room an increase of £1 is little benefit enough, but it is something.  We will have to ensure that the contributions given to these sections will increase substantially with each year that passes.  I believe all of us have the same aim and object in this regard.  I am not sure that the Government have made the best use of the money available to them.  Nevertheless, we welcome the Bill.  All we say is that the increases are not enough.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success in his office.</P>

      <P>I noticed when Deputy Brennan was speaking that he, like other speakers, welcomed the improvements in the Bill.  They might well welcome these improvements because there is no doubt in my mind but that the Bill represents a major breakthrough in social welfare.  I should like to emphasise the word &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo; because I do not regard even the position we will be in when the provisions of the Bill come into operation as being the desired or, indeed, the proper position from the point of view of social welfare.  However, because of the commitments entered into by the Coalition Government in the field of social welfare, I believe all the necessary improvements will be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred on a number of occasions to the fact that what was being achieved in social welfare was being achieved by virtue of the fact that we are now members of the EEC.  He implied that I, in particular, should be ashamed of myself because my party opposed entry into the EEC but yet my party are prepared to take advantage of any benefits that may accrue as a result of that entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to refer to the statement by the Minister for Finance that this marvellous bonanza we were supposed to enjoy for the <Col N="574" /> benefit of social welfare was just not there when he got to the cupboard. That did not, however, deter the National Coalition Government from honouring their commitments with regard to social welfare.</P>

      <P>To come back to social welfare, Deputy Brennan said that the Fianna Fáil Government had charted a certain course and he hoped the Government would pursue that course.  I do not want to take away from any achievements and, undoubtedly, some achievements were made by the Fianna Fáil Government, but I do not think we can get away from the fact that in 16 years of unbroken Fianna Fáil Government none of the omissions about which we have heard so much from the Opposition speakers on this measure were made good, not to mention the things that are in the Bill that were never done or never attempted.  I regard Deputy Brennan as a man with a social conscience and a man who, within the confines of the party of which he is a member, which are fairly constricting in regard to social welfare, did his best.  Apart from the very large increase in expenditure that is provided for social welfare in the present budget there is something more significant in this Bill, and it is in some other social welfare provisions, and some of them spill over into health: it is concern for people.</P>

The Deputy has asked a good question which illustrates, better than I could possibly illustrate, the approach of the Deputy's party towards the whole concept of social welfare.  The provisions of this Bill illustrate something else and I think this is the real difference&mdash;not so much the money although it is very considerable&mdash;but the real difference is the concept of what social welfare should be about.  There is no doubt in my mind and there is no doubt in the mind of this Government that social welfare is not just a matter of a few bob here and a few bob there.  It is a total, comprehensive all-embracing concern for the needs, not necessarily confined to the monetary needs, of the recipients of social welfare.  Basically this is the real difference between the approach of the former Govemment <Col N="576" /> and that of the present Government.</P>

      <P>I am stating facts that are on public record.  I agree there is a shift to the employer to bear a greater proportion of the stamp but Chat is quite in line with every member country of the EEC.  The proportion we require our employers to pay, even with the present increase, which I do not regard as being exorbitant, is still far below what other member countries of the European Community require employers to pay towards the stamp. I do not know why this great hullabaloo about stamps was raisd at all because it is strictly in line with what other countries are doing and does not <Col N="577" /> impose any undue burden even on the small employer.  We are talking about a relatively small percentage of any employer's total wage bill.  We are talking about a very small percentage indeed when we talk about the increases he will have to bear under the present scheme.  I do not think there is much mileage for Fianna Fáil in it and I would not recommend that they should pursue it at any great length.</P>
      <P>The half rate of benefit for widows was mentioned.  In my innocence I sat here and wondered Whether we did this originally, whether we were responsible, whether I had slipped up somewhere along the way and that this was imposed by the present Tánaiste or the present Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I referred to a point in my opening brief and I would like to refer to it again now.  Deputy Brennan, with his experience of being a former Minister of the Department, also referred to this point, and it relates to the absolutely staggering volume of claims and correspondence that come into the Department of Social Welfare.  With the implementation of the provisions of the Bill now under discussion, this volume will increase very considerably.  This will place a tremendous burden on the staff of the Department and also on the staff in the post offices throughout the country.  Every possible effort is being made to ensure that people will get the increased benefits at the rate to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every possible effort is being made <Col N="579" /> to ensure that there are no unnecessary delays.  It would be less than realistic, with the tremendous volume of work that is being dealt with, not to realise that there will be delays in some respects.  I hope that Deputies who have heard Deputy Brennan speaking&mdash;with his experience as Minister&mdash;will accept this fact and acknowledge the difficulties that confront the staff and the very good job they are doing in the circumstances. Every effort will be made to minimise the delays.  While saying that, I should also say that I am not completely satisfied that all delays are unavoidable. Particular attention is being given to this aspect of the Department's work.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for his co-operation and also the other Deputies for giving us the Second Stage of this Bill this evening.  I hope and anticipate that we will get the same co-operation in finishing the Bill, in order that these payments may be made.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We must treat this Department with respect and with consideration for the living of this number of people.  The Minister must be concerned about the employees.  It is important that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should have a good relationship with all his staff.  I believe that this has existed over many years.  I have no doubt that harmony and goodwill exisi within the Department.  There must be goodwill in any organisation if there is to be full productivity in it.  The contribution which the employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have made to the State has been beneficial and helpful.</P>
      <P>I will deal now with the postal services. In this city they are excellent.  I must congratulate the postal section for the delivery of letters.  At times the postmen must find it difficult in newlybuilt-up areas to find the proper addresses in new roads of unusual names.  It is a mystery to me how they become accustomed to delivering letters in such areas in so short a time.  There are a considerable number of post offices in this country.  There are also a large number of sub-post offices.  The services which the post offices and sub-post offices give in relation to postal work and savings banks have been excellent.  They have contributed, in no small measure, to the Exchequer but the conditions under which they work are far from favourable. There are housing schemes in this city where large numbers of people are living without a sufficient number of sub-post offices.  One sub-post office in a built-up area is not sufficient. Quite often these premises are very small and inadequate to cope with the services carried on by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> Sub-postmistresses, sub-postmasters, and their assistants, play a very important part in the life of this country and, consequently, it is important that the conditions under which they work are improved.  Apparently, it is the Government's decision to channel further funds into the Post Office.  As a result of the statement in the budget to the effect that the Government was removing the £70 from the domestic banks the inflow of capital into the Post Office savings will be considerable. I doubt if there are sufficient personnel employed in the sub-post offices, and I am not casting any aspersions on the existing staff, to expand the Post Office Savings programme.</P>
    <P>I do not think the post offices throughout the country are sufficiently equipped to cope with an increased demand on Post Office Savings. There is not sufficient personnel, and the post offices are not properly equipped to cater for the people who wish to use them from day to day. The people in these post offices are overworked, and must remain on duty for long hours daily.  The Post Office service is expanding, and for this reason I should like the Minister to see if the sub-post offices are sufficiently staffed, how they can be improved and to implement any changes necessary as speedily as possible.  Because it is envisaged that post offices will act as a banking agent for the State&mdash;something I think is desirable if funds are to be channelled into the Exchequer&mdash;it is desirable that these improvements be carried out.</P>
    <P>The need for a change in the regulation which prohibits members of the Post Office staff from having affiliations to political parties has been brought to my notice on many occasions. This regulation is wrong.  I feel that Post Office employees should be entitled to affiliate to the political party of their conviction.  This should obtain up to a certain level in the Post Office.  I am not advocating that the higher officials in the Post Office should be exempt from this regulation. The average postman or Post Office employee should not be impeded or prohibited from partaking <Col N="582" /> in the political life of the nation.  We should encourage people to take an interest in the political aspects of the nation irrespective of which parly they are attached to.</P>
    <P>We have seen too many people in this country operating outside the political spectrum and we should not discourage our own employees from speaking out on how they feel the political institutions of this country should operate.  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions when my party was in Government.  Many people in my constituency have expressed the view to me that they consider this an undue restriction.  These people are entitled to this freedom.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is something that leaves a lot to be desired.  Those of us who use the telephone can understand the frustration that is being experienced by the people in the country in relation to this service.  The service is completely inadequate.  Members know how frustrating it is when the telephones in this House are busy, and how difficult it is to make a call to any part of the country.  This also applies to business firms and private individuals.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been a substantial increase for telephones in the capital budget but I wonder is this sufficient, particularly when one considers that there is a backlog of 30,000 applicants for telephones.  Even with the additional allocation I do not think it will be possible to meet the requirements in this regard.  This is one area which can give a return on capital.  It has always given a return of 8 to 8 1/2 per cent on investments.</P>
    <P>This is a Department to which more money could be allocated in the capital budget.  At one time I felt that if the telephone section was separated from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and was allowed to float a loan for the improvement of the service it would prove more beneficial to the country.  With this backlog of 30,000 applications it is obvious that there is no hope of improving the situation because the amount allocated in the capital budget is not sufficient.  This problem will remain with us for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> With this country gearing itself for the Common Market and with industrialists considering the establishment of factories it is important that we should have an efficient telephone service.  There should not be a delay when an application is made by an industrialist for the installation of a telephone.  This delay has discouraged a number of industrialists in the past. This country must reach the same standard of efficiency in this regard as that existing in Common Market countries.  The Minister should do everything possible to expedite the installation of telephones, particularly for business people.</P>

      <P>When I was returned to this House, and during the period since then, I have given quite a lot of thought to the subject matter of my maiden speech.  The attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in answering a question put by me to the Minister for Justice yesterday, and his failure to give a satisfactory reply on the Clones incident, has forced my hand to avail of this opportunity to make my maiden speech.</P>
      <P>Before I put the shameful facts regarding the handling of the Clones incident before the House, perhaps it might be as well for me to prove my <i>bona fides</i> to speak on this matter.  I was born the son of a small farmer on the Monaghan-Fermanagh border in an area that is practically the geographical centre of Ulster.  Not only are my country and my province divided by the Border but the diocese to which I belong, Clogher, and also my parish of Rosslea are divided also by it.  I have walked and cycled every yard of the area concerned in this instance.  I represent people of all persuasions in the area.  These are Godfearing people who wish to live in peace.  They are people who depend on a trusted and competent police force to keep them safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> This area is one of many small unapproved roads.  In fact, nine out of ten of these roads have been cratered during the past number of years and bear a massive scar as a result, so much so that even a blind man would have little diffculty in knowing that he was approaching the Border.  As if the condition of these roads was not enough to identify the Border, there is a huge yellow sign about 100 yards on the Northern side of the Border indicating that one is approaching the Border.  That line is painted on the roads in six-foot lettering.  Therefore, the suggestion that the patrols concerned crossed the Border innocently and accidentally does not stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>We are told that the patrol wandered across the Border accidentally and we have the word of a British officer as given over the telephone that this is what happened.  Apparently, the Minister is prepared to accept that, but I am not willing to accept it nor neither are the people in my constituency willing to accept it.</P>
    <P>The facts of the case are known to them and they must be known to the Minister also.  I wish to quote from a report that appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Saturday, May 26th, 1973.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BRITISH TROOPS HELD AT BORDER FAMILY'S SAFETY FEAR</P>
    <P>A Government investigation is being considered into a Border incident when an armed six-man British Army unit was detained for questioning by gardaí in Clones, County Monaghan, yesterday.</P>
    <P>The unit, travelling in an unmarked van, were halted at a checkpoint in the centre of Clones, County Monaghan, disarmed by a large force of gardaí and taken to the local station, where they were held for more than four hours.</P>
    <P>Two soldiers were dressed in civilian clothes and the driver at first told gardaí they were from Belfast.  They later admitted they were members of the Royal Artillery based at Lisnaskea Barracks.</P>
    <P>It was the second Border crossing into Clones in the past year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> A British Army officer said later that the patrol had taken a wrong turning and had inadvertently crossed the Border, as had happened before.</P>
    <P>He denied that the unit was a snatch squad seeking a wanted man.</P>
    <P Just="Center">RELEASED</P>
    <P>The unit was released and given a Garda escort to the Border after their story was checked with the RUC.  Reports on the incidents were later sent to the Departments of Justice and Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Last night a County Monaghan family claimed that the unit had spent a considerable time at their residence, and that one soldier had been knocking at their door with a rifle.</P>
    <P>Mr. Frank McMahon (22), who lives with his mother, Mrs. Elizabeth McMahon, at Clincarrick, near Clones, said they were too afraid to open the door, and had their suspicions aroused when the van appeared to drop somebody off and then kept cruising around the place.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no doubt this was the same unmarked van which the gardaí later found the British army using in Clones,&rdquo; he added.</P>
    <P>Mr. McMahon said that he now feared the future safety of the family, in view of the fact that there had been a number of unsolved mystery killings in the Fermanagh border area during the past year.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the squad were apprehended when approaching Clones from the east and that they would have been up to two miles from the Border at one point.  They were not two miles from the Border at the point at which they were apprehended but they travelled on the Monaghan road and the first crossing on that road is a mile and a quarter out of Clones.  If that is added to the three-quarters of a mile from the Diamond ill Clones to the nearest point of the Fermanagh border, the distance is two miles so that they would have travelled at least that distance in the Twenty-Six County area.  Clincarrick lies on the west side of Clones so <Col N="586" /> that the directions are opposite.  Apparently, the squad were given the courtesy of an escort to the Border at the Minister's request but when that sinister group were apprehended by good police work, charges could have been made against them under the headings of giving false addresses, of the driver not holding a driving licence, of carrying arms illegally in the State and of illegally wearing the uniform of the armed forces of another State within the jurisdiction of this State and without permission.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said yesterday that there was no question of this incident affecting the morale of the police force.  I could not accept that.  However, there is no doubt that it has affected the morale of the people of all persuasions in that area.  Some local happenings in Clones recently included a number of houses in the main thoroughfare being damaged by a bomb blast and it was only a miracle that saved many innocent people on that occasion.  There was also the case of a young man who, on arriving home from a dance at midnight, was parking his car across the road from where he lived when he was maimed by an explosion as a result of which he will he deformed for life.</P>
    <P>From investigations I have madeI am sure that the Minister has available to him also the information that is available to me&mdash;I am convinced that the group apprehended by the gardaí were a British Army snatch squad and that they were touring around the area on a kidnapping errand.  I am not concerned here with affording protection to an illegal group in this part of the country.  My views on such matters are clear and are on record but I am concerned that the people of my area are now living in fear of being kidnapped by a snatch squad and that they would appear to be in that danger with the goodwill of the Government.</P>
    <P>This occurrence was very serious and can only leave British Army units confident that when they undertake missions such as this, they can do so without any worries other than being a few hours late should they happen <Col N="587" /> to be apprehended.  I am satisfied that a serious mistake was made in ordering the release of this squad and I have no doubt that the Minister is well aware of that.  I ask him, please, to restore the confidence of the people of my constituency and to do that by making an honest admission of error and by giving a firm assurance that the law will be applied firmly in any such circumstances in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very strong case which has been made by Deputy Leonard there is some cause for concern.  One speaks on a matter like this with considerable care.  In view of a rather crude suggestion made by the Minister for Defence while he was speaking this afternoon, that if one expresses concern about this situation one is not anxious for the security of the State or for peace, I wish also, as Deputy Leonard did, to put on record that I subscribe to the policy of my party in its concern for the security of the State and for the achievement of our political aims in a peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>However, there seems to be something going on here that merits the attention of the Government.  I suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should correspond with the appropriate Minister in Britain and request him to instruct the Officer Commanding the British forces in the North of Ireland to see to it that there is no deliberate crossing of the Border.  The excuse that is given generally is that a mistake was made, but in view of what Deputy Leonard has said, it seems rather difficult to accept that people will be wandering around scarred roads and roads that are very well marked for two or three miles and arrive in a sizeable town, as towns go in that area, and not know where they are.  If they are making mistakes, then it is time that lessons in topography were given to the troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems also that lessons in good manners are required as well and respect for the police authorities of this country.  From what I gather from what Deputy Leonard and others have said there are displays of ill manners and illegal activity, if you like, if people <Col N="588" /> give wrong names or false addresses or are going around without driving licences or armed within the confines of the State.  Therefore I am suggesting that a communication through the British Ambassador might be sent to the relevant authorities on these matters.  The situation&mdash;and I am not punning&mdash;is an explosive one in the area, and for that reason one has to be careful about what one says.  One does not condone violence or confrontation, but we have a duty to see to it that our territory is inviolate and that people who deliberately&mdash;and the sin is all the worse if it is deliberate&mdash;or by accident come here, behave themselves in accordance with the laws of this part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, although I speak subject to correction on this, in previous incidents which have occurred of British troops crossing the Border, they have always been uniformed.  It is quite understandable that there could on occasions be mistakes made.  I do not accept that all crossings of the Border that we know of by British troops have been by mistake or under misapprehension, but I do accept that some of them were and it is quite understandable that it could be so. However, I regard one aspect of this incident as being particularly ominous and sinister and one which the Government should not tolerate.  It is the fact that on this occasion we had some British soldiers armed coming into our territory apparently quite deliberately and not in uniform; in other words, as far as any citizen of this State was concerned who happened to come into contact with them, these were armed civilians.  I regard this as an extremely serious matter.  I am quite sure the Government also regard it as a serious matter, but I think that the urging of Deputy Wilson of the making of strong representations to the British Government on this matter is a very sound one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that the Government ought to, and I hope will, through the Minister's reply, reassure people, particularly in Border areas but throughout the State as well, that this kind of <Col N="589" /> thing will not be tolerated.  It is important, as Deputy Leonard pointed out, that no member of the British forces should be left under the impression that this kind of thing can be done with impunity.  The implications and the potential for danger involved in this kind of incursion in civilian clothes is extremely serious.  It is so serious that I feel the Government must be well aware of it and will, I hope, apart from its approaches to the British Government, be in a position to allay fears among the citizens of this State and to reassure our people, in so far as we can ensure it, that this kind of incursion, particularly of this sinister type, will not occur again.</P>

      <P>The information given to the Garda Síochána by the people concerned was verified and it turned out to be correct with regard to themselves at that particular point, so there must be some misunderstanding. Also I think there is some misunderstanding on the question of the time alleged to have been spent at the home of Mr. McMahon.  Yesterday it was suggested they were there for an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I said an hour elapsed between the time they were at the house and the time they were apprehended by the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my understanding of what was said but in any event, the fact is that a much Shorter period elapsed between the time when they were alleged to have been at the house and the time when they were detained coming into Clones in the opposite direction.  Therefore there are differences on points of detail.  But they do not take away from the fact that this Government views with concern what happened.  I do not want to diminish that in any way.  I think it is fair for us to say on both sides of the House that our forces operating along the Border, many of whom are people <Col N="591" /> who are not familiar with the terrain, Garda Síochána or Army people drawn from other areas, have no record of straying frequently across the Border. I know the Border is complex but our own experience shows that the Garda Síochána and troops from other parts of the country can be so trained as not to stray across the Border on a relatively large number of occasions.  We naturally feel in this Government that that is something that should apply to other forces as well.  I admit that the Border in this area is not only complex but is the most complex part of the whole Border.  It is that part of the Border where there are contiguously areas in County Monaghan and County Fermanagh, neither of which can be reached by road from the rest of the territory concerned.  This poses special problems and, in fairness, we must recognise that fact.  I have driven through the area myself and I know how comlex it is.  Some years ago I think I recall seeing at one point two letterboxes side by side, one red and one green, which indicates the complexity of the Border at this point.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it is, in the view of the Government, all the more reason why the particular units of British troops operating in this area should be particularly trained to have regard to these complexities and that in any operations they carry out they should be well informed on the topography of the area to avoid crossing what is certainly a very complex boundary.</P>
      <P>On the question of the van and the people in it, I think Deputy Colley is correct in saying it was the first occasion a unit of the British Army has been found in the Republic where all of those concerned were not wearing British Army uniforms.  Also, the van in which they were travelling was a plain van.  It is not for us in this part of the country to comment on the particular tactics the British Army may find necessary to employ in disguising themselves in the conditions in which they are operating near the Border, where many lives of British soldiers have been lost and where they are seeking to deal with people like the perpetrators of the atrocity in Coleraine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> What we must say from both sides of the House is that, where it is found necessary not to display too publicly the nature of the vehicle or those in it, if that is thought a necessary tactic to save the lives of soldiers&mdash;I can understand that view being held by the British Army after their losses there&mdash; very great care must be taken that when that tactic is employed they do not cross over the Border, because obviously that gives rise to serious misunderstandings. There is clearly a possibility that the forces on our side of the Border might not understand who they were dealing with if they emerge on our side in a plain van, and if the people visible in the van are not wearing uniforms and are in possession of arms.  We view with particular concern the fact that this should have happened in these circumstances. I do not wish to make a comment on the particular tactics employed within Northern Ireland as it is beyond our competence and we can understand the necessity for taking particular steps in view of what has happened in that area.  It is especially important that, in an area where the Border is complex and where there is a special danger of mistakes being made, if this particular tactic is to be employed great care would have to be exercised to prevent any recurrence of what happened on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Regarding the release of those concerned, as far as I am aware from information at my disposal they were held for very much longer than any British forces who were previously found on our side of the Border.  In fact, I understand they were held more than three times as long as on any previous occasion.  That is an indication that the matter was not taken lightly and that, in fact, before they were released not alone were steps taken to check and verify the names, but that information was doublechecked and they were not released until they had given an explanation of what they were doing and why they were there.  As they had entered Clones from the opposite direction to what they had thought, the explanation was less than satisfactory from any point of view: but it is compatible with the fact that they had lost their <Col N="593" /> way and is also compatible with other explanations.  They were not released until a much longer period had elapsed than ever before and not until they had given information that had identified them, which information had been double-checked, and an explanation of the circumstances by which they were there.  I should like to emphasise that also.</P>
    <P>I think that is all that is appropriate for me to say in my capacity as substitute Minister for Justice.  Other matters may arise when I am replying as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I should like to be fair to the Minister on this point.  I should like him to confirm if I heard him correctly say it is not within our <Col N="594" /> competence to comment on the tactics employed by the British Army inside the Six Counties.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not complete the sentence.  That was the first part of the sentence but I went on to define the tactics to which I am referring and to distinguish the tactics of disguising themselves to a degree in circumstances which may save lives from any other kind of tactics that might be employed.  I am grateful to the Deputy for having drawn attention to what could be a misunderstanding but if he reads the Official record he will see there was a complete sentence and I was referring to particular tactics of disguise and no other tactics.</P>

      <P>Under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, grant incentives to industry are available in all areas in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the designated areas the statutory limit on capital grants is 60 per cent of eligible expenditure for new industry and 35 per cent for re-equipment, while in non-designated areas the corresponding <Col N="559" /> limits are 45 per cent and 25 per cent.  In practice the grants for new industry are at present limited to 50 per cent in designated areas and 35 per cent in non-designated areas.</P>
    <P>Certain incentives are unique to the designated areas; namely, an investment allowance for tax purposes of 20 per cent of expenditure on plant and machinery and a reduction of two-thirds on local rates for industrial buildings for a ten-year period.</P>
    <P>Incentives available generally are the tax relief on export profits, free depreciation for capital expenditure on new plant and machinery, training grants, grants of up to £15,000 for research and development projects, an initial allowance for tax purposes of 20 per cent of expenditure on industrial buildings and an annual allowance of 22 per cent thereafter.</P>

      <P>The Consultative Assembly's recommendations regarding the establishment of a Multi-disciplinary Committee of Experts on Drug Dependence is still under consideration by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. As the proceedings of the Committee are confidential, it would be inappropriate, at this stage, to discuss the Government's attitude to the recommendation.</P>
