      <P>I just want to reiterate the disappointment &mdash; I could use an even stronger term &mdash; that this side of the House feels at the manner in which our case was treated yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  I put up our case in what I thought was a reasoned, balanced and temperate manner.  I thought I made it clear what the purpose of our case and of the amendments was.  I am quite aware of the purport of the advice you have just got, Sir, one speech and one speech only.  I said we put this up in the spirit of adhering to a principle that has long been established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For the second time during the course of the debate on this Bill the Minister has displayed not only his ignorance of Standing Orders but his inherent arrogance in dealing with matters before this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister keeps up that attitude he will know what a filibuster is.  Again, I am trying to approach this is a reasoned manner and I am inviting the Minister to reciprocate if he finds it possible, if he can get over his impetuosity, and the manner in which he has been dealing with this matter ever since it was introduced in the House indicates to me he is unable to do so.  Again, I want to go back to a reasoned level of debate and if the Minister wants to divert it from a reasoned level, then be it on his own head.</P>
      <P>We have been trying to maintain a principle here, and the Minister tries, in effect, not only to abandon that principle but to cash in on it as far as another proposition is concerned. I put the case clearly yesterday and I want to say to some of the political commentators &mdash; I am not going to be popular for this &mdash; that we are neither being a varicious nor confused in the manner in which we are approaching this.  I would invite each of them again to read my Second Reading speech, to read, if they have time, the provisions of the various Acts dealing with this matter away back since 1938.  They will see in my references to the relevant sections of those Acts a positive pattern developing: first of all, the introduction of the principle of the allowance for the Opposition, and the pattern in four successive Acts of continuous increases in that Opposition allowance to try to have regard to the rising cost of living during that period of some 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That pattern kept pace, by and large, with the increases given to Deputies and Senators over that period, except in 1968 when what was described here as a spectacular increase was given.  That increase was given in recognition of the extra burden imposed on the Opposition by reason, first of all, of the passage of time, the inflationary trends then obtaining and, more particularly, the extra burden of work that the accelerated pace of administration imposed on the Opposition. It was an easier matter for <Col N="1730" /> the Government, in that they have the Civil Service at their hand and they had the facility not only of recruitment but also of increasing the rate of recruitment in all grades to deal with the accelerated growth of administration.  That was done on the Government's side and we recognised in 1968 that it was necessary, and that it was also necessary to catch up between 1964 and 1968 by providing an extra allowance.</P>
    <P>I want to say again for the benefit of the paper that circulates mainly in my own city that my speech was not confused yesterday, that it was clear and concise, and separated the issues that were involved.  I would invite the editor of that paper to read my Second Reading speech when the report appears.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to be clear and concise on this matter.  There is and always has been a special allowance for the Opposition to provide the kind of services that an Opposition needs, the kind of services which the Civil Service provides for the Government.  There is a clear and established principle, one that has been accepted by Fianna Fáil Governments down through the years and, indeed, by the first and second Coalitions.  Now there is an attempt to confuse the issue by introducing into this principle the question of giving Opposition Deputies and Government Deputies an allowance for themselves, an allowance to provide secretarial and other services.  We as a Government never enjoyed that allowance.  We as a Government party provided secretarial services out of subscriptions paid by our own members.  We have continued that practice to date and will, in any event continue that practice, because these secretarial services are necessary for the proper conduct of Deputies' constituency problems.  On any given day scores of Fianna Fáil Deputies can be seen dictating their constituency letters to a pool of typists we have employed especially for that purpose, and that will be continued.  If the idea is now that the Government will provide the kind of expenses required for that service, well and good, but let it be on an equal basis between all Deputies in the House, and let it not <Col N="1731" /> be confused with the overall issue of a special allowance for the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Those are the terms in which I spoke yesterday.  If they are confused now I can only say the intelligence of a lot of people must be rather dim.  I think the point I am making is as clear as daylight, and I ask the Minister again to recognise that principle.  We are quite prepared to go along with whatever proposals he wishes to bring forward in relation to allowances for Deputies <i>per se</i>, but these allowances ought to be paid on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Blaney says, the proposals now would exclude individual Independent Members or Independent Members as a group, because of the provisions of previous legislation whereby they would not reach the required numbers to be recognised as a party, that is, seven.  I think this would be inequitable, and if the position were reached in which we had several Independent Deputies or a number of groups with less than seven Members attached to those groups, all these groups would be excluded under the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let us maintain the principle of an Opposition allowance, and if we want to introduce a special measure or special facilities to provide Deputies with the kind of clerical assistance that is now being provided out of party subscriptions, by all means let us have that as well, but on a fair basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that when one tries to interpret the provisions of this Bill one is obliged to refer back to a number of statutes &mdash;not so excessive a number of <Col N="1732" /> statutes as to present an enormous problem in codifying the law in this respect, but sufficiently large a number of references back to make interpretation difficult.  Therefore, I should like to urge the Minister to set in train &mdash;he clearly could not do it at this stage &mdash; arrangements to codify the legislation in this respect.  Two types of legislation come together here, the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Acts and the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts.  It would be a worthwhile and not a major task for the draftsman's office to codify the law in this respect so as to ensure without too great difficulty that anybody reading the legislation can see reasonably clearly what is involved.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 has been deemed to be out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The allowance to be paid to each member of Dáil Éireann and the allowance to be paid to each member of Seanad Éireann shall be reviewed by the Government and a report by the Government of the outcome of such review shall be laid before Dáil Éireann at intervals not exceeding two years commencing on the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 4 are cognate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable to take the two together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreed.  These are the amendments I mentioned on Second Stage and which I handed across the floor of the House.  It will be clear that the object of the amendments is to bring about a situation, or at least to attempt to remedy a situation about which Deputies on all sides have complained in the past.  We are all aware <Col N="1733" /> that one of the difficulties which has arisen in the past in relation to increases in allowances to Deputies, Senators, <i>et cetera</i>, has been that because of the long delay between one increase and the next the amounts involved have appeared to be excessive to the general public.  Deputies on all sides agree, I think, that it would be far more equitable, and more understandable and reassuring as far as the public are concerned, if necessary increases were made at much more frequent intervals.</P>
      <P>It may have been that in the past there were many reasons as to why this did not happen and these amendments are designed to ensure that at intervals not exceeding two years all the allowances and salaries dealt with in this Bill would be reviewed by the Government. I think that part of the amendment is surely unobjectionable, and that the Government should review the salaries and allowances at periods not exceeding two years.</P>
      <P>The amendment goes further and suggests that the Government should lay before Dáil Éireann a report of the outcome of that review.  Of course, it would be quite possible that in certain circumstances any Government might, in such a report, state in effect: &ldquo;We have examined the levels of the allowances and salaries and in the prevailing circumstances have come to the conclusion that there should be no change therein.&rdquo;  That is something which could happen and it is not precluded by these amendments, but I think it is necessary if one accepts the idea in the amendments, to provide that there should be a report laid before Dáil Éireann because without that report the Government of the day could carry out the review to their own satisfaction but as far as the House and the public were concerned nothing would have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that these amendments might remedy a cause of complaint on all sides of the House. They endeavour to meet that problem in a reasonable way.  In his reply on the Second Stage the Minister indicated he was not disposed to accept such amendments and I think the reason he gave was that he considered them to <Col N="1734" /> be rather nebulous.  I suggested then that if he felt that I was quite happy to have the experts available to the Minister redraft these amendments, if the Minister accepted them in principle &mdash;that he would have a second look at them.  He did not seem to be disposed to accept that either, saying that the provision in the Bill whereby allowance changes can be made by order more than adequately met the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is true.  It goes some of the way but it does not ensure that salaries and allowances are examined and reviewed at regular intervals and the necessary decisions made on them.  I would hope, therefore, that in the interval the Minister may have given a lot more thought to this problem and that, as a result, he will agree at least to the principle of these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments in the knowledge and experience of two sections in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in which we have been looking for some formula by which Members of the Oireachtas can be paid their due increases at more regular intervals.  This is necessary even from the point of view of the type of publicity that some of our misguided newspapers have been inclined to give to these issues. Not so long ago we had banner headlines stating: &ldquo;TD's Get Massive Increases&rdquo;.  They appeared in some of our newspapers.  We were the only people singled out for that type of treatment although, as everybody knows, the judiciary and the higher civil servants were given what has been ascribed to us &mdash; massive increases&mdash; more massive than we are getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important from the point of view of the House that we work out some formula by which we can ensure that Deputies' salaries can keep pace with general increases prevailing in the country.  I know we will run into all sorts of difficulties when we look for this formula and I do not know the best method to arrive at it.  There were suggestions that we link it to a grade in the Civil Service but that was found to be unworkable or impossible in the sense that it gave us a vested interest <Col N="1735" /> in a certain grade of the Civil Service and that we might ensure that they got increases.  I can well see an argument in that, but I think there is an overwhelming argument for some such system to be worked out.  I do not think it is beyond the genius of the Department of Finance to put some suggestion before us through which we could contemplate the alleviation of this problem.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very reasonable amendment.  I find it very hard to even work out a reason why the Minister would not accept it.  If he does accept it he will ensure that in future we do not get the type of uninformed bad publicity we have been getting up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Deputy's amendment has been allowed proves that it is ineffective because if it were effective in imposing a charge on a public fund, in other words if it achieved the purpose for which it is designed, that is to ensure increases from time to time, it would be denied.  That is why I see no reason to depart from what I said previously.  It simply would require a report to be written but the shelves of the Library of this House are already stacked full of written reports on which no action was taken. Far more significant are the provisions in the Bill to enable increases to be given by order of the Government and my own undertakings on the Second Stage to give increases whenever nationally agreed levels of remuneration should be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment would provide that the allowances of Deputies and Senators and the salaries of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries would be reviewed by the Government and that a report by the Government on the outcome of such a review would be laid down before the Dáil every two years.  It is over a year since we had the Devlin Report and it is over two years since the Devlin Committee was asked to deal with the reference concerning Parliamentarians. Where does the setting up of groups to review and the publication <Col N="1736" /> of reports get us?  Nowhere except ending up at the end of it all in an unseemly debate like we had yesterday.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion in the Deputy's amendments that there would be any obligation on the Government or the House to accept what recommendations would develop from such a review.  It is not even suggested that the review should contain a recommendation. It is simply that it might describe what everybody would know.  I cannot see any value in spending public time and money on such a fruitless exercise.  We are providing that the rates of remuneration can be increased whenever the Government think fit.  I would remind the House of the commitments which I have already given on the Second Stage.  These are that:</P>
    <P>in the event of further national pay agreements, as they are entered into they will be implemented so far as allowances to Members of Houses of the Oireachtas are concerned.</P>
    <P>That commitment is recited at column 1316 of the Dáil Official Report of 18th July, 1973, I further indicated at column 1320:</P>
    <P>if and when adjustments take place on a nationally-agreed level elsewhere then the necessary order can be made.</P>
    <P>At column 1322 I said:</P>
    <P>It would be our intention to increase the remuneration whenever a national wage agreement would indicate that there was a nationally accepted formula for so doing.</P>
    <P>I think that is the most effective guarantee which can be given.  It is much more constructive than the suggestions of Deputy Colley.  I accept his suggestions were made in good faith.  I think he will see, however, that the way in which we are going about it will ensure a greater likelihood of no further delays in the future.  I would not wish to set a pattern and say anything that could be quoted as indicating what the pattern of future wage agreements should be; but it is not improbable, looking <Col N="1737" /> at the pattern of previous national wage agreements, that increases in future remuneration under national wage agreements will take place more frequently than once in every two years.  If we were to accept the Deputy's suggestion and discipline ourselves to move only as a result of such reviews, then there would be unnecessary delays, the kind which generate the kind of comment which leads people to believe that the Members of this House are receiving now rates of remuneration which are outside the national wage agreement.  On all sides of the House we have heard such comments made over the last week, when in fact all we are doing is making up now for the default over the last five years in not paying these increases as they arose.  We want to avoid that and we are providing the machinery for doing it.  I have given the most explicit undertakings to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might deal with the last point the Minister made first, he is mistaken in saying that if national agreements were to occur, as it is quite likely, that they would provide for increases at shorter intervals than heretofore and that there would then be delay if this amendment were accepted.  He is mistaken there because, of course, the amendment provides for review at intervals not exceeding two years.  If there were shorter periods involved in a new national agreement this amendment would not at all preclude review and laying before the House of a report by the Government of a review which it might carry out, say, every 12 months, if that were the requirement of the current national agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister talks about the application of new national agreements to the remuneration of Members of this House and the other House and Ministers, <i>et cetera</i>.  I have two observations to make on that. Firstly, while I hope there will be a new national agreement entered into, the Minister, I think, will admit that it is by no means a certainty that such agreement would be entered into. Therefore, we must contemplate a situation in which there is no national <Col N="1738" /> agreement and what is likely to happen in relation to the matters dealt with in this Bill if that situation arises.  Even if there is a new national agreement our experience in this Bill and in the Minister's proposals is that the national agreements which have existed and exist at the moment are not being applied.  As far as we are concerned the fact that there are national agreements does not mean they will be applied to the remuneration of Members of this House and of the other House.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that the amendments do not impose an obligation on the Government of the day to increase the remuneration involved in this Bill.  That is true, and the amendment would not be in order if it proposed to do so.  Apart from that it would, in my opinion, be very defective if it were to do that because, clearly, at any given time when the question of reviewing allowances and salaries of parliamentarians is involved all the circumstances at the time and all the circumstances that have occurred since the previous increase have got to be considered by the Government of the day.  That is all that is required here.</P>
    <P>The whole point of this amendment is to ensure that the Government of the day address themselves to the problem and show to the House and the public that they have done so by bringing in and laying before the House a report of the outcome of their review of the situation.  In my view, this is not imposing an obligation on any Government which could be unacceptable to them.  It is, however, ensuring that we will not have a recurrence of what has happened in the past.  In this case, five years have elapsed, at a time when there has been greater inflation than ever before, since the last increase was made in the allowances in salaries of parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the fact that you have a review and a report laid before the Dáil is not a guarantee that the Government of the day in fact will increase the allowance, <i>et cetera</i>.  However, a report by the Government is quite different from a report by any other body because it is the Government <Col N="1739" /> which is the body, and the only body, which can take the initiative in this matter.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a report by the Government would, in my opinion, necessitate either concrete proposals by the Government of the day in regard to the remuneration and allowances or, alternatively, as I indicated earlier, it would specifically state that in their view there should be no change. Presumably in any reasonable conception of such a report, it would specify the reasons why the Government took that view.  Therefore, in my opinion, this would be a reasonably satisfactory way of tackling the problem which the Minister admits is one which has been referred to by and has been of concern to Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not made anything like a convincing case as to why this amendment should not be accepted. If he says it will be ineffective, then what I have just said deals with that argument.  Is there any other reason? Assuming he thinks it will be ineffective, and we think it will not, if it is ineffective he is not losing anything. It seems to me that, if the Minister has any argument of substance against the amendment, it should be on the basis that it will be effective and will be too effective, perhaps.  If he thinks it would commit the Government to something to which they did not want to be committed, that would be an argument I could understand.  That is not the argument, because he is saying it will have no effect.  I tried to show that I think he is wrong.  Let us assume for the moment that he is not wrong and that it would be ineffective: what has he to lose by accepting the amendment?  That is what we should like to know.</P>

      <P>The arguments for this amendment were put very clearly and cogently by Deputy Colley and Deputy Crowley.  I listened to the Minister's reply.  I cannot see any validity in what he said.  He started off by saying that, if the amendment were to be effective, it would not have been allowed by you, Sir, and since it <Col N="1740" /> has been allowed for discussion and to be decided on by the Committee, therefore it is useless.  As I understand it, the only reason why you, Sir, might rule out an amendment of this kind is that it imposes a charge on public funds.  The whole point of this amendment is that it does not do that.  It allows this very thorny problem &mdash; and it is a very thorny one &mdash; to be reviewed properly every two years so that the situation of accumulated delay in which we now find ourselves would not arise again.  This is not the only time that this situation arose.  To a greater or lesser extent it arose every time a Bill was brought in to increase salaries or allowances.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given no argument whatever in reply to Deputy Colley's case that it is patently and clearly desirable that this amendment should be accepted.  I can only hope &mdash; and it is a hope after what we had to hear from the Minister yesterday &mdash; that he will see sense and go a long way towards solving this perennial difficulty by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we are discussing an amendment which proposes that the salaries and allowances of TDs, Senators, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, and so on, should be reviewed at intervals not exceeding two years by the Government of the day and that a report of the outcome of that review should be laid before Dáil Éireann.  This does not impose any charge on the Exchequer.  The <Col N="1741" /> object is to try to deal with the problem which Deputies on all sides, including Deputies who are here now, have complained about in the past, that is, that too long an interval has elapsed between one increase and another and, as a result, when increases were granted they appeared to the public to be excessive when, in fact, they were not and were only taking account of the interval which had elapsed between one increase and another.  The object of this amendment is to ensure that the Government of the day would be obliged, at intervals not exceeding two years, to examine all the allowances and salaries and lay a report on the outcome of that before the House.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, no obligation proposed in this amendment on the Government to come in with the report and say that salaries are to be increased.  It visualises a situation where a Government might say: &ldquo;We have examined the situation and, for the following reasons, we do not think there should be any change.&rdquo;  At least this would ensure that, if the requirements of the situation were that there should be some modest increase, the Government could then and would almost certainly, as a result of having carried out the review and bringing in the report, bring in proposals to make this modest increase rather than allow this very long interval to elapse.</P>

      <P>No interpolation from me.  I never interpolated anything into the Official Report.  It is clear enough from the interjections we have had that some of the Deputies opposite, not all of them, may have been fooled by some of the misstatements made by the Minister for Finance or, alternatively, they may not have been fooled but they feel they have to have some defence of the carry-on by the Minister for Finance on this Bill.  We will come to that in much more detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> What we are discussing at the moment is this amendment, which I suggest is a reasonable amendment, designed to meet a problem about which Deputies on that side and this side of the House have frequently complained.  The Minister will not, he said, accept the amendment.  His answer is that it would be ineffective, it would not do anything.  I put it to you, Sir, and through you to the Deputies opposite, that either this amendment would be effective or ineffective. If it were effective, is there any objection to it?  If, on the other hand, it were ineffective what has the Minister to lose in accepting it?  I believe it would be effective.  It is open to anybody to have the contrary belief. Suppose it is ineffective, what does the Minister lose by accepting it?  I would suggest that Deputies opposite might think about it.  They have, or should have, an interest in this.  It is in the interests not only of Deputies and Senators, it is in the interests of the public, I believe, to ensure that there does not appear to be an excessive amount of an increase in the salaries and allowances of public representatives. That is in everybody's interest.  I would urge Deputies opposite to have a little whisper in the ear of the Minister for Finance and ask him, for once, to show that somewhere inside him there is a certain amount of common sense.  I believe there may be a certain amount, but he conceals it very effectively.  If he cannot put forward a better argument than he has put forward so far for not accepting this amendment he is not showing one ounce of common sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me reply to that interjection, originally addressed to me, and subsequently through the Chair, and say, first of all, the occasion when one can do this is when one has a Bill of this kind before the House.  When I became Minister for Finance the whole question of the <Col N="1745" /> allowances and salaries, <i>et cetera,</i> that we are dealing with here had all been referred to the Devlin Commission. Would Deputies at least pay a little attention to this and let us not have any more of these silly interjections we have had?  It had already been referred to the Devlin Commission.  We got the Devlin Report and that covered not only Deputies, Senators and so on but judges, higher civil servants, local authority people in the higher echelons, the chief executives of the various State-sponsored bodies and so on.  It was a very detailed, complicated and well-produced document that required a good deal of consideration and also required to allow the parties who were involved to make representations in connection with it, which they did.</P>
      <P>The Government at the time when that report was received were in quite a different position from when the report was commissioned because when it was received there was a national agreement in operation and it was clearly the obligation of the Government not to do anything which would or would even seem to breach the national agreement.  Therefore, the Government referred it to the Employer/Labour Conference, the body who had negotiated the national agreement, the body who had available to them a steering committee of skilled people whose job it was to interpret various aspects of the national agreement where there were conflicts.  It was referred to them to advise the Government on the extent to which the implementation of the Devlin Report could correspond with and conform to the national agreement. We got that report on 22nd December last.  These are the facts.  In the light of these facts would Deputies please&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley has asked us to tell him how he could have done something about this.  As Minister for Finance he could have influenced the Government not to have a general election and, therefore, he could have brought in a Bill which would have been an act of common justice for many people in the judiciary, for higher civil servants and for Deputies but he would not face the odium that might come from such a move and, so, there was a general election.  He wants to persuade us now into believing that he had not available to him sufficient time in which to introduce a measure of this nature but he had plenty of time to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment appears, <i>prima facie</i>, to be very reasonable but after it is examined <Col N="1748" /> and after one has heard the Minister's view on it, one begins to wonder why Deputy Colley did not introduce it during his many years in office.  I will not accept that he had to wait for the Devlin Report because for many years before then there was a crying necessity to increase the allowances and salaries of Deputies and persons in other categories.</P>

      <P>Long before the Devlin Report was set up, increases could and should have been given to the various categories of persons mentioned in this Bill.  The Deputy is trying to say now that everything hinged on the Devlin Report.  The last Government did not introduce a measure of this nature because it was not one that would make good argument at the crossroads.</P>

      <P>We would appreciate hearing the Deputy's views on the amendment.  I do not agree with the Deputy in regard to what happened in the past.  I have already expressed my views in that regard.  Irrespective of that, and taking the situation as of now, can the Deputy say whether the amendment is reasonable or otherwise? If there is a good case against it, could we hear his views in that regard?  It seems to me that the amendment is reasonable and I would like to hear the views of an experienced Deputy, such as Deputy Dockrell, on it.  Perhaps there is something in it that is escaping me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the amendment appears, <i>prima facie</i>, to be reasonable but all Deputies must make up their own minds on these matters.  When one considers the apparent reasonableness of the amendment one also wonders why it was not introduced in the past and whether Deputy Colley was an unreasonable person.  Why did those apparently cogent arguments that he is putting before us now not occur to him previously? Is this a sudden conversion that has taken place as a result of his move across the floor to the Opposition <Col N="1749" /> benches?  I stand behind my own Minister who has said that there are reasons why this amendment may not be as reasonable as it appears.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an intelligent suggestion designed to prevent the type of occurrences that have happened in the past.  The Minister says that because he will ensure we will be tied to national wage agreements we do not have anything to worry about.  He did not honour the national wage agreement or the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference when he refused to implement that report fully. He did not date the increases back to the time recommended.  Our argument is that he is quite likely next year, or the year after, if he is still here, to do the same thing and our amendment will ensure against that.  It is not an unreasonable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, this matter has been discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I know it has the backing of most Members of the House.  However, because the Minister adopts a stick-in-the-mud attitude of no change at any cost, he will not accept the amendment.  Despite what Deputy Dockrell has said, I think he would be well advised to accept it because it will guarantee all Deputies that in future we will not be treated as second-class citizens&mdash;that we will get increases in allowances when we are entitled to get them.  I am asking the House not to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of a Minister who yesterday came in and introduced a most acrimonious tone to the debate.  He suggested that former Ministers of this side should subsidise the research and secretarial services of their backbenchers but he did not commit himself, on his increased allowance, to subsidise his backbenchers.  It was a petty and cheap political scoring point.  Every Member of the House is <Col N="1751" /> interested in ensuring that never again will we have to wait for five years to get increases due to us.  If the public did not see us as being able to look after ourselves properly they would quickly lose confidence in our ability to look after them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dockrell puts it beautifully when he says that <i>prima facie</i> it is desirable and reasonable but he understands the Minister for Finance gave some reasons why it should not be accepted and that was good enough for him.  When he was asked what those reasons were, he was not aware of them but he would take the word of the Minister for it.  That gives a totally unreal sort of debate.  I want to talk about that amendment. Cogent arguments have been put forward by Deputy Colley and Deputy Crowley.

      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary for me to detail the arguments for this amendment again.  They have been set out in detail and have not been controverted or questioned by the other side of the House which, for the most part, would appear to accept them but feel because they are told by the Minister for Finance they will have to vote against them.  A situation like this creates an unreal debate and because of that and because there are no arguments that can be cogently put against the amendment we have instead of argument the sort of interruptions, shouting and ill-temper that we have experienced on and off for the past hour.  That is no substitute for argument.  It is a pity that those who complain about the time of the <Col N="1761" /> House being wasted or expended unduly on this matter would not realise that.</P>
      <P>I began trying to reply to Deputy Enright on this point ten or 15 minutes ago by saying that this Bill is not like any of its five predecessors since 1938.  It has innovations of a radical kind for which there has been no justification and, as an Opposition, we cannot allow that to happen.  It is not just a duty to ourselves but to democracy generally.  If you have a Minister for Finance who takes up the totally intransigent and abusive attitude that he has taken up over the past couple of days in relation to the Bill and any possible amendments of it, I fear we are in for a long and, unfortunately, hot debate.</P>

We have had no arguments on that side and unless the Government side are prepared to argue rationally against the amendment, we shall just have to put our arguments and listen to abuse in place of argument from the other side.</P>

      <P>In relation to the amendment the Minister has asked us to trust him in relation to future reviews. Prior to this we found that he was untrustworthy in so far as he failed to implement the terms of the wage agreement as indicated by the Employer/Labour Conference.  There have been many rude interruptions from the Government side of the House.  The procedure here, in order to evolve better legislation, has been that amendments are put down, examined, analysed and discussed in a rational way with views being expressed on these amendments by both sides of the House.  The only view we have had from the Government side was that of Deputy Enright who indicated that the Opposition party was endeavouring to drive a wedge between the Government and their backbenchers. This is a clear indication of the thinking of the backbenchers of Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, after making this statement Deputy Enright was told to close <Col N="1764" /> his mouth by the Chief Whip of the Government party and to change his attack in relation to the argument he was making.  Apparently many of the Government backbenchers are in revolt.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this matter.  I am a Member of the House since March but I must confess that I have not been overedified by the discussion, if I may call it such, which I have heard in the last hour.  My initial reaction to this amendment would be to be against it because I do not regard the matter of Deputies' salaries to be the prerogative of a Government of the day.  It is very much an all-Party matter for the Members of this House. The amendment says, &ldquo;shall be reviewed by the Government&rdquo;.  We have a Committee on Procedure and Privileges which has been active for some considerable time in these matters and it is probably because of the activities of that Committee that we now have this Bill before the House. I regret that this Bill appears to be discussed on party lines.  This is very unfortunate and we would be far better <Col N="1766" /> occupied applying our time to what are really more important matters. Having got this Bill through, and learned the hard way in the process, we might be more careful in future in our conduct concerning matters pertinent and personal to all of us.  We have none of us done ourselves any good in this discussion.  As I understand it, an undertaking has been given by the Minister that our salaries will keep pace with national wage agreements.</P>

Before I came in here, coming from a political family, I was very conscious of debates in this House, and one thing that struck me very forcibly was the thin-skinned approach of Members when it came to the matter of their salaries.  For some reason or other there was a patent anxiety on the part of a certain side of this House to be very careful in regard to what might be put down on paper.  I would say it is about time that Deputies realised they have a standing in the country, are elected by the people and should have the courage and guts to take the steps they are rightfully entitled to take&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate Deputy Esmonde on being the first Deputy on the Government side of the House who, since we started to discuss this amendment, endeavoured to make any case in respect of the amendment.  It is quite clear from the Minister's attitude and that of the Deputies opposite who understand <Col N="1767" /> what the amendment is, and here I except Deputy Esmonde, that most of them agree with the amendment and they cannot, therefore, make any case against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Esmonde's case, I understand his objection with regard to the Government, but I would remind him that no steps can be taken to increase allowances or salaries except on the initiative of the Government under both Standing Orders and under the Constitution. That is why the amendment suggests that the review should be carried out by the Government.  It is of great significance that this amendment has produced an almost unique situation &mdash;it was certainly unique until Deputy Esmonde spoke&mdash;in that no backbencher on the Government side <Col N="1768" /> could even be provoked into speaking either for or against the amendment. It is unfortunate the Minister displayed the attitude he has.  If the amendment is ineffective, as the Minister suggests, he has nothing to lose.  I believe it could be effective and, if it were, that would meet the problem with which Deputies on both side are concerned.  We have had no cogent arguments against the amendment. Here, again, I except Deputy Esmonde.</P>
    <P>I make just one last appeal to the Minister to be reasonable and say: &ldquo;I do not think this will be effective, but there is nothing to lose by putting it in.&rdquo;  If he thinks there is something to lose we are willing to listen to him. He has not yet told us there is nothing to lose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the section which sets out the amount of the allowance proposed to be paid to Deputies and Senators, and it is also the section which provides that they shall be deemed to have come into operation on 1st July of this year.  As you know, Sir, I had put down an amendment to the section which, under Standing Orders of the House, you were obliged to rule out of order. Nevertheless, I take it, Sir, that I am in order in referring to the amendment in the discussion on the section.  It summarises very well the principal objection we have to this section as it is drafted.  That amendment was to delete lines 35 to 40 on page 2, and on page 3 to delete lines 1 and 2, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>The allowance to be paid to each Member of Dáil Éireann and of Seanad Éireann shall be the sums recommended in the Report of the Special Committee of the Employer/ Labour Conference on the remuneration of the Judiciary, Higher Civil Service and Parliamentarians dated 22nd December, 1972, and such sums shall be payable on the dates and in the amounts recommended in the said Report.</P>
      <P>We have made it clear that we believe very strongly that the report of the Employer/Labour Conference should be, in this legislation, honoured and implemented in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just to recall the situation, because there have been arguments on the Government side to the effect that the Employer/Labour Conference report was unclear or did not make recommendations which would be different from what is proposed in this section, I would remind the House that the terms of reference of the Employer/ Labour Conference in preparing this report were to advise in relation to the extent to which effect might be given to the review body's recommendations <Col N="1771" /> for each group covered in the report on the basis of and for the duration of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>I think the position is quite clear from that that we had the Devlin Report, but that the Employer/Labour Conference, the body which had negotiated the national agreements, which had set up a steering committee to supervise the implementation of the national agreements in various sectors of the economy, the body which represented both the employer side and the trade union side, were asked to advise the Government and this House, in effect, on the extent to which effect might be given to the Devlin Report on the basis of and for the duration of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything could be clearer as to the terms of reference and what was involved.  We come now to what the report said.  On page 10, paragraph 24, dealing with Deputies, the report said the following:</P>
    <P>The present allowance of £2,500 a year for Deputies has not been varied since July, 1968, when it was fixed at that level by legislation.  If, however, a twelfth round increase in line with that granted to the Public Service had been applied to Members of the Oireachtas then a Deputy's allowance, inclusive of that increase and the first phase of the National Agreement of 1970 would have been £3,029 from 1st January 1972.  On that basis, the second phase increase provided for in the agreement of 1970, that is, 4 per cent plus a cost of living supplement, would become due 12 months after the relevant date in respect of the first phase increase and the terms of the Second National Agreement would apply in due course.</P>
    <P>Various efforts have been made on the Government side to suggest either that this is not clear or that it is not a recommendation at all.  It has been suggested that the report did not attempt to suggest the figures which would have applied in the past.  You will see, Sir, from what I have read out that the report spells out precisely what the figure would have been on 1st January 1972, and then provides the formula <Col N="1772" /> by which subsequent increases would be applied.</P>
    <P>If it is desired to say that because the report says &ldquo;If, however, a twelfth round increase in line with that granted to the Public Service&rdquo;, <i>et cetera</i>, had been applied to Deputies and, therefore, they were not making any recommendation in regard to Deputies, if the wish of the Government side is to argue in that way, I would ask what was the point of the whole report.  Was it not, as I have quoted from the terms of reference, to consider the terms of the Devlin Report and to advise the Government, the House and the public as to the manner in which the Devlin Report could be implemented, and still enable us to comply with the national agreements?</P>
    <P>The Employer/Labour Conference, when they approached this problem, considered that the only basis on which they could make a recommendation was to consider what had happened in the public service.  They came up with this formula.  They came up with a similar approach in the case of Senators and with a similar approach in the case of office holders, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers, <i>et cetera</i>.  They also made recommendations in respect of the Judiciary and higher civil servants&mdash;again on the same basis.  Nothing could be clearer, in my view, than the terms of this report.</P>
    <P>However, on the Second Stage, amongst various contradictory arguments made from time to time by the Minister was one to the effect that the terms of this report were not clear.  When I questioned him as to whether, if he thought this were so, he would be prepared to accept that this report should be implemented from a date which would be made clear to his satisfaction from the Employer/Labour Conference he replied, firstly, that the Government had made their own interpretation and it was the correct one.  Subsequently, when pressed, he said that this was a hypothetical question.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation is quite clear.  There was a clearcut recommendation and the Government deliberately <Col N="1773" /> decided not to accept that recommendation.  It is perfectly legitimate for the Government to decide not to accept a particular recommendation from this or any other report.  That is a normal function of any Government but if that was the situation, then this House was entitled to expect that the Government would come in here and say openly: &ldquo;We have decided not to accept this recommendation and the reasons are as follows&rdquo; and to give the reasons.  That is not, however, what was done.</P>
    <P>The Government have tried to pretend that they are in this section implementing this report.  You will see from the extract from the report in relation to Deputies which I read out that the report mentions a specific figure which would have operated as at the 1st January, 1972, and then provides the formula by which subsequent increases should be calculated. If the Minister wants to argue that that formula is not clear perhaps he would explain to the House how he arrived at the figure in this section in respect of Deputies, the figure of £3,416.  That figure is not contained in the Employer/Labour Conference report but it is a figure derived from the formula spelled out in that report.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, there would be no problem whatever for his advisers to work out on the basis of this report precisely what the figures would have been and should have been at the different dates recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference report.  That can be done and, as the Minister has demonstrated by providing the figure in this section, has been done.  Therefore, that argument about lack of clarity simply does not stand up.  If the Minister wants to make it again I would again invite him to say if he really is contending it is not clear and whether, on receipt of clarification from the Employer/ Labour Conference, he would be prepared to accept that.  That is something he could do under the terms of this Bill.  He could implement the Bill as it is drafted and make an order under a subsequent section on the basis of the Employer/Labour Conference clarification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> Would the Minister, if he is not prepared to do that, at least have the honesty to tell us that he is not prepared to accept this particular recommendation of the Employer/Labour Conference and let us not waste time arguing round in circles, as we have been doing, because of the attitude taken by the Minister and some of his colleagues in relation to this report? The position seems to me to be perfectly clear from the face of the report itself.  If it is not, then the real issue can be clarified quite easily if the Minister would say whether he would be prepared to accept the recommendation of the Employer/ Labour Conference report on foot of an order which he could make under this Bill on receipt of clarification from the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>We have had, of course, some purported explanation by the Minister as to why he proposes to apply to Deputies, Senators and others the recommended figures only as from 1st July, 1973.  He said that the Employer/ Labour Conference report did not recommend retrospection.  That is one of the arguments he made.  If it did not recommend retrospection, why did he apply retrospection to the judges and to the higher civil servants dealt with in the same report? He cannot have it both ways.  The report should be implemented in respect of all the people concerned, or it should not.  The Minister and the Government have chosen to implement the report in full in relation to the Judiciary and the higher civil servants but not to implement it in full in relation to Deputies, Senators and parliamentarians generally.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is perfectly legitimate for the Government to decide this; but it is not legitimate for them to pretend that that is not what they are doing or to pretend that the reason for their decision is that parliamentarians are, in the Minister's words, &ldquo;better shod&rdquo; than recipients of social welfare.  This kind of argument is really too trivial to be tossed across the floor of the House or indeed contained in, I think, a prepared statement by the Minister in this House.  But, since he has made it, we have to deal with it.  If the Minister <Col N="1775" /> pretends to even one ounce of logic, he must explain to the House why, if parliamentarians are &ldquo;better shod&rdquo; than social welfare recipients and therefore on his logic should not receive their increases prior to the 1st July when the social welfare increases were being implemented, judges and higher civil servants should receive their increases prior to the social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister telling us that judges and higher civil servants are not better shod than social welfare recipients?  I do not think even the Minister for Finance, with all his brass neck, would attempt to justify that argument.  The Minister indicated earlier he thinks there has been undue delay, a delay which, as he well knows, has been brought about by his own attitude and approach.  If he wants to speed the process of this Bill he should at least give us a straightforward argument on this and not try to confuse the issue by bringing up silly arguments about social welfare recipients not being as well shod as parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>At least, if the Minister would come out openly and say what his case is, we could argue on the merits of it and not waste time following up these silly red herrings he has been producing.  He has, of course, been twisting and turning on this situation.  He is trying to apply the formula of the Employer/ Labour Conference report to the Opposition allowance.  This is not dealt with in the Employer/Labour Conference report.  It could not be, but it would be dealt with quite differently from that of individuals if it were to be involved.  On the other hand, he is avoiding applying the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendations to the items which were dealt with in the report.  It is this kind of attitude on the part of the Minister which has led to a great deal of the acrimony and delay in dealing with this Bill.  If he would be straightforward, stand on his own two feet, put his case, and let us argue about the real case, and not this nonsense, we would make far more progress and do greater credit to Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the Government <Col N="1776" /> have an obligation to implement this recommendation of the Employer/ Labour Conference in full, and that the onus is on the Government to give very good reasons why they should not do so.  We pointed out previously the precedent being created by the Government in this case.  The fact that they say they will not implement certain parts of the Employer/Labour Conference report and will implement others, can create a dangerous precedent in the private sector.  If employers were to try to follow the precedent being created here by the Government, we could have a very serious situation indeed.  I should like to point out again that the attitude of this party, whether in Government or not, has been consistently one of full support for the national wage agreement and the machinery of the Employer/Labour Conference.  It was on that basis that we took the line we did in Government in relation to the situation which arose concerning the pay of those employed in banks, and the attitude we took in Opposition on the same issue and, indeed, on a number of other issues which have arisen from time to time.</P>
    <P>We believe that, whatever view one may take of the level of the remuneration of parliamentarians, whether one thinks that the Devlin Report was fair and reasonable, or that it was excessively high or too low, the overall requirements of the economy demand that the approach to the problem contained in this section should be that it should be shown that whatever is done conforms fully to the national wage agreement and that the same norms and the same machinery are applied in determining the remuneration of parliamentarians as have been applied in determining the remuneration of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If we want people to adhere to the national wage agreement we must be seen to follow the same procedures, apply the same norms, and accept the results of doing so.  This is reasonable. It is in the national interest and, clearly, it is the only ground on which one can stand when dealing with this whole problem of the remuneration of parliamentarians in the context of the <Col N="1777" /> national wage agreement and of the hope that a further national wage agreement will be negotiated.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter.  The Government have decided to depart from that.  It does not matter whether they are departing by paying more or by paying less.  The fact is that they should stick to it in full and leave no room for argument or doubt about it.  If the Government were to do that, there would not be any problem either from this side of the House, or I believe, with the public generally, because it could be seen that what was being done in the case of parliamentarians was exactly the same as what was being done in the case of everybody else bound by the national wage agreement.  I believe that the Government's failure to do that in this section is creating a serious situation, and creating unnecessary dangers in relation to the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>I say all of this without any reference to the question of justice or injustice.  Quite clearly a great deal could be said when one has regard to the fact that what we are dealing with here is the increase in the remuneration of parliamentarians after an interval of five years.  I am not developing that aspect of the matter which, as I say, could be developed, but I am very seriously urging the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider very carefully the obligation which lies on him to implement in full the report of the Employer/Labour Conference, and the serious consequences which could flow from his failure to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The onus is on the Minister to have another look at the £9,000, or more, suggested in his amendment for backbench members of the Government parties.  This is a hidden subsidy.  It is a contravention of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendation to the Dáil.  This recommendation was within the guidelines of whether the remuneration they suggested for Deputies was in line with the national wage agreement. The Minister then introduces a new feature, an addition to allowances for backbench members of the <Col N="1778" /> Government parties, a feature which was not under consideration by the Employer/Labour Conference, a feature which they were not asked to consider, to adjudicate on, or make representations in respect of.</P>
      <P>The Minister is leaving himself open to the accusation that he has found a way around the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference. In order to thwart and frustrate the Opposition, the Minister has found himself in the position of introducing something which, even now, should be sent to the Employer/ Labour Conference as a new feature for a recommendation from this body as to whether this is an addition to backbench Members' emoluments. I think it is.</P>
      <P>The principle behind this secretarial allowance, if dispensed individually, contravenes the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations.  First, it is a new development; secondly, it is an additional expenditure by his Department; and, thirdly, it was not adjudicated on by anybody other than the Minister.  The Minister deserves to be in trouble over this; he is in trouble over it; and he will be in trouble over it.  I do not say that the Minister is our employer but he is our remunerator and the remunerators of other employees could adopt a method like this to subvert and circumvent decisions arrived at by free negotiation between employer and labour organisations.  This has happened in other countries.  There are countries in which the &ldquo;perks&rdquo; are more important than the basic salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a procedure which has not operated in this country so far.  The Minister has himself adopted this procedure. He has given perks in lieu of remuneration to Government backbenchers for the first time, without reference to anybody.  Who can blame other employers throughout the country if they call their workers into a huddle and say: &ldquo;Look, boys, do not make a fuss about it.  We will do it this way&rdquo;. The national pay agreement recommends a certain percentage increase and the workers agree because they know they will get the perks, the allowances, call them what you will.  If they <Col N="1779" /> are queried by the Government or by anybody else they can say: &ldquo;You yourselves have done it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister should divorce these two issues&mdash;the allowances for all Deputies and the allowance for the Opposition; settle this, get it out of the way and then if he has some bad thoughts in his mind about the question of secretarial or other expenses for each Deputy he could refer the matter to the Employer/Labour Conference, which has not been done up to this.  He is making a mistake and it is not the only mistake he has made during this whole transaction.</P>

      <P>It is a sad reflection on the House that a Minister of any Government would treat it with such contempt as not to give his views on such an important matter.  We consider that this is a breach of the national pay agreement.  We, as parliamentarians, did not receive any benefits from any of the earlier wage rounds and our pay level has fallen seriously out of line with the rest of <Col N="1780" /> the community.  Because of that it was decided to put this before a review body, the Devlin Review Group.  The Government, having received the Devlin Report, rightly, to my mind, decided to put it before the Employer/ Labour Conference.  The Employer/ Labour Conference selected a special committee to investigate this whole matter.  They had no less than nine meetings on this issue.  They presented certain proposals to the then Minister for Finance which the present Minister inherited.  All those proposals conformed completely with the terms of the national pay agreement.  That is as it should be and it should be the aim of every Deputy to ensure that the highest status is given to the national pay agreement.  We hope that another national pay agreement will be signed very quickly because we know that it is in the long-term economic interest of the country to have this type of contract between worker and employer.  I would suggest that the Minister on this very important issue is leaving loopholes for other more unscrupulous people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that this loophole which the Minister has created be closed immediately in order to prevent unscrupulous people from cashing in on it.  The recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference state clearly that our remuneration has not varied since 1968 when it was fixed at a certain level by legislation.  It is a disgrace that that situation should prevail in respect of any body of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the debate on this very important issue has been so acrimonious.  The recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference should be implemented in full and not in the sort of smart-alecky way that is proposed by the Minister.  These recommendations go back to January, 1972.  Why have they not been implemented? We have heard the Minister make the cheap and snide remark that Deputies were better shod than old age pensioners.  That was his reason for <Col N="1781" /> not implementing the recommendations. This attitude on the part of the Minister is deplorable but if he were man enough now to admit that he was wrong and to say that he is prepared to implement fully the recommendations he would gain the respect of everybody.  I cannot understand how he could have adopted the attitude that he has adopted in this regard.  I can see no political gain in an attitude of this kind.  After all, the Minister is a reasonably intelligent man and I cannot see him bringing in stupid legislation such as this without having some reason for doing so.  No matter how much I study the Bill I am unable to see any coherent reason for the Minister's attitude except to conclude that he places such a low value on his fellow parliamentarians that, to his mind, they do not deserve to be treated like other groups in the country.  That would seem to be the only reason, too, for the snide remark which he made in relation to our increases.</P>
    <P>For far too long we have endeavoured to keep this issue out of politics. We have tried to work out a coherent, logical and fair policy in regard to the remuneration of parliamentarians but it is a serious injustice to parliamentarians that the Minister should fail to implement fully the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference in regard to them while, at the same time, implementing fully those recommendations in respect of the judiciary and the higher civil servants. Perhaps the Minister's attitude could be attributed to his belief that he might be putting members of the Opposition in an awkward situation by these proposals.  Be that as it may, the position for us cannot be half as awkward as that into which he is putting his own backbenchers whereby they are forced to support his policy although in their hearts and heads they do not agree with it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to reconsider this whole question and to have regard to the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations. I am very anxious to hear the Minister on this point.  If he is prepared to meet us in relation to this very reasonable request, there <Col N="1782" /> will be very little delay in regard to the passing of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because in essence this is our third Committee Stage of this Bill because both on the Second Stage and on the Money Resolution the Opposition conducted a Committee Stage debate. Deputy Crowley's speech is at variance with what was said by the Leader of the Opposition this morning who complained because the Press were unable to detect any common line of policy in the Fianna Fáil benches. Deputy Lynch indicated that his sole grouse was the fact that the Opposition were not to receive more than a 40 per cent increase in the allowance awarded to the Opposition in 1968 in respect of secretarial expenses, research and information services. Deputy Crowley has indicated now that if there is retrospection to January, 1972, there will be little opposition to the Bill.  I would advise the Deputy to meet with the Leader of his party so as to ascertain what is Fianna Fáil's common line on this issue, that is, if they have one other than that of continuing to obstruct the business of the House.</P>

      <P>What we are dealing with now is not an Opposition amendment that has been ruled out but is a section which proposes to give, in accordance with the Employer/ Labour Conference, an allowance of £3,416 per annum to Deputies and £2,023 per annum to Senators and to make the allowances operative from the 1st July, 1973.  The Employer/ Labour Conference made no recommendations regarding retrospection. The Devlin Report pointed out specifically that it had no mandate to deal with retrospection and the reference of the Devlin Report to the Employer/ Labour Conference special committee was one which required them to consider to what extent the Devlin recommendations could be applied without a breach of the national wage agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> What we are doing is not in breach of the national wage agreement.  We will not breach the national wage agreement.  There is no comparison between employers in regard to what a national wage agreement would require them to perform towards their employees and this House which is itself its own employer and can decide to forego any portion of remuneration.  That is all this Government decided it was the proper thing to do, that people in this House and the other House, being themselves their own employers, should decide. The Constitution so desires them to be their own employers because it is the House which determines the basis of remuneration, not the Government of the day.  We on this side of the House consider that it is appropriate that the increased remuneration for Deputies and Senators would be applicable from 1st July, 1973. <i>Ad nauseam</i> I have given my reasons for this.  They have been called stupid, ridiculous, unworthy and many other epithets.  Those who want to use them are welcome to do so. We have stated our case repeatedly and I have nothing further to add.</P>

      <P>For the third time in the course of the debate the Minister for Finance has shown appalling ignorance of the provisions of section 4 of the Bill.  He went on to allege that what I said did not conform to what my Leader had said earlier. Section 4 has nothing to do with the allowance to the Opposition.  We have been discussing section 4 which relates to salaries of Members of the Oireachtas and the Minister for Finance has displayed appalling ignorance, for a man who has the backing of the entire Civil Service in his Department and in any other Department he wishes to call on.  He comes in here and makes the type of accusations falsely that even the most junior Deputy in the House would not make.  I am not surprised, therefore, that we have this petty, bitter piece of legislation.  Now with a deeper understanding of the Minister's mind, I am not surprised why he holds his fellow parliamentarians in such contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> We make no apology for demanding that the Employer/Labour Conference report be implemented completely. That committee had nine consecutive meetings on this important issue and the Minister, after a cursory glance at the recommendations, decided not to implement them. We regret it very much but we now begin to understand why we have this attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the advantage now of speaking after the Minister made his contribution, which lasted approximately three minutes.  During it he did not once refer to the arguments put forward in detail and with care by Deputies Colley, Cunningham and Crowley on this section.  He said that because Deputy Crowley spoke about the matters contained in section 4, the section we are discussing now, he was in some way in conflict with what Deputy Lynch said this morning.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch spoke only on the question of the allowance to the Opposition.  Frankly, I was flabbergasted at the attitude of the Minister, not at the silly things he said but at the contemptuous way in which he treated the House and the reasoned arguments put up.  In a debate of this kind if careful reasoned argument is put forward by a Deputy or Deputies and if that argument is not refuted, then that argument is accepted as correct, and there can be no doubt that the arguments put forward by Deputies Cunningham, Colley and Crowley can, therefore, be taken by the general consensus of the House to have been correct.  I found it difficult to hear what the Minister said because he spoke in a very low voice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his very short intervention the Minister said the figure proposed in this Bill does not breach the national wage agreement or the Employer/Labour Conference report and he said the Government would not breach them, the implication being that we on this side of the House were asking him to breach them.  The whole point of our case, put consistently from the start, is that we do not want the national wage agreement breached, that we do not want the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference breached, and that what the Minister is proposing is a breach of them.  The truth is the direct opposite of what the Minister has implied or suggested in his very brief intervention.  The whole point of Deputy Colley's amendment which was ruled out of order for technical reasons is to apply the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendation. I will read the amendment:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 35 to 40, and in page 3, to delete lines 1 and 2, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The allowance to be paid to each member of Dáil Éireann and of Seanad Éireann shall be the sums recommended in the Report of the Special Committee of the Employer/ Labour Conference on the remuneration of the Judiciary, Higher Civil Service and Parliamentarians, dated 22nd December, 1972 and such sums shall be payable on the dates and in the amounts recommended in the said Report.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Could anything be clearer than that? What we want done is to have the national wage agreement and the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations implemented in relation to the matters contained in section 4, and the Minister has the effrontery to say: &ldquo;This Bill does not breach the agreement and the Government will not breach it.&rdquo;  The implication is that we are endeavouring to do it when the amendment we had on today's Order Paper is a most specific one asking the House to accept that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am flabbergasted at the Minister standing up and making that statement.  He went on to make <Col N="1786" /> the statement that the Government decided that because Deputies and Senators are their own employers it should be left to Deputies and Senators to agree on the figures, which should be within the national wage agreement. He said it was a matter for each House to fix its own remuneration.  Technically and theoretically that is so but this House is screaming to fix its own remuneration in accordance with the national wage agreement and the report of the Employer/Labour Conference but it is being prevented from doing so by the Government and in particular by the Minister for Finance. If the Minister meant what he said&mdash;I have no doubt he did not&mdash;and if he does not want to correct what he said, he should now do the logical thing and allow each House to decide whether it wants to follow the national wage agreement and he should allow a free vote.</P>
    <P>We know, everyone knows, it has got almost to the stage of being a farce, that the Government backbenchers are in entire agreement with the attitude Fianna Fáil have taken up in this matter.  It was very significant this morning, when Deputy Enright was endeavouring to defend the situation and when he made the statement that what Fianna Fáil were trying to do was to drive a wedge between the Government and their backbenchers, that there was almost a tornado as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach swept into the House, reprimanded publicly Deputy Enright and told him to desist from that line.  Understandably, Deputy Enright departed the House.</P>
    <P>That is the situation that exists and I am now taking up the Minister on what he said, that the Government are allowing each House to fix its own remuneration, and I say to the Minister, let us now have a free vote on this point; take the Whip off the unfortunate people behind you; let them follow the consistent line which anybody who has any interest in the national wage agreement would wish to follow and could only follow.  The situation is that the Minister for Finance, in spite of what he says, is doing the direct opposite to what he says: he is breaching the national wage <Col N="1787" /> agreement.  He is the last man in this country who should do it because he is the Minister for Finance and it is the Government's duty to try to ensure that these agreements are kept by everybody and that future agreements will be made.</P>
    <P>Can you look at the situation of the ordinary worker, or the ordinary trade unionist after this performance?  He will say, and he is completely entitled to say: &ldquo;The Government smashed that agreement and why should I make another one?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government, against the almost unanimous wish of their own backbenchers, are forcing this House to break a solemn agreement which is the most important single agreement in this country at the present time.  We in Fianna Fáil consistently supported, maintained and upheld that agreement. We are now endeavouring to stop it being broken by the Minister for Finance and it is the Minister for Finance and the Government alone that are doing it; it is not the backbenchers of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposed breach of this agreement by the Minister for Finance, forcing it on this House against the wishes of the House and in direct contravention of what he himself said, I want to point out that it is not just a question of justice or injustice to the present Members of the House.  There are a number of persons who left this House voluntarily before the last election and, of course, a number who left it involuntarily. But, those who left it voluntarily left it on the clear understanding and assumption &mdash; and it was a reasonable one to make&mdash;that this recommendation of the Employer/ Labour Conference would be honoured by whatever Government came into power.  They now find, to their horror and amazement, that this is not so.</P>
    <P>The report of the Employer/ Labour Conference&mdash;quite a short document running to about 13 pages &mdash;deals, as Deputy Colley has said, not just with parliamentarians; it deals with judges and with higher civil servants.  The three were grouped <Col N="1788" /> together because they were grouped together in Devlin, because they are regarded as being roughly in the same category for these purposes.  A clear recommendation was made by the committee of that conference in relation to all three categories.  The principles underlying the recommendations were the same for all three categories.  The Government do what, of course, they should do&mdash; they implement the recommendations in relation to judges; they implement them in relation to higher civil servants. With all the talk on this we have yet to get a cogent or even a reasonable reason why the third category in that report do not have the conference recommendations implemented for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With all the talk, we have not got any reason why, three groups having been included in a report and a recommendation made in relation to the three, two are implemented without difficulty and nobody complains or minds because the judges and the higher civil servants are clearly entitled to what they are getting, but the third category in respect of whom the recommendations were made on the same basis are treated with this contempt by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me just another manifestation of the wriggling and the face-changing that the Minister for Finance goes on with in relation to this matter that yesterday afternoon in a discussion on the Money Resolution regarding the question of the Opposition allowance he should justify, or attempt to justify, what he was doing or failing to do by relying on the Employer/ Labour Conference and what their recommendations were.  As it happens, and as I pointed out last night, the Employer/Labour Conference did not make any recommendation at all on the matter of the Opposition allowance because the matter was never referred to them.  That did not stop the Minister for Finance asserting positively in this House that the reason he could not do what he was being asked <Col N="1789" /> to do was that the Employer/Labour Conference prevented him.  It did not. That is by the way.  The significant thing is that he sought to justify his actions in relation to the Opposition allowance by relying on the Employer/ Labour Conference and the necessity of implementing and complying with its recommendations.  That was his justification yesterday but today we come to section 4 of the Bill and we say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Implement what the Employer/ Labour Conference recommended&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;I will not do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That must be one of the most curious, unique, situations that has ever arisen in this House.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance in relation to this is nothing short of brazen.  His own personal attitude in the House as exhibited yesterday and again today when he refuses to take part in debates and reads newspapers for long periods, and so on, is on a personal level nothing short of brazen.  I can only speculate that if any Fianna Fáil Minister had ever behaved in a manner that would approach even half-way the behaviour of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, in this matter over the past few days what the reaction from the then Opposition would have been, what the reaction of the newspapers would have been.  We have seen not just an exhibition of personal contempt for the Members of the House, not least his own backbenchers, but we have seen something that is totally inexplicable in the conflicting approaches to similar problems.</P>
    <P>We are accused when we comment on this and try to take part in a debate on these matters of holding up the House.  I have spoken as reasonably and as calmly as I can in the circumstances with which we are faced.  Let us face the fact that what we are taking part in now is not a debate; it is essentially a monologue.  It is a cogent argument being put from this side of the House by speaker after speaker. None of those arguments in relation to this matter has been refuted.  No attempt to refute them has been made. By any rules of debate or rules of commonsense, the arguments that have been put are valid and they stand.  The <Col N="1790" /> Minister for Finance flies in the face of the facts and of ordinary truth and justice if he persists in what he is now doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak but Deputy O'Malley mentioned one of the most important aspects of this matter when he referred to the effect of the Minister's attitude on people outside the House.  Deputy O'Malley has made one of the most important contributions to the Bill. Might I, therefore, suggest that the Minister would reconsider?  Deputy O'Malley has pointed out the possible effects on the national wage agreement if the Minister persists in his present attitude.  Whatever the fate of the present Bill, there is an even more important issue at stake&mdash;whether the third national wage agreement will materialise at the end of next month when the two bodies begin negotiating.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley when he talks of the effect on workers outside and on their attitude towards the new national wage agreement if they see the Minister refusing to accept the findings of the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
      <P>It is not too late for the Minister to rethink.  He has had a rough time, perhaps, for which he himself was mainly responsible but this matter is so important that he should rethink his whole attitude and remember what Deputy O'Malley has said about the national wage agreement.  Let him, for heaven's sake, change his attitude.  He may force this Bill through the House but he will not have the same power in regard to the third national wage agreement.  The workers will weigh his every word and his attitude towards the national agreement and he may well be sowing here the seeds of defeat in relation to the third national wage agreement.  I ask the Minister to heed Deputy O'Malley's words and those of the other speakers on this side and change his attitude and become a little more reasonable knowing that we on this side will stand by and honour in every way the findings of the Employer/ Labour Conference on this matter.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Moore is being too optimistic in asking the Minister to be reasonable because I am satisfied from my knowledge of the Minister that he is completely inflexible and that inflexibility will ultimately be his undoing as Minister for Finance and the undoing of his party.  I advise trade union leaders to read very carefully the Official Report of this debate because from it they will gain a pretty good idea of the man they will be dealing with in the coming months.  A trade union leader could have no better guide than to study the Official Report because he will recognise that, in fact, the Minister has refused to implement the national wage agreement in regard to Members of the House.  If he can be that callous in regard to his own colleagues, the trade unions will not find it easy to deal with him.  I advise them that in any negotiations with him to dot the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; because whatever they say in negotiating with this Minister they will discover it will bear very little relevance ultimately to what they actually understood they were talking about.</P>
      <P>He has insisted on calling the request to implement the proposals of the Employer/Labour Conference retrospection.  The Devlin Report first came out on 11th July last year and because of the hue and cry by certain trade union leaders, the Fianna Fáil Government, instead of implementing the increases then, allowed the report to go before the Employer/Labour Conference.  They finished their deliberations and came out with their proposals as late as 22nd December last year.  Everybody knows that in order to increase allowances to Members this legislation must be put through the Dáil and so the Minister is fooling nobody when he says we did not have the courage to implement the recommendations. It must be clear to everybody that it takes much more courage on our part to fight the Bill as it stands at present than it would have taken to introduce it had we been returned to office when it would have been unanimously supported by the former Opposition parties.  In fact, this is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think nobody will fail to recognise <Col N="1792" /> the attempt to stifle this Opposition by the refusal to increase the allowance to the Opposition Leader to the £30,000 he sought and the attempt by the Minister to insist that this allowance now being given to the Opposition should be used to pay for the secretarial services which we as a party employ.  Our secretarial services cost us in the region of £1,000 per month which Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators pay out of their own pockets.  The Minister is now suggesting that the £21,000 they have decided to grant us should be used for that purpose instead of for research and information.</P>

There are Members of this House who voluntarily retired on the understanding that the Devlin Report would be implemented according to the interpretation of the Employer/ Labour Conference.  The trade union leaders would do well to study this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's refusal to even consider asking the Employer/Labour Conference for clarification in relation to the proposals which they recommended is evidence of the fact that he knows he is not within the spirit of those proposals.  The Minister has been vindictive and in his opening gambit showed his vindictiveness and the weakness of his own case by refusing to answer the arguments put forward by our party and also in his naming of pensions to former Ministers without naming former Ministers of his own party or, for that matter, indicating what his own pension will be under this Bill in comparison to <Col N="1793" /> former Ministers should he be in office for three years.</P>
    <P>As far as Deputy Barry Desmond, who described himself as a sort of self-appointed shop steward, is concerned I should like to point out that he quickly left the scene as soon as he, and Members of his own party and the Fine Gael backbenchers, received assurances that they would receive allowances which have been euphemistically described as secretarial allowances.</P>

      <P>I should like to put a net point to the Minister.  I understand that the Minister said earlier that the Government did not intend to commit any breach of the recommendations of the report of the Employer/Labour Conference Special Committee.  If that is so I should like to put a point to him.  The Minister will see on the amendment sheet, amendment No. 1, which, as he knows, has been ruled out of order for technical reasons.  He also knows that, if he were to adopt that amendment or the principles enshrined therein, it would be in order.  That amendment calls for the allowances to be paid to the Members of the Dáil and Seanad to be the sums recommended in the report of the special committee and that such sums shall be payable on the dates and in the amounts recommended in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point which I should like to put to the Minister, and I believe it is the net point in this debate on section 4, is: is the Minister prepared to accept the substance of that amendment? If he is, then we are <i>ad idem.</i> If he said, and meant to say what I understood him to have said, that the <Col N="1794" /> Government did not intend to commit any breach of that report, then there is no difference between us on either side of the House.  However, if he does not feel that he could accept the substance of this, how does he reconcile that with the statement that the Government does not intend to commit any breach of these recommendations from the committee?</P>

      <P>I should like to make it quite clear to the backbenchers behind the Minister, and everybody <Col N="1795" /> else, the net effect of the changes and the point at issue, which is now clearly out in the open.  We had an amendment down which called for the full implementation of the Employer/ Labour Conference report on the dates and as to the sums recommended in that report.  I have put it to the Minister that, if he does not want any breach of the recommendations, he could accept that amendment or the substance of it.  The Minister has refused to do so.  Can there be any further doubt in anybody's mind that what the Minister is doing is committing a breach of that recommendation, because he has decided not to accept the recommendations of that report in relation to parliamentarians? Perhaps he had good reasons.  I say that because the Minister has not given us good reasons as yet.  In fact, his contention is that he was not failing to honour the report.</P>
      <P>Can there be anybody who now has any doubt in the light of the discussion in the last few minutes but that the Minister is making perfectly clear that he, and his colleagues in the Government, have decided not to implement that report having regard to the fact that there was an amendment down which called for that precisely? This amendment called for the implementation of that report in full as to the amounts and the dates recommended. The Minister has not accepted it, or the substance of it.  That being so, let it be quite clear to everybody, inside and outside of this House, as to what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have decided not to implement this report.  No amount of twisting or turning can get over this issue.  It is a clearcut issue, put clearly to the Minister, and he has made his decision clear.  At least that is something. It is a gain compared with what has been happening in the debate up to now.  The position is quite clear. There is no ambiguity about it.  I want it clearly understood that the Minister is refusing to implement the report of the special committee of the Employer/Labour Conference.  That is a committee which consisted, as I <Col N="1796" /> said, of trade unionists and employers specially skilled, and it was specially set up to interpret the correct application of the national pay agreement in various sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>That report is available to the Minister and to the Members of this House.  The Minister has decided not to implement it.  He has not given what any reasonable person would consider a convincing reason why it should not be implemented.  The consequences of his failure rest on the Minister and on his colleagues in the Government and on nobody else.  If the decision was made by the Government it could have been made hastily, but they have had every opportunity to see the possible consequences and the implications of their decision.  There is no excuse for the Government saying the thing was done hastily and rushed through; they have had every opportunity to think about it.  They have made their decision and the Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, has made it clear that the Government have decided to reject the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference. So be it, and let the consequences be on the Minister's head.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the Minister is saying that in the drafting of this Bill he had no reference to recommendations of any kind.  My understanding is that there were specific recommendations as to amounts and time.  The Minister says he is putting into operation the amounts.  That is only part of the <Col N="1797" /> committee's recommendations.  It is true, as Deputy Colley has said, that the Minister is not implementing the recommendations, which had one guideline and one standard, namely, the national pay agreement.  Not alone is the Minister not implementing the recommendations but he is circumventing them in two respects.  He is circumventing them in relation to the time element and he is introducing a new element which was not referred to any committee, any conference or anybody apart from the Minister and possibly his Government colleagues. The circumvention arises from the fact that there are in this Bill recommendations that a bonus be paid to the Minister's own backbenchers.</P>

This has been the practice up to now.  Deputies on both sides out of their own resources and out of remuneration provided by the Department of Finance paid their secretarial and other expenses.  My argument is that Deputies on the Government side of the House will not have to do that in future because a sum averaging £200 is being provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House agree with section 5.  It follows the line we had intended to take in this matter.  Incidentally, I would be surprised if, when the Minister was researching this matter and came across the memorandum to which he referred yesterday, he did not also come across documents which showed quite clearly the directions which had been given by me as Minister for Finance in connection with the implementation of the Employer/Labour Conference report.  Among those directions he would have found one to the effect of the contents of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is right to do this, particularly if it is intended, as I think it should be, to ensure that remuneration for parliamentarians is regularly reviewed and adjusted where necessary in line, hopefully, with national <Col N="1801" /> wage agreements.  If national wage agreements do not exist then we have another situation.  It was for that reason, amongst others, that I proposed an amendment earlier which was defeated.  The cumbersome procedure which has to be gone through at the moment, of the passage of all Stages of legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas every time there is to be an adjustment in the remuneration of parliamentarians, is such that it contributes to the situation of which Deputies on all sides have complained in the past, that is, the long delay which has elapsed between one increase and the next.</P>
    <P>It is true also that formerly the same position applied in regard to the remuneration of the judiciary.  It was necessary in the past to introduce legislation each time the remuneration of the judiciary was adjusted.  That was changed some years ago.  This section proposes to make a similar change in regard to the remuneration of parliamentarians.  Although there are arguments against this, on balance, I believe it is in the public interest that this should be done in this way. Consequently we support this section.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister that in connection with section 2 I made remarks which would be equally appropriate to section 6 in regard to the manner in which this kind of legislation is drafted. I can appreciate that the Minister might well say to me that, because of section 5 and its operation and therefore, in future the making of orders, it may not be as urgent to codify the law as it has been in the past.  There would be some substance in that argument.  Nevertheless, I feel there is a great deal of unnecessary confusion in the legislation dealing with the allowances to Members of the Oireachtas and salaries of office holders.  If there should be any necessity in future to amend this legislation, other than by the making of an <Col N="1802" /> order under section 5, it would be advisable to consider the codification of the law which existed heretofore and will be added to on the passage of this Bill.</P>

The current rates were fixed in the 1968 amending Act which substituted new subsections (1) and (2) for what was there before.  Under this Bill revised subsections (1) and (2) are being inserted.  They simply replace the existing sections.  The 1st July, 1973, has been determined as the date from which the increased rates of salary should come into operation.  If this involves a sacrifice the sacrifice is on the part of the office holders.  We expect no thanks for this and we consider that it was the proper date from which to make the payments.  There were no specific recommendations made by the special committee of the Employer/Labour Conference in regard to the effective date for any revision.</P>

      <P>I had intended to say on this section that really we had discussed all the points at issue and that it was not necessary to go over them again. However, in view of what the Minister has said, while I do not want to drag out the debate, I do feel it incumbent on me to say that we do not accept the accuracy of what the Minister has just said in regard to the terms of the Employer/Labour Conference report which I quoted earlier in the debate and that if the Minister thinks that what he said is correct the remedy <Col N="1803" /> has been suggested by us earlier, either to implement the amendment to apply the terms of the report as to amounts and dates or, alternatively, to implement the Bill as drafted and to seek clarification, if the Minister thinks it is necessary, from the Employer/ Labour Conference and if necessary as a result of such clarification to make an order under section 5 and the corresponding section subsequently.  I do not wish to prolong the debate on this matter. I am saying this for the record in view of what the Minister has just said.</P>
      <P>The arguments in favour of amendment No. 3, which has been ruled out of order, are those we have already made on section 4.  I, therefore, do not propose to repeat them.</P>
      <P>For the record I want to say that we have just voted on section 4.  As far as we are concerned exactly the same principles and objections are involved in regard to section 7.  I am not calling for a vote on it but I want to place on the record that exactly the same objections apply on our part.  I am not calling for a vote simply because it is a complete repetition.  That is the only reason why I am not doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present figure of £5,500 for the Attorney General was fixed by section 6 of the 1968 amending Act.  The increased salary will be £7,213 as recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference special committee where the Attorney General is not a Member of the Oireachtas and it will be £4,430 where he is a full-time Attorney General and Member of the Dáil.  An Attorney General who is a Member of the Dáil will thus be in exactly the same position as a Minister who is a Member of the Dáil.  No provision is being made to cover the position of an Attorney General who is a Member of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the Review Body did not contemplate an <Col N="1804" /> Attorney General who was a Member of the House; they specifically adverted to the fact that the Attorney General for some time past had not been a Member of the House but that a different situation could arise if he was a Member of the House.  Having regard to the quite considerable additional duties which lie on an Attorney General if he is a Member of the House, no reasonable person can query the small increase of about £500 which the Attorney General in the House would get by reason of getting a salary related to his office of £4,430 plus his Dáil allowance.</P>
    <P>We will be dealing later with the pensions section but I might mention that any pension he would get arising out of his Attorney General's salary would be related only to the £4,430 and he would have his right or otherwise, depending on his service in the House, to a certain pension arising out of his Dáil salary.  He would be strictly comparable to a Minister but he would be full-time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad of some clarification of this section from the Minister.  He mentioned that there is no provision in this section for an Attorney General who is a Member of the Seanad.  That is a fact. Is there any good reason why there should not be such a provision in this section?  I am speaking from recollection, and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I think that heretofore the salary of the Attorney General has been the same as the salary of a Minister.  Under the provisions of this section the salary of a person who is Attorney General and is not a Member of the Oireachtas would be £7,213 whereas if he is a Member of the Oireachtas his income would be £4,430 plus £3,416.  The consequence of this is that a person who is Attorney General and a Member of the Dáil receives £633 more than an Attorney General who is not a Member of this House.  I would like the Minister to explain why this should be so and also why there is not provision for an Attorney General who is a Member of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he does not get a Dáil allowance at all.  Under recent legislation he has been somewhat below a Minister.  We consider that an Attorney General who is full-time and a Member of the House obviously has additional responsibilities which deserve some remuneration and the small figure allowed is only such as to bring him up to the same level as that of a Minister.  It closes the gap.  The gap would not be closed if he were not holding the parliamentary responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The question of the Seanad is a rather peculiar one.  If you try to provide for some arrangement for the Seanad in relation to the Attorney General, because of the six Acts to which the Deputy has referred you arrive at the end of the day with a complex assortment of anomalies, none of which in itself can be corrected without creating other anomalies. You could have a position where the Attorney General would get more in the Seanad than a Minister who might be serving in the Seanad.  The problem does not exist at the moment.  Our attitude to it is that we will let perhaps wiser counsel deal with the matter whenever such a creature comes into being if, indeed, he ever does.  Perhaps by then we will have codified the legislation governing these matters and the problem can be dealt with in that light.</P>

      <P>In the context of the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the GATT the Council of Ministers have decided already that the principles and mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy are not matters for negotiation.  The EEC Commission, however, are at present carrying out a review of the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  They have indicated that they will put forward some proposals in the matter later in the year but, of course, any such proposals can be adopted only with the approval of the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a serious attempt is being made by certain member nations of the EEC, notably Germany and France, to undermine the Common Agricultural Policy, particularly in respect of support prices and that this would be most deleterious to the Irish farmer and would undo largely the alleged benefits of EEC membership as presented to use at the time of the referendum campaign?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will take special measures for the further development of agriculture in Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Mayo in view of their similarity geographically, geologically, economically and socially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The counties named by the Deputy have benefited from the special development measures operated in favour of western counties as a whole and their special problems will continue to be taken into account in the future in the application of Government and EEC agricultural policies. In particular, the EEC schemes for the modernisation of farms and for the encouragement of elderly persons to cease farming, which will be introduced early next year, may be expected to have a special significance and to make a special impact in these areas. I might mention also that, as the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the Council of the EEC are expected to adopt a directive before 1st October next to provide for a special system of aids to farmers in agriculturally-handicapped areas.  Until the terms of the directive, including the criteria for defining the areas, are finally settled it is not possible to say precisely what areas of this country may be eligible for these special aids.  Under the proposals as at present envisaged, however, it seems likely that large areas of the counties mentioned may qualify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question the position is that as the Community Market price is still above 103 per cent of the guide price the scarcity regulations are still in operation and levies and full duty have not so far been restored.

Is the Minister aware that there is great disillusionment among farmers who do not know from one week to another what the price will be?  We all expected that there would be a drop in the month of August.  Can the Minister say, or can the people in Europe tell him, what will be the position in, say, September or October?

I should like to remind the Deputy that during his period of office he met the board, at their request, on only one occasion, in September, 1972. He took over the Fisheries Branch at the time of the upheaval in May, 1970, and he was in office more than two years before he met this body which he thinks it is so important for me to meet now.</P>

      <P>The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which will come into effect on 1st September this year, will improve the employment conditions of domestic workers in the same way as other workers in non-agricultural employment.  Conditions will be further improved on the enactment of legislation on holidays and hours of work, at present being drafted.  In the circumstances, I see no reason at this time to propose special legislation to deal with any special category. Should it become necessary at some future time, however, to legislate for any category of workers, I shall feel it my duty to bring appropriate proposals before the House.</P>

      <P>AnCO's present establishment of seven permanent and five mobile training centres are primarily intended for the training and retraining of adult workers.  They also cater for a limited number of school leavers intending to enter into apprenticeship. Currently applications from school leavers from both rural and other areas far exceed the number of places available.</P>
      <P>There are plans for a major expansion of training programmes over the next five years.  They envisage a trebling of direct training capacity by 1978 to enable 10,000 people per year to be catered for.  This expansion includes provision for young persons. Special attention is being given to the feasibility of using existing facilities in the vocational schools and regional technical colleges to provide additional training for young persons.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the conditions necessary for getting into the AnCO training schools is that the person must be serving an apprenticeship and, in rural areas where you have not that kind of employment, it is very hard for young people attending vocational schools to be admitted to the AnCO training schools?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a legitimate grievance.  Industry is less plentiful in rural areas and therefore the number of young people in apprenticeship must obviously be less than it is in industrialised urban areas. There are fundamental, far-reaching changes in all phases of apprenticeship published in a recent document sent out by AnCO.  The matter is between the unions and the employers at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As to 87 per cent, they are recruited by employers on the basis of an interview.  Only a small number of employers require them to take aptitude tests.  About 12½ per cent of all apprentices are recruited directly by AnCO and applicants are interviewed and given aptitude tests.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Manpower Service is a part of my Department which has not published an annual report up to now.</P>
      <P>I am informed that, as the work of the Department, including that of the National Manpower Service, came under review in the House in the annual Estimate debate, and on other occasions, it was not considered necessary to publish an annual report.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing the general position as to availability of information on the work of the Department.</P>

      <P>Whatever one may say about the National Manpower Service, its productivity on the lines of producing circulars is not in doubt.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied with the fact that the National Manpower Service has been able to place in employment only 14 per cent of those <Col N="1833" /> on its register; and if he will state the proposals he has, other than increasing personnel, for improving the effectiveness of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, of course, like to see a greater proportion of the people registered with the National Manpower Service placed in employment. The percentage placed in the last three months, however, is not a reflection on the effectiveness of the service but rather a reflection of the job situation.  I indicated in reply to a question from the Deputy on 11th July that nearly 60 per cent of vacancies notified&mdash;72 per cent when cancellations were taken into account&mdash;were filled in the last three months and I consider this a good performance.</P>
      <P>The main problem in placing people is the shortage of suitable jobs.  There are also problems of lack of skills among the registrants and the unattractiveness of a number of vacancies on offer.  It is also the case that employers are not using the service as widely as I would like.</P>
      <P>The effectiveness of the service can best be raised by getting more employers to use it.  I am therefore arranging more publicity for the service in this field by more intensive personal canvassing of employers by the placement staff and other forms of publicity including the wide circulation of a brochure on the work of the service which, I hope, will be available soon.</P>

      <P>The number of persons who were not in full-time employment in the Tralee area at the time and expressed an interest in obtaining work was 475 males and 192 females.  Approximately 165 boys and 136 girls may be expected to enter the labour force from the schools in the area each year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the commitment of the National Coalition in its election programme <Col N="1837" /> to provide for the election of worker representatives to State boards and I have elaborated on this in some more detail in my Estimate speech of the 15th May.  I have set up within my Department a section to carry out the necessary research in this field and to prepare legislation which will give effect to the Government's commitment.  It is my intention that this section will have an ongoing function in relation to the encouragement of worker participation in decision-making generally after the initial phase has been completed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department &mdash;AnCO and CERT&mdash;no proposals specific to them have been put forward to increase the degree of worker participation in decisions over and above that which already exists through normal trade union and consultative machinery.  In the case of both these bodies, however, there is already a high degree of trades union representation in the controlling councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the desire for greater participation in decision making at the place of work is a desire of the Irish trade union movement and it is a legitimate desire that this Government are happy to meet by bringing in legislation to provide it in this State area and to encourage it in private industry.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that, in a judgment delivered on 16th July, the Supreme Court declared section 44 (2) (a) of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, to be invalid as being repugnant to the Constitution.  The provision in question is an extremely important one; without it, Part V of the 1968 Act &mdash; which introduced the offences of driving, attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle while the blood-alcohol level exceeds a specified limit &mdash;cannot be operated effectively. Although proceedings can still be taken for the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; offences of driving, <i>et cetera</i>, while under the influence of drink, it is highly desirable that legislation should be enacted at the earliest possible date to enable the institution of prosecutions for the offences created by the 1968 Act to be resumed.  The main purpose of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1973, is, therefore, to substitute a new paragraph for the paragraph in section 44 of the 1968 Act which has been declared to be unconstitutional.  In addition, the Bill provides for certain necessary amendments in Part V of the 1968 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill, which relates to interpretation, and section 8, which provides for short title and collective citation, do not call for special comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 2 to 6, by amending a number <Col N="1847" /> of sections of the 1968 Act, will remove the restriction by which only the member of the Garda Síochána who is in charge of a Garda station when an arrested person is brought there has the power to require the person to provide a blood or urine specimen.  Difficulties have arisen in relation to the existing provisions because of changes in Garda organisation and working hours following the implementation of the Conroy report. Moreover, it is desirable to amend these provisions to facilitate the introduction of the Special Traffic Corps.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the best course is to make the amendments proposed in sections 2 to 6 and thereby enable any member of the Garda Síochána to carry out the necessary procedures.</P>
    <P>Section 7 amends section 44 of the 1968 Act to take account of the Supreme Court decision and to improve the existing provisions relating to evidence.  In subsection (2) (a), it will now be provided that a certificate from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety as to a person's blood-alcohol level will be &ldquo;sufficient evidence until the contrary is shown&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;.  It was the use of the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; that led the Supreme Court to declare the existing provision invalid.  In subsection (2) (b), a minor change in wording is being made, on the advice of the Attorney General's Office, to improve the evidential value of the certificate referred to in the subsection. The new subsection (3) is designed to remove the possibility that the prosecution may be called on to prove in each case, by production of current medical registers, <i>et cetera</i>, that the doctor who took the blood or urine specimen is a &ldquo;registered medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the amendments proposed in the Bill are necessary in order that the provisions of Part V of the 1968 Act may serve the purpose for which they were designed.  Deputies will be aware of the importance of these provisions and of the part they can play in reducing the number of deaths and injuries on our roads. I am sure, therefore, that they will <Col N="1848" /> appreciate the necessity to have all Stages of the bill dealt with as a matter of urgency.  I hope that it will be possible to take all Stages of the Bill today so that it can be discussed in the Seanad tonight or tomorrow. If the Bill is passed by that House, and if the necessary Early Signature Motion is agreed to, the Bill could become law this week.  I might mention that, if the Bill is enacted, some consequential amendments will be necessary in the regulations made under Part V of the 1968 Act.  The drafting of amending regulations is in hand so that there should be no avoidable delay in restoring the 1968 Act to full effect.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to state clearly that this party are concerned greatly at the number of accidents and, in particular, the number of fatal accidents that are occurring on our roads annually.  The number seems to be increasing at an alarming rate each year despite the many and sustained efforts in regard to road safety promotion.  We assure the Minister that we will support all reasonable measures that are aimed at reducing or, if possible, eliminating road accidents.  We have always believed that the community desire that stringent measures be taken to deal in particular with the drunken driver who is the greatest menace to life on our roads.  Therefore, we support the continued operation of the breathalyser system and any reasonable steps that are deemed to be necessary to ensure its effective operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1968, when the then Road Traffic Bill was being debated here, the question of the breathalyser and the tests in relation to it were debated at great length.  At that time it was recognised that the operation of the system would impose a new and a heavy burden on the Garda Síochána.  At that time the House endeavoured to foresee the difficulties and snags that might arise in relation to the operation of the breathalyser system and every possible step was taken in the legislation to try to ensure that the system would operate effectively, efficiently and smoothly. <Col N="1849" /> At the same time, however, it was recognised clearly by Deputies on all sides of the House that the success and acceptability of the system depended to a large extent on the manner in which it would be operated by the Garda.  It might be opportune at this time to pay a special tribute to the Garda for the manner in which they have carried out this duty.  We realise that since the Act was brought into operation there has been a dispute with the medical profession which has meant that the breathalyser has not operated uniformly throughout the country.  However, sufficient experience of the operation of the system has now been gained to enable an assessment to be made of its effectiveness and an attempt should be made now to deal with whatever difficulties have been encountered in relation to the Act.</P>
    <P>We are in the special position here that, while the Department of Local Government are responsible for the legislation, the Department of Justice are responsible for its administration. This brings us to what happened on 16th July when the Supreme Court gave the decision to which the Minister has referred.  My only knowledge of that decision is what I read in the newspapers.  The Minister's explanatory memorandum tells us that it was the use of the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; that resulted in the Supreme Court deciding that paragraph (a) of subsection (2), section 44 of the Act is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I am at some disadvantage in not having available to me a copy of the Supreme Court judgment and, consequently, I do not know what was the exact wording of their ruling.  I suggest to the Minister that, perhaps, it would have been appropriate for him to have supplied me with a copy of that judgment, a judgment that has led to the introduction of this Bill at such short notice.  Perhaps the suggestion is one that Ministers might consider for the future.</P>
    <P>Because this paragraph of the Act has been declared invalid, it no longer exists in so far as the law is concerned. I am wondering whether we should be discussing the re-enactment of the paragraph rather than to be amending a <Col N="1850" /> paragraph which the court has deemed to be invalid.  However, that is a small technical point.  We would like the Minister to tell us what is the great necessity for rushing this Bill through the House.  It has been only days since the Supreme Court decision has been made known.  The rushed introduction of the Bill is indicative of a hasty decision having been made either by the Minister or by the Government and I am wondering how much time the Government have given to considering the Bill.  They can have given only very little time to it.  From my own knowledge of these matters, I know that in the normal course of events a Minister furnishes his colleagues with full information in regard to legislation he proposes bringing before the Dáil and that his colleagues, having considered it, discuss it at a Government meeting where a final decision is reached.  I have reason to believe that this procedure has not been followed in this case.</P>

      <P>I hope this has not happened in this case but the Minister will have an opportunity of replying to the query.  I can only hope that full consideration has been given by the Government to this measure and that we will not live to regret its enactment at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introductory statement the Minister implied that the 1968 Act cannot be operated now because of the Supreme Court decision.  I would just like to suggest to him &mdash; he may let me know if I am right or wrong&mdash;that the breathalyser system could in fact continue to be operated without this paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 44.  The person who analysed the specimens of blood or urine provided could be required to appear in court to give his evidence rather than depend on the certificate with which section 44 deals.  If part of the law relating to the evidential effects of the certificate were deemed invalid, I do not see why there should be any great difficulty in the interim in having the analyst appear to present his evidence <Col N="1851" /> before the court where these matters were being decided.</P>
    <P>The whole question of constitutionality was discussed when this matter came before the House in 1967 and 1968.  At that time the Minister referred to the report of the Commission on Driving While Under the Influence of Drink or a Drug which was presented to his predecessor, Deputy Blaney, when he was Minister, in 1963, and this whole legislation dealing with the breathalyser and the other tests was based on the recommendations in that report.  It is interesting to recall that there was some doubt expressed at that time as to whether the certificate stating the alcohol level in the blood of arrested persons could be deemed to be conclusive evidence in a court of law and, on balance, the Minister decided to include the clause &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo; which we are now being asked to withdraw following the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote part of the commission's report to show the thinking in 1963.  I am taking this from an extract in volume 227 of the Official Report of 7th March, 1967:</P>
    <P>If any legislative changes are to be really successful and effective they must, in our view, have the support of the bulk of public opinion.  In countries where a certain blood alcohol level has been prescribed as conclusive evidence of critical impairment, public opinion has, we believe, been conditioned, perhaps gradually, to accept the position. Here the whole procedure of making and analysing blood samples and giving evidence of blood-alcohol levels in prosecutions would constitute an innovation in criminal procedure with which everyone concerned might take some considerable time to become familiar, as well as interference with personal rights which public opinion might be still slower to accept as necessary or desirable. It may be that, as a result of experience, public opinion would, in the course of time, be conditioned to accept and approve of a prescribed <Col N="1852" /> level which would be conclusive evidence of impairment.  We doubt very much if the education of opinion on the matter has yet reached that stage.</P>
    <P>They seem to come down against including it.  At the same time it can be shown clearly that they did not rule out the introduction of such a system at some future date but they considered it was unlikely to be acceptable at the time they reported&mdash;1963. As we know, in the event, the Minister decided that he would include that clause &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo; and it did become part of the Act.  So, there was always a doubt there as to whether it should, in fact, have been included or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister states in his explanatory memorandum that he is also availing of this opportunity to make a limited number of other amendments related to the provisions of the 1963 Act which experience of the operation of the Act has shown to be desirable. I suppose the principal change here is where he is providing that any member of the Garda Síochána may be permitted to require a person to permit the taking of the specimens, rather than the existing provision which says that it must be the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station.  There is no difficulty with us as far as that is concerned.  We accept that there has been some difficulty in the operation of this Act, in this aspect of it, and we will accept these changes without any great objections from our side of the House.</P>
    <P>There is a principle involved here where the change is &ldquo;until the contrary is proved&rdquo;.  This is throwing an onus on the accused to prove a matter and is removing from the State the obligation which hitherto lay with them.  This is something for which, of course, there are precedents but it is not a highly desirable clause to include in legislation. We accept again that, in the circumstances, special measures are necessary because we are dealing with a very serious matter, drunken drivers, and the provision can and should be tolerated by the community in these circumstances.  But, now that the conclusive evidence clause is to be removed <Col N="1853" /> from the legislation and the accused will now be allowed to argue the contrary to what the certificate says, I wonder would the Minister agree with me that some further amendments would be desirable at this time because if the accused person will now have the right to argue his case he should be provided with a copy of the certificate at least seven days before the court case takes place.  If sufficient time had been allowed for a measure such as this, this type of amendment would have been highly desirable.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that he should accept an amendment of that kind and also that the accused upon receipt of the certificate and having studied it and having received whatever legal advice he has sought, should be entitled to request that the analyst responsible for the certificate and its contents, which would be used as evidence against him in court should be present in court on the day the case was being heard so that he could be cross-examined as to the accuracy of the certificate being presented against the accused.  This would not have been necessary in the past when the certificate was deemed to be conclusive evidence and therefore there was no argument but there is argument now and if the accused is to show the contrary of what is contained in the certificate he should be supplied with a copy of it and should be allowed to request the presence of the analyst in court on the day in question.  I would suggest that at least three days before the case is heard he should be entitled to have that request submitted.</P>
    <P>These are some very brief suggestions. The Bill has been brought before us rather abruptly.  It just goes to show that the legislation can be improved and, with further thought and consideration, could be improved considerably more.  I am wondering whether it is wise on the Minister's part to rush in and more or less put the gun to our heads and say that the Bill must be passed.</P>
    <P>I would be satisfied, in the circumstances, if the Minister could give some kind of assurance, if he accepts <Col N="1854" /> that what I have said is valid&mdash;he can argue otherwise and prove me wrong &mdash;that at some future date he would consider introducing amendments of the kind I have suggested which I think are necessary in the interests of defendants and enabling them to present their case adequately to the courts.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I want to say at this stage.  I may have something to say on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Supreme Court was a very important one.  It shows how important the constitutional rights of the individual are. It is a great source of relief to everybody to know that the constitutional rights of the individual can be protected. Courts are there to protect our rights and this case was a very interesting exercise in this regard.</P>
      <P>What is important is the fact that not everybody can challenge these cases.  Those people who have not got the means cannot take their cases to court.  What I am wondering about is what happens to all those people who were borderline cases and feel aggrieved over this matter, who have been convicted or had their licences endorsed.  What rights have they and how can they take their cases to court?  What can be done about them? This is a very important matter and something which will have to be looked into.  Many of those people are not able to provide the money to fight the case in court and they have no redress whatever.  What can be done to protect the rights of these individuals?</P>
      <P>I understand that cases which are pending will be declared invalid.  However, in all other cases where convictions took place and licences were endorsed there should be some means of redress or some means by which their cases could be heard in court at minimum cost to the individuals concerned.  This is a matter which the Minister should seriously look into and tell us what will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the Minister's action in bringing this before the House so rapidly.  While <Col N="1855" /> I defend the rights of the individual I am also opposed to people driving cars with excess alcohol in the blood. However, I would have thought we would have given a little more time to this matter to consider, perhaps, reducing the level of alcohol by way of legislation.  The Council of Europe, in a recent recommendation which will be binding on all the member countries, sets the level of alcohol at 80 milligrammes.  Ireland and Belgium are the only countries in Europe with permissible levels above 80 milligrammes. We are far in excess of what is considered a high level of alcohol for a person to be fit to drive a car.  The level in this country, 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood, is far in excess of what would be considered excessive for a man to be capable of driving a car in other countries.  Knowing the Minister I have no doubt that he will look at this matter seriously and bring a bit of sanity to driving.  I am convinced he will do this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has told me that when a sample is taken from an accused person that person has the right to demand an extra sample for an independent analysis.  He should be given this sample automatically for independent analysis.  The fact that the accused is entitled to a second sample for his own independent analysis is not well known.  It should be made clear that an estimation of his blood alcohol level can be obtained by him independently.  This would serve a useful purpose and would be seen by the accused as a means of ensuring his own protection.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to raise is in regard to the proposal to amend the Act to give any member of the Garda Síochána power to require a person to provide a blood or urine specimen.  I am puzzled as to why this was amended.  The Minister's statement referred to the fact that sections 2 to 6 amended a number of sections of the 1968 Act by removing the restriction by which only the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the Garda station when an arrested person was brought in had the power to require <Col N="1856" /> the person to provide a blood or urine specimen.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that if a person is brought to a Garda station there must be somebody in charge.  For that reason I wonder why these sections were amended.  It would mean that this could be open to abuse unless the person in charge of the station takes on this responsibility.  The person in charge of the station is the only person who should have the right to require a person to provide a blood or urine specimen.  This is a very important matter and should be considered seriously by the Minister before these sections are amended.  I am a little puzzled by it and I cannot see the reason for the amendment.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a need for this Bill.  There is a need for this change. The present high death rate on the roads, with the knowledge that the very high proportion of these deaths are attributable to a high level of alcohol in the blood, indicates that there is a need for this change.  There is also a need for it so that we do not have this wrangling in courts as to whether the old methods of whether a man could walk a straight line and so on, are sufficient.  We must have some means of knowing it and I would like to see the Act amended by virtue of this alone.</P>
    <P>If people think that this Act is contrary to the Constitution you will have everybody challenging it.  Anybody with money will challenge it unless the law is amended immediately. We could arrive at the stage where people would become more and more irresponsible on the roads with alcohol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Minister's motives in bringing this Bill before the House quickly because, quite obviously, there is a loophole in the law and it is extremely difficult to deal with the question of drunken driving unless we have this amendment. This Bill in two ways illustrates the effect of this kind of legislation.  The very fact that this amendment has to be rushed in means, in effect, that the older provisions for the policing of the roads which depended on commonsense and the truthworthiness of the <Col N="1857" /> Garda are all shoved aside by the introduction of this kind of legislation.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister referred to the fact that prosecution for drunken driving will still lie.  However, the plain fact is that once you bring in this kind of legislation to deal with a particular subject it effectively throws the older remedies aside because the defence immediately sets up the plea that there is a specific statutory way of dealing with this.  The defence then makes the innuendo that this was not adopted because it could not stand up and the accused gets the benefit of the doubt.  It was for that reason that a number of us strongly opposed elements in the Act when it was first introduced.</P>
      <P>At that time I was sitting on the Government side of the House and I was one of the people who was very critical of this matter in some regards. The only comment that is legitimate now is that one should look before one leaps with legislation of this sort.  I wonder if the condition on our roads in regard to drink is any better today because of this legislation brought in some years ago than it would have been if the law as it was had been enforced.  That is water under the bridge now.  We have brought about the situation and there is no alternative now but to accept it.  We must have some legislation to deal with the problem and I do not think the Minister had very much choice but to rush this thing through.</P>
      <P>I join with the other Deputies, particularly Deputy Molloy, who suggested that the whole matter should be reexamined. I will come to that in a moment with this second remark in regard to what Deputy O'Connell said. In section 5 there is an amendment: &ldquo;the member of the Garda Síochána then in charge&rdquo; is now to be &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.  This is a typical example of the type of erosion that occurs in this kind of legislation.  How often in this House have people who have been critical of legislation argued that there was a danger to the rights of someone, maybe the individual, and how often has the Minister put in a qualification, and how often has that qualification later been eroded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1858" /> To be specific, if my memory serves me correctly, the Opposition, and perhaps some Government Deputies at the time, queried broad rights being given to the Garda in a Bill such as this.  It was to mollify, so to speak, that criticism and, perhaps, genuinely to introduce some safeguard, that the provision was restricted to &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána then in charge&rdquo;. Here we are eroding this for practical purposes.  The lesson is clearly there.  In this kind of legislation you start down the slippery slope and, once you do, you are going to slide.</P>

      <P>If I may refer for a moment to the Supreme Court decision.  We, as legislators, are the other arm of the constitutional machine and I, for one, welcome the Supreme Court intervention in this way under the Constitution.  Our Supreme Court &mdash;if I may presume to say so; it is not for me or this House either to comment or criticise what one might describe as our constitutional co-equal&mdash;have exercised this function over the years and that has been a good thing.  May I say they have not over-exercised it. I might add a corollary to that; this being the situation, it is right that the courts should judge but the courts cannot escape the fact that in this kind of thing, and this is particularly so in the case of the inferior courts, they have, because of their autonomy, the public duty of co-operating in the enforcement of the law.  It is here the question of penalty comes in.  I throw this out as an idea to be considered by the Minister for later legislation rather than as a subject for discussion here now.  In the enforcement of the law we must take into account what the courts are likely to do, what would be reasonable penalties and what would be the reasonable way of enforcing the law through the judicial machine.  So much for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to touch on what I consider to be a fundamental point of mechanism as far as the roads are concerned and particularly as far as drunken driving is concerned.  There is a gap here where you are dealing with a crime which is very definitely <Col N="1859" /> a crime; it is an anachronism that legislation should emanate from the Department of Local Government rather than from the Department of Justice and one of the main difficulties from the point of view of policing our roads arises from this traditional cleavage between the two Departments. In effect, the Department of Local Government legislates for the roads and the Department of Justice and the police have the responsibility of enforcement. It is all very well to say there is co-ordination at Government level.  There may be, but it does not appear to work.  There are routine matters, such as signposting and parking regulations, which come within the ambit of the Department of Local Government.  What we are concerned with is the serious problem of policing our roads from the safety point of view.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, particularly in regard to this Bill and, perhaps, more generally too, would he reconsider with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, the reallocation of responsibility and duties in this regard?  All matters that pertain to safety on the road, safety in driving, traffic offences, should be integrated under the Department of Justice.  Far too often one sees&mdash;I will not name the place because that might pinpoint it &mdash; ridiculous signs erected on a road, a road which I drive, an academic pattern on a road not very far from this House, which could have led to a very dangerous situation.  Indeed, every car that passed there technically committed a crime.  After a few weeks, whoever was responsible came and painted the signs out and put a sensible sign there instead.  Now that would never have happened if the Garda had been dealing with the situation in the first instance.</P>
    <P>This is not a Bill the Minister for Local Government should introduce. It should come from the Department of Justice and I would suggest a reallocation and a transfer of certain functions from the Department of Local Government, to the Department of Justice where safety of driving or crimes arising out of the use of motor vehicles, as distinct from the <Col N="1860" /> organisation of such things as parking or one-way streets, are concerned; these should be the responsibility of the Garda.  Only then will you get the roads policed.  As it is, the gardaí have an impossible job.  It is impossible largely because of the multiplicity of regulations and orders and their enforcement.</P>
    <P>There are, for instance, roads with all sorts of signs on them &mdash; 30 miles per hour, 40 miles per hour, and so on; it is absolutely impossible to enforce the local authority signs on the Bray road, for example, and that shows an utter lack of appreciation of the police problem and I would strongly urge the Minister to let police problems be police problems referrable to them. This is very relevant to the question of drunken driving because discipline on our roads, particularly in the cities, is deteriorating.  Lights are being crashed, all sorts of things are happening. Of course the Minister for Local Government is not the Minister to urge in this regard and that is the difficulty.  One of the matters involved in this problem is the provision of an adequate police arm to deal with it. In this city of Dublin there is not an adequate force of specialised and trained police who can devote their time continuously to the problems involved.</P>
    <P>In regard to drunken driving in particular, prevention is better than cure.  The cure comes after the damage is done, and prevention means steady, unobstrusive, quiet policing, and that we have not got because the Garda Síochána have neither the resources nor the organisation to do it. Gardaí are not in a position to enforce the law fairly and uniformly, and there is a great deal of hit and miss about it.  It is a bit of good luck or bad luck whether a fellow who has too much drink to be safe on the road is caught or not caught.  There will always be an element of favourable chance in it, but at the moment there is too much of a toss-up about it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an amending Bill and, perhaps, it is going a little too far to open it up into a general debate. On the question of shifting the onus <Col N="1861" /> of proof, which Deputy Molloy mentioned, it is essential sometimes to shift the onus of proof, but it is a well tried out principle of law that the onus rests on him who asserts and particularly on him who prosecutes. We should be very loathe to shift that onus unless it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>Although the question of penalties does not come into this Bill, it is valuable to have as an institution a Supreme Court which will protect the rights of individuals and of the community. The Dáil, the courts, everybody who is concerned with administration, and the community should advert to the need for appreciating the relative heinousness in crime.  Too often what is really a serious case gets off scot free and too often a heavy penalty is imposed where it is not warranted.  Sometime ago I read about two cases in the same issue of an English newspaper.  In one case a court of fairly high jurisdiction in England dealt with the conviction of a man who had defrauded large business interests.  He got a lecture from the judge and a long term of imprisonment.  In the other case, a criminal with a record who had very savagely and indecently assaulted a young girl was let off, virtually with a caution.</P>
    <P>In regard to this Bill, there must be some appreciation of the magnitude of the crime and judicial uniformity in dealing with it; otherwise we fail completely in what we are trying to do.  Anyway, I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence in allowing me to go perhaps a little beyond the confines of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no option, and I would join with Deputy Molloy in asking him to re-consider the whole question when time permits and to bring in suitable amendments to fill the gaps.  Let us regard this as a stop-gap provision which he must have passed. However, I would ask him quite seriously to consider if there are not duties which are currently and traditionally laid at his door that would be better transferred to his colleague, the Minister for Justice.  Where to draw the line can best be determined by the people <Col N="1862" /> who know, both Ministers and their advisers.  As long as the present conditions continue, the policing of the roads is a more difficult problem than it need be and, in many cases, the situation in which the Garda Síochána find themselves becomes literally impossible.  It is not that the guards do not want to do the job; they do.  It is not that the guards are not capable; they are.  It is that the multiplicity of regulations, the variations in them, all the problems with which thy are confronted when it comes to road control, make their task impossible.  I would ask the Minister very earnestly, indeed, to consider that as a first priority.</P>

      <P>As somebody who, perhaps, has come across the provisions in the Road Traffic Act to a considerable extent in his job, I should like to make a few comments on this Bill.  First of all, in regard to the matter before the House, we are aware it is the result of a Supreme Court decision, and I believe that everybody is satisfied that such a decision should have been taken by the Supreme Court.  On this issue the Supreme Court have shown that they gave very close care and attention to the matter that came before them.  This shows the diligence of our judiciary and their complete independence.  In this Bill the words &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo; are deleted and are substituted by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the words &ldquo;shall be sufficient evidence until the contrary is shown&rdquo;.  The basic point is that the hands of a District Justice were tied while the words &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo; were in the Act.  This Bill is essential.  Quite a considerable amount of the carnage and a considerable number of the deaths and accidents on our roads are caused by drink.  We must take whatever steps are necessary to prevent accidents and deaths on the road.  This is a very important social point which we should bear in mind. A person should be able to have his case heard on its merits before any court.  The change proposed in the Bill will provide a person with an opportunity <Col N="1863" /> of rebutting any evidence that comes before a court.  This is essential.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of the Bill dealing with proofs, and doctors, and so on.  A person giving evidence should be able to prove that he is qualified to take a test and to give evidence.  He should be able to prove that he is a registered medical practitioner.  The medical evidence will be very important. Indeed, I would maintain that the onus should be on the State to prove that such a person is a registered medical practitioner.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill. It is regrettable that this measure has to be introduced but it is one the general public will support.  At the same time I have a reservation, as the emphasis seems to be on drunken drivers.  Having regard to the mounting toll of fatalties and injuries caused by road users, I was delighted to be present at a function recently held at a school for road training in Clontarf which was attended by the Minister for Local Government.  I was impressed by the very responsible message the Minister gave to road users generally.</P>
      <P>I am very sensitive about the tragedies which occur on the roads. Statistics show that serious accidents occur at certain hours but, unfortunately, no steps are taken to deal with bad mannered and aggressive drivers on our roads today.  No steps have been taken to curb the infiltration on to our roads of these huge lorries which are not clearly identified.  Some bear the words &ldquo;long vehicle&rdquo;; others do not.  No attempt is made to inspect the roadworthiness of some of these long vehicles and some of the cars operating on the roads.  I may be out of order in referring to these matters but I am conscious of this, as a citizen.</P>

      <P>I should not like to delay this measure one instant.  I am appalled at the number of deaths and injuries on the roads shown nightly on television.  This amendment has been described as a stop-gap.  Call it what you will, but I welcome it.  The whole question of driving on our roads will have to be looked into.  When this provision was introduced some years ago I said that a man must have taken so much drink before he is guilty.  Like the Minister, I have been &ldquo;dry&rdquo; all my life and I hope to remain so.  If the Minister and myself had two halfones before we started to drive, we might be a greater menace than the habitual drinker who had taken half a bottle of whiskey.  Drunken driving cannot be measured by the amount you have but by how you can stand up to it.  I welcome this measure.  I hope its passage will not be long delayed and that it will have the effect of sobering up many of the drivers on the roads today.  It is regrettable that our police force are otherwise occupied trying to put manners on some of us here and in other parts of the country. I hope this will be put into full force and that even stronger measures will be taken to deal with drunken driving. From what I see in the newspapers or on television an appalling number of people are killed on the roads.  If we can reduce that figure even by one we will have done something worthwhile today.  I hope when this is put into effect it will sober many of the drivers on the roads today.</P>

      <P>Any effort in this House to prevent death or injury on our roads deserves our support.  We have seen too many road accidents caused by excessive drinking and other <Col N="1865" /> reasons.  My main reason for speaking is to ask the Minister about road signs. I hope I am not outside the scope of the debate.  I will just make a passing reference.  The signs erected on main roads outside towns are a little ugly. What they say is well intended but I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of having something more artistic and better worded.  There is one, I am not sure whether it is in Irish or in English, which says: &ldquo;He is a killer who drinks&rdquo;.  I do not think that is correct.  He may be a killer if he is a drunken driver but certainly he is not a killer because he drinks. Neither the Minister nor Deputy Coogan drink but I am sure they would not say that everybody who drinks is a killer.  There is one which says: &ldquo;Speed kills, kills, kills&rdquo;.  I do not think this is the right approach. I would prefer to see people encouraged to do the right thing on our roads starting with a greater emphasis on education at school level and going on to encourage various rural and urban organisations to devote certain periods to discussing road safety, the different aspects of road safety, advice to drivers, advice regarding drink&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Molloy that this amending Bill was not introduced with the great haste that he seemed to think it was.  It was fully considered in the normal way and we are quite satisfied that the terms of the Bill will do the job they are intended to do.  I might remind him that according to what he said himself the recommendation made previous to the other Bill was in 1963 and the Bill introduced in 1968 turned out to be defective so a long time spent preparing a Bill does not seem to be very effective.  I agree with him that it is <Col N="1866" /> very necessary to have the correct words in the Bill so that it will not be defeated again by a Supreme Court decision.  I do not think it will.  I think the words now inserted will stand up to time.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that during the debate on the previous Bill every effort was made to prevent the word, which has now caused that Act to be declared <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, being included but the then Minister insisted that it should be included.  I believe he felt as I do now that he was putting the right words in.  As it turned out he was not, so one can never be sure.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the question of whether or not a person who is taken in on a charge of drunken driving should be told what his rights are.  In fact, he is told.  The regulations should be read out to him and he should know unless he is too drunk to understand.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy made a point about making a copy of the certificate available to the person charged.  I am surprised he should make this point because section 43 of the 1968 Act lays down that this should be done.  I am quite sure the regulations are carried out and in every case the necessary information is given to the person who is being charged.  As regards giving Deputy Molloy a copy of the Supreme Court judgment, as he must be aware this will not be available for several weeks.  I have the newspaper report but I felt that because of the seriousness of the case and because we are hopeful of having the adjournment of the Dáil in the not-too-distant future that we should not allow the holiday period to go over with a defective Act in operation.  Of course, it would be possible to make a charge under the Act but it would not be possible to prove it so there would not be much point in taking somebody to court knowing that the case was even weaker than it was under the existing law and therefore it had to be amended and amended quickly.  For that reason I am glad that the House has agreed to take all stages of this Bill this evening.  I understand the Seanad will do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Running through the debate was the theme that the number being killed on <Col N="1867" /> the roads was increasing.  I am glad to say that that is not so; the opposite is the case.  I would say that the Act which has been in operation until now had a lot to do with this reduction.  In 1972 the number killed on the roads was 640 and the number injured was 8,955.  For the first six months of 1973, though it is nothing to brag about, the number is down to 283, a reduction of 33 on 1972.  There are 33 people alive today who would not have been alive, in my opinion, if it were not for the introduction of that Act.</P>

      <P>Yes, years.  Deputy O'Connell commented that, perhaps, the regulations should be tightened further and the level of the alcohol content reduced.  Unless there is a much greater improvement in regard to this issue than there has been in the past I would be inclined to recommend to the Government that we should tighten the regulations because it is my belief that many road accidents are caused by people who have had too much alcohol to drink.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera made some good points but, apparently, he did not understand that while the local authorities are responsible for erecting signs in relation to road safety, these must be agreed by the Garda so that there is co-ordination already of the type that the Deputy suggested.  There are in operation now special traffic gardaí and while it is true that there is not a sufficient number of breathalyser systems in operation the fact that there are some in existence is a deterrent to those who might otherwise indulge in alcohol to excess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was found that in many cases, particularly in country districts, a garda in charge of a station might be a very junior member of the Garda while an experienced senior member might have taken the person in but would then have to hand him over to that junior member. Also, in a busy Garda station it was found often that when the Garda who was responsible for the arrest arrived at the station, he would have to wait his turn in a queue.  It happened sometimes, too, that the garda who was in charge of a station might, under the rota system, be about to go off duty as the person was being brought in so that there would be some confusion as to whether he or the man taking over from him was the responsible person.  Therefore, it was regarded as appropriate that this matter be tightened up so that the person making the arrest could be responsible for the test being taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now the responsibility was confined to the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station to which the arrested person had been taken but I do not think that under the amended legislation this will be confined to the garda who brought the person to the station and that it will be open to any garda present in the station to assume the responsibility.</P>

      <P>It might be better if the garda who was in charge of the station would be an officer senior to the one who brings in the arrested person.  I cannot see the point of the Deputy's query because either the man who makes the arrest or the senior officer at the station will now be responsible for the test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that we are in a difficult position here and the Minister seems obliged to bring in this amending legislation so as to ensure the continuance of the breathalyser system.  At a time when the Dáil is facing a recess period, this measure has been rushed on the Minister but it is a pity that we are not being given more time in which to consider the operation of the system since 1968. I hope that in the not-too-distant future we will have such opportunity so that thorough consideration can be given to the operation of the Act since it was introduced.  On this occasion we are only dealing with one aspect of it as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  It has been brought to my notice that at present the arrested person must be brought to the Garda station but that situations have arisen whereby persons who were driving motor vehicles while under the influence of drink became aware of being under the observation of a member of the Garda Síochána and proceeded to the nearest Garda station, made their way inside but when accosted by the garda, under the Act, he was not able to bring a successful prosecution because he had not brought such people to the station.  I understand that there has been an acquittal in such a case.  It seems that there are little weaknesses such as this in the Act which we could have tidied up at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of this Bill being rushed.  If Deputy Molloy wishes to debate the Bill until tonight he may do so but he cannot be on both sides.  The suggestion that, because a fellow goes into a Garda station of his own accord, there is, therefore, no way of arresting him, is a little too ridiculous to comment on but since Deputy Molloy, a former Minister, has made it, I feel I must comment.  The position is that either he is allowed to stay until he sobers up, which is very unlikely, or, as soon as he goes out, he is liable to be arrested.  I am aware of a case where <Col N="1872" /> this happened.  I know of somebody who tried to be clever, went to the Garda station and as soon as he went outside he was arrested, brought back in and charged.  I cannot accept that somebody goes to a Garda station and is allowed to stay there all night until he sobers up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I only gave the instance to demonstrate that there were loopholes in the Act.  For instance, there was a case similar to the one I have mentioned which was brought before the courts and the accused was acquitted on the defence which was made on these grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate as to why he deemed it necessary to word the amendment in this way: &ldquo;sufficient evidence until the contrary is shown&rdquo;.  This breaches the principle we mentioned already that the State should be expected to prove its own case.  Here we are placing the onus on the accused to prove that the contrary is the case.  Would it not have been equally effective, without placing the accused in this position, to have worded the amendment in such a way as to provide that the certificate shall be evidence, and leave it at that rather than breach the old principle which most people do not like to see breached?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer Deputy Molloy to section 44 (1) and (2) (b) of the 1968 Act where the very same wording is used.  There is no question of a new principle.  Unfortunately this was not accepted.  If the previous Minister had continued on those lines we would not now be here arguing for amendment of the Act.  The new wording is not open to the objection voiced by the Supreme Court, that is, that the evidence provided by the certificate is incontestible and the District Justice would be precluded from exercising his judgment in the matter.  It is simply doing the opposite to what Deputy Molloy said.  He says the onus of proof is on the person charged.  If the person accused is now able to prove that the evidence given by the garda is wrong, then the District Justice has the right to use his own discretion, which he had not when it was stated that the evidence was conclusive.</P>

      <P>Under the existing subsection (2) (b) a certificate from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is <i>prima facie</i> evidence &ldquo;in so far as it states other facts obtained from records required to be kept under this Part.&rdquo;  Apart from that, it has no evidential value.  The court could require oral evidence.  In order to prevent this happening and cluttering up the courts it has now been decided that this would be brought in which makes the matter easier of administration without taking away any rights of the person accused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had concluded before Question Time but I was asked to report progress and, as some progress was made, I reported it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussion on this section before Question Time I raised certain questions and the Minister gave certain answers.  I want to pursue this matter a little further. The Minister, as I recall, stated that there was no provision in this section for the possibility of a Member of Seanad Éireann being Attorney General because if such a provision were to be made there would emerge various anomalies resulting from the previous legislation in this regard which could result in a Member of Seanad Éireann, who was Attorney General, being paid a higher salary than, for instance, a Minister.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand how this could happen but if the Minister says that is so I accept it.  However, it does seem to me that this is a fault in this section which visualises the possibility of an Attorney General being a Member of Dáil Éireann and not providing for the case where he is a Member of Seanad Éireann when particularly paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of the new section refers to a Member of the Oireachtas.  On the face of it the omission of the provision in relation to a Member of the Seanad is, to say the least of it, peculiar when paragraph (a) refers to a Member of the Oireachtas and (b) refers to a Member of Dáil Éireann and there is no provision, as one would expect, in paragraph (c) for a Member of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that the explanation which the Minister has given is a sufficiently satisfactory one because it seems to imply that it was not possible to draft an additional subsection which would deal with the situation of a <Col N="1875" /> Member of the Seanad.  I should also like to ask the Minister what was the position previously when an Attorney General was a Member of the Dáil with regard to his salary <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of a Minister at that time.  I ask this question because we are providing here for a difference in salary between an Attorney General who is a Member of the Dáil and an Attorney General who is not a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I want to ascertain whether we are simply adjusting in relation to what happened before or whether we are creating a new situation.  It would seem to me that it would be helpful in understanding this position if the Minister would tell us what was the position in the past where a Member of this House was Attorney General in relation to his salary <i>vis-à-vis</i> a Minister at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not agree that there were any surprises in this Bill but if I try to fill all the loopholes and cure all the anomolies that exist in relation to this I suspect, and I would then be able to admit, that there would be several reasons for believing that there were, or would be, surprises.  If the Deputy is not good at mental arithmetic I suggest he take out pen and paper for these figures.  The Employer/Labour Conference suggested the Attorney General figure should be £7,213.  That was on the basis of his not being a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  It was wrong to visualise the Attorney General not being a Member of the Oireachtas because he has often been in the past.  Being a Member now of the Dáil, and full time in his duties, and being excluded from outside occupations of profit, the Attorney General will get his Dáil allowance of £3,416, like every Minister, and his Ministerial allowance of £4,430, making a total of £7,846.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the way in which the legislation governing remuneration of Ministers has been arranged since 1960 the Minister in the Seanad would receive the Seanad allowance of £2,023 plus the ministerial allowance <Col N="1876" /> of £4,430, making a total of £6,453. That is roughly £1,400 less than if the same Minister was a Member of the Dáil.  Here we have a number of anomalies.  If the Attorney General, being full time, were to be paid in accordance with the Employer/ Labour Conference he would get £7,213, but if he were to have the same arrangement applied to him as a Member of the Seanad as would apply to him as a Member of the Dáil, he would end up with only £6,453, or else he would have to be paid the £7,213 which would be more than a Minister would get if he was in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>These are obviously contradictory situations and I think there is a very good case for saying that on the very rare occasions that a person is a member of the Seanad and a Minister he ought to receive the same figure of £7,846 because where a Minister is a Member of the Seanad he is required to do exactly the same work as if he were a Member of the Dáil other than march through the lobbies.  He is required to be present in this House during Question Time to answer questions.  He must move, and deal with all business relating to his Department in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Attorney General does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Minister situation.  The Minister, as such, has to do all these things and yet, because of the particular code that was adopted in 1960, he would receive £1,400 less although in all respects in relation to the way he would have to behave in the discharge of his responsibilities in this House and in the Seanad he would not have one iota less work to do because he was a Member of the Seanad.  That is also an anomoly which I believe needs to be cured.  We decided that rather than trying to deal with all these things, which would probably require a totally new look at the situation and one which I think is best dealt with at committee level so that all these difficulties could be ironed out, the appropriate thing to do was to deal with the situation which now exists and that is one in which the <Col N="1877" /> Attorney General is full time, is a Member of the Dáil and is excluded from participating in any activity beyond public duty which would give him any remuneration.  That is the situation which we are dealing with here and I think it is the proper one.  If and when some Taoiseach desires to appoint a Member of the Seanad as Attorney General that will be a suitable time and if, in the meantime, we have not corrected this anomaly, that will then be the appropriate time to try to correct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks from what the Minister has said that no Taoiseach could contemplate appointing somebody from the Seanad as Attorney General as the position stands, but could I remind the Minister that I asked another question; I asked what the position was in relation to any previous Attorney General who was a Member of this House.  What was the position of his salary <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of a Minister?  Did he have the same salary, a lower salary or a higher salary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the last time we had an Attorney General in this House was before 1960.  I am subject to correction on that.  At that time office holders received a lump sum and it is only since 1960 that they received two salaries, one as an office holder and the other as a Member of the House.  The situation, therefore, would not be entirely comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for that, how did the income of Attorney General at that time, taking into account his membership of the House, compare with that of a Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very, very difficult to compare like with like, as far as I can see.  The tables given to me are on the basis of excluding Deputies' allowances in all cases.  This is a purely notional table.  In 1947 a Minister received £2,125 and an Attorney General received £3,000, including his Deputy's allowance.  Remember, at that time the figure was a global figure.  There was no notion of separating them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is proposed here is to reverse the situation that obtained some years ago where the Attorney General was paid more than a Minister. It is now proposed to pay him less unless he is a Member of this House and to pay him the same if he is a Member of this House.  The situation is a little confusing.  I think I can say I would accept the proposition that the Attorney General, who is a Member of this House, is analogous to a Minister <Col N="1879" /> and should be paid the same. Frankly, I am not quite clear as to how he should be treated if he is not a Member of the House.  In one sense it could be argued that he is performing the same function and, as of now, in the case of a Minister, he receives his allowance as a Deputy the same as any other Deputy and then he receives a salary as a Minister on top of that.  It could be argued that an Attorney General who is doing the job of Attorney General should be paid a sum as a salary in respect of that job &mdash;in other words, equal pay for equal work&mdash;and the allowance which he should get as a Member of this House, if he is a Member, is another matter. It may be that the practical effect of applying that would be that you would get no one prepared to be Attorney General if he were not a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, there are various anomalies when one tries to marry the two positions, which may be even further complicated in the case of the Seanad, though I would have thought that it is not enough to say simply that there are anomalies and, therefore, you do not deal with it at all from the point of view of the Seanad. When we are dealing with the possibility of an Attorney General being a Member of Dáil Éireann, and we are referring to a Member of the Oireachtas, we should provide in regard to the Seanad.  I have not done the sum but the principle involved, if it does not give a round practical result, would seem to be that an Attorney General, who is a Member of the Seanad, should be paid the same amount as an Attorney General who is a Member of this House less the difference between the allowance to the Deputy and that to a Senator.  I have not done the sum, as I have said, but that would seem to be the correct principle to apply. Perhaps the Minister could tell me whether that principle, if applied, would produce an anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy's suggestion it is that, if we take the figures relating to a Minister or an Attorney General&mdash;let us take an Attorney General in the Seanad&mdash;you <Col N="1880" /> get a Seanad allowance of £2,023 and he would have a Ministerial or office allowance of £4,430 which would give £6,453.  The Deputy is suggesting that he should in addition get £1,393, which would be the difference&mdash;that is, £1,393 less than an office holder in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the equivalent amount of the difference between the allowance to a Deputy and that to a Senator.  It seems to me that is what it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now look at the anomaly.  The Employer/Labour Conference said the remuneration of the Attorney General should be £7,213 if he is not a Member of either House so, by becoming a Member of the Seanad, he would lose out by about £800 and, if he resigned from the Seanad, he would be £800 better off.  That is because of the mixture of the ways we have for remunerating office holders and members of the legislature.  We would not be in this difficulty if we did not start in 1960 to cut sums paid to office holders as between their Parliamentary allowance and their office allowance.  The more one looked at this and the more one tried to cure a particular anomaly the more one saw the generation of another, and the least of all evils was to choose the remedy we have chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What emerges from this is that we do not pay the same rate for the same job.  When we complicate the issue by talking about a Deputy's allowance or a Senator's allowance and regarding that as part of the total salary, we end up, in effect, having to pay a different salary for the same work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Devlin identified that they were not dealing with an Attorney General who was a Member. It could be argued that £7,213 is the appropriate figure for an Attorney General, that if he becomes a Member of this House he ought to get £3,416 on top of it, but I do not think anyone would suggest that.  The format we have adopted is one which is as close as is feasible to the existing scheme in which an Attorney General as Attorney General gets paid somewhat less than a Minister.  That was on the basis of his not being a Member of the House. All we are suggesting is that if he is a Member of the House he gets a mere</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> £633 more, which I think is not an extravagant addition having regard to the fact that the present Attorney General, unlike most of his predecessors and certainly his recent predecessors, is totally detached from any outside remunerative occupation of any kind and he is also a Member of this House.  I think everybody will accept that being a Member of this House, even if you have not got the ministerial responsibility, adds somewhat to the difficulties and responsibilities of life.</P>
    <P>That is all we are doing.  We think it is a very fair measure and it leaves some scope in the future for any Taoiseach to decide whether to take his Attorney General from here or from outside life.  If he decides to take him from the Seanad, then an anomaly clearly exists.  That is something that has to be looked at.  However, we are dealing with the present situation, and I would ask the House to accept that that is the appropriate way to deal with it, and we can consider ways and means, with the agreement of all sides of the House as to how this anomaly can be cured in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot entirely accept the manner in which the Minister in certain circumstances would talk about a mere £600, while in other circumstances lesser figures seem to qualify for greater importance in his mind.  I agree with Deputy Flor Crowley that it is wrong and must leave room for certain suspicions when, on the one hand, we will quote the Employer/Labour Conference as being the sole criterion, the bedrock on which all decisions are made, and, on the other hand, we can dismiss it and say that they were not asked this or they were not asked that.  I understand from the Minister that the figure of £7,213 was recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference as the figure which would be adequate for an Attorney General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, are we taking it that his membership of this House can be equated with a figure <Col N="1883" /> of £633; and, if so, on what basis do we make that calculation?  If we are to accept that membership of this House, as far as the Attorney General is concerned, entitles him to an additional £633 because we are told he is devoting all his time to Attorney General duties, does that mean you can make the same case for Deputies who are Members of this House and who are devoting all their time to membership of this House?</P>
      <P>This is a situation which cannot be dismissed too readily.  It must be decided whether membership of this House is ideally part-time, whether there are some Members who are different from others in their membership and that you cannot make a case for giving a special allowance to one Member as against another because he is devoting himself whole-time to these duties.  Is it permissible now to have segregation here, and will the Minister accept that, in the case of those Members of the House who are prepared to indicate that they will become full-time politicians and will perform no other duties, the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations can be put to one side. Will he indicate that he is prepared to look sympathetically at the allowance that may be made to Deputies and Senators, because in the case of the Attorney General the Employer/ Labour Conference were asked to indicate the salary which would be reasonable and just for him?  They have given this figure.  They were asked to do likewise in the case of Deputies.  There was no distinction made as between part-time and whole-time Deputies.  I hope that the Minister will clarify the position and, if he can, make a case for an additional mere £600 being paid to a Member of this House who is already, under the recommendations, entitled to £7,213.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not require him to be full-time.  This Bill provides that, if a person is a Member of this House and a full-time Attorney General, he will not be paid on the basis of £7,213, but that he will be paid his ordinary Deputy's allowance, the same as Deputy Tunney and myself, of £3,416, and the office holders' pay of £4,430, making a total of £7,846.  That is all that is proposed. Deputy Colley has indicated that he did not think this was unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>We must appreciate the facility with which the Minister can make his own case.  That is an attribute we must admire in him but it is extraordinary how phrases slip from him.  When he is talking of figures of £7,846 and £7,213 as applying to himself or the Attorney General, he can throw in &ldquo;the same as Deputy Tunney&rdquo;.  Deputy Tunney is making the point that he is not entitled even to half of the figures the Minister is throwing around.  What Deputy Tunney is trying to indicate is that, when the Employer/Labour Conference made recommendations, they quoted a figure for the Attorney General of £7,213.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is proposed by the Minister to go contrary to the recommendations made, and give instead a figure of £7,846, on the basis that, because the Attorney General is a Member of this House and will devote himself whole-time to his duties as Attorney General, he should qualify for the £600.  He also made the point that membership of this House imposes additional duties on the Attorney General.  I concede that point.  I contradict the Minister when he says the Attorney General will be a full-time Attorney General.  If he is a full-time Attorney General he will not be free to attend to the duties which devolve upon him as a Member of this House. He cannot have it both ways.  Is not the case which is being made for the <Col N="1885" /> Attorney General that because he has duties devolving upon him as a Member of this House he is entitled to an additional allowance?  I suggest that if he is operating as a Member of this House he cannot simultaneously be operating as a full-time Attorney General.</P>

I could not help smiling cynically, after all we have been through with the Minister, when he tried to make the point that, because the poor Attorney General was devoting himself full-time to the affairs of the Dáil, he deserved this princely sum.  As Deputy Tunney said, what about all the unfortunate TDs whom the Minister was not prepared to allow to get their just sum?</P>

It would be very interesting to hear Deputy Thornley, Deputy B. Desmond and other Labour Members discussing this one because in their wildest dreams and fantasies they could not support this type of trick-of-the-loopery.  If the <Col N="1887" /> Minister is serious and makes the case that because the Attorney General is devoting his full time to the affairs of the House he is entitled to extra money, then he has made the case we have been trying to make that so also are TDs entitled to the same treatment.</P>

The figure given for the Attorney General in the Employer/Labour Conference report is, as at 1st January, 1972, £6,539.  I assume that by applying the further formula recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference you arrive at £7,213?</P>

It said that there was difficulty in dealing with the remuneration appropriate to Deputies.

      <P>Now I would like to speak with your permission, Sir, after that performance.  There have been complaints from the Minister for Finance, who has deigned to be good enough to be with us, and there have been complaints from some backbench members of the Government, that this matter is being dragged out. We have had lectures from several of the newspapers about how petty we are in discussing these matters of detail. The reason we have to spend these long, weary hours trying to thrash out these small matters is because of the attitude of the man who sits over there, the Minister for Finance.  If you want clear proof of that you have not just to listen to what he said in the last few minutes but also to watch his demeanour while he said it, the bitterness with which it was expressed, the air of complete boredom that he should have to come in, he, Ritchie Ryan, the Minister for Finance, and deal with miserable, tuppence-halfpenny people who are miserable TDs, when he should be about the nation's business. He is about the nation's business and we are about the nation's business because here.  If any Fianna Fáil Mini-business here.  If any Fianna Fáil Minister had put on the exhibition that we have had from Deputy Ryan over the past two days I do not think my imagination could envisage in full the reaction there would have been from the other side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crowley made a valid point that was well worth consideration.  The Minister for Finance got up and in the testiest fashion imaginable rounded on him for daring to question something which he did, for daring to ask for an explanation of the many anomalies that seem to arise in this situation.  We are setting out and <Col N="1890" /> the Minister attempts in this very section to create an anomaly.  Anomalies are usually created by legislation governing a particular situation and then some effect arising in the future, which clearly was not envisaged by the section, and then there is an anomaly. Here, before we enact this section at all, we have, on the Minister's own admission, a serious anomaly and the reason he gives for having the section as it is containing this enormous anomaly is simply that he could not work out how an Attorney General should be remunerated if he was a Member of the Seanad.  There are 60 Members in the Seanad at any given time.  The Seanad usually contains a number of barristers.  I do not know how many there are&mdash;four, five or six &mdash;at any given time but maybe at some future time some future Taoiseach will wish to nominate one of those people to be Attorney General.  He will come up against the situation that because of section 8 of this Bill not only will he not know how much he should be paid but he could not be paid anything at all.  Paragraph (a) says that if he does not hold office as a Member of the Oireachtas he will get so much and (b) says that if he is a Member of Dáil Éireann he will get so much.  It clearly spells it out to any future Taoiseach who might be anxious to appoint somebody from the Seanad as Attorney General that he may not do it.  There are only two types of payment which can be made under this proposal to an Attorney General and a man who is a member of the Seanad does not qualify for either.  In other words, lawfully and legally he can be paid out of public moneys nothing apart, perhaps, from his salary as a Member of the Seanad, which is small as we know.  This aomaly is created by the Minister for Finance setting out deliberately to create it.  It is absolutely silly to create a situation in legislation where you have to go back afterwards to rectify it.  The only reply the Minister for Finance has given in relation to it is that if and when it ever happens the then Taoiseach can bring in a Bill to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should some future Government have that obligation imposed on them?  How long will such a Bill take <Col N="1891" /> to go through both Houses?  In the meantime, the man who is Attorney General gets no salary as Attorney General.  In other words, he is put in the position of not being able to take on the job.  A very serious objection I have to the section is that it sets out deliberately to create a serious anomaly.  I have objection to the section on the general grounds on which I object to any of these sections, that they do not comply with the recommendations of the special committee of the Employer/Labour Conference. This is particularly important in the case of the Attorney General because at present he is not entitled to a pension. All that an outgoing Attorney General is entitled to is a lump sum calculated by reference to his salary on the date on which he left office provided that he has had, I think, three years service at that time.  Because that lump sum is calculated on the salary that existed on the date on which the last Attorney General left office, that was the 14th March, the lump sum is significantly lower than it would be otherwise and significantly lower than what was recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>I have not been asked by the former Attorney General to make this point.  I am sure that he has asked nobody to make it because he is the sort of man who would not do so but it is no harm for me to point out that although a serious injustice is being done by this Bill to many, he is the man to whom the most serious injustice is being done.  This provision in section 8 is only one of the provisions that have been brought in to suit the present Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I admire Deputy Costello and I am sure that he will prove to be a competent Attorney General and Deputy but I object to the principle of special legislation being brought in to cover one man only because, as I pointed out here, either this morning or yesterday, in relation to Attorneys General and the pension that it is proposed to pay them under this Bill, there are several former Attorneys General who will qualify for that pension under the terms laid down and that in several <Col N="1892" /> other cases there are widows of former holders of the office who would qualify for this pension but each of those is excluded specifically by the provision which lays down that the section should be deemed to come into force on the 14th March last or, in relation to Attorneys General, who assumed office on or after the 14th March, 1973.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what the Minister may say on those rare occasions that he deigns to talk down to us, the elected legislators of the people, there is special provision in this Bill for one man.  It arises on this section and on subsequent sections.  Regardless of the merits of the proposals, the principle is wrong. I have no objection to the Attorney General being granted an increase in his salary and I welcome the payment of a pension to a full-time Attorney General but I consider it very wrong that those who have served this nation in that capacity on a full-time basis should be excluded deliberately from the benefits of what is being introduced for the sole benefit so far of Deputy Costello.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate that I am not being in any way critical of Deputy Costello but I am criticising the Minister and the Government who produced these special sections to deal with one man.  Everybody should be dealt with equally.  It is not too much to ask that of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the case made by Deputy O'Malley I wish to make a further case and also one which is really the development of a point raised by the Deputy.  Despite the Minister's outburst it might be helpful to him if I suggest that his trouble in this regard stems from the fact that he stated the case for this section wrongly.  As I see it, the case for this section is that if an Attorney General is full-time and is a Member of this House he is in an analogous position to that of a Minister and should be paid accordingly.  That is a proposition that I would accept but the Employer/Labour Conference report recommended a certain figure for the Attorney General on the basis of the assumption that he would be a Member of this House.  It seems to me that <Col N="1893" /> the Minister's approach should be to say that the Employer/Labour Conference figure for an Attorney General who is not a Member of this House is £7,213, that there is not a figure for an Attorney General who is a Member of this House, that, therefore, we must construct one and that we believe that the correct figure on the basis of constructing it, should be, since he is to be a Member of the House and a full-time Attorney General analogous to that of a Minister.  That is the case that should have been made and one that would not have led the Minister into the kind of difficulty that he is in now in regard to full-time or part-time service in this House or in other positions.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make, and this is the development of one of the points made by Deputy O'Malley, is that I consider it inappropriate that the section should omit a reference to an Attorney General being a Member of the Seanad while providing for his being a Member of the Dáil.  The Minister has explained the practical difficulties that arise in relation to any such decision.  I appreciate that there are difficulties but I find it difficult to accept that the Minister should not have made a decision as to what way the matter should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister is creating an impossible situation, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out.  If this section is enacted in its present form what we are saying is that if a Taoiseach wishes to appoint a Member of the Seanad to the office of Attorney General, he can do so only if that man will act without a salary because it is provided specifically in this section that he will not get salary.  If one accepts the Minister's argument, at the very least, ought not paragraph (a) be amended to read &ldquo;in case the person who holds the office is not a Member of Dáil Éireann&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;is not a Member of the Oireachtas&rdquo;? On the Minister's own case the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; should not appear and should be substituted by the words &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  At least that would mean that the section was consistent and that it would not create a situation such as that described by <Col N="1894" /> Deputy O'Malley whereby, if the Taoiseach wished to appoint a Member of the Seanad to the office of Attorney General, he would have to appoint somebody who would be willing to act for no salary.  There would be no provision in relation to a Member of the Seanad but at least it would be consistent and would not produce this ludicrous situation to which Deputy O'Malley has referred. I suggest that the Minister consider this point because this section as drafted will be ludicrous if it goes through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, like other sections in the Bill, is inserted in its present form because of the barter that went on in the early days of the formation of the National Coalition Government.  At that time, when the Taoiseach was unable to fit Deputy Costello into a front bench seat and a ministerial post, quite an amount of bartering went on.  I believe, and it is commonly believed outside by those who have read the Bill, that the Government got the full support of many rebellious Deputies because of the concessions granted over and above the concessions granted to Deputies of the Opposition.  The addition here is a clear indication of the type of discrimination that went on.  Additional moneys are being made available over and above the amount prescribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is typical Coalition-type legislation that provides money for the boys. This is not the first time that this type of barter took place.  In the course of the last day or two the members of the public who have been in the Visitors' Gallery and those who have read the papers have become aware that this lopsided legislation is designed to ensure that additional sums of money will be made available to supporters of the Government.  This is to retain their support in Dáil Éireann.  The figures mentioned were the result of barter.  The Government were doubtful if they could retain the support of a very honourable, and, in many ways, hardworking Deputy. Now that he is full-time Attorney General he must find it difficult to deal with Dáil work.  A full-time <Col N="1895" /> politician must deal with Dáil work exclusively.  The position of Attorney General is full-time and therefore the occupant of the post would have no time for the ordinary work of the Dáil.  The additional money proposed is an attempt to pacify.  It is the result of the horse-trading that went on prior to the formation of the Government. This is the type of legislation that we will get in future where it is &ldquo;lolly&rdquo; for the boys at all costs.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister deign to comment on the suggestion that we have made in regard to the anomaly being created here and the suggestion about deleting the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the difficulty you run into there is that you end up in a situation in which the Attorney General, being a Member of the Seanad, gets a higher figure than a Minister who is a Member of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the remedy to provide, as we do in this section, that you can only appoint a Member of the Seanad as Attorney General if he is prepared to work for no salary at all?  That is the effect of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cure the Deputy is suggesting is one in which a Minister in the Seanad would receive less than the Attorney General.  If the Minister were in the Seanad and were to receive the equivalent of the Attorney General, his total salary would still be less than what he would get if he were in the Dáil.  On the other hand, he would receive, in respect of his ministerial responsibilities, in the Seanad, a salary in excess of what a Minister gets by way of ministerial salary for service in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>If in the case of a person holding the office he is not a Member of Dáil Éireann the sum of £7,213,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>would that not mean that if a Member of the Seanad were appointed the <Col N="1896" /> appropriate salary for him would be £7,213?  The Minister may say that you have to add to that the allowance he gets as a Member of the Seanad. Am I not right in thinking that there is provision in previous legislation to the effect that an Attorney General who is a Member of either House is not to be paid the allowance appropriate to his membership of that House?  What is the position of the present Attorney General under the law as it stands?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why can it not be provided that if he is from the Seanad he gets, say, £7,213, deemed to include his Seanad allowance?  My trouble with this section is, as Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, that it is deliberately legislated to ensure that no Taoiseach can appoint an Attorney General from the Seanad unless the Attorney General is prepared to work without any salary at all.  Would the Minister accept that that is the effect of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily because I would say that special <i>ad hoc</i> legislation could be passed but the remedy suggested would have this effect, that an Attorney General who is a Member of the Seanad would receive in respect of his office duties £5,190 while a Minister who is a Member of the Dáil would receive only £4,130.  That is the effect.  If the Attorney General in the Seanad gets £7,213 it would mean he would get his basic Seanad allowance of £2,023 plus £5,190 as the element of his ministerial office and that would put him above <Col N="1897" /> the ministerial salary of £4,430 and that would have an effect not only during his term of office but also in relation to his pension because his office pension would be higher than the office pension paid to a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>By providing that he would be paid the salary of a Minister but would lose his Seanad allowance, that would get over the pension problem but whatever anomaly arises surely no anomaly can be as bad as the one created by this section which effectively is legislating to say that no Taoiseach can appoint an Attorney General from the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is no need to appoint an Attorney General at the same time as the Government are appointed.  If it were deemed advisable on some occasion to take the Attorney General from the Seanad I would say that it would have to be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  There is no system, other than a radical total changing of the whole structure of pay for office holders which can get around this anomaly. We are now dealing with the situation as it is.  I accept the criticism.  It is one to which I was very much alive and every effort we made to cure one anomaly only seemed to generate another.  We are now dealing with the existing situation, the one that does as of now no injustice to anybody.  I would hope that when we get to the codification of the law that the Deputy referred to we will get back to the system of paying office holders a global sum rather than fragmenting it, which gives rise to trouble of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  It is much better to cure this in future legislation.  That is what we would propose to do.  I would say, without any disrespect, that if we had endeavoured to do it in this legislation we would have given further grounds for attack.  Seeing that there is enough meat for attack in it, I do not think that would have been a wise course to adopt.  I do not think you can any longer defend paying a Minister from the Seanad&mdash;it is rarely enough one comes from there&mdash;only £6,453 when Minister who are Members of the other House will be getting £7,846.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Balney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the thought expressed by the Minister is scarcely one which holds water in this particular case.  If a Member of this House is made Attorney General he gets an allowance appropriate to being a Member of this House and the duties that that imposes on him and in addition, an allowance as Attorney General. The two combined represents his overall salary which seems to me to be a fair enough way of dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>If we accept that membership of the Seanad and membership of the Dáil are quite different things as the differential in the allowances paid to Members of both Houses indicates why should that not be logically continued right into the case where a member of the Seanad becomes Attorney General? The figure of £6,453 would be the appropriate figure then.  This person would then be given an allowance for being Attorney General and an allowance as a Member of the Seanad.  This would give the holder of the office, if he was a Member of the Seanad, a figure less than that which a Member of this House would receive if he was Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> There is nothing at all inconsistent in that.  The matter should not be left in abeyance, waiting for the situation to arise and provision having to be made at some future date.  In section 8 the actual figure that the Member of the Seanad, when made Attorney General, may receive should be added. In fact, all we would have to do is to amend clause B by inserting the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; and deleting the words &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  That would mean that the Attorney General, if he was a Member of the Seanad, would receive his Seanad allowance and an allowance as Attorney General.  The figure of Member of the Seanad, would receive his Seanad allowance and an allowance as Attorney General.  The figure of £7,200 for the present holder of the office would be appropriate if such a holder of the office was a Member of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We should rectify the situation now and not leave it until the occasion arises because we would have to spend a number of days again trying to decide on the matter.  The amendment which I have suggested provides for all future occasions and covers any Members of the Oireachtas irrespective of which House he comes from. This would be a much wiser procedure rather than leaving the matter open-ended to be debated here at a future date.</P>

      <P>If we want to get rid of the anomaly that there is my suggestion is that we just insert that an Attorney General be paid the sum of £7,213 regardless of whether he is from outside of the House or inside the House.  If the Minister would find it too difficult to delete too many lines in this Bill I suggest that he insert instead of £4,430, £3,797 which would mean that the Attorney General would then be paid £7,213.  In my view that would get rid of all difficulties in relation to the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back over all the case we have made but all of the objections which we made in regard to the previous sections dealing with allowances for Deputies and Senators apply equally to this section. The amendment which I put down and which was, for technical reasons, ruled out of order urged that in this case the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, and the Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann, should be paid the sums as from the dates recommended in the Employer/ Labour Conference.  That is our stand in relation to this section.  The Employer/Labour Conference report should be implemented fully and without reservation in regard to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>However, in addition to that case which we have spelled out in considerable detail before, there is another matter and that is that this Government, quite contrary to all precedent, decided that it would grab the positions of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle for members of the parties constituting the Government.  We felt that at that time, and we still feel, and this is not to cast any reflection on either the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House, that the Government was not only grabbing all but was making a serious error in taking a long term view of the operations of this House, of the way it has operated in the past, of the approach to power sharing in this House and the efforts which have been made to ensure full support from all sides of the House for the Chair.  The Government took another view.  As far as we are concerned, for both of the reasons I have outlined, we are opposed to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather puzzled by the suggestion that there is any grabbing of the two positions of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle. There might have been some grabbing, perhaps, in a theoretical kind of way as far as the Leas-Cheann <Col N="1902" /> Comhairle's job was concerned. I do not mean that in any way as personal to the holder of the office of course, but surely it was purely a tactical operation by the Opposition which I, though no longer belonging to that party, had advocated as soon as the results of the election became known.  They would have been mad as a political party if they did not stand down their own man and thereby narrow the gap by a difference of one in having the Government of the day, as it was then emerging, compelled to choose from within their supporters a member to act as Ceann Comhairle.  Having passed that up, and just to set the record straight, I do not think it can be said that the second spot was grabbed and that the first spot was grabbed.  Rather, was it the first was declined by the Opposition for very good and sound tactical reasons and the Government, in their wisdom and, perhaps, slightly annoyed at the astuteness of the Opposition, standing by this tactic, decided that it suited their book too, to have the second spot, which they intended to have, as they intended to give the first spot to the Opposition, an offer which the Opposition declined. As I say, for the record, and to sort out my own puzzlement&mdash;I heard this assertion made yesterday as well in relation to this particular job&mdash;that is my recollection.  Fianna Fáil did not want it and indulged in a proper political tactic.  The Government had to fill it whether they liked it or not and the Government then were seeking the second spot; they were forced to take the first and they would not part with the second.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second post&mdash;again this is not raised as a particular personal matter&mdash;I would ask the Minister whether he considers the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House properly remunerated for the work he is obliged to do and the responsibility he carries in performing the function of his office as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, not to mention the fact that the Ceann Comhairle may, as has happened in the past to my knowledge, be absent for long periods and his duties <Col N="1903" /> and responsibilities have had to be undertaken by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  In my time in this House on two occasions the non-availability of the Ceann Comhairle through ill health created a situation over a long period in which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had to take over all the responsibilities vested in the Ceann Comhairle, but without the Ceann Comhairle's authority, may I say?  So far as I know no worthwhile recompense for these long stints standing in for the Ceann Comhairle was forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it must be very clear to the House and to the Minister that an allowance of £1,800, which is set down here as the appropriate new figure for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is not a proper allowance when compared with those of other office holders.  It does not even maintain the differential that existed.  I have not got the actual figures, but I am thinking of the differential as between Parliamentary Secretaries and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle up to the time this Bill was introduced.  Can anyone seriously contend that the office of Cathaoirleach in the Seanad is more onerous and carries more responsibility than does that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil? Can anybody seriously contend that the difference between the allowance to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be no greater than £600 more than the allowance for the Leas-Chathaoirleach in the Seanad?  Is there any real comparison between the functions these people are called on to perform?</P>
    <P>I am not now to be taken as in any way denigrating the functions of the Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I am merely making a comparison between their roles and their responsibilities in the Oireachtas in an effort to get across to the House the fact that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's job carries more responsibility, is more onerous and more time consuming than are the offices in the Seanad.  He has many functions to perform apart from those appertaining to this House.  He has to act as chairman of various committees. He has got to be in attendance here <Col N="1904" /> every day the House sits.  He cannot absent himself from the House for any prolonged period.  He must occupy the Chair at stated intervals and for stated periods.  I do not think he is being properly remunerated for the work he does and the time he gives in comparison with other office holders.  Everybody should realise this.</P>
    <P>Again, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle must fight to retain his seat in the House.  The Ceann Comhairle is automatically re-elected.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle must keep a political organisation going in order to return himself to the next Dáil.  He has no free passage into the new Dáil.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle suffers quite a number of disabilities so far as political organisational activity is concerned and there is no recognition of this fact. In addition to what the Ceann Comhairle carries, he has to try to ensure by his political activities in his constituency between elections that he will get back to the following Dáil.  This has not been given sufficient congnisance in assessing what is fair and just for the holder of that office.  I can see no reason why the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle should not have the same relationship to a Parliamentary Secretary as the Ceann Comhairle has to a Minister, in other words, that that allowance should be £2,800 instead of £1,800.  I think there is a very strong case for the revision of the allowance in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any need for me&mdash;and I do not mean this disrespectfully&mdash;to reply to Deputy Colley, because he has acknowledged he has made the same point five or six times throughout the debate, so I mean him no discourtesy in not replying to him again. I would endorse what Deputy Blaney has said in regard to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and we can speak of the office without regard to the person that is in it, Sir, so I am sure you will understand it is in that sense we are discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the decision the Government took was to apply the rates as recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference.  There may be argument about the commencement date. <Col N="1905" /> We believe we are right; others believe they are right, but the rates are not in dispute.  There were a number of cases in which the Employer/Labour Conference struck a rate below that of the Devlin report, and there were some cases, which we would not like to criticise although we might have some doubts about their wisdom, in which they allocated a figure higher than that recommended by Devlin.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me that one of the cases in which they rather unfairly diminished the Devlin award was in relation to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The Devlin award for the remuneration of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, which, of course, would be additional to his Dáil salary, was £2,560.  The figure recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference was £1,898, a reduction of £662.  I think the duties of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle have been undervalued, not only in periods of illness or absence on official engagements when the Ceann Comhairle might not be available but also in relation to the fact that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is called in regularly for consultations and exchanges of views on matters when the Dáil is not sitting.  When the Dáil is sitting his hours in the Chair here are, I am sure, in many cases far in excess of the numbers of hours for which many of the judiciary would sit. I think it is no reflection on the House to say it must be difficult at times to sit in the Chair and keep fully alive to all the proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to all the obligations of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and indeed, of the Ceann Comhairle, I consider the awards made of them, and to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in particular, are less than the duties of their office deserve. However, it is only one of the innumerable matters that have to be considered by the Members of this House.  As we pass this Bill I would hope it will not be regarded as a final determination of what should be the appropriate remuneration and facilities for office holders and Members in <Col N="1906" /> this House, if the House is to be brought up to the pitch of efficiency which it needs to be, which it is working very far below at the present time.  But we must observe the common pattern in relation to the improvements of remuneration in this Bill, and that pattern is the scale of awards given by the Employer/Labour Conference.  I would hope the view expressed by Deputy Blaney will be re-echoed at an appropriate time through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and elsewhere by all Members of the House, so that these anomalies&mdash;to use that great in-word&mdash;can be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister talk about a pattern to which we must conform, when in the next section we are going to step into the unknown in so far as the Employer/Labour Conference is concerned.  I do not want to indulge in point-scoring against anybody but sometimes we make moves to confine ourselves when it is convenient. If we accept the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference as a pattern, then we should have that pattern all the way through in relation to remuneration, whether it be by way of allowances for secretarial or research work, or else we should feel free if the House thinks fit, and I believe the House would so thing fit in this case&mdash;to change that figure upwards.  With no disrespect to the Employer/Labour Conference, I doubt very much if the responsibilities of the various office holders, the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach and Leas-Cathaoirleach, of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, were known in detail to the Employer/Labour Conference.  The fact that they reduced the Devlin recommendation by such a substantial <Col N="1907" /> percentage seems to indicate that they were not alive to the onerous responsibilities of the holders of this office. Since we are proceeding to depart from the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations, whether it is by way of the Minister's own proposals for allowances to the Opposition or to Deputies for secretarial assistance and research or by way of Opposition amendments, there is justification for breaking with the pattern referred to by the Minister.  As I say, the next section, certainly the provision two sections down, breaks entirely with the concept of there being a pattern which, for the pattern's sake, he should follow, and, which in the case of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, does an injustice to the holders of that office by virtue of sticking to the pattern.  There is nothing sacrosanct or sacred about the pattern.  I believe that this recommendation was made, and such a large cut was made in the Devlin figure, because of a lack of information.  We are not sticking to the pattern from section II onwards and, therefore, the merit of keeping to the pattern has already disappeared.</P>
      <P>I think the House generally will concede that we are not being fair to the office of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We should make an exception in this case, realising that we mean no disrespect to those who made this recommendation, but with a fuller appreciation of the responsibilities that attend upon the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points.  I do not want to engage in controversy but for the record, as Deputy Blaney said, he will recall that there have been occasions in the past when the Ceann Comhairle has come from the Opposition party, and there have been occasions when the Ceann Comhairle has come from the Government ranks.  There has never been an occasion, until this Government came into office, when both the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle came from parties forming the Government, parties supplying Members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> This is the first time this has happened. That is the point I was making. However, I do not want to pursue that.  I just want to make the point for the record.</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to advert to is this.  I think Deputy Blaney is under a misapprehension about the Employer/Labour Conference report but, much more seriously, I think the Minister is under a misapprehension about it.  In the discussion on a previous section the Minister made a reference which I intended to pursue but I let it go.  He made a similar kind of reference in replying to Deputy Blaney.  At the moment I cannot recall his exact words, but the gist of his reference was that it seemed unfortunate that the Employer/Labour Conference had downgraded in some way the recommendations of Devlin.</P>
    <P>This is a misconception of the role of the Employer/Labour Conference and what was behind their report. With your permission, Sir, I should like to quote from the Employer/ Labour Conference report at page 2. First they give their terms of reference. They say:</P>
    <P>We were given the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To advise in relation to the extent to which effect might be given to the Review Body's recommendations for each group covered in the report on the basis of, and for the duration of, the National Agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As we see our task, we are not called upon to advise on whether we consider the current salaries or the salaries recommended by the Review Body to be fair and reasonable in relation to the duties and responsibilities of the posts and occupations in question.  The Review Body were required by their terms of reference to report on the levels of pay for the different groups and they reached their conclusions by the application of various criteria, including comparability and relativities and their assessment of the levels of responsibility. Our terms of reference are <Col N="1909" /> different.  We are not concerned with levels of pay, but rather with what increases in pay are justifiable during the currency and in the context of the National Agreements. Our conclusions, therefore, take no account of the adequacy or otherwise of the levels of pay which may emerge from the application of these increases.</P>
    <P>In all fairness to the Employer/ Labour Conference that should be put on the record of this House.  The seriousness of this, in my opinion, is that the Minister has seemed to me, from what he said just now and what he said previously, to be under a misapprehension about the whole purpose of the Employer/Labour Conference report.  It may well be that, if he was under that misapprehension, it may explain his approach and why he does not seem to appreciate the reason we have taken the approach we have taken.  I would suggest that, if he considers what I have just quoted, he will see, in the context of a report which confined itself solely to determining what should be the scale of pay in any particular position having regard to wage rounds and the terms of the national wage agreements, and without any regard to what was the appropriate rate of pay initially, and having regard to the responsibilities of the job, why it is regarded as being so serious, and such a serious breach of the recommendations not to implement them in full.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference were based on a completely different concept from Devlin.  I do not disagree necessarily with the case made by Deputy Blaney as regards the position of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Employer/ Labour Conference report did not have regard to the level of responsibility or the duties of the position of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It was solely concerned with starting with the base and applying national wage rounds and national agreements.  The answer they came up with was what should be paid at different dates and what should be paid today.  That is exactly what the report did.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what the Minister said that he was under a misapprehension <Col N="1910" /> about the purpose of the Employer/Labour Conference report when he referred to it as in some way downgrading the recommendations of Devlin and in other cases, perhaps, going too high.  It seemed to me that the Minister was under a misapprehension in regard to the purpose of the Employer/ Labour Conference.  I suggest that it is possible that that misapprehension may be the explanation for many of the difficulties we had in this debate on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about the money involved, but the principle.  To my mind this is a complete violation of the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendations as were other sections of this Bill. Subsection (2) of section 6 provides:</P>
      <P>This section and sections 8, 9 and 10 of this Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of July, 1973.</P>
      <P>The Minister is creating a situation now which can involve thousands of trade unionists and workers in the Government services and elsewhere. He is indicating in the terms of this Bill that retrospection will not apply. I wonder if a recommendation was made for phased increases for workers in Government services in the same manner and from the same dates as the recommendations in the Employer/Labour Conference report on the allowances to the various people affected by this Bill, how would the Minister react?  Does this mean, in effect, that he would see that no retrospection applied to workers in the Government services?</P>

The Minister has indicated his desire to keep in line with these recommendations and to ensure that there is no breach of the National Pay Agreement.  The Minister has gone outside the terms of the National Pay Agreement in so far as the phased increases apply to this and other sections. This is a broad warning to <Col N="1911" /> workers that the Government feel that no retrospection should apply. Workers in the Government service, in trade unions and elsewhere, will examine this in a very critical way in relation to retrospection when it becomes an Act.</P>

If a Government Minister fails to honour the recommendations of the Employer/ Labour Conference in relation to one section of workers it will be looked at in a very critical way.  It is the thin end of the wedge to ensure that there will be no retrospection paid to workers in the Government service or elsewhere. It will cause great problems and create quite an amount of industrial unrest when people see a Minister disregarding the Employer/Labour Conference and, by implication, indicating that what they recommended is of no importance. If this is to be the basis of wage negotiations, a serious situation will develop.  Prompt action will be taken to ensure prompt payments because any delay will be so serious.  This precedent will have wide ranging repercussions. When it is examined in detail I hope the trade union element who have not been very active here today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney has made some very valid points that are worth considering.  I approach the matter before us on the basis that the section is a violation of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations. I take it that it is in order to pursue it on that basis without mentioning retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the national pay agreement is one that we all wish to safeguard in full but this section, as is the case in other sections of the Bill, is creating a situation whereby the Minister for Finance can violate the recommendations of the Employer/ Labour Conference.  I wonder how the Minister would react if other people in the State services put forward recommendations that have been made on their behalf by the Employer/ Labour Conference.  Would he adopt the same attitude in relation to, for instance, Board of Works or Department of Defence employees as he is adopting on this issue?  This is a serious breach by the Minister of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations and one that will have serious repercussions throughout the country.  Also, it is a disturbing factor for many workers in the State service because it is a clear indication <Col N="1915" /> that the Minister will deal with future increases only from the date on which increased social welfare payments come into operation.  This is a serious situation because salaries and wages of other groups are dealt with on a very different basis from that of social welfare payments.  Therefore, the Minister's suggestion in this regard is not logical.</P>
    <P>I note that no member of the Labour Party has been in the House for some time.  Apparently none of them considered it worthwhile to come here and discuss this very serious matter of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations being disregarded by the Minister.  Even at this late stage I ask the Minister to consider seriously implementing those recommendations in full.</P>

      <P>One would have expected the Labour Party to have voiced their opinion in regard to this breach of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations and to give their support to those Deputies who are concerned as to the protection of the national wage agreement.  This is creating a precedent that will be grasped by many employers.  Where phased increases and retrospection are indicated, the employer will be in a position to state that a Minister has violated the Employer/Labour Conference recommendation in relation to the salaries that would be applied to the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  This type of treatment of the Members of this House, particularly the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle who have a difficult job to do, is serious indeed. The principle involved is one that we cannot laugh loudly at.  No doubt Deputy Bruton can laugh at people who may be trampled upon by employers and, indeed, by the Minister in relation to State services.  This is a <Col N="1916" /> vicious Bill, designed to break the Employer/Labour Conference recommendation. Members of the Fine Gael Party may laugh at this breach.  There is nothing funny in this breach.  It may lead to widespread industrial unrest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that it was pressure from the employers on the other side that brought about this situation, that the Minister is being asked to breach the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations.  This is a serious matter.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider implementing in full the terms of the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendation and thus safeguard the current national wage agreement and those that may be made in future.</P>
      <P>The Minister is making it difficult for negotiators in future to arrive at an agreement.  He is making it easy for employers to create a situation where retrospection would be terminated at a particular date, where phased increases or phased involvement would be eliminated.  This is very serious.</P>
      <P>Again, I would point out that there is not a single member of the Labour Party in the House.  This is a clear indication of their complete disregard for what they have been so loud in condemning in the past.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 9 I would say if Deputy McMahon's contribution is to say: &ldquo;You were not here this morning&rdquo; I say that is not what we are discussing.  We are discussing section 9 of the Bill.  I challenge Deputy McMahon to make his contribution in support of the breach of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendation. I challenge Deputy Bruton, the man who has been laughing so heartily in the House at the breach of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations, to stand up and defend it.  We know that the big employers on the opposite side of the House have pressurised the weakling of a Minister into breaching the recommendations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night and even today the Minister made many references to the national wage agreement and to the recommendations of the Employer/ Labour Conference.  This was purely for the purpose of the Press and his statements were reported in some of the papers in such a way as to give a very erroneous slant to them.  What the Minister is doing is violating the recommendations that have been made.  Is there any reason why we should send to the Employer/Labour Conference for recommendations if when we get them we violate them?  The Minister has indicated that he wants to keep in line with the recommendations.  This is untrue because the breaches are obvious <Col N="1918" /> and they have created a precedent that the Minister and the Government may well regret in the days to come because I am quite certain that the workers and the trade union officials who are not hog-tied&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy please try to relate his remarks to section 9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to that section I am quite certain that when trade union officials and the people outside who are members of the Labour Party examine section 9 and the other sections in depth and see how the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations were violated they will be angry.  When they examine them further they will find that their colleagues have been bought over at a price that has been named in various sections of this Bill.  We will deal with those sections later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very perturbed that the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle are treated in this shabby way by the Minister for Finance.  I hope the Minister for Finance will mend his ways before the Bill goes through and will ensure that the office holders concerned will get increases in accordance with the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendations. I hope the current national wage agreement and future agreements will not be put in jeopardy as a result of this jackboot activity by the Minister for Finance.  Jackboot activity it is as we read this section with the other sections.  I hope the Minister will clearly indicate how he will treat workers in Government services, for instance, those employed by the Office of Public Works, the Department of Defence and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as postmen or otherwise. If the same type of recommendation were to come to him in respect of them would he deal with it in the same way?  Would he eliminate the phased increases that have been suggested and so violate the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendation? He is setting a precedent now.  He is arming employers, particularly unscrupulous employers, with an argument <Col N="1919" /> that can have very serious repercussions on the workers and trade unionists of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Repetition is necessary in order to ensure that the Minister fully understands where he stands in relation to the Employer/Labour Conference.  If I succeed in getting him to understand that position, then the repetition will be well worthwhile.  I hope that when I sit down other Deputies will give their views on the obvious breaches on the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendations. The Minister cannot have it both ways. He is either fully in favour of implementing these recommendations or he is not.  On this occasion he has decided to violate this particular recommendation.</P>
      <P>At this late stage I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider the situation in relation to the salaries payable to the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  In conclusion I should like to express my regret that the Labour Party Members have not yet shown up and have given no indication of how they feel about the Minister's proposals.  They have done nothing to let the Minister see in public that they have sympathy for this particular breach.  By their actions in the division lobbies they indicated that they will condone any type of tactic, any type of approach, any breach of agreement whatsoever, as long as it is done on a political basis and recompense is made elsewhere to satisfy them personally, and them alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney, when speaking on this section made reference to the annual allowance that is paid to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, £1,898, and to the responsibility, and the time consuming activity of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and, of <Col N="1920" /> course, to the Ceann Comhairle.  A comparison was drawn between the figure for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and that for a Parliamentary Secretary and it was pointed out that it was somewhere in the region of £1,000 less. All of us who have had quite a deal of recourse to the House will appreciate the fact that there is the comparison in ways between the responsibilities of one <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance will tell us that he must abide by the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference in this regard.  Deputy Colley has drawn attention to the terms of reference in this but I think that, arising from the discussion we have had on this matter, it appears that the Minister is acting a little less than generously in regard to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We can assume that in relation to all sections but he is acting a little less than fairly as far as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is because of that that I feel the Minister might, at this stage, reconsider the position.  The Minister has conceded that with the volume of responsibility which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has he would consider that he was entitled to a greater remuneration. He has an opportunity here. I am aware that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle himself has mentioned that the backdating of the allowance previous to 1st July has been dealt and finished with under previous sections but it does apply to sections 8, 9 and 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister consider the possibility of making that specific allowance retrospective.  That would appear to be unfair to the other people covered in sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 but as against that I think that the Minister for Finance would be able to get over that problem because he would know that by making this particular section retrospective he would not be doing something that would hand anything to Members of the Opposition.  From that point of view this suggestion might appeal to him. To make sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 retrospective might be of some benefit to members of Fianna Fáil but the <Col N="1921" /> making of section 9 retrospective will not be of any benefit to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be tempted, for that reason, to do justice and to accept the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference.  This is why I rose to suggest that in order to be fair to the two office holders concerned in this specific section he should introduce the element of retrospectiveness.  Naturally, if he was to do this it would be likely that he could be prevailed upon to introduce it also in connection with section 10 but that is a matter which can be, and will be, discussed when we deal with that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Lalor would not be setting a trap, or wish to.  I accept the generosity of his offer and the remarks of Deputy Blaney.  I think they were well justified and I think they reflect the view of this House regarding the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It would seem to me that the way to meet this is not with regard to the past but, if the Opposition were prepared to indicate an increase in the figure of £1,898, then it would apply to the future.  In that way the justice that people have seen has not been done could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of £1,898 was the Employer/Labour Conference figure and we have abided by those figures. <Col N="1922" /> The Devlin figure was £2,560.  It may be that there may be some difficulties in doing this but I think that all sides of the House agree that it is a matter that should be looked at in the not too distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

      <P>The Deputy will probably appreciate that I am standing in for the Minister for Finance at somewhat short notice and therefore cannot fully expect to do justice to this argument in this matter. The argument is reasonably clear. It is in line with the thinking of other passages in the Bill providing for increases by order.  This is the application in particular instances of this principle of increases by order which has already been discussed here.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that what the Minister says is correct.  The proposal is in line with other proposals in the Bill.  What I am endeavouring to ascertain is how this amendment has that effect.  It purports to insert in section 11 an additional provision on the lines of that set out in section 11.  The Minister will appreciate that I am now trying to interpret this in the light of section 10 of the Principal Act which provides for the payment of an annual allowance to the Leader of the second party and the Leader of the third party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said he is having difficulty in explaining this because he has been asked to take it at short notice.  Amendment No. 5 adds paragraph <Col N="1927" /> (g) to section 11.  It says that an annual sum will be payable pursuant to section 10 of this Act.  That is section 10 of the Principal Act.  There is provision in the section itself for the Government whenever they see fit to increase the annual sum payable to the Taoiseach, to the other members of the Government, to the Parliamentary Secretaries, to the Attorney General, to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Dáil, and to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Seanad.  We are now adding an annual sum payable pursuant to section 10 of the Act.  In this context I presume that is section 10 of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>To get our lines cleared at this stage, now that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has had time to get section 10 of the Principal Act, I wonder if he could clear up this issue for us.  Can he tell us whether the purpose of the amendment is clearly to enable the Government by order to increase the ordinary Deputy's allowance, because everybody else seems to be covered here, and the allowance to the Leader of the Opposition Party and, I presume, the backbenchers of the Government parties? We are most anxious to ensure that this amendment does what it appears to do.  Originally the Minister completely overlooked any allowance for the Opposition party for research.  I am anxious to know if paragraph (g) covers the remuneration of Deputies and the party allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Colley's request perhaps I might recapitulate.  This amendment enables the Government whenever they so think fit to increase the allowances for secretarial expenses <i>et cetera</i> to Leaders of the Government and <Col N="1928" /> Opposition parties by order.  This provision corresponds to that already in the Bill providing for increases by order of the Government in the allowances for Deputies and Senators and in the salaries of Ministers and Parliamentary office holders.  That is what I said.</P>
      <P>If any Deputy opposite has been somewhat confused about what this reference to section 10 means, I must freely confess that I was equally confused until it was cleared up for me. The reference to section 10 of this Act is to section 10 of the Principal Act, as about to be amended, by section 13 of the Bill before you.  If you look at section 13 you will see it sets out in great detail the annual sums to be paid to the Leader of each qualifying party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

May I take it that amendment No. 7, if enacted, will include the allowances, in the present stage of the parties in the Dáil, to the Leader of Fianna Fáil, the Leader of Fine Gael and the Leader of the Labour party and that the effect of this amendment will be to enable the Government as appropriate, by order, to increase the allowances payable to the Leaders of each of the three parties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What puzzles me in the arrangement of these amendments, <Col N="1929" /> as, indeed, has puzzled me in some earlier parts of the Bill, is this matter of predetermining, by amendment or otherwise, what is to come later in the Bill which has not yet been discussed or decided.  From the point of view of your interpretation of the rules of the House, including the rules of the debate, I wonder whether this is not an inhibiting device in the sense that section 7 of the Bill is agreed and as a result of the agreement we included the last clause which reads: &ldquo;This section and sections 8, 9 and 10 of this Act shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st day of July, 1973.&rdquo;  Fair enough, except that sections 8, 9 and 10 have not yet been arrived at nor have they been seen in their final form since all three have to be discussed, agreed, amended or deleted as the case may be.  Properly that clause at the end of section 7 should have come at the end of section 10, and in that way it would be no inhibition to the debate in this House. It would be no inhibition if it had come at the end of the last section rather than at the end of the first section.</P>
      <P>In this amendment we have something of the same nature and I am at a loss to know how we can properly determine the terms of any amendment that has a binding effect predetermining what is to come after it and if it has not got the force or predetermination of what comes after, what is the purpose of having it there at this juncture in the Bill?  Surely there must be a more appropriate place for this than where it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in the wrong place and if we agree on it we may preclude ourselves from taking the necessary and appropriate action on the sections which follow which it is set to govern.  Even if the intention can be carried through what I want to get on the record is that the allowances that may be payable, depending on what is agreed on a later section, the manner on how they may be computed, the amounts that may be arrived at by whatever computation is used, whether it is the Government's formula or the formula of the Opposition, all of it <Col N="1930" /> heads in the one direction and that is to aid financially all Deputies, on all sides, in Government and in Opposition, to do their work the better by providing through this money secretarial assistance and, perhaps, research officers as well.  I said &ldquo;all&rdquo; with two exceptions. The two Independent Deputies in this House are not included in either the Government's thinking or the thinking of the Opposition.  While I could and might yet make a very full and comprehensive case as to why these allowances should be paid in respect of Deputies of various parties, including the Government parties, the whole basis of that argument would be and must be based on the need for such assistance.  The bigger the party the more they find it impossible, with their collective resources to provide themselves with secretarial assistance and research facilities; how, then, does it appear to all the members of those parties that it should be possible for an Independent or a group of Independents to provide themselves with any useful information by way of research or provide any secretarial assistance except at extreme cost?  I am not seeking money for this particular chore but I do think the manner in which Deputy Sheridan and myself are being ignored and omitted is a negation and a complete contradiction of all the claims that all the parties can make, have made and will make, as to why they should get allowances to provide secretarial assistance and research facilities.</P>
    <P>Either those arguments are true and if true those allowances are justified; if they are true and are justified then they are justified one hundred times more for the individuals in this House than for the parties, and the bigger the party the less the justification. I do not think the House can dispose of this whether by agreement or otherwise without having a thought about whether they are genuinely concerned about the input Deputies may be capable of making in this House aided by research and secretarial assistance as a result of the provision of public moneys to help them to do so.  If they ignore those who belong to no party in this House then I make them a present of whatever <Col N="1931" /> the House may decide in its wisdom to grant by way of allowance to each of the Leaders of the parties.  If we are to have the case made on the basis of need and of the usefulness if this need were fulfilled they cannot ignore the most extreme examples in the House, namely Deputy Sheridan and myself, as the people who most need this and are least capable of providing it because our number is two, not 52, not 42, not 32, or 22, just two.  If the big parties require money, including the Government parties with all the assistance that being in Government can bring in its various ways to the backbenchers of the parties composing it, and if the Fianna Fáil Party with their 68 members need money to provide the information that will make them more useful members of this House, and if there is no proper provision made for the two Independents&mdash;as the position is at present but may not always be so&mdash;then it is a hollow, contradictory operation on the part of the majority of the Members of this House.  They cannot have it both ways.  They either provide for those in the most vulnerable position and if they do not concede that, they cannot honestly make an argument that the bigger groupings require this money in order that they may be able to do it.  If it is conceded that it is correct and just that provision should only be made for organised parties you are saying that though we were all elected by the electors of our various constituencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be able to assist what the Deputy wishes to achieve even if it does not conform with the principle that he is enunciating.  I intended suggesting that it would be better if we took amendments Nos. 6 and 7 together and, indeed, No. 9 also.  Strictly speaking perhaps they should not be taken together but it is clear that to discuss them separately would involve repetition of argument. If Deputy Blaney agrees, perhaps we could take together those amendments suggested by the Chair&mdash;Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 9 and then the Deputy would be in order in what he is saying.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense that takes me back to where I came in, that is, to the first point I was making which was the arrangement of sections or amendments in a way that seemed to predetermine what follows.  This amendment should be numbered 9 instead of 5, and so on.  However, since all four are being taken together and not having available to me the research facilities that are available to the larger parties, I must desist at this stage in order that I may consider to a greater extent what is contained <Col N="1933" /> in the following three amendments. What I have been saying is that, without making any plea whatever on behalf of either my colleague, Deputy Sheridan, or myself, or for any other Deputy of the future who may belong to a group that is not on the register of political parties in this House, are we to take it that although we are elected in no less a manner than any other Member of this House, that our rights and our privileges here should be less?</P>
      <P>I assert that what is now proposed, although it may be based on a precedent of the past, is a denial of the rights of individual Members who do not conform to the procedure laid down in relation to the registration of parties or who, even if of a party, are not sufficient in number for the purposes of these allowances.  If the proposed increased allowances in respect of research and secretarial assistance are justified, they must be justified in respect of every Member and not merely be facilities afforded to party leaders for the benefit of party members in carrying out their work.  It would not be right if, indeed, it were constitutional, for this House to provide for assistance only to some members. That would be a denial of the rights of individual Deputies regardless of the extent of the majority by which the provision might be enacted. Even if the provision were to be agreed to on this occasion by the two Independents, it would not mean that it was right.  There is a case to be made for the provision of extra financial help in respect of research and of secretarial help for each party but there must be equal treatment. The fact that the anomaly existed in the past is no reason why it should continue in the future.  Neither is the fact that in the past there have been parties of a certain size only on the register any case for continuing the discrimination in respect of individual Deputies.  I can see the difficulties involved in implementing what I suggest but neither the formula suggested by Fianna Fáil nor that suggested by the Government is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing in substance with these amendments <Col N="1934" /> which I propose to do later after I have given the Minister an opportunity to reply to Deputy Blaney, I wish to make it clear that so far as this party are concerned we agree with what Deputy Blaney has been saying but I would remind the Deputy that our stance on this matter has been, consistently, that for many years there has been an allowance for the Opposition and that we distinguish sharply between that and the proposal which the Government have now to provide an allowance in respect of secretarial assistance to all Deputies in the House, subject to the qualification that Deputy Blaney has pointed out.</P>
      <P>Our attitude is that the allowance to the Opposition which has been in existence should continue to be in existence and should be appropriately increased and that there is a good case to be made for the provision of secretarial assistance either directly or by way of an allowance to enable it to be provided for all Deputies.</P>
      <P>We believe that the proposals put forward by the Government in this regard are defective from a number of points of view.  One of the points in which we think they are defective and that they were rushed in is precisely the one made by Deputy Blaney.  We do not think it is correct that if there is to be a new arrangement, a new allowance for secretarial assistance on both sides of the House, any Deputy should be excluded.  Deputy Blaney is talking about the present situation in which he and Deputy Sheridan are the only non-party Members of the House and I think he is right to make that case.  Nevertheless, under the amendments as they are before the House we could have a situation in the future in which there could be a party consisting of six Deputies.  Indeed, we have had in the past a party with a smaller number than six Deputies.  Under the amendments proposed by the Government such parties and such Deputies would not benefit.  We think this is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that there is a clear distinction to be made between what is known as the Opposition allowance <Col N="1935" /> and the new proposals the Government have here.  If one approaches it on that basis, which we think is the right basis in principle, one sees very clearly the injustice which is involved in the Government's proposals as pointed out by Deputy Blaney and as I have tried to point out, which could arise in a future situation and where the example might be even more glaring of a party of six Members who would not benefit in any way by these proposals.  It would seem to me that if they have any sense at all the proposals should be directed to providing assistance for every Deputy, no matter on what side he sits.  I am making that point now because I want to make it clear that as far as we are concerned we agree with the point made by Deputy Blaney and it is one of the grounds&mdash;by no means the only one&mdash; for our objection to the proposals contained in the Government's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the statements which have just been made, I think Deputy Blaney made two important points.  One was more or less technical and procedural and based on the question of the propriety of passing an amendment to a section which has yet to be carried.  The point is well taken and should be taken into account in consideration of the drafting of any future legislation here.</P>
      <P>We are coming to the end of the session.  This measure is felt on both sides of the House to have a certain amount of urgency.  Some imperfections which I would accept exist, have to be condoned if we wish this legislation to pass, if we do not simply intend to protract our present session or postpone this measure until the next session.  I do not think any of us really wants to do those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would regard the technical passage of Deputy Blaney's statement as admonitory and I think the admonition is good and well-founded.  On the second point he made concerning the two Independent Deputies here, I personally cannot speak here for the Minister for Finance on this point; I can only speak a little personally here <Col N="1936" /> when I say that I think it is well-founded and will convey it to the Minister for Finance with that view.</P>
    <P>I would say both in relation to what Deputy Blaney said and what Deputy Colley said that this measure is not intended to be a final and totally correct solution of the whole complex problem which I would remind all Deputies has been somewhat neglected in the past.  I am not about to say that the present Opposition always neglected it.  I think in 1968 they took a far-sighted and magnanimous measure in this respect.  For some years past it has been neglected and I think this is catching up on some of this.</P>
    <P>These amendments and this Bill are a sensible measure of justice for the improvement of the efficiency of Parliament.  They have their imperfections and Deputies opposite, and Deputy Blaney, acted rightly in drawing attention to the imperfections but we on this side of the House regard both the amendments and this Bill as being honestly framed as a contribution to a step in the right direction.  We would all welcome in future the assistance of everybody in the House and I would hope in future at some time when we are not at the ragged end of a session, with more consensus than we have had hitherto, we may plane away the uneven parts and try to do justice both to everybody in the House and to those whom we represent.  Therefore, I am not commending the amendments or the Bill to the House as a final settlement but as steps that need to be taken now and which I hope we may be able to take this evening.</P>

      <P>Before I make the substantive contribution I want to be clear on this.  I appreciate the position of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs sitting in for the Minister for Finance.  I appreciate that there are certain difficulties which face him in that position.  Nevertheless, I am sure he will appreciate our point of view if at this stage we find ourselves in the position that the Minister who is dealing with the Bill expresses a certain amount of sympathy with the view we express but, if I understood him right, also indicates <Col N="1937" /> that, no matter how convincing the arguments we put forward, he does not think he will find himself in a position to agree to changes.  I am not sure if I am not going too far when I say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right.  At this stage, sitting in for a colleague, I obviously cannot agree to changes in this measure. What I can agree to is to convey to my colleague and the Government to which I belong the substance of what has been said, my own views about what has been reasonable in what has been said and to repeat that this Bill and these amendments are part of an ongoing process, not a final thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the Minister will appreciate that from our point of view it is a thoroughly unsatisfactory situation that we should debate at some length these complicated amendments and make what we believe to be valid points, but all the time in the knowledge that no matter what we say and no matter how convincing we are to the Minister representing the Government in the House at the moment, it will make no difference.</P>

      <P>Not now.  It is this Bill we are dealing with.  I am making a suggestion which is not in any way intended to create difficulties but rather to try to be helpful.  I wonder would the Minister consider some short adjournment of the House at the moment.  Perhaps on this side of the House we could avail ourselves of the adjournment and it might also give the Minister for Finance an opportunity to come back later, when we can deal with these amendments. Our position is really quite unsatisfactory in the present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the spirit and the substance of what Deputy Colley has said but the Government's position essentially is that these are amendments, this is the Bill, and this is what we are putting to this House now.  We are rather late in the process of discussion here and I am afraid I <Col N="1938" /> do not find myself in the position where I can agree, on behalf of the Government, to an adjournment, or recess which might suggest a willingness to accept amendments.  I have no reason to believe that we are prepared to accept amendments at this time.</P>
      <P>It is late and we may find ourselves sitting very late tonight but there have been opportunities for discussion when it might have been hoped that agreement could be reached on the Bill.  I do not think that we are going to be able to reach the kind of agreement on further amendments that Deputy Colley has in mind on this Bill now. The point I am trying to make is that we regard this as a measure of justice and efficiency, a step in the right direction, a reinforcement of the basis of Parliament but it is not final.</P>
      <P>There will be more to be done and I hope that more can be done in the next session with the agreement of the Opposition.  I hope that we may work out, and perfect in the future, a process of consultation in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all because I am new here and whether the salaries of Deputies are important or not I would not know.  To me this is the most important section of the Bill and for this reason I think that the suggestion of Deputy Colley has a lot of reason.  The section of a Bill which gives an allowance to an Opposition to do research in this day and age when we are a part of Europe is the most important part of any legislation of this type.  To me a Government is as good as the Opposition but the Government have everything at their disposal to carry out such research.  The Opposition have no such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement of Deputy Blaney to me is plain honest justice.  It is the first time, I understand, that an allowance is to be given to Deputies.  Personally, I do not think that we could get away with the excuse tonight, if we pass this, that, just because we were in a hurry, we could exclude two Deputies from an allowance for secretarial and research work.  I do not see why the two Independent Deputies should not get an allowance just as the backbenchers <Col N="1939" /> on the Government side and the Opposition will receive an allowance.</P>
    <P>This allowance is very important because the ordinary Member of this House is not in touch with the everyday happenings in the European Parliament.  It is most important that every Deputy in this House should know what is going on in Europe.  He cannot do that type of research without having some kind of framework to do it.</P>
    <P>That is what the Opposition allowance, and the allowance for the Government backbenchers, is meant to be for.  It should equally apply to the two Independent Deputies.  I feel that there should be a short adjournment to enable both sides of the House to reach agreement on this matter.  If this allowance is passed now it will mean that individual Deputies will have an allowance and the Independent Deputies will be excluded.  At the outset, it was understood that an allowance was being provided for the purpose of establishing a secretarial and research organisation to help the Opposition in contributing to debates of the House. This is a most important section because I believe that the Treaty of Rome, as it was framed, will be outdated in about four years now that the Community consists of nine countries.</P>
    <P>If we are not well versed about what is in progress in Europe we cannot play our part to build up Europe and obtain what we expect to get from our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course these amendments do not provide allowances for Deputies.  These amendments provide allowances for the Opposition.  This situation existed for a number of years but this section goes further and says that certain sums will be given to the Leader of the parties in Government.  This is a new feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this side of the House we want to make it clear that this is what used to be the Opposition allowance. In so far as the Government parties <Col N="1940" /> are concerned it can be, and may well be, an allowance to individual Deputies.  I am sure that with the leaders and other members of each of the two parties occupying positions of Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, and having the resources of the Civil Service in their own Departments at their disposal, they will not, and should not, and I am sure cannot, avail of the £9,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure also that these people will not be used to get the benefit of a higher category.  The amount of the allowance graduates upwards as the number in each party increases and for this reason I hope that the Taoiseach, and other members of the Government, are not thrown in for the purpose of getting a higher Government allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that this is a Government allowance, an allowance to Government parties.  It is a new feature in view of the fact that what was up to now an Opposition allowance has suddenly become a Government Party allowance.  Therefore, I presume that seeing that there is no need for research, for central office or any of the facilities which are freely available in large measure in each of the Departments of State to the Leaders of these parties and to the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, the Leaders of those parties can say: &ldquo;There is a sum of £5,000, divide that among our 20 Deputies.&rdquo;  Each one of the Deputies can have access to a portion of this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is still an Opposition allowance for the Opposition but for the Government backbenchers it is a hidden increase in salary and, therefore, a contravention of the national wage agreement, a contravention of the suggestions of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations to the Government.  I feel very strongly about this point because the Minister did not implement the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations <Col N="1941" /> although he says he is implementing them to the letter.  As well as that, he goes outside of that and gives a hidden increase to Government backbenchers while refusing to increase the Opposition allowance to any great extent except from £15,000 to £21,000 because he got there a percentage in line, or so he thought, with the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendation. This was not even considered by the Employer/Labour Conference.  It is a subsidy by the Minister to his own backbenchers, without any reference to anybody.  This is a serious matter. This is something at which every employer in the country will look when there is a question of a national wage agreement.  By adopting the subterfuge adopted by the Minister and giving perks, which are not included as remuneration, employers and employees will in future negotiate not for an increase in wages and salaries but for an increase in fringe benefits.  If the Minister gets away with what he is doing, he will be setting an example to the whole country.  What the Minister is doing is providing large fringe benefits for his own backbenchers. The members of the front bench do not require financial assistance for secretarial and research work and the Minister is cutting across the principle that heretofore operated, namely, that the Opposition must have these facilities.</P>
    <P>There is a case, it has been made on both sides of the House, and let the Minister do the thing honestly and above board.  Individual Deputies out of their own incomes have to pay for ordinary day-to-day working as representatives of constituencies.  Let the Minister do what he is doing for all individual Members of the House. But let us not cod ourselves.  This is not a benefit for Deputies as individuals. As far as we, on this side of the House, are concerned the money provided will be expended by the Leader of our party on research and secretarial work.  It will not be available generally.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which should be referred to the Employer/Labour Conference in the same way as the other allowances for Deputies, Senators and <Col N="1942" /> Ministers were referred to that conference. This is in breach of the recommendation on which the Minister has insisted during the course of this debate that he himself is relying and keeping in line with the recommendations. He is not doing that.  He has made sure that any shortfall will not affect his side of the House.  We, the Opposition, are getting the thin end of the stick.  This is a Government decision and this is why the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs knew it was a waste of time yesterday adjourning the House and having a talk about the whole thing.</P>

I want to identify it now and ask Members opposite to give a demonstration of the professed dignity of the Leader of the Opposition.  I was also going to show, by quoting chapter and verse at this late hour of the night, when, I suppose, the possibility of reporting is diminished.  I could have intervened this morning when he broke in, breaching every tradition of this House, in an effort to turn a mere reporting of a decision of the House, an official technical matter, into an opportunity for making a statement in the hope that that would instigate <i>The Evening Press</i> into giving maximum publicity to his mean and unfair charges dressed up in the guise of so-called polite remarks.</P>

      <P>With an air of injured innocence Deputy Lynch this morning rejected the statement from me that he was engaged in a filibuster. We are now 11 hours later, and how much further have we advanced in this debate?  Very little.  We have heard repetitious speeches from members of <Col N="1943" /> the Opposition, which translated into actuality mean they are whinging because they are not getting more money into their pockets, and all the parliamentary business of this State has been held up while they do a false song and dance beneath the stance taken by Deputy Lynch that he has been statesmanlike, that he has been injured in his reputation, in regard to what he is trying to do for the country. It is all based upon a totally false statement by him.  I am not accusing him of being deliberately false, because I am quite aware that during most of his occupation of this House he has operated with the assistance of people passing him notes, and without that assistance he is a negligible Member of this House.</P>
      <P>The truth is that the basis of allowances paid to the Opposition in this House is rooted in the Shanley report of 1938.  That report was the basis of all expenses paid until 1968, and that is the one basis that Deputy Lynch now says is not the basis upon which the Opposition gets any allowance.  I mentioned this last night.  I am not sure whether Deputy Lynch was here. He was probably at home asleep.  He does not participate very much in this House except to come in at the times his Press officers tell him is the most influential time to go in and make an impact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I inadvertently made a mistake but apparently in the Fianna Fáil lexicon that means it is a lie.  It is the 1937 report of the Shanley Committee of Inquiry into Ministerial and Other Salaries.  It could be purchased at the time of publication for one shilling in the Stationery Office.  If the Deputy wants it, let him go and get it in the Library.  Page 36 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The provision made from public funds for the Leader of a party in Opposition to the Government should not be in the nature of a salary but would be an allowance of a sufficient amount to enable such a person to defray secretarial and other expenses.</P>
      <P>It says on page 37 that the allowance was to be in the nature of recoupment of secretarial expenses.  It also said that there should be accommodation in the Oireachtas building for secretarial staff for the Leaders of the Opposition to enable them to employ people if the allowances recommended were to be made.  Again, it says that the allowances were for the purpose of providing effective secretarial assistance.</P>
      <P>The sole reason for the petulance of the Opposition about the proposals in this Bill is that the basis of the Opposition allowance was not to meet secretrial expenses.  It always has been and is to this day in respect of secretarial allowances.  The only addition to this secretarial allowance&mdash;and it is an addition&mdash;was one given in 1968, when Deputy Haughey, exhibiting more generosity than is now apparent in the front benches or even in the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party, said that it was time to give a payment for research facilities for the Opposition, and they were given it, for the first time in 1968.</P>

      <P>The research facilities are now available to the Opposition, and their complaint now apparently is that, while the former Opposition&mdash;a divided Opposition, two parties in Opposition&mdash;worked with £15,000 until the 14th March this year the present Opposition are in <Col N="1946" /> some way suffering a disadvantage when a 40 per cent addition is given by this Bill.  I do not think I have been in any way unfair, in any way reckless, in any way excessive, when I said that Deputy Lynch was displaying the height of audacity when he was looking for a 100 per cent increase in respect of secretarial and research facilities which are already available to the Opposition.  We are giving them an increase greater than the increase which the Employer/ Labour Conference considered to be the norm for Deputies, the maximum to be given to anyone operating within the Parliamentary system.  We are giving that and, because we are giving it, we find ourselves chastised by Deputy Lynch as being impatient, mean and angry.  I do not know what Fianna Fáil mean by generosity, unless their definition is to milk the taxpayer in order to give them as much in Opposition as they had when they were in Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the essence of their anger and annoyance.  They expect to receive in Opposition as much as they received when they were in Government and their responsibilities are now less.  They are receiving from us precisely the same sum in respect of secretarial facilities and research facilities as they gave, and considered proper, plus a 40 per cent increase which is more than the cost of living or wage increase since 1968. We believe that is generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we do not expect the Opposition or the Government members to carry the cost of understanding and interpreting and servicing the European Parliament, or the interpretation of European directives and proposals and legislation and decisions in the workings of this Parliament. We will set up an independent office, independent of all parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. Maybe this is why the Opposition do not like it.  We will provide an independent office with independent staff to service all Members of this Parliament&mdash;a staff which will not be beholden to any party, and will be <Col N="1947" /> available to advise and assist, with information and full research facilities, all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We believe this is the proper way to give such assistance.  There is no justification for the suggestion from the Opposition that they need more money in order to do European affairs work.  We are doing what they failed to do.  We will provide, in this building, a European office to which any Member may resort irrespective of whether he or she is a member of the European Parliament or a member of the European Affairs Committee. The services will be available without political taint or political obligation.  That is the way every parliament should be serviced and that is the way this Government believe Parliament should be serviced.</P>
    <P>To sum up, we are giving a 40 per cent increase to the Opposition to cover the research and secretarial services which are acknowledged on the record as being their right and already available to them.  We will not breach the national wage agreement by going beyond that figure which is the limit of what can be tolerated. Opposition Members, including Deputy Dowling, said the Government were breaching the national wage agreement.  We are doing no such thing.  We will not allow Members of this Parliament, any more than the bank officials, to go beyond what the vast majority of workers in this country have accepted as appropriate discipline for themselves.  Even if this House sits until 2 a.m. tomorrow or right through for many months to come, we will not allow the Opposition Party, by deliberate filibuster, under the auspices of the Leader of the Opposition, who sends in his filibusterers while he withdraws, after making his state of his party statement at the commencement of business, to breach the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>I expect these words bluntly, deliberately and carefully stated, will set the members of the Opposition in a tizzy of indignation.  How they conduct themselves, or how they react to the truth written into the records of <Col N="1948" /> this House since 1938, is their business. They cannot escape from the facts.  They are getting the facts of what the Opposition had in the past, what they made available to the Opposition in the past.  They are getting a 40 per cent addition on what they gave to the Opposition without, as I again would like to point out, providing one penny in this year's Estimate to meet the cost from 1st July onwards, not to talk about the so-called retrospection of back pay they were hungry for early today.  I will conclude on this note.  Deputy Lynch said this morning that there was only one issue concerning him.  He chastised the political correspondents in the Press gallery.</P>

He said his opposition to the Bill was only on the basis of our not giving a 100 per cent increase in the Opposition allowance.

      <P>At that stage sitting in for the Minister for Finance was his colleague the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He listened to the contributions made by three or four spokesmen. His reaction to the contributions made by the various Deputies was 100 per cent opposite to the reaction we have had from the responsible, with a question mark, Minister.  In fact, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said in relation to the contributions made while he was here that he agreed that there was a great deal of merit in the points the various spokesmen made.  I am deliberately avoiding allowing myself to be worked into a tizzy, as the Minister said.  He anticipated this side of the House would come back roaring because he feels he can roar us down and make many close to false allegations.</P>
      <P>He has made another of his unparalleled attacks on the Leader of this party.  The quality of the Leader of our party, as opposed to his own qualities or lack of qualities, is quite evident and I do not think there is any need for me to comment on it.  It certainly does not arise on the amendments we are discussing. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs confessed that this legislation is presented by the Government in an effort to do something before the end of this session to meet the requirements of the people in this Chamber. He indicated that if the House would let this legislation through the Minister for Finance would be back again in the next session to try to clear up the anomalies and the various other matters which were, as he saw it, justifiably raised.  I do not think it would be possible. It would probably need another Bill to make up for the breaches of the national pay agreement in this measure. The extraordinary thing is that parallel with that in sections 5 and 11 there are provisions to enable the Government, by order in the future, to make the necessary adjustments.  This is why our opposition to various sections and amendments arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister just now in his aggressive, <Col N="1951" /> abusive, derogatory address to the House and in his effort to castigate the Leader of this party, has gone out of his way to talk about how generous he is and how in line with the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations this Bill is.  The Employer/Labour Conference did not discuss the Opposition allowance.  The Minister says the increases are in line with the maximum that the Employer/ Labour Conference considered could be offered to any individual.  He is endeavouring to twist this.  Deputy Allen did not succeed in extracting from him an answer in regard to the situation whereby an increase of 200 per cent was given in 1968 for research purposes.  A sum of £10,000 was given to the Opposition parties at that time on top of £5,000, if he wants to follow his shambling report and indicate that the existing £5,000 that was there up to 1968 was for secretarial expenses.  A 200 per cent increase was given in 1968 by the Government to the Opposition for research. As I see it, the impression the Minister creates is that 50 per cent of the £21,000 was decided as the figure for the Opposition, without any reference to the Employer/Labour Conference which he is so anxious to quote when he is dealing with the allowance for the Opposition, but which he refuses to quote when he is dealing with the allowance for the Government party.  The reason is that he has not been able to work out the sum as requested by Deputy O'Malley last night as to what percentage that is and in what way that agrees with the Employer/Labour Conference.  The fact is that out of the £21,000 one could assume that £10,500 is there for secretarial purposes and £10,500 for research.  That is £10,500 to the Leader of the Opposition party for research against the £15,000 which the Fianna Fáil Government in 1968, five years ago, when costs were not as high as they are now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister invited the cross-questioning.  I was speaking about the comparative costs of research in 1973 as against 1968 and the £21,000 which could be devoted to research as against £15,000 in 1968. As a reply the Minister tells us about a new service that he proposes to provide in relation to the dissemination and explanation of information in connection with the EEC.  I indicated last night that we feel, despite our admiration for the Civil Service, that we need a research unit of our own.</P>
      <P>I am afraid we could only set up a very poor unit on £10,500 and any such unit would be expected to provide us with background information on the EEC as well as information in regard to other matters. Any back-up services that might make for effective Opposition are being sabotaged deliberately by this action of an aggressive Minister for Finance.  It is stupid of the Minister to adopt this attitude because after the next change of Government he, too, will suffer from that lack of back-up services, that is, of course, if he is retained by the Leader of his party and if he is re-elected by his constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 is not one of the amendments that has been brought in for the purpose of clearing up some technical hitch although we have had several such amendments from the Minister already.  The effect of this amendment would be to insert a new section before section 12.  This necessity has arisen because the Minister overlooked the question of allowances <Col N="1955" /> for the Opposition in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Oddly enough, although I am not a particular admirer of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when he was speaking it occurred to me that if it had been he who was piloting this Bill through the House, it would have gone through last week.  He said that the Bill was framed honestly as a contribution to progress and fairplay.  There was no reference in the Bill as framed to any allowance for the Opposition.  I do not know whether this was excluded deliberately so that the objection might be raised on Second Stage and that the Government might find this backdoormeans of introducing a subsidy for the backbenchers of their own parties. Deputy Cunningham referred to this possibility but Deputy O'Brien objected to Deputy Cunningham claiming that the introduction of this subsidy for backbenchers was in breach of the Employer/Labour Conference.  Of course it is in breach of the recommendations of that conference because it transpires now that the allowance paid previously to the Leader of the former Opposition party was used for subsidising secretarial services for the Fine Gael Party. It is obvious that the fund proposed now is for the same purpose.  Deputy Lynch reminded the House this morning that Fianna Fáil members fund their own secretarial service.  The additional emolument proposed for the backbenchers of the Government parties should be referred to the Employer/Labour Conference, as Deputy Cunningham pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have endeavoured deliberately to avoid becoming perturbed by the Minister for Finance who came in, after what he told us was his first refreshment since 3 o'clock, and tried to aggravate the position.  After the Minister's efforts during the past fortnight to aggravate us, we have become immune to any such effort by him but it might be no harm if he were to check on what was said by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, a Minister who, this evening, could have done business here because he accepted, almost without reservation, that there was a great deal of merit in everything being said <Col N="1956" /> by us but implied that we should speed the passage of the Bill through the House because everyone wants his few &ldquo;bob&rdquo;.  He promised a remodelled version of the Bill in the new year but why can the Minister for Finance not let us have a new Bill now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that we are endeavouring to breach the national wage agreement but, as Deputy Cunningham pointed out, under this Bill the backbenchers of Fine Gael and Labour could receive an extra subvention.  A simple calculation would indicate that they could gain to the extent of £3 to £4 per week over and above their new salaries.  Therefore, we suggest that the Minister is in breach of the national wage agreement.</P>
      <P>Recently when the Minister for Labour was putting through his Bill in regard to the remuneration of bank employees it was obvious that he was blocking every loophole of this kind but here we have the Minister for Finance proposing to give the Government backbenchers an increase of the order that I have indicated.  Apart from breaching the national wage agreement, he is encouraging other groups, such as bank employees, to breach the agreement also.  It is not too late for the Minister to defer debate on the Bill but if he is not prepared to do that I suggest that he refer the terms of the Bill to the Employer/Labour Conference so that they might adjudicate as to whether these terms are in breach of the national wage agreement.  This is a very important issue especially at a time when a third national wage agreement is about to be negotiated.  It is very wrong that the Minister would give an impression to the negotiators of that agreement which might be such as would lead either to a bad agreement or to there being no agreement at all. If that happens the Minister will be the person to blame.</P>

I may be wrong.  My education may be far more faulty than the last speaker's but an allegation is being made here that the giving of these sums in relation to the number of qualified Members in a party could give rise and possibly would give rise to a hidden subvention being given to the backbenchers of a Government party.</P>

My reason for saying that is that statements made by many backbenchers of the Government party yesterday and today indicated quite clearly that while they were in sympathy with many of the amendments we had down and with the views expressed by members of the Opposition <Col N="1960" /> they would have to support in the Division Lobby a Bill in which they did not believe.  We had Deputy Enright's outburst in which he indicated that Opposition Deputies were endeavouring to drive a wedge between the front bench members and the back bench members of the Government parties.  That was a clear indication of a division of opinion between the Government and their backbenchers. This is the pay-off section.  Deputy Moore is quite right.  If one examines the figures one finds that per backbenchers of the Government parties, taking it across the board, it would mean £125 to £200 in the case of the Labour Party and £166 to £171 in the case of the Fine Gael Party.  The Minister for Finance referred to the 35 per cent embodied in the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendation. How does the Minister for Finance account for this particular allowance section?  There is no way of assessing to what extent this section is in breach of the national pay agreement and the Employer/Labour Conference recommendation but it is substantially in breach of the Employer/Labour Conference proposals.</P>
      <P>It is a pay-off section.  No doubt, it was put in in order to ensure the support of Government backbenchers because we know they were in revolt against many sections of the Bill and many of the amendments put down by the Minister.  In order to woo the backbenchers and ensure their support in the lobbies the Minister decided that there would be a pay-off.  This is the pay-off.  A very important precedent is being created here, a pay-off for the Minister's own backbenchers.  This is typical Coalition Government type barter where people can put the gun to the head of the Minister and tell him that unless he is prepared to concede to them they will not give him the type of support he requires.</P>

      <P>The Opposition allowance is different to the allowances that are now embodied.  As a member of the Committee on Procedure <Col N="1961" /> and Privileges I am aware that over the years the question of a separate allowance and of back-up services for the Deputies, not alone the Government Deputies but Deputies who have not the full availability of the Civil Service, was discussed.  The Civil Service is available to the Government and Government policy is percolated back to their backbenchers with the result that the backbenchers have the necessary information on all matters.</P>
      <P>That is one of the reasons why in the past we were told it applied only to the Opposition who had not got the availability of the Civil Service for research and other work.  The backbenchers on the Government side have available to them many avenues of information which are not available to Members of the Opposition.  It is necessary to ensure if we have a viable Opposition that the necessary finances are made available to that Opposition.</P>
      <P>We all know the amount of debate that went into this in order to get the Minister to move.  However, he only moved after consultation with Members of his own party, and his own groups, and when the gun was put to his head.  It was only then that he embodied these payments to Government backbenchers.  This is probably only a start of many pay-offs which we may see in the future.  It is a complete breach of the national pay agreement and contrary to the opinions expressed in the recent legislation, the Banks Bill, which prohibited an employer paying additions of any type or improving conditions of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that Bill the situation is completely the opposite to this Bill.  One Minister brings in legislation which is, in many ways, opposing the legislation which we have before us now. The Minister has spoken so often about the 35 per cent limit which he could not exceed, but how does he apply this 35 per cent to this particular section, this pay-off section for backbench Members?  We have seen other pay-offs in other sections of this Bill.  I felt that another pay-off was included in the section which provided for the payment to the Attorney <Col N="1962" /> General.  The Attorney General was given certain concessions which were demanded by his supporters because he could not be fitted into the Cabinet. Maybe the Minister conceded to this pressure unwillingly but, nevertheless, he conceded.</P>
    <P>From the confusion of thought of the Minister in relation to and in reply to many of the questions put by speakers on the Opposition side, we found that while the Minister endeavoured to confuse Members of this House that, at the same time, he had confused himself.  He was so confused on occasions that he gave erroneous information.  When he was challenged to present facts he had no answer or necessary material.  Because of the erroneous statements made he would not allow himself to be drawn on any matter and never did produce the information or give quotations from any particular documents.</P>
    <P>This is completely undesirable.  It has been foreign to this House for some time that there would be pay-offs in legislation to Members in order to get them to support Bills.  I believe this is just the start of many pay-offs which we will see embodied in legislation in the future.  It is a very serious matter and one which will give rise to considerable thought outside of this House.  When people examine the circumstances of payments, I am quite sure they will see the real meaning.</P>
    <P>In relation to back-up services for Deputies, there has been an amount of discussion over a period of years in relation to the inadequate services. The library service and other services should be available to deal with the ever changing position in this country in relation, in particular, to our membership of the EEC.  This applies right across the board to Deputies of all parties and if an effort was made to meet these inadequacies it should have been done on a general basis because the Members of the Opposition are entitled to additional services.</P>
    <P>However, this new allowance is a payment, in cash, to parties but how they will dispose of it is another matter.  Members of the Government party clearly indicated that this was <Col N="1963" /> an allowance for Deputies.  If it is an allowance for Deputies to me it means that it is a further allowance which is in excess of the national pay agreement and any breach of that agreement is a serious matter.  If the Minister wishes to pursue this course of breaking the national agreement in the various sections of the Bill it is a clear indication of the lop-sided thinking.  If the Minister felt that allowances should be made because Deputies were hard pressed, he could have fully implemented the question of the application of salaries as recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference to meet this great strain that has been on Deputies over a period.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was logical in his approach, he would have decided that this payment would be made on the basis suggested in the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference.  If the Minister feels that Deputies are so hard pressed that they require an additional £171 per annum, surely this is a clear indication that the full implementation of the salary scale suggested should have been applied.</P>
    <P>The Opposition allowance was available previously but for a very different purpose.  This new measure has been introduced in order to ensure Government support in the division lobbies because without this pay-off section the backbenchers of the Government would be in revolt against the Minister.  Many of the Government backbenchers have clearly expressed the opinion that they were going in to vote in favour of this Bill against their will and that makes this particular section all the more distasteful. I hope the Minister will reexamine the case and, if he feels there is a genuine case to facilitate Deputies, it should be applied across the board rather than to a particular section.</P>
    <P>The Minister must give an explanation as to how he will arrive at the 35 per cent related to the national pay agreement and the additions here to backbenchers of the Government Party because this means that, in addition to their salaries, they will now be paid out <Col N="1964" /> of public funds additional amounts ranging from £171 up to £200.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House and of the Minister to some of the details of amendment No. 7 in the name of the Minister. I do not want to be taken as accepting the amendment or the principle underlying it, but I have to face the reality of the fact that in this day and age, when a Government makes an edict, all those who belong to the parties comprising that Government have to obey that edict and vote for it, no matter how strongly they disagree with it. Having to face the reality of that situation, I can only assume that the likelihood is that this amendment will be enacted.  If it is enacted, it will give rise to enormous difficulties.  In particular, it will give rise to enormous difficulties in any year in which there is a general election and in which there is a change of Government as a result of a general election.  I say that because there is a concept introduced in this amendment of what are described as qualified Members.  Qualified Members are people who did not hold what is defined in Part IV of the 1938 Act as qualified offices and qualified offices mean offices which are either ministerial or secretarial and they in turn are defined.  That concept of qualifying office has since 1938 been extended to include the offices of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle as well as Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and will, under the proposal in this Bill, include the Attorney General, if the Attorney General is a Member of the House on the operative date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us cast our minds back now to 1st January last.  At that date there were 14 Ministers, each of whom was a member of Fianna Fáil.  There was a Ceann Comhairle who was a member of Fianna Fáil.  There were six Parliamentary Secretaries all of whom were members of Fianna Fáil.  They are not qualified members for this whole year for the purposes of this amendment.  If they are not qualified members, we have to deduct the total, which comes, I think, to 22 and, as a result, the Fianna Fáil Party, which <Col N="1965" /> has at the moment 68 members, is 68 minus 22, which is 44.  Therefore, instead of getting £21,000, which the Minister says he is awarding in his generosity, we will, in fact, get £12,000, which is the amount applicable to a party that has between 35 and 44 qualified Members.  I would be obliged if the Parliamentary Secretary would correct me if I am wrong because this is a very serious matter.  Will he tell me whether I am right or wrong?  If I am right, I will have to pursue the matter.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept my interpretation?</P>

The Fianna Fáil Party, now in Opposition, will have to deduct from the list of qualified Members 22 people who were Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries or Ceann Comhairle on 1st January, 1973.  This is a very serious matter in this year.  It will arise with considerable seriousness in any year in which there is a general election that results in a change of Government.</P>

      <P>There is the converse because on 1st January last Fine Gael and Labour were in Opposition and none as of that date was a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary. There was a combined total of 67 or 68.  Assuming they are all back&mdash;they are not all back&mdash;for the purposes of this argument, that brings them up to a figure way above what apparently is the Minister's intention in this amendment.

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  We might as well draw the attention of the House to this.  It was, I think, done earlier in the debate, but it is no harm to draw attention to it again.  The Minister told the House that this Bill provides these very liberal allowances for all and sundry, Opposition and Government backbenchers. He repeated that a couple of times in my presence.  The fact of the matter is there is not one line in the Bill about providing allowances to the Opposition.  It was only as a result of the speeches made by Deputy Lynch, Deputy Colley and others on this side of the House, and by Deputy <Col N="1967" /> O'Connell, Deputy Desmond and, I think, Deputy Thornley on that side of the House, who said it was not good enough that this should be omitted, that the Minister now comes along with his amendment, not to give an allowance on the basis on which it was given since 1938, but a new-fangled thing which works in in some way the Government backbenchers.  There was nothing in the Bill, and this is significant, in relation to the Opposition, even though there was a clear entitlement to it, and it was only because we spoke up and pointed out what the Government were trying to do that this now appears and because happily we were supported by decent backbenchers on the Government side in the Labour Party.  When the Minister comes along with this amendment, it appears to have been drafted in such a hurry that already we have had what were described as amendments to amendments, which have now been incorporated on the second green sheet, which has a note on top of it to say it is in substitution for something else.</P>
      <P>They apparently noticed one set of errors that they made in this amendment No.7, but they do not appear to have noticed the other one.  We have a Minister in the House now, and the Tánaiste is here.  Perhaps he will be able to help out since the Parliamentary Secretary will not venture any opinion.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one point.  I cannot understand why the value of Deputies of particular parties can vary so much.  According to this Bill, a Labour backbencher is worth £136 a year extra, and a Fine Gael backbencher is worth £158 a year.  I would imagine that Deputies of both parties do an equivalent amount of work and I fail to see the reason behind this kind of legislation.</P>

We pay a lot of lip service to the idea of an effective Opposition, but an effective Opposition should not be shackled.  We should be given certain rights.  One of the rights given to Oppositions in the past was an allowance for research and information. The figure was £15,000 in 1968 and it is being increased in this Bill to £21,000.  The Minister is now telling us that what we do with it is our own business and that it is not necessarily for research and information services but to pay for our own secretarial services if we so wish.</P>
      <P>This shows the vindictiveness of the Minister for Finance towards the Opposition. He should take note of the fact that the Opposition received the votes of 624,000 people.  When the Government attempt to scorn the Opposition they are also scorning possibly 624,000 people.  They should bear that in mind.  This is absolutely disgraceful.</P>

      <P>The allocation of money to the Leader of the Opposition in the past has never been used for the secretarial services of our party nor has it been used, I am quite certain, for the secretarial services of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour <Col N="1971" /> Party.  It would be interesting to hear how this £15,000 will be distributed. Will it be distributed to each Deputy or will it go to the Leaders of the parties to be distributed?  It cannot go to the Leaders of the parties because they do not qualify.  As far as I can see, it will probably go to each Deputy.  I will be looking forward to hearing how the Minister intends to distribute it.</P>

      <P>Everything the smart members of the Opposition have adduced in the course of this debate underlines what I said last week.  I was accused by the Leader of the Opposition, who likes to draw about him an atmosphere of taking a benign and considerate approach to everything, of being vicious and unfair because there was no provision in this Bill to deal with these problems.  The more we discuss them the more the problems the Opposition throw up.  The more the Opposition justify&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1972" /> Every argument advanced on the opposite side underlines what I said, which was that there was no easy solution to the many requests voiced from the Opposition for a total re-arrangement of the basis upon which individuals and parties are remunerated.  The Taoiseach, one of the wisest men in this House, indicated as much to Deputy Lynch some time ago when Deputy Lynch approached the Taoiseach informally on this matter.  We indicated a willingness to deal with these problems.  Knowing the anxiety of all Members of the House to get at least their basic remuneration dealt with before we went into recess, we introduced our Bill.  Then with a great show <i>saevo indignatio</i> we had Deputy Lynch rising on his high horse last week and accusing the Government of being unfair to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The more the Opposition draw attention to the difficulties of framing fair legislation, the more they justify us in not having a provision in this Bill originally to meet their gluttony to get a 100 per cent increase in the Opposition allowance.  I readily admit that Deputy O'Malley has raised a valid drafting point.</P>

The draft which I had all the time here&mdash;I was simply laying the ground for it&mdash;now I see the experts have gone out&mdash;would be to amend it by providing that the subsection would read that &ldquo;in case there are 14 or less qualified members of the Party on the 1st day of January in a particular year, or, in any year in which there is a change of Government, the date on which the Government is appointed by the President&rdquo; and it would seem to me that that might meet the reasonable last minute demands of the Members opposite, who had since last Friday to come forward with their objections on the sections as drafted, but apparently did not consider doing anything about it until this late hour.

We will have to consider it in the light of the situation that now <Col N="1977" /> exists.  Perhaps the Opposition will agree to some shortening of the 48 hours to perhaps 42 hours or 36 hours, whatever would seem appropriate to us.  A factor in deciding whether we reduce that notice to 42 hours or 36 hours or whatever number of hours seems appropriate to us is the attitude of the Minister himself.  It is a relevant factor to be taken into account.  To say the least of it, the attitude of the Minister for Finance has been somewhat ungracious.</P>

We are sorry about it, and will you let us amend it?&rdquo; he would be likely to find a far more favourable reception to this request arising out of the dilemma in which he now finds himself.  Before he came to the point in his speech where he agreed that there was a serious and fundamental error running through the whole amendment, we had an overture or prologue of five minutes of venom which was totally unnecessary and untrue.  The untrue part of it does not surprise us any longer after what we have had.  We have now reached the stage at 11.10 p.m. that as a result of the thorough examination of this Bill and of the amendments to it we have discovered a most fundamental error.  If that thorough examination was not given to the Bill by us this error, which the Minister admits exists and invalidates his whole amendment and the whole principle of what he has been talking about for two days, would not have been found out and a most serious situation would exist.</P>

    <P>We have been criticised as an Opposition for going through this Bill line by line, going through it, as we did, with a fine comb but we have more than justified our opposition to the Bill and our close examination of the Bill by what now comes to light. The one thing on which the Minister was pinning his flag in seeking to justify the whole Bill has now been <Col N="1978" /> found to be fundamentally defective.

The matter before us now is fundamental to the whole approach that the Minister has been adopting for days past.  As I understand it, and I wish the Minister to make this very clear to us, what the Minister is saying is that, although he knows now and we know that the effect of this amendment would be to deprive this party of a substantial portion of the Opposition allowance which the Minister said he was giving and, at the same time, to give to the Fine Gael and Labour Parties substantially more than the Minister said he was giving to them, we can vote on it and take it or leave it depending on whether we think it is to our advantage.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>When one considers that there is this fundamental flaw in it and that what is before us contains amendments to the amendments it is only reasonable that we should consider very carefully any further attempt to amend the Bill.

In those circumstances we insist on getting, in writing, the amendment the Minister proposes and we insist on being given an opportunity to consider that amendment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since business was suspended, I have circulated the amendment to the original amendment which I think meets the points made by the Members of the Opposition.  This would have the effect of ensuring that at any given time the assessment would be made of what the remuneration would be according to the number of people in the party at any particular time.  We have adjusted the amendment to read that the parties would be paid at an annual rate, that the rate would be an annual rate and that it would relate to the number of people at any given time.  The phraseology which we have used, as I am sure Deputies Colley and O'Malley will understand, is well known in the legal world&mdash;it is that one identifies the situation for the time being.  That, I think, gets over the difficulties which were legitimately raised in relation to the time of assessment of the state of individual parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say in passing that if we had not acquiesced in this amendment the effect would have been that the parties now in Government would have made an immense profit and the disadvantage would have flown to the Members opposite.  Our readiness to acquiesce in this, I would hope, will now be acknowledged and set off against what I identified at the beginning as rather churlish criticism of us who have also exhibited our generosity in this regard.  At the very commencement of the debate we emphasised that there were immense difficulties, and it was because we were aware of these difficulties that we said time was needed for discussion and it was made known to the Leader of the Opposition.  There was no unwillingness on our part to deprive the Opposition of the valid and adequate allowance and we would have been more than willing to make this retrospective if only sufficient time had been given for the kind of adult discussion that ought to have taken <Col N="1984" /> place between Members of this House. The opportunity for those discussions was denied to us and notwithstanding all that, and working under immense pressure, we have now arrived at this amendment which I trust will be acceptable to the Members opposite.</P>

      <P>I have heard of people making virtue out of necessity, but trying to make virtue out of one's own deliberate mistakes or deliberate omissions is something new on me.  Let the Minister be assured that we extend no virtue to him in bringing in this amendment.  It is an amendment to a section which was already amended before it appeared before the House. The amendment was brought in not at our insistence, not at our request, but on the Minister's own initiative. Let that be quite clear.</P>
      <P>Now that Deputy Cosgrave is here &mdash;I will not go back into the history of the two conversations we had about this matter, about the matter of the Opposition allowance&mdash;I think he will agree with me that any suggestion made by the Minister for Finance that there was an agreement between us as to the content of this amendment is not correct, to say the least of it.  There was no agreement and I am sure Deputy Cosgrave will agree.</P>

      <P>Having said that and, I hope, having established that it was not at our insistence this amendment was brought in but as a result of what we regard as hasty drafting by the Minister, we now find ourselves in this position: in the short time that we have had to examine this amendment we have discovered a number of defects not only in the amendment but in other parts of the Bill as a result of this amendment. The first defect I would refer to is <Col N="1985" /> the use of the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo;.  The Minister said that he used the words &ldquo;an annual sum&rdquo;.  As we see it the word &ldquo;annual&rdquo; is being eliminated and later on in different paragraphs of the subsection, the words &ldquo;per annum&rdquo; are introduced instead.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make about this is that the various sums to be paid per annum would, I presume, be paid in a single sum at a given time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is at a rate of £X per annum.  That does not require an annual payment.  That is the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where there is no provision for the interim payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy knows the system of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The system has been in the form of monthly payments in relation to the Opposition allowance. Having imported the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; it is necessary to ensure that the sums be paid at a given time or times because at a particular time, if the period were long enough between payments, the situation in a particular party might alter seriously and adversely in relation to that party.  If, for example, a member of the party with barely 14 qualifying members died or the qualifying members increased, that would have a material affect on the payment.  In certain cases there could be overpayment or underpayment. No doubt, underpayments could be easily cured but there is no provision for the return of overpayments. I need not elaborate on that.  We regard that as a fundamental change and not only that but it requires amendment of other parts of the Bill and of the amendments to the Bill.  It will require a consequential amendment to section 7 which the House has already passed and of which this amendment, as drafted and circulated takes no account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will also require an amendment to amendment No. 5 which is at present before the House.  This is very imprecise drafting.  We know well that hasty <Col N="1986" /> drafting of this nature can lead, as it has led in the past, to serious consequences. In our preleminary examination of this amendment not only have we discovered the defect in the amendment itself but also the need for consequential amendments arising out of the amendment now proposed.  In all these circumstances, it seems to me that the best thing for the Minister to do would be to take the Bill and the amendment back and let himself and his advisers examine it and bring it back to the House at, say, a particular time next Friday.  We could then discuss it in a reasonable way so that we would be sure we knew what we were doing and that the Minister knew what he was doing.  The fact that there are two consequential amendments is an indication that what the Minister is now doing is something the consequences of which he has not envisaged. I suggest that the Minister take the Bill back and we can have another look at it at, say, 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock on Friday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that Deputy Lynch has underlined what I said at the beginning, that this matter is riddled with difficulties.  He chastised us last week because we had not provisions in the Bill to meet these points; now he is saying that the thing is riddled with difficulties.  He is trying to play it both ways.  He abused us because we were being careful about it, adopting a line of advantage.  He was entitled to do that but recognising the difficulties he would now project himself as an injured party who was being savaged by a Government that was denying justice to the Opposition.</P>
      <P>He comes in tonight at 12.30 during an extended sitting to say that there are difficulties that have not yet been visualised.  We have seen many difficulties all along the line and we prepared amendments to try to meet the insistence of the Opposition that they should get certain benefits for themselves.  The more we tried to meet their deadlines the more difficulties they have tried to raise.  I shall now try to deal with some of these trivial difficulties which Deputy Lynch has suggested tonight.</P>

      <P>He says, for instance, that there is now provision in this which governs the payment of these allowances monthly or otherwise. I would invite him to show me any provision in any of the existing legislation which provides the means of payment.  The truth is that there are no provisions in any existing legislation which requires the payments to be made monthly or in any other sequence or in any other proportions so that the very argument he is throwing up here is shown to be totally without foundation unless, of course, the whole proceedings at present existing are irregular and, if that be so, as his party have claimed responsibility for so much of past legislation the blame lies on them, but they cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The amendments we are bringing in here tonight will ensure that the Opposition party receive a 40 per cent increase on the allowance now paid to the Opposition.  We think there has been enough waste of parliamentary time, enough obstruction of the business of this State by the 68 Deputies opposite anxious to look after their own pockets.</P>

      <P>Here is another typical example of the Minister trying to disrupt reasonable argument in the House and failing to meet the reasonable case put to him.  I did not mention <Col N="1989" /> one word about the merits of this Bill in the course of my remarks.  I spoke only about the amendment, its inadequacies, the fact that it contains a fundamental change in the Bill as presented to us, and the amendments already presented to us.  I pointed out that the new amendment is an amendment of an amendment, in that the Minister brought in the amendment in the first instance and had it amended even before he introduced it.  I point these things out in the spirit of trying to ensure that the House knows what it is doing and that when it passes legislation it is legislation that we know will ensure what the Minister desires to ensure.  It does not do that, because already two consequential amendments, at least two&mdash; that is what we discovered in our short scrutiny of the amendment&mdash;are required to which the Minister did not even advert.  Instead, he indulges in the same kind of acrimony as he indulged in at the commencement of the Committee Stage of this Bill yesterday morning.  He should do as I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister suggesting I was not entitled to speak until such time as attention was drawn to what was contained in Standing Orders?  I do not want to be acrimonious about this but this amendment was not suggested by us.  We suggested that the pattern of previous Bills providing for increases in Oireachtas allowances and Opposition allowances should be followed and that if this new provision, this new principle of allowances to Deputies as such was to be imported into the Bill that this should be discussed separately. It was the Minister's attempt to compromise the issue that has led to the mess in which he now finds himself.  I suggest that he adopt the course that I originally suggested. This Bill, as a result of this amendment, is fraught with technical dangers, with legal problems that we see <Col N="1990" /> to arise now and others that we may not have seen on our preliminary perusal of the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is something I would like to get clear.  I referred earlier to the procedure that was adopted in section 7 and said that it would create inhibitions later on in the discussion on this Bill.  I had not envisaged this arising in this way but it was quite obvious that there was part of section 7 that could only bring about this sort of dilemma, that if you amend what you propose to do, that you had predetermined by a clause in an earlier section that is passed, you hamstring the House in its discussion and in its liberty to make changes. This has happened now.  Allowing that that can be amended and that the other imperfections that have been detected and those that may yet be detected were amended, is the amendment as such and its intention acceptable in principle to the Opposition?</P>
      <P>That is one question, but not one I can readily ask the Minister.  I can ask him what is the difference between what was there and what is now proposed in the most recently circulated amendment?  I should like to be clear where the net difference is.  Perhaps the Minister might elucidate what his intention is in the proposed amendment.  There are many things I want to say about it afterwards.  In the meantime, could he clarify what is in his mind?  Maybe from the Opposition we might get some indication as to whether they are still four square behind the concept that the Minister has either in this or in his earlier amendment and whether they intend to push on with their amendment. Could I have from the Minister, for my edification and information, what is the net difference?  How much extra does it mean in any particular case?  What advantage is it?</P>

      <P>The amendment, as originally drafted, provided that the time of assessment on the size of the party every year would be the 1st January.  The point was raised that this did not take into account changes which could arise, first of all, in the numerical strength of the parties at different times, nor did it take into account the possibility that there could be a change of Government within a year.  Therefore, we have amended the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by providing that instead of making the assessment on 1st January in any particular year it could be made at any particular time and that the rate to be paid to a party would be equivalent to whatever the annual rate would be for a party of that size.  The effect of that is that the Opposition party would receive £21,000 as against £15,000 if the amendment had not been made.  You could understand why the Government are naturally in some difficulty in understanding why they are not grateful for receiving an extra £6,000.  If they would prefer the Bill to go through without this amendment we have no objection if they want to vote accordingly.</P>

      <P>Really one would have thought that at this late stage in this debate the Minister might have learned something.  It is now pretty clear that he is congenitally incapable of learning anything.  He has walked himself into one mess after another on <Col N="1994" /> this Bill apparently with his eyes open. I want to reiterate that we urged from the beginning that the correct approach to this matter was to introduce a Bill on the same lines as was done on four different occasions in the past and to provide, as was done before, for an allowance for the Opposition and to provide an appropriate increase in that.</P>
      <P>We also said that this Bill, as introduced by the Government for the first time made no provision for an increased allowance to the Opposition. When we complained about this the Minister rushed off and, not at our request, but apparently on his own decision or at the request of his own backbenchers, he introduced an amendment which was designed to introduce a completely new concept under which additional assistance would be given to all Deputies, other than office holders, to assist them in secretarial work.  We said that this was a completely wrong approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We said if they felt this new concept was worthwhile we thought it should be discussed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because we could see a number of difficulties arising.  Some of them we referred to earlier and Deputy Blaney also referred to them earlier. We felt the problems should be ironed out.  The Minister for Finance did not do that.  He produced an amendment, which we did not ask for.  We opposed it and we still oppose it.  The Minister decided not to follow what was done in the past but to rush in an amendment at the last minute.  He then amended the amendment, which is what we have before us this morning, and then when Deputy O'Malley pointed out a fundamental flaw in his amended amendment he has come back with what looks like 37 new amendments to the amended amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of Deputy Blaney, because I do not think that the Minister was anxious to explain to him <Col N="1995" /> what was involved in this, let me point out that, under the Minister's amended amendment before he went at it a third time, because of the provision that the assessment of the numbers in parties would be made as at 1st January of the year in question, in particular this year, the position would be that all the members of this party who were office holders.  Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, or Ceann Comhairle, would be excluded in calculating the amount due to this side, whereas conversely in the case of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties those who are now office holders would not be excluded and the net effect would be a substantial reduction in the amount paid to the Opposition and a substantial increase in the amount paid to the Government party.</P>
    <P>When this was pointed out the Minister, with a great deal of his usual bluster, and abuse, attempts to suggest that we were responsible for this amendment.  He wanted us firstly to accept across the floor orally an amendment without notice but we insisted that we should get it in writing and be given an opportunity to consider it.  His own version of what he wanted us to accept orally was 37 further amendments of the amended amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the version we have before us now, as Deputy Jack Lynch pointed out, there is a problem arising because of the use of the words &ldquo;for the time being&rdquo; here.  I do not think that we ought to spend too much time on it except to point out to the Minister that there are problems.  Let me say to him that when he talks about other legislation providing for the payment of an annual sum as was provided here that that is what he was talking about before but he is trying to compare that with his amended version which is payable at a rate of so much per annum.  This is a completely different thing and if the Minister thinks about it, he will realise that to make this kind of amendment work it will be necessary to specify a particular date in each month on which the calculation is made and, perhaps, the same, or another date, on which <Col N="1996" /> the payment is made.  If the Minister thinks about it, he will see that that is so.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by the Leader of this Party, after a quick perusal of this amended amended amendment, consequential amendments are necessary.  One of them relates to section 7, subsection (2), and the other relates to amendment No. 5 which is at present before the House. I feel certain that if the Minister's advisers get an opportunity to examine the Bill further they will discover some further consequential amendments arising out of this.</P>
    <P>I again urge on the Minister the wisdom of the course suggested by the Leader of this party that at this stage discussion on this Bill should cease and resume at some agreed time on Friday.  In the interval the Minister, and his advisers, would have an opportunity of discussing the consequences and so would we.  The wisdom lies in that course.  Surely the fact that we could immediately point out to the Minister two consequential amendments arising out of this is fair enough indication of the wisdom of what we are suggesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Minister, and to Deputy Colley, for clarifying this matter in so far as they see it from their opposite sides of the House.  What matter is it, what difference will it make if the content and the intention as expressed in this amendment, and the amendment before that, and what was in the Bill originally, is unacceptable to the Opposition?  Why go to the trouble of perfecting that which is non-acceptable? Is there any merit in it after the hours that have already been spent uselessly in trying to reach agreement by discussion?</P>
      <P>More than 24 hours ago I made a strong plea, and a lengthy one, which I repeated asking that there should be an adjournment so that there could be consultation.  The wisdom of that must now be evident to all in this House. Consultation was badly needed at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy certainly did.  That this consultation did not take place is now fairly evident as having been a bad mistake.  What seems to have been an even greater error is the fact that a week earlier when Second Stage had concluded that the consultation, which I understood was to have taken place did not, in fact, take place.  I was amazed to find that this did not take place to any worthwhile degree, if at all. I discovered since that there was some consultation, or an exchange of views between the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition, but this did not lead to any sort of general assessment or agreement as to what might be acceptable to both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>We have reached the stage now where we have a proposition by way of an amendment from the Fianna Fáil Party specifically setting out not only increased payment to them as an Opposition but stating very clearly in terms of being an allowance to the Opposition with no counting of heads or anything else.</P>
      <P>On the other side, we have a new approach by the Government, that of counting of heads and arriving at different figures related to the number of heads in any particular party at any given time and with clear differential in relation to the <i>per capita</i> payment that will fall due to Members of the Government party or parties as distinct from those for Opposition parties. We also get confirmed for us that any Opposition allowances in the past deriving firstly from the 1938 Act were at that stage, and until the 1960 Act, clearly pointed in the direction of providing secretarial assistance to the Opposition party or parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time a new dimension was added in 1968 when in addition to financial assistance for secretarial payments or the hiring of staff financial assistance was provided in order that the Opposition party or parties should have available to them research facilities and being able to pay for these services.  From 1938 until 1968 we had an Opposition allowance for <Col N="1998" /> secretarial purposes and from 1968 to date we have had an allowance not only for secretarial but for research purposes. Now we have the present Opposition who were the Government party in 1968 and who initiated this research and secretarial financial assistance now seeking to continue that which they established in 1968 in the form of their amendment.  The Government proposal is a totally new departure. That is that not only should there be allowances but that they should not only go to the Opposition but also in lesser measure and, indeed, as to 50 per cent rate, to the Government parties.  This clearly indicates that there now can be added, if either of these two amendments are passed, in the increase that is proposed in them, added on a <i>per capita</i> basis, if you like, to the award that has already been outlined in an earlier section in line with the proposals from the Employer/Labour Conference.  If you add these allowances spread over the Deputies of the various parties they will undoubtedly put the whole thought of conforming to the national wage agreement absolutely and completely out of gear.</P>
    <P>We cannot surely try to delude ourselves and those outside that what is proposed in either of these two amendments is other than an additional income to the Members of the parties sitting in this House.  I do not mean that they will get it doled out to them every month at so much per head.  Not at all.  This means that by the additional amount the parties will receive as a result of these payments, whether in Government or in Opposition, there will be a lesser call on the pockets of the members of the various parties, calls they would have to meet if this were not given to them.  I see this quite clearly as an additional emolument to the members of the parties in this House and, if the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference are not to be flouted, this surely cannot be agreed to.  I cannot see it in any other way.</P>
    <P>Do not let the Minister or anybody else come back and tell me this is something that Members of the House <Col N="1999" /> are getting but that it is not going to the Members of the House for their personal benefit; I say that it is to their personal benefit because, if it were not, they would be paying much more by way of party subscription, something which all members of all parties have had to pay traditionally all down through the years.  Under this measure, if they get so much from this, they will not have to pay so much to their own party and, that being the case, it is an actual addition to the allowances of Deputies, though we may call it allowances for the Opposition.  But that is a misnomer according to the amendment. It is an allowance to all the parties in this House and the fact that it is confined to the parties and to none who do not belong to a party proves the point that I am making and it can and truly must be regarded as an additional amount being paid over and above the limits set by the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations as presented to the last Government and now proposed to be put into operation by the present Government.  If there is to be any semblance of conforming to the recommendations of the Employer/ Labour Conference, which are trotted out by both sides when it suits them, then we should face up to the fact that will emerge if this measure is put through, whether as amended by the Minister or by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>These additional amounts will infringe the limits set by the Employer/ Labour Conference, as they see the position to be in conformity with the national wage agreement.  I am not saying now that the national wage agreement is something against which this matter should have been measured at all, but the fact that it was referred to for their perusal and their recommendation ties the hands, I submit, of the House to conforming to the recommendations, whether or not we agree the recommendations are right. There are quite a number of them with which I do not agree but, if we are going to conform, then, as the Minister said earlier today, there is a pattern to which we must keep and <Col N="2000" /> that is the pattern laid down by the recommendation of the Employer/ Labour Conference designed to keep us in conformity with the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>This particular section, as it stands, or as it may be amended, will bring about a situation wherein the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations will be publicly flouted and circumvented.  If that is what the House intends to do, then it would be far better to face up to that situation, unshackle ourselves of the conformity into which we have been driving ourselves, making a virtue of necessity in talking about the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference.  We should drop the sham and do what we think is the right thing to do and not be calling on the national wage agreement to support our case under one section and ignoring it in another section merely because it happens to suit our book. There has been a great deal of this double vision, this contradiction in terms, on both sides in regard to this measure.  The display we have had here during this debate vindicates my belief that any increase in the allowances to Deputies would be better diverted into providing proper pensions for Deputies' widows and dependants.</P>

I am trying to indicate that what we have arrived at in the small hours of Thursday morning, having started this particular stage on Tuesday afternoon, plainly and clearly indicates, as nothing else could, that the allowances proposed in <Col N="2001" /> this section, not to talk about earlier sections, are out of place, that they are shown to be unmerited, as is borne out by the display in this House, and, if this applies to the earlier sections with even greater force, that is something upon which I cannot comment at this particular point of time.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the only matter in issue here is whether or not, by utilising this particular role, the Government in office, the framers of the legislation now before us, can get a financial advantage to accrue to their backbench Members&mdash;that is, those outside of the immediate Government and Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;in the guise of giving increases in conformity with the national wage agreement, as recommended by the Employer/ Labour Conference while, on the other hand, the Opposition are seeking in their own way as a result of this same document recommending that various allowances be increased, to get more allowances for the Opposition, with no tags attached.  I think that fairly interprets what is proposed in this amendment.  The holy cow of research, the great volume of EEC documentation, and the increasing volume of work emerging in this House and the institutions associated with it, all these things are trotted out by both sides to show that they want the money for a very good cause, and the cause is to better inform the Deputy members of their respective parties so that they may contribute with greater understanding on all the matters that come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If members in both the Government and Opposition parties are so convinced and enthusiastic about the need and the justice there is in both their claims for these increased moneys, how do they reconcile that with leaving two sole Independent Deputies without any provision whatsoever being made for them?  It is not an oversight, because I would remind Deputies that I drew this to the attention of the House several days ago. Why should these other Deputies, because of the smallness of their numbers, be left in a far worse position to provide for themselves either secretarial or research facilities than any of the bigger parties if they <Col N="2002" /> never got a penny under this section, whatever way it is amended.  A great deal of hypocrisy has emerged from this discussion, and I believe that it is seen clearly for what it is outside this House, and it does not apply to one side of the House more than the other.  It is a question of &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack,&rdquo; so long as each side gets what it wants, which is more than they have been getting in the past and more than they are entitled to at present.  Their display in the past few days shows without any shadow of doubt that anything we are going to expend here would be far better expended in taking care of those who may be defeated in this House&mdash;who have given service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us confine ourselves to these particular allowances proposed in the amendments to the section, in the Opposition amendment and the Government amendment to their own amendment.  They would be better spent in improving the pensions of ex-Members of the House, their dependants, widows and families. That would be a far better thing in the long run than all this hoo-ha we have heard <i>ad nauseam</i> for the last day and a half.  Then we have the Minister at the same time indicating that, in addition to what has now been provided for research for the Opposition, on the one hand, a new sum has been provided for Government backbenchers that has never been provided in the past, that there will be set up a State agency to inform Deputies of all parties, on top of their own information and research, on various matters.  The Minister did make the suggestion that this office was being set up to inform the Independents in the House, who will get nothing from this Bill no matter what amendments are passed.  As somebody said earlier, a virtue is being made of necessity: you set up facilities for 141 Deputies and you can then point out there is some advantage in it for the two who have no service at the moment and for whom no provision is made in all <Col N="2003" /> the amendments that have been enumerated.</P>
      <P>The Opposition are not prepared to accept the intention of the Minister no matter how well expressed or no matter how well amended.  They want half price for the back benchers in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties and full price for Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil say: &ldquo;Let us have an Opposition allowance which is double what it was before and cut out all the trimmings.&rdquo;  In other words, they want their own version.  If that is the case, why waste the time of the House in trying to perfect something that is unacceptable?  They have made no bones about being against the proposals over the last day and a half. If they are not prepared to accept them, why go through the motions?</P>

      <P>I could.  I am going to finish, for the time being at any rate. I may have to get some matters clarified before the adjournment or should I say the interruption of business at 2 o'clock.  However, I shall be glad to hear the Leader of the Opposition on this matter.  No matter which amendment goes through, it makes no difference to me, but it shows the hollowness of the concern of both front benches about improving facilities for Deputies in order that they may contribute better to the House, because they ignore those who do not belong to their parties.  However, leaving out all the pros and cons of the amendments and the amendments to amendments, there is one version which will give to the Opposition an amount which will be for research and for secretarial assistance and, for the first time, will give half-rate moneys to the backbenchers on the Government side. As I understand it, Fianna Fáil categorically reject that.  If it is not, as I suggest, totally objectionable to Fianna Fáil, I have been labouring under a total misapprehension and maybe agreement is still possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, I believe agreement could have been reached on these <Col N="2004" /> matters long ago if only an hour had been given by a couple of sensible people from both sides of the House, but, instead, we are going through this sorry process of disagreement.  I would suggest again at this late, or early, hour that there should be a get-together on this matter rather than an adjournment which we have had twice already, so that something can be produced by the Minister.  Surely a solution could be found through consultation with a view to finding if this amendment, in any form, is capable of being accepted by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>If I might intervene at this stage, in view of the late hour and the fact that it is not likely that this section of the Bill will conclude tonight, I suggest that we might adjourn further discussion of it until 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock on Friday.  In the meantime, the amendments can be considered and we will deal with the Finance Bill tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is acceptable to us.  What I was going to say when Deputy Blaney put a question was that it appears that the obstinate and intransigent attitude of the Minister towards our proposals which sought to maintain a principle which has been long established&mdash;an attitude in marked contrast to the attitude adopted by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when he sat in on behalf of the Minister and when, I understand, he said that there was reason in the case the Opposition were putting but unfortunately he was not able to yield to it&mdash;will obviously prevail by reason of the numbers the Minister can command in support of his provisions.  At least in so far as he wants to put his provisions through the House, let us in the name of political sanity be sure that what the Minister wants to do is done properly.  I am glad the Taoiseach has made that suggestion and I gladly endorse it.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
