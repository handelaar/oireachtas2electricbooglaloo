    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is at present preparing for a conference with the British Government and leaders of the elected representatives of Northern Ireland which, it is hoped, will lead to the setting up of a Council of Ireland. It is envisaged that this council will, <i>inter alia,</i> promote increasing co-operation in many areas including those referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if, in his concept of the Council of Ireland, he envisages Britain still filling her role of dominance over and occupation of the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Ireland is envisaged by this Government as a bipartite body with representatives of the Government of the Republic and of the Executive of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's reply that it is at least in the Minister's mind that this Council of Ireland will be a two-party operation and that the ultimate in it would be that Britain would not hold any sway in regard to what it may or may not do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1708" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it has always been envisaged on our side as being a bipartite body with only representatives of the Government of the Republic and the Executive of Northern Ireland.  I think that is the situation.  I do not think I can add anything to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it has always been envisaged as a bipartite body.  This is the first indication we have had of this policy approach by the Government.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the major party in this island should not, in fact, be represented on the Council of Ireland or is he implying, in fact, that the Council of Ireland should merely be an executive functioning body and would not in fact operate in the same institutional manner as this House for instance or any other sovereign parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not implying anything.  I could not follow the Deputy's supplementary question.  Is he suggesting that it should be tripartite and the British Government should be members of it?  Is that the Deputy's suggestion?  I did not quite catch the whole of his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister takes that interpretation out of what I said but the Minister will understand that a representative Council of Ireland is a very important matter and it is a very important matter to ensure that it has the consensus of all the people.  That does not include the British Government, for the Minister's information.  I am simply asking the Minister if, in view of that, he does not recognise the need to make the council as representative as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I misunderstood the Deputy.  Perhaps it was a momentary inattention on my part. As a representative body naturally there should be parliamentary representation as well.  I am sorry if I did not make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may also have misunderstood my last supplementary question.  I will put the <Col N="1709" /> question in another way.  Might I ask the Minister whether, in fact, his idea of the two-party Council of Ireland does, in fact, exclude the British Government from the affairs of the territory of both participants in the Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Ireland, in carrying out its functions, will be doing so jointly by joint executive action of the Government of Northern Ireland and our Government and with appropriate involvement of the Parliament and the Assembly.  It is not envisaged on our side&mdash;I do not think it is envisaged at all&mdash;that the British Government will play a part in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When, if ever, can we expect to have a publication of the Government's proposals in relation to the Council of Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to publish the Government's negotiating position in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking in terms of the negotiating position. The Minister has given some indication as to what the Government have on their minds in some areas.  The Minister will appreciate that in view of Press speculation and information from informed sources it is rather important that this House should be aware of what the Government's proposals are so that we could take a serious and responsible view on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in certain respects indicated our position where this was necessary at this stage.  I do not envisage that there will be any further indication of that position in advance of the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>A resolution which provided <i>inter alia</i> for the establishment of an environment fund, to be financed from voluntary contributions, was recommended unanimously by the Stockholm Conference in June, 1972.  At the 27th session of the United Nations General Assembly in autumn, 1972 the same resolution was adopted without opposition.</P>
      <P>Ireland's Permanent Representative to the United Nations has indicated that Ireland will contribute to the fund.  A decision has yet to be made as to the amount of such contribution.</P>
      <P>A separate fund for assistance to developing countries was not proposed. However, the resolution referred to also provides for the provision of financial assistance on special terms from the fund to developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations supplies copies of all printed UN documents and publications to the Oireachtas Library as a depository library.  The report on the Stockholm Conference has not yet appeared in published form.  In the circumstances <Col N="1711" /> I am taking steps to have neostyled copies of the report placed in the Library as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second question the arrangements already referred to should normally be adequate to enable members of the Oireachtas to keep abreast of developments in the UN. However, my Department will be happy to make available to the Librarian, on request, copies of individual documents or publications in neostyled form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government are fully aware of our views on internment in Northern Ireland, including the conditions in which internees are detained.  The matter was raised again recently and, while it would not be useful to go into detail, the Deputy may be assured that the report referred to is being taken into account together with information from other sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that good example on our own part would be the most telling representation we could make to the <Col N="1712" /> British Government?  Would he ask his Government to consider the release of our Republican internees or that, pending their release, there should certainly be no more oppressive conditions applied to them than there are at Long Kesh?  I refer to the matter of visits by their relatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have any people who could by any stretch of the imagination be described as Republican internees and, therefore, the Deputy's question, as phrased, is irrelevant and inappropriate.  If he is referring to people imprisoned who have been convicted by our courts of offences under our law, any question about their treatment is not a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

Does the Minister think that is consistent with his readiness to go on a radio programme and freely and spontaneously answer questions from whatever source?  Is he suggesting that the Members of this House should engage in a phone-in, including the Minister for Finance, possibly the Taoiseach, Deputy Coogan and some others?

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to high and low tension electricity supply lines.</P>
      <P>In the case of low tension distribution it is the policy of the board to provide underground services in every sizeable new housing estate.  Regarding low tension overhead mains and services in town centres the board take advantage of any opportunity occurring to remove these.  This is very often done in conjunction with new lighting schemes for towns.</P>
      <P>In the case of transmission networks, the cost of underground cables is 12 to 15 times that of overhead lines.  Even the richest countries in the world do not use underground cables because of the cost involved and the reduced reliability which would ensue. The ESB, however, take special care in the routing of such transmission networks to avoid interference with the environment.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that they received some 30 applications for connection of direct heating systems in Tralee recently. These particular systems make heavy demands on the existing supply network, and considerable strengthening of the supply to the houses concerned, involving larger transformers and the replacement of lines and cables, will be necessary.  Because of the heavy work programme for rural areas in the Tralee district the necessary improvement works cannot be carried out before May, 1974.</P>

    <P>The board have made a temporary arrangement with the manufacturers of the heating system by which 15 of the installations will be connected to <Col N="1719" /> the supply on condition that their usage will be within agreed limits until the network improvements are completed. The imposition of limits is necessary to ensure that supply to other consumers in the area will not be affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Industrial Development Authority have received seven inquiries from promoters interested in establishing in the Ballingarry area.  These include the expansion of Carroll System Building Ltd. Ballingarry, which has been approved by IDA, and has a potential of 35 extra jobs; a project to employ 80 men initially at Callan which is under negotiation at present, and two small industry projects to employ six persons which have also been approved for the area.  In addition, the IDA have included the Ballingarry area on the itineraries of 20 industrial promoters in the past year, but no definite proposal for the area has been received as a result of these visits.  The IDA have acquired industrial sites in Callan and Fethard, and have now decided to build advance factories in these locations as a further incentive to industrial development in the Ballingarry designated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While, as I have indicated, some progress has been made in generating new <Col N="1724" /> jobs in the Ballingarry area, I am concerned to encourage more rapid development.  The building of the two advance factories and the higher grant facilities available because the area has been classified as a designated area should help to make the area attractive to industrialists.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given <Col N="1725" /> to similar questions by Deputies Dowling and Briscoe on 6th November, 1973.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the exact total cost of advertising the increases in prices recommended in the monthly reports of the National Prices Commission since March, 1973, is not yet known as final statements of account have not been received from the newspapers.

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that that precise question was put down by Deputy Dowling for answer today but was disallowed on the grounds that it was argumentative. The Minister did not seem to regard it as argumentative.  It is simply a question of fact.  The civil servants can tot up the items and the Minister can give us the information.  Is the Minister prepared to give us an answer now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, I am not able to give the answer now. The Deputy is fully aware that the NPC reports are published and that it is a fairly simple matter to go through them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there have been many other increases besides those many increases recommended by the NPC and sanctioned by the Minister?  Is the Minister not aware that the increase in VAT has resulted in increases in virtually every item other than food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> Therefore, there has been a direct increase in price in everything, apart from NPC recommendations and sanctions by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>No.  The Deputy cannot be as dense as not to understand the reasons.  The Deputy is not obtuse and dense.  I will take time to answer his question.  A particular item may be packed in seven different sizes of package and unless one has an agreed list as to whether that counts as one or seven items&mdash;and such list does not exist&mdash;and unless the list enumerates every item in the retail trade of the country it is not possible, as the Deputy well knows, to give a precise answer to the question asked. This has been asked to get by-election mileage out of it.  It is a silly, tendentious question.</P>

      <P>The object of the arrangements is to meet particular needs in the Force by providing training for specific posts requiring specialised knowledge, that is, training which cannot economically or adequately be provided as part of normal in-service training.  Various other specialist courses are, of course, already provided for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The needs of the Force in regard to specialised courses are primarily a matter for assessment by the Commissioner. I am informed by him that, for the present, these needs will be met, as far as specialised university courses are concerned, by sending two members on such courses.  The two members concerned were selected from sixty-five applicants following the issue of a circular to the Force inviting applications for the two places.

    <P>A scheme of compensation for injuries received in incidents such as last years bomb blasts is in an advanced stage of preparation.  I hope to <Col N="1737" /> be in a position to bring this scheme before Dáil Éireann in the near future.</P>
    <P>A claim has been received from the Prison Officers' Association for the extension to their members of provision for compensation for injuries received in the course of duty.  I have the claim under consideration at present in connection with the preparation of comprehensive proposals for the amendment of the Malicious Injuries Acts.

I can assure the House that they will not be niggardly, but it would not be appropriate for me, in advance of a formal Government decision in the matter, to give any further information to the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my constituency I have a case of a man whose motor car was very badly damaged and his whole livelihood interfered with as a result.  He has so far been proceeding on the basis of making a claim under the malicious injuries code.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters that was announced by me at that time was that the scheme would be retrospective to the 1st October, 1972.

Could I ask a supplementary in regard to Question No. 55 which the Minister took with Question No. 54 and which, as Deputy Haughey has pointed out, is a totally separate matter?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is no scheme covering prison officers, is it the practice of the Minister to make <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the officers, some of whom have been quite badly injured in the course of their employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he proposes, his words were, &ldquo;to tidy up&rdquo; the malicious injuries code.  Would he, in the examination of that code, which he presumably will conduct in relation to this tidying up process, have regard to the fact that a new situation is developing in regard to damage to private property, of which the case I mentioned is typical, where a person whose livelihood depends on a motor car can have that motor car completely destroyed or very seriously damaged. The malicious injuries code as it exists is completely inadequate and unsuitable for catering for cases of that sort.  Would the Minister bear in mind that in the case of the bombing of the North Strand during the war and in the case of the malicious destruction <Col N="1741" /> of Nelson's Pillar, the State intervened positively to introduce compensation. Surely this new type of case should qualify for a new type of machinery to compensate people who are at a very grievous loss in this way?</P>

    <Title>Courts Bill, 1973: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to provide for an increase from six to seven in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the High Court, to qualify &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; Circuit Court judges for appointment as permanent Circuit court judges or for re-appointment as &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges, and to remove doubts about certain appointments of Circuit Court judges made in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for an additional judge in the High Court, as provided for in section 1 of the Bill, arises from the increased volume of business that has occurred in that court in recent years, coupled with the fact that the full time of one judge has for some time been, and is still being, taken up with sittings of the Special Criminal Court.  The number of cases set down for hearing in the High Court has almost doubled in the past four years and a serious arrears position now exists.  In addition, it has not been possible to bring into operation the important provisions in sections 1 and 7 of the Marriages Act, 1972, because of the inability of the High Court to cope with the extra business <Col N="1750" /> that, it is considered, would result. Section 1 of that Act allows for exemptions by a judge of the High Court from the prohibition of marriage, where either party is under 16 years, while section 7 provides for the granting of consent by a High Court judge to marriage, where either party is under 21 years and the necessary consent of the parents or guardians has not been or cannot be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the normal growth which can be expected in the ordinary civil and criminal business of the High Court will ensure that the additional judge will be fully occupied, even after sittings of the Special Criminal Court cease. Also, the appointment of an additional High Court judge will mean that the recent assignment of one of the judges to hold the inquiry into security announced by the Taoiseach will not result in a worsening of the present situation in regard to the business of the court.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with the qualifications for appointment as a permanent or &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; Circuit Court Judge, Section 17 (2) (a) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961. and section 14 (1) of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, specify that the person to be appointed must be a practising barrister at the time of his appointment or in the case of permanent appointment, a barrister District Justice.  A person who is already acting temporarily as a Circuit Court judge might not be regarded as a practising barrister.  Section 2 of the Bill removes doubt by providing that, for the purpose of the appointment provisions just mentioned, service as a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; Circuit Court judge shall be deemed to be practice at the Bar.  In the past a number of &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; Circuit Court judges have been given either permanent or further temporary appointments.  Because of what I have said, there may be a doubt about these appointments.  Accordingly, section 2 also provides that service as a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judge shall be deemed always to have been practice at the Bar for the purpose of the qualification for appointment provisions both in relation to the former Circuit Court of Justice <Col N="1751" />&mdash;subsection (1)&mdash;and the present Circuit Court&mdash;subsection (2).</P>
    <P>I may add that section 2 is not without precedent.  A somewhat similar situation arose in the early days of the Courts when a High Court judge was appointed to the Supreme Court at a time when there was no statutory provision specifically qualifying a High Court judge for such appointment.  The problem was resolved by section 6 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, which, like section 2 of the Bill, was framed so as to have retrospective effect.  Later on it was found that a judge of the Supreme Court was not in terms qualified for appointment as President of the High Court.  This defect in the law was cured in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the arrears situation that exists in the High Court. There are also substantial arrears in the Circuit Court, particularly in Dublin, where there has been a considerable increase in criminal business. Again, the problem has been aggravated by the fact that the time of one Circuit judge is occupied in the Special Criminal Court.  The question of increasing on a permanent basis the existing statutory number of ten Circuit Court judges&mdash;including the President of the Court&mdash;is at present being examined.  In the meantime, arrangements are being made to have an additional `temporary' Circuit Court judge appointed for a period of one year.  This appointment will mean an increase in the number of Circuit judges&mdash;whether permanent or temporary&mdash;from 11 to 12.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned about the serious arrears position in the High and Circuit Courts.  Appointing extra judges is a most important factor in improving the position but the procedural machinery in the courts must be examined to see how it can be changed or streamlined or both so as to ensure that a citizen with a cause of action gets a speedy hearing.  At the moment, from the time a case is ready for hearing, that is with all the preliminary paper work done and there is an amount of that, until it is actually heard, there is a delay of 12 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> This delay is driving people into unfavourable settlements.  This autumn there were close on 1,000 cases awaiting hearing in the High Court.  One of my ambitions as Minister for Justice is to see a scheme of legal aid in civil business but, quite frankly, such a scheme would be largely nullified by the present clogged position in the courts.</P>
    <P>There is no instant solution available to me for if I had one I would have adopted it before now.  While the problem because of its complexity cannot be dealt with instantly, it can be dealt with urgently.  This Bill is an earnest of my desire to do this and, in addition. I am having an urgent study made as to the implementation of some reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which have been lying in my Department for some time and which contain recommendations and suggest changes which could help substantially in improving the position.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware from my own knowledge and from representations from members to me of the injustice being done to some citizens in this context and I share their anxiety to remedy this injustice.  The Bill now before the House is, therefore, an important one in achieving the remedy and I recommend it to Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister referred to the ministerial ambition to have civil business taken within the scope of free legal aid.  This was an ambition of the former Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, and he worked extremely hard in that direction.  For the time being, at least, it is the business of the present Minister for Justice to carry on that work and to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that a scheme of free legal aid in civil business is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I placed a Parliamentary question two weeks ago on this matter.  The Minister could not be here because he was out of the country on official business.  The Minister for Lands replied adequately on his behalf but he was evasive in reply to my question about the matter of introducing a scheme of free legal aid in civil business. Now the Minister produces this <Col N="1753" /> chestnut.  Let me assure him that I will do everything I can in Opposition to assist him and to ensure that his ambition in this matter is realised.</P>
    <P>As the Minister says, it is fair to say that the High Court in particular is pretty over burdened with work.  It is obvious that the scope and depth of the legislation with which the High Court has to deal have expanded enormously due to modern conditions. If people cannot have disputes resolved with reasonable expedition, apart from the justice of the case, that is bad economically.  If litigants show up for a whole day in court with witnesses on tap, as it were, and are sent away and told to come back another day because of the overcrowded state of the lists, that is bad economically as well as being likely to work an injustice against the best interests of the litigants.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that there is a backlog of 1,000 cases in the High Court lists at present.  I have not got the full figures on that point but, arising from my own experience in the short time since I returned to the Bar, and also from information I received from my colleagues when the Courts Bill came before the House &mdash;naturally I referred to the back-up group with which I am associated in the social and individual rights committee of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I know that in the service of notice of trial in civil jury actions there is a backlog of somewhere in the region of a year.  This is a hardship in two ways.  The plaintiff is kept out of his money and, if the defendant makes a lodgement, the money values are eroded considerably, by the time the case is heard, having regard to the inflationary times in which we are living. The lodgment is accepted and the case is compromised as the legal people are about to go into court and have the case decided by a jury.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the Circuit Court.  To my own certain knowledge there is a backlog there of up to one and a half years and I understand that there is an inflow of six indictable offences daily into the Attorney General's office.  This is quite a considerable inflow of cases.  It is <Col N="1754" /> quite understandable that the Minister should express concern about the need for an increase in the number of judges in the High Court.  I have no doubt that he will also consider the very urgent need of another increase in the number of Circuit Court judges in the near future.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the matter of the clogging of the list with cases, as it were, and so on.  From time immemorial, the judge in charge of a particular courts list&mdash;in our case the president of the respective court&mdash;has always been sensitive to criticism that there are delays.  The fact is sometimes overlooked that as well as trying cases judges carry a large administrative load&mdash;that certainly applies to the president of the various courts.  The men who must carry out these administrative duties can feel quite blameless about any delays there might be and, indeed, they are to be congratulated for coping with such heavy lists.</P>
    <P>For instance, time may be set aside for a case which cannot get on.  In such circumstances the judge may feel frustrated but, in the last analysis, the important thing is not the state of any list but the quality of justice. Again, sometimes the fact is overlooked that the judge may need time to prepare written judgements&mdash;this is done in what appears to be his off time.  For example, in the Supreme Court the full court must sit where the constitutionality of an Act of the Oireachtas is challenged and, by custom, where any important question is debated it is usual to have the full court of five.  That is a matter for the direction of the Chief Justice but practitioners and litigants feel let down if the full court is not assembled to hear important issues debated.  If a court of three hears such a case and if the decision is not unanimous, there is always a feeling that the two other judges might have made a difference.</P>
    <P>Courts of three debate fairly straightforward accident case appeals and the like.  The Supreme Court judges circuit appeals and, as such, act as High Court judges.  There are two schools of thought on this matter. <Col N="1755" /> First, it is considered that the Supreme Court judges no longer should be required to do this in view of the heavier work load with which they must cope.  The other view is that it is important that they keep in touch with everyday litigation so that they do not become too remote from the cut and thrust of litigation. I submit the answer to the second point is that the Chief Justice traditionally does not perform this task and is none the worse for that.  A strong case can be made for having a reserve judge in the Supreme Court and thus the two views could be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Courts of five would be available always, barring illness.  A judge might be given time off to prepare a judgment or he might assist in hearing circuit appeals.  As the Minister knows, the 12th Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended the appointment of an additional Circuit Court judge.  In my opening remarks I expressed a desire for the creation of an extra Circuit Court judge.  I imagine the Minister intends withholding the appointment of this additional judge until a decision is taken on the other recommendations on the revision of circuits contained in the 12th Report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy, but I have stated we are appointing immediately a further Circuit Court judge to bring the complement to 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I meant in addition to that.  In his speech the Minister on two occasions referred to the Special Criminal Court and the fact that this court uses up the time of a judge.  The continuance of this court is a matter for the Government and we submit its operation should be kept under review.  As long as the national security requires it, we will support its continued existence.  I want to say that without any equivocation whatever.  I should like to pay tribute to the judges who have served with integrity and courage on the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that the <Col N="1756" /> right to trial by jury is precious and we must not regard with levity any long dispensation from it.  However, as long as the democratic institutions of the State are under attack, as long as the security of the State demands it, I repeat deliberately that we will support without doubt the continuance of the Special Criminal Court.  We did our duty in that respect when it was demanded of us and we will continue to uphold democracy.  Despite what has been written about Fianna Fáil by what could be described as &ldquo;Coalition pamphleteers&rdquo; in the recent past, as a democratic party we are dedicated to upholding the institutions of this country.</P>
    <P>Another example of the service judges give is provided by the appointment of Mr. Justice Finlay to head the Taoiseach's inquiry on security.  I would sound a note of caution here, not in relation to the judge but in relation to his office and its separation from the Executive.  The Government propaganda service was hard at work before this appointment was announced officially.  We had the announcement continually from some high Government spokesman three or four days before the official announcement.  The Government should be careful when they behave in this fashion, when they try to make propaganda out of the situation for their own advantage.  This is in no way to disparage the learned and respected judge who had nothing to do with that; from my slight personal knowledge of him, I know he would not accept that kind of publicity. He is a man of great integrity, he has the highest respect of the legal profession, and I am not being critical of him in relation to his appointment.</P>
    <P>Under our Constitution, we have a strict separation of powers and it is as well to point out that there is not this separation of powers in England. Therefore, while I have no objection to a judge heading a tribunal of inquiry which sits in public, under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, I have reservations&mdash;I put it no higher than that&mdash;about asking a judge to report, which must also mean advise on security.  The security of the State rests fairly and squarely on the <Col N="1757" /> shoulders of the Government and they must accept that responsibility.  I would urge them not to attempt to shrug off that responsibility.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach's inquiry headed by this respected judge to be held in secret?  An element of secrecy is understandable where a question of security is involved.  The judge's role traditionally is so different.  He never sits completely in private.  <i>Bona fide</i> representatives of the Press are always allowed.  A few applications may be heard in chambers.  He administers justice and proclaims the law.</P>
    <P>To recap: there are a number of matters which, to my knowledge, he hears in chambers, income taxation, appeals from the commissioners of Appeal and legitimacy matters.  There are other matters including matrimonial matters but they do not occur to me at the moment.  It is proper that income taxation, matrimonial and legitimacy issues should be tested in private, safe from the scrutiny of publicity.  These are private matters and should remain private.</P>
    <P>A judge decides whether an Act is repugnant to the Constitution.  This is on the question of the separation of powers.  By that he faults the Legislature. He may strike down Executive decisions as being <i>ultra vires</i> or made without regard to the principles of natural justice.  The principles of natural justice mean that a man has a right to be heard in his own case.  On the question of matters being ruled <i>ultra vires,</i> the recent case of Murphy <i>v.</i> Dublin Corporation and the Minister for Local Government was a good example, where the Supreme Court overruled the claim to departmental privilege.  The public weal was more important than the need for candour.  There is a necessary tension between the Legislative and Executive side on the one hand and the Judiciary on the other.  This is as it should be under our Constitution. That is why I have doubts about the propriety of asking a judge to head such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Without question the respected Judge Finlay will bring to the judicial inquiry his usual incisiveness and <Col N="1758" /> clarity of thought.  The public have great faith in his integrity.  These points are beyond dispute, but I consider that these gifts and rights should be reserved to his judicial sphere. These observations are not made in a carping fashion or in a spirit of disharmony. It is simply a point of view. The more we buttress the independence of the judges the greater hope we have for preserving our democracy.</P>
    <P>Having dealt specifically with the Minister's speech, I should now like to make my observations on specific sections.  Section 1 deals with the number of ordinary judges of the High Court, which shall now not be more than seven.  That is acceptable to us. Is section 2 necessary?  I know the Minister has not come into this House with a section that is not required, but a number of temporary appointments have been made in the past which were given the stamp of permanency. What is the position of those people?</P>
    <P>I perused sections 37 and 43 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, and section 17 (2) (a) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, in depth and examined the Bill before us.  When I concluded my examination I felt that this was a painful piece of drafting.  That is the first point.  The second has already been posed.  What is the position of the judges appointed to temporary positions and given permanent Circuit Court appointments? Is their position dealt with in this Act?  The answer to that may be yes.  However, on Committee Stage we can deal more fully with the Bill and the sections.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the heavily overworked circuit of the city and of the county of Dublin.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure did not recommend&mdash;I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am incorrect&mdash; that all South County Dublin should be transferred to the Dublin Metropolitan District, except the electoral area of Rathmichael, which should still be retained in the Bray Court area.  The report, which is dated 26th August, 1970, is, I have no doubt, now <Col N="1759" /> out of date.  This is in no way a criticism of the people who volunteered their services on this very worthy committee.  A very strong case can be made for a court in the township on Dún Laoghaire as follows: (a) that all civil business for South County Dublin should be transacted in Dún Laoghaire; (b) that all licensing work should be transacted in Dún Laoghaire; (c) that the summary work to be transacted in Dún Laoghaire should be clarified; (d) that in fact a new court area for Dún Laoghaire and Bray would be the obvious solution to the problem.  As I understand it, there is nothing in the report about the establishment of a Circuit Court in either Bray or Dún Laoghaire.  In my respectful submission, this seems extraordinary since the committee recommends the establishment of a court in Tuam.</P>

      <P>I just want to get it on the record.  I shall not detain the House much longer and I shall deal with the particular matter in the course of a sentence or two, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will bear with me.  I was making the point that the committee recommends the establishment of a Circuit Court in Tuam which is 20 miles from Galway city. There is a vast expanse of territory between Dublin city and Wicklow which is very highly populated.  It seems extraordinary that, if a Circuit Court is to sit in Tuam, a claim for a Circuit Court to sit in Dún Laoghaire or Bray should not even be considered. I would ask the Minister&mdash;again this is no criticism of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure&mdash;to deal specifically with the possibility of the creation of a Circuit Court in this huge densely populated area.  This area is growing all the time, as is witnessed by the proposed gerrymander of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency into the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; to give an idea of the population growth.  The constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is now to be given the title of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  This is indicative of the vast population growth in bringing about the required constitutional tolerance electorate per Deputy, not more than 30,000 and not less than 20,000, and this surely is indicative of the urgent need for a fully-fledged&mdash;forgive the unlegal expression&mdash;Circuit Court in the Dún Laoghaire area.</P>
      <P>Where the sections are concerned, we shall have to listen to the Minister's reply to those Deputies who contribute after me before we can consider permitting the Committee Stage to be taken today.  It is my intention at all times to facilitate the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can fully appreciate the Minister's desire to increase the number of judges, whether it be in the Circuit Court or the High Court, in order to facilitate the long-suffering public.  I emphasise the &ldquo;long-suffering&rdquo;, something which is indicated in the Minister's own speech.  We look at the figures and facts in regard to High Court cases.  Those set down for hearing have almost doubled in the last four years.  We take into account also his indications as to the increasing volume of business on the Circuit Court side and it would appear at first sight that the proposals in the Bill for increasing the numbers of judges in both these cases are supported by an open and shut case.  It seems a very reasonable request.  Without question, that would be the case were it not for recent operations by the last Government and by the present Government in the utilisation of the time of our judges, who are in very short supply, judges whose services the public badly require in order to mitigate their hardships and sufferings in so far as <Col N="1761" /> unheard and undecided cases of all kinds are concerned.</P>
      <P>Despite the increasing burden of work, almost doubled in the last four years, we find that we can take a full-time High Court judge out of the existing maximum of six and allow him to devote his time to the very questionable operations of the Special Criminal Court.  It would be difficult for any Minister to come in here and ask for an increase against this background but it is nothing short of impossible for the present Minister.  I suppose one can only have a certain amount of sympathy for him.  He was very emphatic, very clear and very precise, as he so often is, in the providing of the machinery whereby the Special Criminal Court, having been put into action, was given sufficient work to entail the services of a full-time, fully-fledged High Court judge.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that the Minister in this case in particular would immediately have taken the obvious remedy to relieve the situation in the interests of the public, whom we are all here supposedly to serve, and that he would have made every effort to refuse to come in here to seek that which he is now seeking in this Bill, namely, additional judges, while he has a High Court judge taken up wholetime in the Special Criminal Court administering that very questionable piece of legislation passed through this House less than a year ago in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972.  I fail to understand how he has been pushed into the position of coming before us in this shamefaced way to build up the numbers of High Court judges in order to give a minimum service to the public, the public whose interests it should be the first consideration of the courts to serve.  That should be their prime consideration and I do not think what one of them is doing at the moment is in the interests of the public or in the interests of the State now or in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently we have had the situation of yet another High Court judge being taken to preside over a body appointed to inquire into security.  This was announced by the <Col N="1762" /> Taoiseach recently following on the helicopter snatch from Mountjoy.  I believe, and I think most of the public would be of the same opinion, that far too much was made of that particular snatch.  Certainly the results arising from it do not justify the abstraction of yet another all too scarce High Court judge being taken from his normal work to preside over an inquiry to inquire into whatever it is.  I just do not know but I think it is wrong that in these circumstances two much needed High Court judges, whose courts have large backlogs with people waiting over a year to have their cases heard, with many in great hardship as a result, should be put on other work.  That would be fine if we had judges to spare.</P>
    <P>There are no better people perhaps to present to the public as being impartial and to give a good image to any inquiry, no matter what it might be about, but to take them in our circumstances with the grave shortage and the large backlog of work is nothing short of scandalous in this particular circumstances which only occurred as a result of a once-and-for-all, unique and imaginative jail break by way of a helicopter snatch out of the square at Mountjoy.  The Government should have grinned and borne the consequences of the laugh that was being had at them at the time rather than getting all hot and bothered and jumping in to set up an inquiry into security, drawing out of the hat a very respected High Court judge to put a front on things and then coming into this House and announcing that it would be a secret inquiry, the results of which would come to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should appreciate that we cannot discuss this matter on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not even attempting to discuss it.  What I am doing is trying to indicate how ridiculous it is to be utilising the time of all too scarce a commodity, namely, High Court judges, and proposing at the same time in this House today to <Col N="1763" /> legislate so as to provide more of them while we wastefully use what we have of them.</P>
      <P>That is the situation as I see it and as I think a great deal of the public must also see it.  They must treat with some disdain, if not outright disbelief, the offerings of concern by the Minister for the well-being of those who are awaiting hearings in the High Court.  Do they consider those things I have been mentioning and this inquiry in particular so important that they should continue to be deprived of justice being administered by those who are qualified to do so?  I do not believe they accept that this is a genuine, good reason for their being further discommoded in this particular regard.</P>
      <P>To get this secret inquiry we have a High Court judge giving his full time to it.  To what avail if he can neither hear in public nor report to the public his findings?  Is it not an utter waste of his time?  Is it not something that can and should be laughed out of existence rather than taken seriously? The Taoiseach gets the result, the rest of us do not.  The judge will have spent his time on it very wisely I have no doubt, devoting his energy and ability to it.  To what purpose?  For whose knowledge?  For whose benefit? Is it merely to inform confidently the Leader of the Opposition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I get very annoyed about this because I happen to be involved in a case that has been before the High Court since this time last year.  It was sent up from the District Court and it has not yet been heard nor has it even been put down for hearing.  Fortunately, it is one that does not bother me or those associated with me in this matter too much but it is a scandalous situation.  Surely the interests of the 1,000 people who are awaiting hearings, the administration of justice and determination of their cases are far more important than this hare-chasing created by this alleged <Col N="1764" /> secret inquiry.  Let us have it by all means if it satisfies people but do not let us waste the time of High Court judges who are already overburdened to the degree that they have been falling behind badly in the hearing of cases.  There are two I would make a present of to the Minister right away and he does not need legislation at all. Let the High Court judge out of the Special Court and get this man who is being assigned to the inquiry.  Release him and get somebody else.  I am sure there must be somebody else who could carry this out, maybe not with the same public face on it but certainly with the same efficiency.  It is about nothing really and it is not going to be reported to anybody so what is the difference in the long run?  It is merely an effort to cover up, a face-saver, an indication to the British people that we are doing their bidding even better than they are doing it themselves.</P>
      <P>I started off on the basis that I felt sorry, in the circumstances, for the Minister, who has been forced into this position with the knowledge of the expressed mind that he gave here in the House on these and related matters that are now taking up the time of judges, whom his Department so badly needs to carry out the duties they are assigned to, that we have to have special legislation to create new ones to fill in for those who are doing things that the present Minister, in fact, does not believe should be done at all, any more than I do.  It is a sorry situation and I sympathise with him but I would suggest that, even if this is to go through without any big opposition to it, because of the heavy backlog that exists we still need those who are taken up on the Special Criminal Court and on this silly face-saving inquiry.  Let us have them as well if we are to have these additional ones.  Let us have our own two back and give us another one if we must have him in order that the public should get their cases heard within a reasonable time as they are entitled to and not be put on the long finger with all sorts of additional hardships being created as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing can be said in regard to the Circuit Court judge and the shortage there and the backlog in <Col N="1765" /> that particular court.  We are wastefully using, I would go so far as to say misusing, the time of the Circuit Court judge in the Special Criminal Court.  I implore the Minister and his colleagues behind him to have a thought, it will soon be anniversary time and it is a good time to think back, as to whether their expressed, pronounced, emphatic first thoughts on the debate on the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act should not be revised and whether there is not reason, now that they are in Government, to go back to their first and very definite thoughts and convictions that that Act should never have come into being and if it did should now be repealed.  As a result, there would be released two useful judges who could be doing the work they were appointed to do in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Fianna Fáil Party whose spokesman has been at great pains&mdash;I think he said he was greatly pained&mdash;to push the idea that this whole thing of the special courts and the utilisation of those judges should be kept under review.  Am I to take it from that that the Fianna Fáil Party have had this thought under review and that they have changed their stance from this time last year and that time has made a change?</P>

      <P>I hear much talk of hawks and doves over there.  They have a slightly different way of looking at things now and have seen them more clearly, as time has now indicated. The passage of time is making this very clear.  I am asking, in order that we should have more facilities in our courts, that we should throw out anything that is unnecessarily taking up the time of the judges.  There may have been a change of heart on the part of the Government or on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  What is the difference?  Let us have change, if it is proper to have change.  Let us have these people and utilise them in the interests in which they were first appointed.</P>
      <P>We should not clutter up our courts any further.  It is a poor service to our people to do so.  They are paying for the whole show, including ourselves here who talk or do not talk, who are silent or otherwise, who are doves or hawks.  The public are paying for all and they are entitled to service. When they themselves have difficulties, legal or otherwise, they must have recourse to our courts.  In their difficulties and dilemmas they are entitled to service from the people whom we solemnly appointed.  Let us be fair to the judges we have.  There is a case for having more judges.  Let us see if we can improve on the additions asked for in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could we now get back those two very necessary people who have been taken from the High Court and the Circuit Court?  They are a fair percentage of the total manpower at that <Col N="1767" /> level.  Let us have them back.  Let us have extra judges and give service to the community.  The public are entitled to such service.  I am sure that this will appeal to the Minister with his persuasiveness and his preciseness, if he can get this point across to his colleagues in Government.  This is the way it should be rather than have a half-hearted effort to stop the gaps and plug the holes in the system created by other actions of the House. In other words, we make a hole and come back with some kind of strainer to stop the leak.  Why not get the people back to the business for which they were appointed to do?</P>
    <P>An attempt should be made to give a full and expeditious service in the courts at all levels to our long suffering citizens who have the misfortune or otherwise to have recourse to these institutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at a spokesman for Justice supposing that a Deputy other than a Minister might not have something to say about a speech, or might not say it.  The Deputy belongs to a party which, in my recollection, appointed judges&mdash; probably quite rightly&mdash;to decide on two matters which were not of a judicial nature.  I am open to correction if my memory is at fault.  A committee <Col N="1768" /> on the conditions of service of the Garda Síochána was presided over by Judge Conroy.  A commission on the price of building land was set up by the Government which Deputy Andrews supported and was chaired by Judge Kenny.  A warning was not sounded on these occasions, nor was there a note of caution.  I do not see why such a note should have been sounded.  I see nothing wrong with using a judge for a purpose like this, provided it does not mean that the entire administration of justice will break down in the way Deputy Blaney suggested.</P>
      <P>Apart from these two matters, which were entirely non-judicial, the last Government saw no harm in appointing judges to conduct inquiries which, though not so far from the administration of justice as those two instances, were still a long way from their ordinary work in the courts.  The visitations which have taken place in the National University from time to time, in which matters of not merely the application of university statutes but matters of an academic kind have been considered, have been carried out by judges.  About three years ago the last Government appointed a judicial commission which cost an enormous amount of money in failing to prove allegations which the second last Minister for Justice had made about a television programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of that I am not taking Deputy Andrews very seriously when he tells us that a note of caution should be sounded.  The division of powers is not just an empty academic phrase; it has force and it ought to be suspected.  But I do not think there is anything inherently suspect in a situation where a judge is asked to decide on something not primarily judicial.  Judges are business-like men. On average they have 15 or 20 years' practice behind them in which they have seen all sides of life from all angles.  They have developed a perspective of a situation and of a system which those involved in conducting such a system, or which those involved at the centre of the operation may not have.  They are trained to detect the gaps which arise.  That <Col N="1769" /> has been the essence of their professional life even before they reached the bench.  I do not see anything wrong with having one of the judges decide the question here.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Deputy said he did not know whether the inquiry would be held in public or private. The Taoiseach said that the inquiry would not be held in public.  It will be held in private.  The average court proceeding is held in public but the law is full of exceptions to the contrary.  I have here a list of the exceptions accepted in the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1961. They include applications of an urgent nature for relief by way of <i>habeas corpus,</i> bail prohibition or injunction, which can be heard in private.  So may matrimonial cases and matters, and lunacy and minor matters, and proceedings involving the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process.</P>
    <P>These are four instances which, collectively, cover a great deal of ground and they are in addition, as the Act makes clear, to other exceptions which were put into the law previously, one of which is a case in which the nature of the evidence is indecent or obscene; in such circumstances a judge has discretion to clear his court.  Therefore, if anyone either inside or outside the House is impressed by this note of warning sounded by Deputy Andrews, I would like to add a footnote that he has succeeded in giving the impression that there is something very unusual in a judge conducting his affairs in private, he is giving a wrong impression.</P>

      <P>When I am on the receiving end of sneers from the other side of the House, I get the impression that I have reached something.  Without prejudice to the question of recognising that a note of caution, as Deputy Andrews puts it, is not out of place in a matter like this, an inquiry of an unusual kind is a serious matter, but the two matters adverted to by the Deputy are beside the mark.  There was the question of whether judges should be used at all in such inquiries and also whether, when they are used, proceedings should be in private or in public. The Deputy is a sensible enough man of the world to realise that an inquiry on security matters cannot be dealt with in public and that whatever advice or report is given by the judge cannot be delivered in public either: otherwise, the inquiry would be of no value.  Where, therefore, is the relevance of the Deputy's reference to the question mark which must hang over work done by a judge other than in public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding I wish to advert to some of what was said by Deputy Blaney during his contribution.  I regret that the Deputy has not remained in the House to listen but I hope he will allow me to get far enough away from the centre of this Bill to say what I wish to say now without being ruled out of order.  Deputy Blaney expressed much concern in regard to a judge being taken away from his ordinary duties in order to conduct an inquiry into a defect in the security arrangements of the State, a defect that has been revealed by the helicopter rescue at Mountjoy.  I hope the Chair will <Col N="1771" /> allow me the opportunity of adverting to the Deputy's last contribution, which was made outside the Rules of Order of this House following the statements of the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition a couple of weeks ago.  At that time the Deputy said that Deputies on both sides of the House were delighted because of the helicopter operation.  Some soft-witted journalist&mdash;I cannot remember who he was and I am sorry if I am offending some one I know personally&mdash;wrote subsequently in a Dublin paper that it was significant that that remark of Deputy Blaney's had been allowed to remain on the record without anybody at least saying that the Deputy did not speak for him.  Of course, nothing that happens here goes without notice in the North, so I was not in the least surprised when three days later I found in the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> that the Dublin journalist's remark had been picked up and used in an editorial in which the readers of that paper were invited to reflect on the genuineness of the attachment of the Members of this House to the institutions of State when no one had stood up to disagree with Deputy Blaney.</P>
    <P>Those of us who were in the House at the time remember that incident and we know that to have intervened would have been as disorderly as was the Deputy's intervention.  However, lest it should be said against me that I neglected the opportunity to do so, I put it on the record now that Deputy Blaney was not speaking for me and that I reject any implication that might involve me in what he said. I believe that I speak also for my entire party in saying that as well as for the other party which form this Government.  The party on the other side can speak for themselves as and when they find an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney spoke of the questionable operation of the Special Criminal Court.  I was not absolutely clear as to whether he objected to the Special Criminal Court as such or whether it was the fact of the court operating the 1972 Offences Against <Col N="1772" /> the State Act to which he objected so strongly.  If he objects to the court as such he ought to say it openly.  It is hardly an unfair interpretation of some of what he said during the past half hour to say that he dislikes the Special Criminal Court.  Let me say that we all dislike any kind of special or exceptional justice.  I hope I speak for the gentlemen opposite in saying that.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, it seems to me that you allowed Deputy Blaney to speak in a general way about the Special Criminal Courts and about the waste of a good High Court judge being engaged in the Special Courts.  I would have thought, therefore, that a few words in regard to the Special Criminal Courts would not have been out of place.</P>

      <P>The Chair is trying to avoid getting away from the Bill, which concerns an increase in the number of judges, but it would not be in order to have a discussion on the Special Criminal Courts as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I respect your ruling and would say in a general way that, although everybody has more or less the same feelings about the use of a High Court or any other judge in a setting which is abnormal, it is not right to consider the matter without asking whose fault it is that this situation has been arrived at. Whose fault is it that this has happened?  Whose fault is it that we are short of judges to carry out the ordinary work to which Deputy Blaney adverted?  I accept that it was a factor in the High Court and Circuit Court.  The fault lies in the people who will not let the ordinary justice work in the ordinary way.  I am sorry to say this&mdash;not sorry to say it, but sorry to leave myself open to the charge of being acrimonious.  It is not so long since the spectacle was common of District Court proceedings being regularly accompanied by the parading of men with placards outside, and cordons of gardaí being addressed by men using loud hailers and exhorting them to dessert their duty and take a course of action other than that which they were commanded to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> At the time I protested about that. I said then that this was going on, not with the connivance but at any rate with the tolerance of the then Government. It caused great annoyance to Deputy O'Malley at the time, but I am still waiting for a prosecution to take place based on the events of those days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not mention the continuous attacks by Deputy L'Estrange on district justices in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why a court of this kind has to function is because the kind of people we have in this country, and who have been insufficiently kept down in the past, will not allow any other type of court to function. The only sort of justice which will work via a jury is a justice in which a juryman can feel just as safe whether he convicts or acquits the prisoner.  He should be able to feel safe to go home to his wife and family in the evening, without any fear that anybody is going to be victimised, without any fear that somebody is going to be boycotted or picketed, to leave aside any mention of anything worse than that.</P>
      <P>Once those conditions disappear, once you have an atmosphere of fear and bullying in the air, you cannot run a jury system.  I am sorry to have to say that so bluntly.  I am aware that I will be accused of delivering a lecture, but it is the truth even if couched in that kind of form.  We cannot conduct a jury system if we have people who will not allow a jury system to work. That is the reason, and I am sorry Deputy Blaney is not here to hear it, why judges have to be taken away from their ordinary duties and sent to preside over a court which I hope will quickly disappear because the conditions which have given rise to it will also have disappeared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few brief words about this Bill.  I thought when I read it that it was a perfectly straightforward non-controversial Bill but, having listened to the last speaker one would have doubts regarding it.  It is extraordinary that <Col N="1775" /> every time Professor Kelly comes to address the House he creates trouble and acrimony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Deputy Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry about that. Deputy Kelly creates acrimony about the most simple and straightforward matters.  I heard most of what Deputy Andrews had to say and I could not see how anybody could take offence from it.  Nonetheless Deputy Andrews is attacked, with some bitterness, by Deputy Kelly.  It does not help the passage of important and useful legislation through this House that such a simple and straightforward Bill as this should give rise to such acrimony.  However, that is Deputy Kelly's, and his party's problem rather than mine or anybody on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say about the Bill is that it is proposing to have an additional permanent ordinary High Court judge.  I have no great objection in principle to that but I think it is only right to point out that the need for this judge can be met in ways other than the appointment of an extra judge.  The most obvious way in which the undoubted backlog of work which is there at the moment could be overcome, partly at least, is by a change in the systems of court sittings.  We have an extraordinary situation in this country in that there is a long vacation in the courts which lasts for two months.  This vacation applies to the Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court and during this time, the months of August and September, virtually no work is done.  There are vacation sittings for an hour or two on one day a fortnight in the High Court but outside of that no work is done during that two month period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that two month vacation there is a two week vacation at Christmas, there is a one week or ten day vacation at Easter, and there is a vacation of one week at Whit.  These four vacations divide the four terms in the legal year.  Apart from ourselves and England it is not customary in other countries to have these prolonged vacations of the courts.  It is <Col N="1776" /> not regarded in other countries as necessary to have such long vacations in the courts.  I wonder is it necessary to have such long vacations here.  A change in that system, in my view, would do a great deal to lessen, if not to remove altogether, the backlog of work.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Minister in his speech to reports and recommendations of the committee of which Mr. Justice Walsh was chairman and which advised on the revision of court practice and procedure.  Undoubtedly there were many very valuable recommendations in those reports.  Many of them have already been implemented and I hope that the great bulk of the rest of them will be implemented within a short time. There is one note which runs through all those reports and recommendations and that is a sort of basic acceptance of the present basic system.  I think it is no harm that some people should begin to question whether the whole basic system of court procedure which we inherited 50 odd years ago is in fact beneficial or necessary in this country.</P>
    <P>We have heard today from the Minister that the delay between the time an action is set down for hearing and the time it is actually heard in the High Court is about 12 months. That is very disturbing but what is equally disturbing is the fact that before you can get to the stage where you can get the action down for trial a preliminary procedure has to be gone through which, in practice, usually takes about 12 months also. The number of pleadings and the number of stages in the pleadings to my mind is totally unnecessary and creates work and delay.</P>
    <P>In my view it would be no harm to run through the stages that have to be gone through before one can get to the stage of putting an action down for hearing and starting one on a 12 month wait.  A plenary summons has to be issued by the plaintiff, the other side enters an appearance to that, another document.  The plaintiff then issues a second document called a statement of claim.  The defendant then sends him a notice for particulars <Col N="1777" /> arising out of the statement of claim.  The plaintiff, after he has obtained all the necessary information, has to send back a reply to the notice for particulars and when the defendant has assimilated all that he prepares his defence and files it.  When that has been done the plaintiff considers and files what is called the reply to the defence.  At that stage notice of trial can be served.</P>
    <P>These are the basic steps that have to be taken in every action.  There are various other steps which in some actions may have to be taken. The average delay in going through all those procedural steps of pleading in advance is about 12 months, sometimes it is more.  The result now is that it is impossible, even with the greatest expedition on all sides, to get a case, a simple straightforward civil case in the High Court, on for hearing within two years of the accident or other incident out of which it arises.  It is wrong that people should have to wait a minimum of two years to have a matter adjudicated upon.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in this Bill may go some way towards lessening some part of it.  It will lessen the 12 months period of waiting after the case has been set down for trial, but it will do nothing whatever to shorten the 12 months waiting period, because, in effect, so far as the litigant is concerned, that is what it is, while all this archaic system of pleading is gone through.</P>
    <P>In other countries two documents suffice: a claim by the plaintiff setting out some detail of what he is complaining about and what he is looking for; and a reply to that by the defendant denying, in his view, why the plaintiff should be entitled to what he is looking for.  Basically, the six or eight steps that have to be gone through amount to that, and there is no reason why it could not be done in two rather than in eight documents.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we have such delays in the High Court is that virtually every civil case based on negligence is heard by a jury.  The House will recall that two years ago, in the Courts Act, 1971, the House abolished civil jury trials in the Circuit <Col N="1778" /> Court.  They were not much availed of, and it did not make any great difference anyway because I think the average number per annum was somewhere in the region of ten or, perhaps, a little less.  However, the principle involved there, which I think has been very readily accepted by everyone, surely applies also in the High Court.  If no injustice has been done to litigants in the Circuit Court &mdash;and bear in mind that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is now £2,000&mdash;one can legitimately ask whether any injustice would be done by limiting the right to a civil jury trial in the High Court.</P>
    <P>In England and most other countries the right to civil jury trial is very limited.  Ninety-five per cent or more of the cases which are in this backlog of 1,000 cases to which the Minister referred in the High Court jury list at the moment are actions based on negligence arising out of traffic accidents or accidents at work.  Negligence is an issue, perhaps, 25 to 30 per cent of the time.  In the remainder of the cases it is simply a question of assessing damages and a jury is called in for the purpose of assessing the amount of money that should be given to the plaintiff for the injury he received.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a jury has any special quality for making what is basically a technical assessment.  I believe a judge could do it at least as well.  In almost all of these cases in England it is done by a judge.  A judge can assess damages in the normal case in a matter of hours.  If it has to go before a jury, the times they have to be addressed are so numerous and, the detailed explanations that have to be given to them are so lengthy, that a similar case would take a day or possibly two days.  One could cut down to about 25 per cent the amount of time that is involved in these cases if the assessments were made by a judge.  I do not think any injustice would be caused by it.  It is done in the Circuit Court with general satisfaction to everyone.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies plead at the present time that one of the chief reasons for the very high premiums <Col N="1779" /> they find themselves forced to charge is due to the fact that we have retained the civil jury system in the High Court here and that awards here are very considerably higher than awards for corresponding injuries in Britain.  Undoubtedly, that is so.  I am not saying that the award should be lower, but awards should be on a more scientific basis than the rather haphazard situation we have at the moment, where one jury may value a particular injury £10,000 higher or £10,000 lower than another jury might.</P>
    <P>I mention these things as an example of the way time could be saved in the High Court, as examples of the way this backlog could be overcome by means other than those in this Bill.  I do not dispute the Bill, but it is an easy way out, because it does nothing to change a system that is patently unsatisfactory; indeed, it does a great deal to perpetuate it, because if the situation were to be found in two, three or four years time that there was again a backlog for some reason, it might well be a very easy way out for whoever would be Minister for Justice at that time to say: &ldquo;Instead of seven ordinary judges of the High Court as we established in 1973, we shall now have eight ordinary judges, and the extra one will try to get rid of the arrears of work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A more fundamental approach is necessary to what is a problem and a serious one that is causing a lot of injustice to litigants who are in court, not through any wish of their own but in an effort to get compensation for an injury done to them through negligence.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that one of the reasons for the arrears at the moment is that a High Court judge has been more or less continuously sitting in the Special Criminal Court since its establishment in May, 1972. That gives me the opportunity to join with Deputy Andrews in paying tribute to the eight judges who have served in that court and, in particular, in paying tribute to the first three who sat in that court, because the problems facing them were far greater than the problems facing those who came on some months later when <Col N="1780" /> the ice was broken, as it were, and when the intimidation was not as great as it was at the start.  This country is fortunate that judges of the highest standing were prepared very readily to serve on a court in circumstances that were difficult and that were leaving them open to abuse, threats and so on.  Their readiness to serve on that court and the consummate fairness with which they dealt with everybody before that court has done much to enhance the standing of the Judiciary in this country.</P>
    <P>Like most speakers here, I would naturally regret that in criminal matters it was necessary, in the first place, to establish, and it is still necessary to maintain, the Special Criminal Court.  I would hope it would not be maintained any longer than is necessary, but we might as well make it perfectly clear that at the moment and, indeed, I would say in the immediately foreseeable future, it is necessary that the Special Criminal Court should be maintained.  It has achieved a great deal by the fair way in which many people have been tried. It has contributed a good deal to the maintenance of the rule of law in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly found place in his speech to criticise the Government of which I was a member for allowing picketing or parading to take place in front of certain courts during the past couple of years.  I want to avail of the opportunity to place on the records of the House the precise position in that regard.  First, in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972 there is a section prohibiting the picketing of courts or parading in front of them. That Act was passed on 3rd December, 1972 and signed by the President on the same day, Sunday, to the best of my recollection.  As and from that date I am not aware of any picketing or parading in front of any court.  If it happened, it was only for a matter of seconds because as and from that date the gardaí had power to deal with that situation.  Up to then they had no such power.  Parading before or picketing a courthouse was not an offence under our criminal law until 3rd December, 1972; I believe it should have been and <Col N="1781" /> I was very glad to have played a part in making it an offence.</P>
    <P>Up to then the only way in which picketing of courthouses could be dealt with was on the direction of the judge presiding in the court in question and for the most part the judges&mdash;not exclusively&mdash;decided that since they were not influenced by the carry-on outside they would not, as it were, dignify those taking part in these activities by having them brought before the court.  I think, with respect to the judges concerned, that was a mistake; they should have much more regularly instructed the gardaí to go out and arrest these people and have them charged with contempt of court.  The judges did not decide on that.  I felt strongly for a year or more that we would have to make this a statutory criminal offence so that the gardaí could move on their own initiative rather than at the request of a judge.  We did so in that Act and it has never happened since.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to remind Deputy Kelly, although he was not in this House at the time, that the Act was very violently opposed and very severely criticised for among other things, this very provision which was regarded as unnecessary, as creating an unnecessary criminal offence, and it was suggested that all sorts of people involved in advising litigants in civil matters could get themselves into trouble.  Happily, that Bill passed and has proved of tremendous value both to the previous and the present Governments in the maintenance of law.</P>
    <P>The only other thing I wish to say on the Bill is that section 2, as drafted, is, to say the least of it, confusing and to some extent repetitive. There is a slight difference between subsections 1 and 2 but it is not clear that the whole thing needs to be said twice.  Perhaps the Minister could deal with that more appropriately on Committee Stage.  I should like some explanation of the necessity to express section 2 in the way in which it is expressed.  The meaning is probably reasonably clear simply to ratify temporary appointments and count them as practice at the bar for the purpose of permanent appointments. One would imagine that could <Col N="1782" /> have been expressed in two or three lines rather than 14 or 15.</P>
    <P>Subject to what I have said about delays in the courts, I welcome the Bill but it is only right to warn the House that this is an easy way out for a Minister for Justice.  Ideally, the Minister should get down to a much more fundamental reappraisal of the causes of delay in the courts.  If he did, he would achieve far more than by what is essentially a stop gap measure in this Bill.  Better results with greater benefits to the people generally would be secured by a fundamental rethinking on the necessity for the elaborate and time-consuming procedures in our courts. The backlog or arrears of work under discussion here today would disappear if that were done.  It is an easy way out to appoint an extra judge but it is no solution to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some general comments on the Bill.  For many years of my membership of this House I have found that usually on the case of Bills dealing with our courts or the Department of Justice the debate is confined to the legal members of the House on both sides and that non-legal Members are rather diffident about taking part.  That is regrettable because our courts and how they are constituted are of prime importance and all legislation dealing with them and their activities and with the judicial system are of major importance to the nation.  I was rather disappointed in listening to the debate that not one non-legal Member of the House took part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me if I overlooked him.  We got an interesting picture from the former Minister for Justice who gave us some idea of procedure and told us of improvements that could be made in the system.  He actually detailed such proposals&mdash;curtailment of holiday <Col N="1783" /> periods, the desirability of having the courts working more frequently and possibly working longer hours than at present.  But I was surprised that during his own term of office he did not seem to take any steps to promote those ideas or formulate legislation which would put his ideas on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>One of the secondary reasons for my intervention was the interesting talk Deputy O'Malley gave us on procedures to get an action before the court.  He told us that the 1,000 cases awaiting decision in the High Court arise mainly from traffic accidents. I assume that his figures are reasonably correct and factual.  He is a member of the legal profession and I am sure his information is quite factual.  He indicated that you have to adopt procedures which, to be candid, some of us did not know existed.  As a Member of this House I know that you have to go through a system of pleadings.  There are preliminary pleadings, three going one way and three the other way, which consume 12 months in time and which consume I do not know how much in money; that is beyond me.  You have to spend another 12 months doing other types of work and making other pleadings before you get the case before the court.  That is the procedure as Deputy O'Malley sees it.  To put it mildly it is rather pitiful from the point of a layman that a cumbersome, clumsy system should operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting to his statement that 95 per cent of cases awaiting decision are traffic accident cases, what happens in a traffic accident?  One car strikes another.  The cars are damaged and possibly the occupants are injured. Pleadings may be made by one side that the other party was at fault and <i>vice versa.</i> Surely some less cumbersome system could be found to determine the rights and wrongs of such a case.  People who suffered injuries and who had to be hospitalised for lengthy periods have suffered a great deal of mental injury, if I can so describe it, waiting to hear about their cases, running to solicitors and doctors, and trying to find out when their cases <Col N="1784" /> will be resolved.  This mental strain which extends over a period of a couple of years is unfair to such people.  I am dealing with the case of a person who was the victim of a traffic accident in which the responsibility rested with the other party.  I am not going into the question of what happens in court other than to comment on Deputy O'Malley's statement.</P>
    <P>The case comes to court and usually in a two-sided case&mdash;sometimes there may be three-sided cases &mdash;there are eight legal people working for the parties, four for each side. Most of the cases are dealt with by juries.  We have the additional information from Deputy O'Malley that, on average, a jury action on a traffic accident involves an extra day.  The Minister is quite new to his job but he is as fully conversant with legal principles, with our Constitution and court procedures as Deputy O'Malley. Both of them are members of the same profession.  I suggest that the Minister should have a look at the procedures to see whether agreement could be got on modifying them and making it easier to get the cases on the judge's desk.  I would be prepared to go a long way with Deputy O'Malley in his suggestion that the three types of preliminary proceedings should be reduced to one.  This matter could be worked out around a table better than in the House possibly.  Naturally it would have to come before the House in its final form.</P>
    <P>I agree that traffic accident cases can be best determined by the Judiciary. This is relevant to the Bill because mainly it centres around the appointment of an extra judge to overtake the backlog.  It is entirely beyond the competence of ordinary people to make an assessment of what is a fair and reasonable sum to grant to a successful applicant for his injuries. It is difficult for the ordinary jurymen &mdash;and several of them have mentioned this to me down through the years&mdash; to make such an assessment.  They do not regard themselves as qualified to make an assessment.  They have no qualifications in that field.  I would agree with the suggestion made in the <Col N="1785" /> course of this debate that very often the amount of the damages is assessed in a rather haphazard fashion.  People claiming damages think it is better to go before a jury of well-to-do citizens who are likely to think big and give them better damages.</P>
    <P>Without labouring that point, I suggest to the House that, so far as civil actions are concerned, the time has come when the jury system should be brought to an end.  Apart altogether from the additional strain it puts on the court, it also puts a strain on the individual jury men, business men who are called away from their business for a week or nine or ten days, or longer, to deal with civil actions, mainly traffic accident cases.  I want to make this suggestion and I have made it on previous occasions.  A sizeable percentage of our people think this feasible.  We should overhaul the system as far as the determination of traffic accidents are concerned and we should have a less clumsy and cumbersome way of dealing with them.  I would be in favour of the cases being determined by those who are qualified to do so and whose job it is to make assessments and the necessary inquiries in connection with the amount of damages to be awarded.</P>
    <P>I intervened in this discussion for two reasons.  First, I should like to see more of the non-legal Members of the House take part in debates on the courts and the Judiciary.  They should have no hesitation in expressing their points of view.  Many people do not understand the legal procedures and the language used.  In 1973 there is no room for words such as &ldquo;whereas&rdquo;, &ldquo;wherefor&rdquo; and &ldquo;whereafter&rdquo;. I do not know if it is intended that all those lengthy documents should confuse people but they certainly succeed in doing this.  The language used should be simple and straightforward, capable of being understood by ordinary people.  The system we have has been in existence for more than 200 years.  The Minister for Justice would be performing a worthwhile task if he would overhaul the system of determining traffic accident cases in particular.  If that were done it would not be necessary for him <Col N="1786" /> to come here in two years' time, as was pointed out by Deputy O'Malley, to ask for an additional judge or more help to determine court cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a better position than I to make an assessment of the suggestion thrown out by Deputy O'Malley regarding curtailment of holiday periods.  I am not going to enter into this discussion but I think the suggestion deserves close consideration, particularly as it was made by a solicitor who understands court procedure.  If a non-legal man had made the suggestion it might have been pointed out he did not understand the position, that he did not know how much work these people do, but the suggestion was made by a member of the legal profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with certain of the matters referred to by Deputy O'Malley.  I do not think there is disagreement between Deputy O'Malley and the Minister for Justice in that certain matters on court procedure require tightening up and radical amendment.  Deputy O'Malley has outlined the procedure required in a straightforward motor accident case in the High Court, whereas in the Circuit Court, probably dealing with the same kind of facts, with a lesser amount of damages and the same number of witnesses, there would be only two forms of pleading, claim and defence.</P>
      <P>I can see no justification for the present rather cumbersome method used in the High Court.  Of course, there is the point that by the method used in the High Court it is possible to collect revenue by way of stamps on documents.  One would have to consider that aspect also because stamps on documents go towards some of the costs and expenses of maintaining the courts.  That does not mean only judges but also the various offices associated with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something can be done about the long vacation, the two months' recess in August and September.  There is a good argument for reducing it to a maximum of six weeks but I would not be in favour of any interference with the other vacations.  Possibly the public do not understand that the amount of legal matters that appear in the courts <Col N="1787" /> is merely a tip of the iceberg in the legal work that is going on.  Of the cases that go to court a considerable number are settled but frequently this means the litigant must bring the case to the door of the court before reason and common sense prevail.  However, even if this is the case, the tip of the iceberg is entitled to an early and ready trial no matter what may be the claim or the defence.  It is a matter of justice, the right of every citizen in the State.  Unfortunately, as matters have now turned out, litigants and citizens are not getting those rights except on a postponed basis.  It is a serious matter to see that there were 1,000 High Court actions pending at the end of August.  From the Minister's statement I do not know if they are what might be called current cases or cases that should have been reached but were not dealt with.  Possibly the Minister might be able to elucidate on this matter.</P>
    <P>From my professional knowledge, I am aware that sometimes cases take two or three years before they are heard.  It is not realised that cases are put in the queue and if one steps out of the queue one's case goes to the end.  This is a very serious matter from the litigant's point of view.  One must remember that every case that comes to court is different and, from the point of view of the parties involved, it is unique.  There is a personal aspect in every case that goes to court.  Frequently I have been irate at the delay in appointing extra judges because it is clearly apparent to me as a practitioner, and to my fellow-practitioners at the Bar, that there is a serious shortage of judges.  There may have been resistance on the grounds that this was adding to the overall costs of litigation in that extra salary must be provided for a judge and the extra staff.  If one equated the costs of an extra judge with the costs and expenses the litigant would be saved, then the costs and expenses expended on an extra judge would be infinitesimal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the comparable costs that could be saved by the appointment of an extra judge.  If an extra judge were appointed it would save litigants a considerable amount of money.  If, for example, an accident case were to be heard in the High Court in Dublin, the people involved must travel 100 miles or more.  They must bring a specialist from a provincial area, their family doctor and maybe an engineer or other expert to Dublin.  If the case is not heard the first day that means added costs and expenses.</P>
      <P>I was associated with a case which was postponed for three days before it was heard, although it had been listed for the first day.  When my client saw the cost barometer rising considerably he did not go into court. He paid to avoid having to pay the increased costs.  That is a very serious situation and a bad indictment of our legal system.  I know also of cases where settlements were more or less forced on people because of these delays.  This could be got over by getting a case specially fixed.  I do not know if any Member of this House knows what the position is about getting a case specially fixed.  He would find it easier to do many other things. A very special case must be made before a case can be specially fixed.</P>
      <P>I have experience of another legal system similar to our own, the Australian legal system.  I discussed the legal system in Western Australia with practising and academic lawyers.  I gathered that it was established practice there that if a person had a case on in the Supreme Court, which is the equivalent of our High Court, that it was specifically fixed and that was the end of the matter.  This was done months before for the convenience of the lawyers, the clients and the witnesses.  One could say that time could be wasted by such a procedure. I do not think time is ever wasted in facilitating people who are looking for justice if you want to produce a fair legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too often one goes into court on behalf of a client and gets the feeling that the judge sitting on the bench is nervously looking over his shoulder <Col N="1789" /> wondering how he will deal with the number of cases piling up.  That atmosphere becomes evident in court. This Bill has been unduly delayed and has annoyed me and some of my colleagues who have seen the actual procedure work.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the workings of the court about which the public have a misconceived notion. They ask lawyers the hours of court sittings.  They are from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. People say these hours are very short. They do not realise that the judge sitting on the bench must concentrate all the time.  He cannot take it easy at any stage because whether he is deciding the case or not, he must have the facts under such control that he can properly put them to a jury.  One can realise how important a judge is when there is a criminal trial in process. Then the liberty of the individual and justice in a very acute form is involved.  If judges are overworked there is a tendency, or a real danger I might say, of injustice being done. People going into a court of law should look on it as a friendly place and not a place where they will be terrified.  They go there for justice. They should be welcomed by the judge.  He is a public official, on a public salary and should be able to take his time and ease doing the right thing by the litigants who come before him.  He should not be asked to work under pressure.</P>
    <P>Very often a judge has to deal with highly technical matters.  One day he may have to grasp the principles of physiology and the next day he may find himself having to turn into an obstetrician in order to grasp the argument advanced before him.  Next day he may have to turn himself into an engineer or an architect.  He must grasp the science for the purpose of making a decision and doing justice by the parties.  Very often the work of a judge involves the reading of a colossal amount of documentation.  In the course of a trial he must take copious notes.  I had the experience of being involved in a case lasting 21 days.  The unfortunate judge had a monumental amount of work to do by <Col N="1790" /> the time the case was finished.  He started to deliver his judgment at 11 o'clock one morning; there was a break of one hour for lunch and the case finished at five o'clock in the evening.  That may be a rather extreme example but it does illustrate the type of work judges have to do. On Monday morning in the High Court I have seen 70 or 80 applications having to be dealt with by one judge because of a shortage of judges. Judges fall ill.  They can have family problems and difficulties which may prevent their attending court.  Deciding matters between litigants is a colossal burden to put on any man's shoulders.</P>
    <P>The President of the High Court and the Chief Justice try to allocate work fairly so that the machine will run smoothly.  Both have done good work in that regard and so has the president of the Circuit Court and the chairman of the District Court.  There is, however, a limit to human ingenuity and luck in working out a programme under the circumstances I have outlined.  I am not painting a gloomy picture.  Generally speaking, the legal profession and the Bench are quite happy people, but there is grave overloading of work and, that being the case, one is concerned that justice may not be done.</P>
    <P>One very often hears that not alone should justice be done but that it should be seen to be done.  Where justice is done in five minutes flat in a court of law very often one of the parties involved comes out of court without a clue as to what has happened. On occasion I have spoken to a client outside the court and found that client under the fond impression that he had won his case when, in fact, he had lost it hands down.  That will give an idea how quickly things can happen.  I think the courts should be run on the basis that the ordinary lay person, whether he be a litigant, a witness or an onlooker, should fully understand what is going on; there is no reason for making the law or justice complicated in its application or in its understanding.  A very important aspect of justice is that people should understand it because, if they <Col N="1791" /> understand it, they will respect it. They will know how it works and if they want a change in the law they will understand how it should be changed.  The law and justice should be clearly understood by every person of normal intelligence.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been a tendency to put matters to arbitration. This is typical.  It illustrates the fact that the courts are somewhat overloaded. This is a bad sign and this is a matter that should be examined very carefully by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>There could be a change for the better in the sittings of the courts.  It is my recollection that a committee of the Bar Council recommended that civil sittings in the Circuit Court could be reduced to three times a year.  It should not be necessary to have sittings four times a year.  It would be necessary in criminal cases in provincial areas because a person might be in custody and there should be an early trial.  It might ease the load in the Circuit Court if sessions were three times a year with possibly longer sittings in each town.  That would lead to a centralisation of activity and those involved would allow for that. It would be more satisfactory than having the courts sitting for a few days every eight or ten weeks and it would cut down costs.  It would also obviate the necessity of a man trying to get himself into two places at the same time.  The disease is perennial and barristers and so on can suffer from it.  That situation might be helped considerably by a special listing of cases.  One Circuit Court judge has availed of this procedure and it has greatly eased the burden where litigants are concerned.  It means they know their case is likely to be reached on a particular day instead of having to take its chance in a queue.</P>
    <P>There is a list in the High Court which does assist in making things easier to some extent for litigants, but I have instanced the case in which a client of mine spent three fruitless days waiting for the case in which he was interested to come on.  Possibly too many cases are listed to avoid any danger of collapse but I think <Col N="1792" /> there has been an undue pre-occupation on the part of certain members of the Bench with regard to a possible collapse of the list.  If there are 12 cases listed and the 12 cases are settled, then the judge has done his job and the litigants have had their satisfaction in that their difficulties have been resolved.  I would like to stress that point because there seems to be an idea in certain judicial minds that they must be seen to be slogging away at a case all day in court.  What is required is availability of judges within a reasonable time and an increase in the number of judges will ensure that availability.</P>
    <P>I gather Deputy O'Malley believes this is not a real solution to the problem. He said the Bill was an easy way out.  I do not regard it as an easy way out or, for that matter, a way out.  My personal view would be that even with these extra appointments it will not deal with the whole situation. I regard the present situation as one of some sort of crisis.  It is a terrible thing to have a 12 months' delay before a person can get access to justice.  There is a lot to be said for structural reform and procedural reform and possibly a change concerning the long vacation.  However, I think the Parliamentary Secretary, who spoke before me, did not like the jury system too much and I think Deputy O'Malley did not care for the jury system too much.  The Parliamentary Secretary, if I may be forgiven for making a slightly legal point, made the case that he was putting forward a layman's point of view. If you want a layman's point of view, the only way you will get it is to have a jury to try your case.  There is a lot to be said for the jury's view.</P>

      <P>Indeed, since the removal largely of juries in England some judges over there have been quite outspoken in their views concerning the doing away with juries.  They feel at a great loss.  There is a certain type of case&mdash;it is very hard to typify or describe it&mdash;where it is greatly in ease of a judge to have a jury to decide the case.  A type of case that lends itself to the jury system on the civil side is one <Col N="1793" /> concerning the law of defamation&mdash; libel and slander.  A jury is eminently suited to try that type of case.  In a particular set of circumstances, one knows as a lawyer or as a layman that judges could quite easily take completely opposed views because of their preferences or their prejudices.  At least when a matter goes before a jury there is something of the law of averages, there is the ordinary man from the street coming in as he sees things, as he wants to see justice done to his fellow-citizens.  He will obviously look at it through his own eyes.  He is making the law for his fellow-citizens. I would certainly be very adverse to the removal of the jury system.  I know it has been used here, with some reason, as one of the grounds for the delay in litigation but if that were a cause of delay I would say we should get more judges but still keep the jury. The jury system is possibly unique to the English legal system.  I may be wrong in my history but I think it started with the English common law system, the Englishman's preference for being tried by his equals.  There is a lot to be said for it.  I do not think it is always right to be tried by a semi-technocrat, which is what a judge is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard about a case once that was tried by a judge, a very eminent man in his profession who had been many years on the bench.  It was a simple case of a person who sued his garage in respect of repairs to his motor car.  I am just giving an instance of where a man can go, in my eyes, a little bit wrong through being out of touch.  The man who owned the car had to get out every quarter of an hour and put a can of water in his radiator.  A job was supposed to have been done on the radiator.  That judge dismissed that unfortunate man's claim against the garage because he thought it was quite normal for a car to have to be filled up every quarter of an hour.  This sort of situation can arise.  While not criticising the Judiciary, a judge could possibly be out of touch in an everyday situation where the juryman is useful. I suppose like all sections of society there are good judges, bad judges and indifferent judges.  You can have judges with prejudices.  I do not think there is any practising lawyer in any part of the <Col N="1794" /> world who would not say that certain judges have certain human minor prejudices or leanings one way rather than another in dealing with certain situations.</P>
    <P>Something that puzzled me when this Bill was mooted was what the attitude of the Opposition would be. I know Deputy Andrews goes along with it and I agree with his reasons for so doing, but I was a bit puzzled as to why there has been such a long delay in providing extra judges when it was very obvious that the system was creaking at its seams from lack of judges.  I think we got an answer this evening in Deputy O'Malley's speech.  I am glad that this situation will be rectified.</P>
    <P>There has been some slight debating heat generated over the appointment of a judge to preside over security arrangements.  Leaving aside the personality and the ability of the particular judge concerned, who is above reproach and was one of our very brilliant members of the Bar and certainly honoured his position on the Bench, I think he is the proper person to preside in a matter of this sort because you are dealing with prisons and prisoners and other matters relating to security.  Very often judges have to make fine distinctions in coming to an assessment of a situation.  Where somebody else might rush in and dish out penalties a judge might sit back and consider whether the cure would be worse than the disease.  All this comes back to the mental attitude of the people who come before the court.  A judge is an independent type of person who would be the proper person to preside over a private inquiry of this nature.  Any report from such a man would have the confidence of this House even though it is a private report to the Taoiseach and rightly so.  It has to be because it deals with security.  It is not a matter that can be in the first instance put before this House.  As has been said by the Opposition spokesman, the matter of security is one for the Government though I would like to remind the Opposition that a responsible attitude on the part of the Opposition also helps.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It is good to see the number of judges in our courts being increased.  Deputy Andrews, as well as the vast majority of Deputies and the public at large who have any connection with law, is well aware of the long delays people face in having cases dealt with in the courts.  Delays occur in all civil actions coming before the courts.  There are delays in having cases heard.  People tend to become easygoing and say: &ldquo;The case will be heard eventually&rdquo;.  Delays which arise because of insufficient judges are particularly hard for the less well-off people to bear.  People may be involved in traffic accidents. Their injuries may result in loss of pay.  A stay in hospital may result in a loss of several weeks' pay.  A man may be without income for a long time.  His dependants may suffer seriously. He may have to depend on social welfare, home assistance or the goodness of his friends.</P>
      <P>An individual injured in an accident may reach a stage where he is anxious to have his case settled at any price. This should be rectified.  A man may settle in order to avoid going to court. This Bill should remedy that situation. This happens all the time in the District, Circuit and High Courts. In the long run the insurance companies are the only beneficiaries.  I welcome this Bill, which should speed up the hearing of cases.</P>
      <P>Juries have been mentioned.  In the Circuit Courts many jurors are summoned on hearing days.  As many as 60 jurors may be called to attend. Of these 35 may have no business in court.  Before the jurors reach the courts the county registrar will have notified the Garda who go around to the homes of the jurors with their summonses.  All this involves expense. The number of jurors summoned on a particular day should be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often receive representations from people who have been summoned for jury service.  Such people may lose pay for their day's work.  They may have to attend court for two or three days.  A person is compelled to come <Col N="1796" /> to court but he should not be at a loss.  Jurors should be compensated properly.  They should also be paid travelling allowances.  Jurors often assess damages.  Their dependants should not suffer a loss of £15 or £18 because the breadwinner is attending court.  The jury system should be continued not alone in criminal cases but also to attend actions where damages are being assessed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde rightly pointed out that some of our judges who have spent ten or 15 years on the Bench reach a situation where they may not be in as close contact with the day-to-day lives of the people as those who are on juries and who are mixing daily with the citizens of the country. The jury system is the fairest way of assessing damages suffered as a result of accidents or injury.  If a man loses three or four fingers the person most likely to assess correctly the damages due to him would be a juryman living in the same area.  Such man knows the effect of the loss suffered.  Therefore we should retain our jury system. One sector who would like to see that system go are insurance companies because it is their opinion that in some cases juries award compensation that is in excess of what is warranted, but I do not believe that to be so.  I believe they are fair awards decided on by 12 reasonable men.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I would put to the Minister and these relate to matters which county registrars might look into.  In regard to the hearing of criminal cases it is the general practice that these are heard on the opening day of a session, but in the case of a hearing being adjourned the county registrar should be given reasonable notification to that effect by the State solicitor applying for the adjournment and if it happens to be the defendant who is seeking the adjournment the same should apply.  In regard to civil cases solicitors and counsel should notify county registrars as to whether the cases are going ahead.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with the procedure in the courts in Dublin but I am aware that in the country one finds long lists of up to 50 cases <Col N="1797" /> awaiting hearing.  A person whose case was on such list and who was not from the area in which the case was to be heard would have no way of knowing whether the hearing was to be adjourned, so that in the event of an adjournment witnesses might be present unnecessarily in court.  It may be found that any case might not be heard at all during the session for which it was listed.  On the other hand a person might take a chance on his case not being called but might find that it had been called because of a number of earlier listed cases being adjourned.  This leads to much confusion. I suggest that county registrars get in touch with the solicitors and bar associations throughout the country so as to have lists drawn up setting out the specific days on which individual cases would be heard.  This would require much consultation but it is important that some effort be made in this respect.  The co-operation of the solicitors, the barristers, county registrars and, in criminal cases in particular, the Garda Síochána is necessary in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not refer to the District Court but, in passing, I might say that since the increase in the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts there has been an increase in the civil lists for these courts.  I suggest that the Minister consult the District Court clerks in regard to having special sittings in respect of civil lists.  I have been in the courts recently where rent cases went on all morning while an Attorney-General's case was not taken until the afternoon. This should not happen, especially since people summoned by the Attorney-General to attend must be present if they do not wish to have a bench warrant issued for their arrest; it is too bad that they should be present in court all day only to find that the case in which they were giving evidence was not called.  This gives witnesses the impression of being treated as second class citizens and, consequently, they may lose some of their respect for the courts which are such an important part of our democratic system.  It is the responsibility of each of us here to ensure <Col N="1798" /> that citizens have a proper approach to the courts.  I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank all Members who contributed to this debate and to thank in particular the party opposite who, through Deputy Andrews, expressed their acceptance of the principle of the Bill, that is, the appointment of an extra High Court judge in an effort to do something about the arrears in the High Court.</P>
      <P>The debate has been wide-ranging. Deputy Blaney attempted to drag in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act while Deputy O'Malley questioned the adversary system and Deputy Esmonde spoke of the judge who knew so little about mechanically propelled vehicles.  I do not propose to reply in detail to every point made because many similar points were made by several speakers.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Bill is an effort to deal with the arrears position in the High Court.  The position in the Circuit Court was referred to also.  It is serious there, too.  In introducing this Second Stage I indicated that the Government intend to recommend the appointment of an extra Circuit Court judge so as to bring the complement to 12.  It is our intention also, but this will require legislation, to increase to four the number assigned permanently to Dublin.  At the moment this number is two and this is inadequate for the amount of business to be done in the Dublin Circuit Court. These changes were recommended by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  The other matters recommended in that report require further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews suggested that the districts of Dún Laoghaire and Bray are now populous enough&mdash;indeed, they always were&mdash;to require Circuit Courts.  The committee which examined the re-organisation of the Circuit Court did not recommend this specifically but I have no doubt they were conscious of the problem in respect of those areas because they gave much attention to them in respect of the District Court position.  I wonder whether it would suit to have a separate Circuit <Col N="1799" /> Court sitting in Dún Laoghaire and Bray, bearing in mind that the people who would have to man those courts would be lawyers practising from the Bar Library and solicitors practising, by and large, from the city.  The inconvenience involved in that respect might be such as to make it impracticable for the courts to be manned.  However, that is an issue that is not strictly relevant to the main purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I concede readily, that, as Deputy O'Malley says, to appoint an extra judge is possibly the easy way out, but it is one way out that must be taken.  Unless we have enough judges, the arrears will not be cleared regardless of how speedy the system is.  It is possibly the easiest step that can be taken from my point of view and I make no apologies for taking what is an easy step.  It can be taken quickly and that is why it is being taken now.  As I said when I was introducing this Stage the problem is urgent and anything that can be done urgently should be done.  It does not permit of an instant solution.  It is too complex to permit that but it does require an urgent solution.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an extra judge is a very practical and important step and it recognises the urgency of the situation.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley that the whole procedural system in the High Court requires to be looked at.  Indeed, it has been looked at by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  This committee has made some very valuable recommendations, particularly the recommendations contained in the sixteenth interim report concerning the jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court.  These recommendations were made primarily to try to speed up the pre-trial procedures of which Deputy O'Malley rightly complained. This report was furnished in January, 1972.  I am pleased to say that at the moment I am having legislation drafted to implement the recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations in that report regarding the Master and <Col N="1800" /> his place in the pre-trial procedures were made as far back as 1965 in the third interim report which dealt with jury trial in civil actions.  I am hopeful that this legislation revising the role of the Master in the High Court when it is enacted will have substantial effect in diminishing considerably the pre-trial delays.  I am not satisfied that it will reduce the preliminary pleadings to the level that Deputy O'Malley would seem to suggest is a desirable level.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is necessary to compare the three courts and the three procedures.  In the District Court which now has jurisdiction up to £250 all that is necessary for a case to come before a district justice is for the plaintiff to issue a short and informal statement of the nature of his claim. This claim merely states that he claims £X for damages for negligence and possibly alleges that the negligence was for the driving of a motor car on such a date at such a place.  There is no formal defence required to that in the sense that the defendant does not have to set out his grounds for defence in a reply to that document.  On that document the parties join issue before a justice and satisfactory trial takes place.</P>
    <P>In the Circuit Court where there is now jurisdiction of £2,000 the procedure gets somewhat more complicated. We have a civil bill in which the claim is set out in more detail and in more the type of language to which the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy M.P. Murphy, took exception and, possibly so with a lot of merit.  The statement of claim in the civil bill in the Circuit Court is a more detailed legalistic document.  The Circuit Court procedure requires that it be answered by a defence which is also a detailed legalistic document.  In between those two documents there may be a notice for particulars and replies which can be comprehensive and have the effect of slowing up procedures.  Nevertheless, it is a fairly simple procedure and one which does not cause much delay.</P>
    <P>Next we move to the High Court. Deputy O'Malley has already graphically <Col N="1801" /> described the paper jungle that has to be fought through by litigants and practitioners in order to reach the court.  It does seem an odd situation that what is permissible for one court should not, by and large, be the norm in all the courts.  The theory behind the more intricate pleadings in the High Court is that these pleadings define and isolate the issues in advance of the hearing.  In effect, they should make the hearing quicker and simpler and should obviate the need for witnesses to have to prove a lot of things which have been admitted previously in the documents.  This may be the theory but in practice it has not worked out like that and these complicated pleadings have, regrettably, only had the effect of slowing up procedure.</P>
    <P>While the changes coming as a result of the report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure on the jurisdiction of the Master will I hope ease that position, I am doubtful, and I share Deputy O'Malley's concern in this, as to whether they will go far enough.  The time has come when we will have to look at the present pleadings in detail to see if they can be considerably curtailed. I do not see that the justice of the matter or the efficiency of the court going to deal with the case demands that the intricate, technical and legalistic pleadings which presently obtain need to be continued.  This is a subject on which there are conflicting views and these views will have to be heard and a decision arrived at.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by Deputy O'Malley of the question of maintaining juries in the High Court in civil actions.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, they have been abolished in the Circuit Court and judges are now giving judgement in cases involving amounts which up to a short time ago were reserved for the High Court where they would have had to be given by juries.  If you like, as a matter of logic that argument seems to defeat the argument that a judge is necessary in order that justice be done where the amounts are large.</P>
    <P>This question of the right to trial by jury in civil matters produces <Col N="1802" /> heated arguments.  People have very fixed views on it and underlying the opposition to the abolition of juries in these circumstances is a very proper fear that this may be the thin end of the wedge towards affecting the jury principle in criminal matters. This possibly explains a lot of the opposition to any proposed changes. It is significant that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, in its third interim report on jury trial in civil actions, stated:</P>
    <P>Unless it can clearly be shown that the cause of justice would best be served by either abolishing or severely curtailing the present right to trial by jury in civil actions in the High Court there is, in our view, no case for doing so.</P>
    <P>That committee, with its wealth of experience, decided that jury actions in civil cases in the High Court should be maintained unless it could be shown that the cause of justice would best be served by abolishing this right or severely curtailing it.  There is no doubt that if the existence of this right contributes substantially to the delays in the High Court the cause of justice is not being served by maintaining it.  From that point of view there is possibly an argument at this stage that, having regard to the arrears which now obtain and which did not obtain in 1965, if that knowledge was available to that committee they might have altered their opinion.  Again, this is a matter where there is room for a lot of debate because there are very contrary opinions on the subject.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the pre-trial procedures can be streamlined, and I have indicated my anxiety to do this, or changed or both and there is a sufficiency of judges they should go a long way towards eliminating the backlog without any need to look at the right to trial by jury.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Esmonde's point of view that if a layman's point of view is wanted in legal matters&mdash;and Deputy M.P. Murphy very properly intervened in this debate to give a layman's point of view&mdash;in assessing the amount of loss, the jury is the proper vehicle through which that point of view <Col N="1803" /> should be expressed.  This is an argument in favour of the retention of juries in serious civil cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the fundamental point that we maintain here following our independence the adversary system of litigation which seems to go with the common law system which we took over when we formed our own administration.  I do not know that we can ever abolish this.  There will always have to be some form of adversary system involving two lawyers arguing the merits of respective cases before an independent tribunal which will adjudicate on them.  However, what might be more fundamental would be to have a look at the doctrine in negligence cases.  Most of our civil litigation in the courts arises out of road traffic cases which are decided on the principle of fault, that is, that damages only follow if one of the parties has been negligent.</P>
    <P>One wonders in this day and age when the motor car is the <i>sine qua non</i> of modern society and when people are permitted to drive potentially dangerous vehicles freely around the roads if society is being unfair in asking the people injured by this freedom to base their claim for compensation on their ability to show fault on the part of the driver, especially when this ability to show fault might be clouded in some way by technical difficulties of pleadings and the standard of advocacy available to the parties and when the technical rules of evidence can possibly cloud the real element of justice.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the time has come when we must begin to decide whether this idea of fault should be removed from our legal system and that there should be an absolute right to compensation for injuries sustained by a citizen in the course of his ordinary daily activities in this society.  How it is to be paid for, the rights to it, all these things would have to be matters for debate. However, it is a basic matter and I suppose it is brought into focus now by the injustice of the present system heightened by delays in getting that system to work, unjust and imperfect as it may be.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Andrew's praise <Col N="1804" /> for the presidents of the High and Circuit Courts for the jobs they have to do in very difficult circumstances. I would like to endorse his appreciation of their work, because in addition to performing the normal judicial functions of a judge they have vast administrative burdens and these are undertaken and carried out without complaint of any kind whatever.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Andrews when he questions the propriety of a judge undertaking the inquiry into the security aspect of the State.  I think a judge is a person well fitted to carry out such an inquiry.  It is an inquiry of considerable importance and it requires in the persons of those who carry it out a reflection of that importance, and this is truly reflected by having a judge of the High Court as the person to lead that inquiry. I do not think it impinges in any way on judicial independence, on the constitutional propriety of the situation, by having a judge do a job for the Executive.  To suggest that would be to cast doubt on the personal propriety of any individual member of the Judiciary, and I think, happily, none of us would seek to do that nor have we ever had any cause to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned my reference to legal aid in my speech opening the debate as a symptom that I might be inclined to put that subject on the long finger.  He coupled this with what he described as the evasiveness of Deputy Fitzpatrick answering questions on my behalf when I was absent, not, as Deputy Andrews thought, out of the country but down in Templemore presenting medals for bravery to members of the Garda. There is no evasiveness in this area. It is my ambition to have a system of legal aid in civil cases.  I intend to achieve that ambition and to achieve it in a realistically short time. There is no point in putting it on the long finger, because it is an urgent social necessity.  I have the support in principle of the parties in the National Coalition for the introduction of this change, and I can assure Deputy Andrews that it is a change that will come.  I mentioned it in my speech in the context that, having brought it in, it would be a terrible pity to find <Col N="1805" /> its effects nullified by the courts being clogged.  It was in that context I mentioned it, not using the clogging of the courts as an excuse for postponing it but as another argument to show how urgent it was to clear the clogging of the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney's contribution was an odd one in the context of this Bill.  He cried crocodile tears for the litigants who found themselves unable to get speedy justice because our judges were involved in the Special Criminal Court and another judge will be involved in the security inquiry.  Deputy Blaney did not seem to realise that there is a public need to have the Special Criminal Court. His viewpoint on this is a bit narrow. The judges in that court are doing perhaps the most important judicial work that is being done in this country at the moment.  He would be better employed using his undoubted influence among that section of the population who provide the defendants coming before that court to persuade them that their particular policy and actions are inimical to the interest of the public, whose wellbeing was being detrimentally affected by judges having to go into this court.  He said it was a waste of time for judges to be in the Special Criminal Court.  It may be but there is a regrettable necessity to have the Special Criminal Court.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, we must have it to remove any fear of intimidation of juries.  We do not want the situation to arise here where jurymen would be not merely intimidated but, as happened in another part of the island, assassinated.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately necessary to have these courts to try people who are not prepared to observe the democratic rule, who are not prepared to observe the will of the majority. Deputy Blaney shamefully boasted here, on the occasion of a debate before Christmas, of his part in setting up or encouraging the organisation which provides all the people who proceed through these courts.  He wanted the court abolished.  He, perhaps more than anyone else in this House, could help in ending the Special Criminal Court, if he is prepared to urge these people who have <Col N="1806" /> been misled into certain activities contrary to the wellbeing of the State to desist from those activities and to realise that peace can only come by the acceptance of democratic rule and the will of the majority of the people.  I suggest to Deputy Blaney that he has the responsibility and the opportunity of helping towards the ending of the need for this court.</P>
    <P>He was inclined to minimise the need for an inquiry into our security situation in the context again of taking a judge away from providing speedy litigation for our citizens.  He was inclined to regard the escape from Mountjoy Jail as something trivial.  Of course, it was not trivial; it is serious, that people convicted of serious criminal offences against the State should be able to escape from jail.  It is important to ensure that both the jails and every other aspect of security are critically examined and found to be fully effective and efficient.  We know that there are people in this country whose declared aim it is to bring down this Parliament and to bring down the institutions of the State.  It is essential that we who have the responsibility of maintaining and safeguarding these institutions be satisfied that that responsibility is carried out effectively.  The episode in Mountjoy, which I regret very much, shows possibly a gap that highlights the need for this examination.  Deputy Blaney might think it trivial.  He might think, as apparently he said on the day it happened, that it was something to be regarded as meritorious. I am glad Deputy Kelly raised it at this stage, and I would like to endorse the condemnation of any attitude of satisfaction at such an escapade taking place.  It is a matter for regret that people convicted of serious criminal offences should be able to escape from our jails.  Their place is within those jails and the inquiry is very proper and necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews made reference, as did Deputy O'Malley, to the odd drafting of section 2.  Deputies will recall that we had pre-1961 courts and post-1961 courts, and it was necessary to remove doubt as to the validity of appointments in relation to both <Col N="1807" /> courts.  That is why that section had to be duplicated in apparently similar terms.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised in the debate.  I want to thank Deputies again for their contributions and to assure them that I share their appreciation of the injustice to which the arrears in our courts can give rise to.  As I indicated in opening the debate, it is a matter I am having examined urgently.  It does not permit of instant solution.  If it did, I would have adopted an instant solution before now.  The only quick action available to me was to increase the number of judges and that is what I am going to do.  If there are any other matters of technical detail arising on the sections I shall deal with them on Comittee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to learn that any doubt arose about the <Col N="1808" /> validity of the appointments of temporary Circuit Court judges.  I never heard any such doubt expressed at any time.  I wonder if this section is necessary because I think appointment as a temporary judge is clearly on a par with permanent appointment.  I do not see why, if a man were temporarily appointed for, say, 12 months and at the end of that time a vacancy had arisen in the Circuit Court to enable him to be permanently appointed and he was so appointed, any doubt about the validity of that appointment could arise.  Assuming that he was practising at the time he was originally appointed, the fact that he acted temporarily for 12 months would not, I think, on any reasonable reading of the section, invalidate his subsequent permanent appointment if there was no break between the period of temporary appointment and the commencement of the permanent one.</P>
      <P>It seems a bit drastic now to have to go back and supposedly validate all temporary appointments as far back as 1924.  I assume the period of temporary appointment is not a period that is taken into account for pension purposes.  If it is, there possibly could be some difficulties; I assume it is not.  If this provision is genuinely necessary in the Circuit Court, should it not also be necessary in the District Court?  I have not compared the wording in the respective sections but one would imagine it would probably be either the same or very similar.  There have always been one or more temporary District Justices at any given time and invariably, as in the case of Circuit Court judges, they have been permanently appointed when vacancies arose during the currency of their temporary appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain why it is necessary in the Circuit Court and not in the District Court, if that is believed to be the case.  I feel the section is curing a doubt which could hardly arise reasonably and the fact that somebody had some doubts about it does not make it necessary to legislate about it.  There must be hundreds of doubts about legal situations of one kind or another but the courts are able to make these clear <Col N="1809" /> from time to time.  One must have some reservations about the necessity for this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an anomaly in regard to Circuit Court judges.  I shall explain what exactly the doubt is. Under section 43 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, now repealed, and section 17 (2) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 the qualifications are laid down for appointment to the Circuit Court bench.  These are that a person be at the date of his appointment&mdash;this is the important thing&mdash;a practising barrister of ten years' standing at least, and, for this purpose service in the case of a barrister as a District Justice is deemed at the Bar.  So the qualification is &ldquo;practising barrister at the date of appointment.&rdquo;  The situation arises that a barrister might be appointed under section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936 as a temporary Circuit Court judge and later comes to be appointed to a permanent post.  At the date of appointment to the permanent post he is a temporary Circuit Court judge; he is not a practising barrister.  This is where the doubt has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Deputy's point that it may seem a fine point of law, a lawyer's point, but that does not take from its validity if it came to be challenged.  One might say: surely a temporary judge is a judge and it is merely changing his judicial nature rather than appointing him again as a judge; but I am advised that, because of the wording of the Acts in regard to the qualification of permanent judges of the Circuit Court, that argument is faulty and does not serve to solve the difficulty.  In essence, the difficulty is the requirement in the 1924 Act and the 1961 Act that at the date of appointment the person should be a practising barrister.  This is why it was found necessary to introduce this saving section.  The saving has to go back to the pre-1961 position when the present Circuit Court was constituted. It is necessary to deal with pre-1961 court in one part of the section and in the other part of the section to deal with post-1961 court.  Each court was in the same difficulty because of the requirement that at the time of appointment the person in question <Col N="1810" /> should be a practising barrister.  It is an anomaly in relation to the Circuit Court only.  It does not arise in regard to the District Court or in the case of the Special Criminal Court because the qualification to sit on the Special Criminal Courts is that the person be a barrister&mdash;not a practising barrister&mdash; or a judge of the other courts.</P>
    <P>The position in the District Courts is that a temporary District Justice may be given a permanent appointment. This is covered by section 29 (3) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, which says that a barrister or solicitor who actually practised his profession for not less than ten years shall be qualified for appointment as a District Justice if for the time being he holds an office in respect of which it is required that every person appointed should have been a practising barrister or solicitor. A temporary District Justiceship is such an office and so a temporary justice is qualified for appointment to a permanent post in the District Court.  That is why it is necessary to introduce the change.  It could be argued as to whether it is a real doubt or a petty legal point.  I think it has some substance and rather than have a position in which there is a question mark over it, it is as well to remove the question mark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless he gets this Bill through in a very short time, anyone who has been sentenced in the past month or so by Judge Roe, or in the past 12 months, approximately, by Judge O'Malley, might well profitably go to the High Court either on <i>certiorari</i>, or on a little used writ <i>quo warranto</i>, to question the validity of his conviction or of his sentence.  The High Court would presumably have to take the view that at the time the position was that those men were not validly appointed.  Sorry, that would not apply to Judge Roe at the moment.  It would apply to Judge <Col N="1811" /> O'Malley who was permanently appointed after temporary service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly apply to a considerable number of judges back over the years.  One would wonder whether the High Court would have any option at the moment but to declare that their subsequent appointment must be in doubt.  I notice that this section does not contain words which are usually contained in sections of this kind, the words, &ldquo;for the removal of any doubts&rdquo;.  Rather curiously it just states by implication that the appointment of permanent Circuit Court judges subsequent to temporary service in the past must have been bad. In order to keep everyone right, the section would have been better expressed if it had commenced with the words: &ldquo;For the removal of doubts which may exist&rdquo;.  Those words should have appeared in each of the two subsections in the section.</P>
      <P>I am not encouraging anyone to take any action of this kind.  On the other hand, as I see it, because of the way the section is worded, it is an open invitation to people who may have been affected by it to make some application, perhaps, to the High Court between now and the time the President signs the Bill.  In order to keep himself clear in that respect the Minister should consider inserting the words I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think these words were used in the 1961 Act dealing with the position of High Court judges when the question was raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the absence of the words would affect the position one way or the other.  Possibly the reason why they are not there is that this section sets out to provide for qualification not merely of those in the past, where there may be some doubts, but also for future qualifications.  The important thing is that the section provides &ldquo;temporarily as a judge of that Court shall be deemed to be, and always to have <Col N="1812" /> been, practice at the Bar&rdquo;.  That is the important sub-clause in section 2 to deal with anything which has gone before and which might be affected by this doubt.</P>
      <P>The chances of anyone having litigation to try to exploit this doubt are small, but that is not to say they do not exist.  If a person feels that the doubt is real and that he has been affected by it, it is his privilege and his right to go to court on it.  As I have already indicated, there are arguments for and against whether or not the doubt exists.  In order to be cautious about the matter we decided to remove it from argument and bring in the change.  I do not think that the insertion of the words: &ldquo;For the purpose of removing doubts&rdquo; would alter the reality of the situation.  It would not prevent somebody from going to the High Court if he feels he has a right to go there.  The position is safeguarded by the clause deeming the service always to have been practice at the Bar.  They are the important words in dealing with the problem raised by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I was referring very briefly to the question of agricultural income which was the subject of research quite recently.  I was referring to it in the broad spectrum of the EEC.  Lest I might be misunderstood, and lest I did not finalise properly the points I was making, I should like to come back to that subject for a moment. The main point I was trying to make was that, if one compares agricultural productivity in the EEC and if, for example, one looks at Holland, one sees that we have less than half the productivity of the Dutch despite the fact that, in relation to our size, we have far greater scope for expansion, even if we refer only to livestock and livestock products.</P>
      <P>The point to note in this context is that it is not always the country with the highest income per head of population that shows the greatest results in agriculture.  Germany, for example, is a very prosperous country and the income there is mainly generated from non-agricultural activities. I would take it, accordingly, that costs are so high in farming that they practically put the German farmer out of competition.  However, whether Germany can find a means of becoming more competitive is a question for that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, Britain has been fairly successful in this matter. I think part of the success is due to the fact that as they have such a large non-agricultural income they can direct a considerable amount of that income into farming activities.  This is done by giving preference to their own producers in their home market, a huge market on which we had to rely for years.  Unfortunately for us, except for cattle on the hoof and other livestock, it was not such a successful market.  We had to devote a large slice of Exchequer expenditure in export subsidies, in effect, to subsidise the British consumer to use our <Col N="1814" /> products.  Now that we have got away from that, no matter what difficulties we may meet in Europe, for the first time we have a market there for our produce at a floor price.</P>
    <P>The European Commission carried out a survey and it stated that the gap between the various countries in the EEC had widened.  The conclusion of the summary was that there is a marked difference between the level and rates of growth of agricultural productivity within the Community. This is understandable but there is also a growing gap between agricultural and non-agricultural activities.</P>
    <P>The level of agricultural productivity is indicated by graphs and by the added value per working year and per unit of account.  The working week is roughly calculated at 45 hours.  I do not know how they arrive at that figure because it is difficult to calculate the number of hours a farmer works; sometimes he may work into the small hours of the morning.  There is also a calculation regarding the added value. For example, Germany has 2,600 units of account; France has 3,200; Italy 2,300; The Netherlands 5,500; Belgium 4,400; Luxembourg 2,100; Denmark 3,900; United Kingdom 4,000 and Ireland 2,000 units.</P>
    <P>If the growth of value is taken per head of the population, as it was taken between 1964 and 1970 in agriculture, and if it is taken on a percentage basis, the <i>per capita</i> figure for Germany is 2.3 per cent; France 4.5 per cent; Italy 5.6 per cent; The Netherlands 3.3 per cent; Belgium 4.5 per cent; Luxembourg 1.2 per cent; Denmark 1.6 per cent; United Kingdom 3.8 per cent and Ireland 2.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The report then shows the percentage <i>per capita</i> for non-agricultural production.  In some cases it is fairly well balanced while in others it is not. On the whole it can be seen that the return from non-agricultural activity is higher than from agricultural productivity. I hope the Council of Ministers will be able to find some way to balance the system.  In the light of our position we can see at a glance that we have a huge task ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> In the course of the debate speakers referred to the desirability of getting younger farmers to work the land. This matter has been the subject of a worthwhile report that was issued recently.  At least it will have the effect of stimulating dialogue, of highlighting the problem and of making us reconsider the general pattern here. There are almost 133,000 holdings under 30 acres; in modern circumstances a 30-acre holding is barely viable unless it is worked on an intensive basis and even if that is done, how many units of labour would be required?  In the 30-acre to 50-acre range there are 60,000 holdings but even the 50-acre holding cannot be considered large.  We must also take into account the quality of the land.</P>
    <P>These matters are highlighted in that report.  We will need to take them into account if we intend to make our way in Europe and to close, or partially close, this gap which is begining to appear between the relevant incomes of the various groups of society who make up this vast Community. The report goes on to show the larger holdings.  We have some large holdings earning far less <i>per capita</i> than much smaller holdings.  That does not apply on a very wide scale, but it is noted in the report on farmers' incomes issued by An Foras Talúntais.  In referring to this report I had difficulty discerning what constituted the manpower on such holdings. It would be all right if it represented the head of the household earning £1,500 a year, but how many people had he helping him?  How was the income distributed?  How many had a claim on the income?  We must face these questions presently.</P>
    <P>The people who carried out this survery did it very well.  They had to face a certain amount of difficulty.  About half of those canvassed took part in the survey, and kept records.  That is as it should be.  Despite the best advice and leadership&mdash;and I have evidence of that in my own and neighbouring counties&mdash;farmers still persist in trying to work by rule of thumb. That age has passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> Today's figures support facts.  A farmer may be wasting time instead of making money.  This could be applied not merely to husbandry in general but also to our efforts to eradicate diseases from our livestock.  When I spoke here last I had not the opportunity of fully studying the Minister's speech.  A section of the speech was devoted to the eradication of livestock diseases.  The Minister dealt with the counties which are clear of disease and those under current clearance.  He also dealt with the subject of bovine tuberculosis. Regrettably it is even more prevalent than I thought.  It is a disease from which we have had only a remission, and we can expect it to turn up again at any time.  It would be very bad if it regained a toehold here because we have enough trouble on hands trying to deal with brucellosis.  I welcome any steps which the Minister or his Department could take to deal with the re-emergence of tuberculosis.  It must be wiped out as far as practicable. If we have a re-emergence of that disease and are not able to proceed rapidly with the eradication of brucellosis we shall have a real job on hands.  In three or four years' time it will be incumbent on us to have a clean bill of health in Europe.  We should be leaders in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong, not with the advice or leadership, but with the personnel.  The Minister mentioned that he had a pre-intensive brucellosis scheme, that is a scheme to deal with the counties not under clearance.  I have had ample evidence of the harm done by people in non-clearance areas who know that a cow or two in the herd has brucellosis.  The cow is sold into a county which is to enter the intensive scheme.  An infected cow was brought in and destroyed a herd of 14 first-class cows.  I felt very sorry for the owner. However, a man of his ability and foresight building up his herd, acted stupidly in buying this cow without proper health certificates to back up the sale.  No matter how the inspectors watch this practice people will take advantage, if there is any advantage to be taken, in this regard.  In the long run it is not an advantage to themselves or their neighbours.  It is a criminal act. <Col N="1817" /> Therefore the inspectors should get support from every decent farmer who has the interests of the future of the national herd at heart.  We should all strive to build the national herd into something which will be a credit to us not merely at home but in Europe.</P>
    <P>Following our experience with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis it is too bad when people pretend that they do not know the rules.  They know them very well but they want to break them.  The sooner we get rid of this type of character the better.</P>
    <P>At column 1452, volume 268 of the Official Report the Minister dealt with certain livestock diseases.  He said:</P>
    <P>In regard to both of these diseases I must say that progress is just not good enough.  We are really living on borrowed time because in four years' time we will be subject to compliance with the full veterinary requirements of the EEC in regard to both our domestic and our export trade in live cattle.  In the negotiated terms under which Ireland entered the Community, we secured derogations which entitle us up to 31st December, 1977, to retain our existing methods of declaring herds free of the two diseases and to export store cattle to the United Kingdom with the minimum of disease restrictions.  The effect of the full application of the present EEC requirements is that unless there is rapid progress in the eradication of brucellosis and a substantial reduction in our present incidence of bovine tuberculosis, more frequent testing of animals for both diseases will be required, internal inter-herd movement of cattle will be severely restricted and our capacity to export will be seriously hampered.</P>
    <P>That is the strongest possible argument to convince those who break rules not to break them and to convince those who seek advice to take that advice.  Those who deliberately try to circumvent regulations should suffer a substantial penalty.  It would be just too bad if we were to revert to a position in which disease was rampant in our livestock.  I am sure every farming organisation is of the <Col N="1818" /> same opinion.  Unfortunately, there are, of course, always the few who, despite exhortation, despite advice, will insist on trying to take a short cut.</P>
    <P>On the question of hides, hides have been making very good prices for the last three or four years.  It is to be regretted that until quite recently we had not developed the skill we should have developed in dealing with hides.  The hide is as valuable as any other part of the beast.  Is it not a pity that hides should be disfigured by bad flaying or careless handling?  Is it not a pity that we do not make the most of this product? Whether the hides are sold at home or abroad they should be sold in top-class condition.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary trait that we always tend to talk about that part of our economy which is moving well.  For example, there is a good deal of talk about the price of livestock. We concentrate on that which is doing well and we possibly at times overlook something that should be able to do better.  I am referring now to sheep.  Sheep have had a varied existence here.  I am glad that steps are being taken with regard to the dipping of sheep and that a special committee has been set up to study sheep scab and make recommendations on its eradication.  I hope this will get all the support it deserves. There is plenty of scope for sheep dipping and there is no reason in the world why we should have sheep scab. It is heartening that practical measures will be taken following the report of this committee.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether our traditional export of cattle on the hoof will continue far into the future or whether it will be replaced by the dead meat trade.  No one likes to be a prophet because prophets usually come to a sticky end.  Some of them lose their heads, sometimes on a marlin spike and sometimes on the spike of criticism.  It is rarely profitable to speculate.  One wonders whether we will be able to retain the hold we have on the British market for store cattle, whether the price of beef will continue with a floor under it in Europe sufficient to attract the <Col N="1819" /> export of our beef there, whether it would be more profitable for us, if it did, to export our beef as fresh beef, either to Britain or to Europe.  If we could do that, it would bring about a complete change in our production of livestock.  At any rate, for the immediate future it looks as if the off-take for cattle on the hoof will be there.  It is said now that if one is producing beef one should do so in an intensive way and produce for the best price, for the highest market.</P>
    <P>The highest market at this moment seems to be for young bull beef in Italy.  Whether that will continue or not, I do not know.  I have not had sufficient time to go into it and forecasting is bad if one is not fully briefed.  It would look as if the return from young bull beef is very high and as if it would compensate in monetary terms for the amount of manpower that would be engaged in its output. We should have this aspect of our livestock system examined to see whether we should switch in a phased way in this direction.  Whether we like it or not the longer a floor remains under beef in Europe the fancier the product will need to be.  Therefore, we can never afford to rest on our oars in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the price of feed.  He dealt with the EEC intervention prices, the system of levies and so on.  Despite membership of the EEC, I would say that in times like the present, when the price of soya bean compound and other compounds has doubled, it would pay us here, as a livestock exporting country, to always have a basic tillage policy.  This can only be done I suppose in times of peace by incentive but a little time should be spent on going into this matter.  The farmer who is viable, who has a decent unit of land, should be able, if he is a livestock producer, to produce a share of the rations his livestock would need. He would be well paid for it by the returns he would get in the end. Whether he was in cattle, sheep or poultry production he would not have to go into the market and buy at the highest price.  We should do everything <Col N="1820" /> to encourage the viable farmer to adopt such a policy.</P>
    <P>The other night I was reading of a report issued by the IDA concerning County Offaly.  It referred to the fact that Offaly lost some of its population. Offaly is a great county with wonderful land.  I spent some time there in the late 1950s and I thought there were wonderful farmers there. When I read the report the other night which referred to a lack of industry, I wondered whether they quite realise the assets they have there in the shape of land and know-how.  I drove through Offaly very recently and was surprised to see the number of green fields.  I did not see a quarter of the tillage which I saw there on a previous occasion.  This is regrettable. We may be inclined to indulge in looking back over our shoulders but we should look more to the future and make provision for the future.  We cannot live in the past except in the sense of history.  Seeing that we are in Europe, that we have guarantees for the first time in our long history of farming, a county such as the one I have mentioned can do very well. They have the manpower, too.  I hope they will get the quota of industry they are seeking but I would not look to industry to solve all my problems if I had the assets they have in County Offaly.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned potatoes and the fact that the position was righting itself.  Last year there was a great scarcity of potatoes.  The season was not all that bad but the early spring, when the potato crop was vulnerable, was very bad.  However, I think there is something going wrong in potato growing.  Blight is blamed.  It is easy enough to blame blight.  We know there is blight.  I am not against the use of nitrogenous manure, but I feel we are applying too much of it to the potato crop. This matter should be examined.  Two or three months after good potatoes are dug up they are black.  More than blight is involved.  The potatoes are grown in forcing beds.  I should like to have the views of expert potato growers.  There seems to be too much forcing, which is not natural.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> There is very little tillage around the country.  Last year people complained about the price of potatoes. None of them grew potatoes.  When I heard complaints I said &ldquo;Grow them yourself&rdquo;.  Any man can have a ridge of potatoes in his garden.  If he has not got a garden his neighbour will allow him grow a ridge of potatoes.  Last year when livestock was doing well people forgot about growing potatoes and found themselves in competition with the housewives in the supermarkets when buying potatoes.  Country people should grow their own potatoes.  We could insulate ourselves against rising prices by doing so.</P>
    <P>Last year, because of scarcity, we had to import potatoes.  We were lucky to be able to do so.  The potato crop is good this year.  If potatoes are forced too much they may react by turning black.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister and his Department will be able to achieve the target set.  The last point to which I wish to refer is the succession scheme.  There is no good talking about incomes, output per man or husbandry methods unless there is sufficient manpower in each unit to do the work.  We can only have the manpower if we take steps to see that we put sufficient money behind the schemes, and begin with pilot schemes. We have had enough paper work.  Let us try the practical scheme.  If even two farmers in each parish surrendered to the younger people, in the knowledge that neither their future nor their status was going to be marked or marred in any way, we would soon get the returns we are looking for. The sooner we go in this direction the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister, and the Parliamentary Secretary, on their appointments. Both men have a very good knowledge of agriculture.  I feel sure they will produce worthwhile programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers of this country are now entering a new era: we are now members of the EEC.  Our farmers are not aware of the urgency connected with the different schemes <Col N="1822" /> which will come into force because of our membership of the EEC.  The Department are not doing enough to bring home to farmers a sense of urgency in regard to the farm modernisation scheme, for instance. These schemes will come in soon. The farmers will have to have plans drawn up covering a five-year period. The committees of agriculture and the agricultural instructors will be involved.  Accounts must be drawn up and kept in order so that the final instalment of loans may be obtained. The Minister must ensure that these plans are drawn up and that there are sufficient agricultural instructors and other officials to process the schemes necessary for each farm.</P>
    <P>It will be vital for our agricultural industry in the future to take advantage of the EEC farm modernisation scheme.  If the majority of our farmers opt for this scheme the Department and the county committees of agriculture must ensure that farmers are made aware of the working of the scheme so that they will be able to obtain the maximum benefit from it.  I suppose it could be said that World Bank loans for agriculture affect mainly the larger farmers but it is important that the smaller and medium sized farmer are enabled also to take advantage of these moneys for farm modernisation purposes.  It seems to me that this World Bank loan is not being publicised sufficiently either by the farming organisations or by the Department. If our farmers are not geared to take advantage of the farm modernisation scheme, we may lose the advantages therefrom to other countries. We must have ready our schemes for agriculture if we are to avail of the benefits to which we are entitled by reason of our EEC membership.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in the not too distant future farmers must keep proper farm accounts if they are to benefit under the various EEC schemes and that their share of the various grants will be based on the accounts they produce.  The Department must use all the resources at their disposal to make farmers aware of what will be the position in the <Col N="1823" /> future.  It is my opinion that many farmers do not realise what is involved.</P>
    <P>Regarding the various Department schemes&mdash;the beef cattle incentive scheme, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;grants are paid on the recommendation of the agricultural instructor and of the county committees of agriculture.  While these schemes are very good, there is often very little opportunity afforded to the man who has, say, one or two cows and who wishes to increase his herd to five or six because, even on the recommendation of his committee of agriculture, he may have difficulty in qualifying for a grant.  These are the people, who, down through the years, maintained a stock even if only on a very small scale and they should be helped in every way possible to increase their herds.</P>
    <P>I understand that in regard to pigs the smallest unit that is now considered practicable is a 1,000 head unit.  That is a pity because up to now pig rearing has been regarded as a home industry for the smaller farmer. It was a means whereby the housewife could make some extra money for household goods and so on but it appears that that kind of operation will no longer be possible because of the cost of feedingstuffs.  Very often those farmers who grumble about the cost of feedingstuffs grow a lot of grain for which they get big prices. Consequently, they can hardly expect feedstuffs to be cheap.</P>
    <P>What the Minister should endeavour to ensure in regard to sheep is that there is a continuous market for our lamb.  This year I understand that the position has been fairly good and that the French market was the principal one for us in this regard.  Down through the years the lamb market has been in the precarious position of being closed one month and open the next and I am told that even within the EEC the French can close their market to us.  That results in an adverse effect on our sheep population.</P>
    <P>It should be the policy of the Department to ensure that our committees of agriculture have a sufficient number of instructors for the purpose <Col N="1824" /> of assessing farmers' readiness to avail of the various schemes that will be available to them.  More instructors mean more expenditure but it is important that the required number be available.</P>
    <P>It is agreed generally that farm income has increased greatly but I consider it my duty to say that the income of the farm worker has not increased very much down through the years.  The Agricultural Wages Board have been bad from the point of view of these people.  When Mr. James Dillon was Minister for Agriculture he said that he would agree that his policy as Minister was a failure if the standard of living of the agricultural worker was not at least equal to that of the industrial worker. If we take that criteria for the purpose of judging any Minister for Agriculture down through the years, we must agree that his policy was a failure because the agricultural workers of whom there is still a large number are the down-trodden people of this country.  We must remember that they are entitled to the same standard of living as any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>While I agree there are some small farmers whose standard is not going up with the best in the land, the larger farmers are doing pretty well at present.  I am delighted with that position but I believe a case can be made for some improvement.  I believe it would be a step forward if the Agricultural Wages Board was abolished and I am pleased to hear that negotiations are in progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>A farm labourer at present has to be a highly skilled man.  In my area such an employee is dealing with tillage farmers, those growing barley, wheat and beet, and he is also a mechanic.  He must be because he is in charge of complicated machinery. For all these reasons he should not be in an adverse position <i>vis-à-vis</i> any other workers in this country.  What kills me altogether is that a worker in County Dublin is on a different basis from his counterpart in County Kildare and the worker in Kildare is <Col N="1825" /> paid more than his neighbour in Laois, Offaly or west Wicklow.  I do not know how anybody could justify that policy of fixing wages.</P>
    <P>These people are entitled to fair play, something they have not been getting down the years.  There are a lot of people who are considered agricultural workers and are brought within the scope of the Agricultural Wages Board whom I feel should not be classified as such because they seem to be part of an industry.  It is high time that this situation was changed.  When we were discussing legislation in this House to give workers three weeks annual holidays, for some unknown reason&mdash;perhaps it was because an Agricultural Wages Board is in existence&mdash;the headlines in the papers said that everybody was to be given three weeks holidays except agricultural workers and those engaged in the fishing industry.  Why do we have to single out a worker because he is engaged in agriculture, our principal industry, which is doing pretty well at present?  The Minister should have a look at the Agricultural Wages Board and have consultations with the Minister for Labour concerning its operation.  He should come up with something decent and christian for the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when the TB eradication scheme was introduced I thought&mdash;foolishly, I admit&mdash;that once a herd was free from this disease a farmer would be able to keep his herd absolutely free of it.  Now it appears that, even though a herd is free of this dreaded disease for a number of years, it can break out again.  This is disappointing and if it is so we will always have this disease with us.  A lot of people feel that proper supervision is not being exercised on this TB eradication scheme.  It is the opinion of many that when a herd is cleared is should be possible to keep it clear.</P>
    <P>There are areas in the country where it is compulsory to comply with the brucellosis eradication scheme.  In my county a voluntary scheme is in operation and it is hoped that by the time it is compulsory for farmers to comply with the main scheme a lot <Col N="1826" /> of the ground work will have been completed.  I commend the operation of this voluntary scheme which is deserving of the support of all the farmers in my area.</P>
    <P>The scheme to eradicate the warble fly has been in operation since I was a small boy.  It is said that if everybody treated their animals for this warble fly we would eradicate it in a year or two.  If that is so it is high time we enforced this properly.  If a person, during the last month of the time allowed for the treatment of animals against warble fly, sells cattle at a fair he need not have any certificate to show that they have been dressed but the farmer who purchases these animals does not have time to have them dressed.  There is a need there for tightening up by the Department. I have knowledge of a farmer who purchased cattle towards the end of the period during which they should have been dressed ascertaining later that he was too late to have them looked after.  Apparently there is a time lag between the submitting of applications and the dressing of these animals.  The result of this was that the farmer concerned was involved in endless trouble.</P>
    <P>In the breeding of cattle there is also the question of scrub bulls.  Such animals are being kept by unscrupulous farmers.  The Department policy of eradicating these animals and prosecuting those found in possession of them is correct because only the highest quality bulls should be allowed to produce our stock.  This is particularly important in view of the fact that this country has now joined the EEC. If we mean to maintain stock at a high standard those keeping such animals should be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>In my area a lot of barley is grown. The price this year was excellent: it was fixed at 25p per barrel more than the feeding price.  Barley has always been a good crop but a rotation is necessary because our land, rich though it is, will not continually grow barley either for feeding or for malting. This brings me to beet growing. I am fearful that our beet crop will not be big enough to enable us to meet our sugar quota.  Beet is a very <Col N="1827" /> valuable crop.  A great deal of employment is provided in the growing of the crop, the manufacturing of the sugar and transporting both products. It may be that we have to cut down on beet growing, but I would ask the Minister to ensure not alone that our beet quota is not reduced but that it will be increased in years to come.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to keep the vegetable industry going.  I cannot see any good reason why vegetables cannot be economically produced in this country and sold overseas.  We pride ourselves on being a wonderful agricultural country; yet packet foods and vegetables are imported into this country.  Surely it is possible for us to hold our own markets here as well as to export these items.  In that way the failures of Erin Foods in the past can be overcome.  To make this possible we must have a sales organisation in Britain and throughout Europe.  Both beet and vegetables are very necessary if we are to maintain the proper rotation of crops between grain and root crops.</P>
    <P>The agricultural institutes throughout the country are doing good work.  I refer specifically to reclaimed bogland which has proved to be very suitable for growing vegetables.  I know there is some research going on in this area but not nearly enough, and not enough money is being spent in ensuring that our boglands which are suitable for growing vegetables are properly treated and reclaimed.  It has been proved at Lullymore and elsewhere that vegetables can be grown in this way.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the reclamation of bogland was a very important part of our agricultural programme and that not enough money was being made available for this work. This is one sphere in which progress should not be hindered for want of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the excellent work being done by the manager and workers at the National Stud in Kildare. Stallions are being made available <Col N="1828" /> there, which will ensure that our great tradition in horseflesh will continue.  I would suggest that some of these fine horses should be made available to mares owned by small farmers under a certain valuation free or at a very low charge.  This would encourage the smaller man to get into the very lucrative horse breeding industry.  There are some wonderful farmers with small bits of land who are making a living out of land by reason of the fact that they are able to take conacre.  The price of land makes it impossible for these people ever to own a farm.</P>
    <P>There should be greater co-operation between the Department, the Land Commission and the committees of agriculture.  People who are proven farmers even though they have only a small amount of land should be able by some method to acquire sufficient land to give them a decent living from agriculture.  Many of them by taking conacre, being able to pay high prices for it and still make a living have proved that they are expert farmers.  I know of one man who owns about six acres and is rearing a good family very well by taking conacre. People like him should be helped to become farmers because they have proved their competence.</P>
    <P>Farmers should be encouraged to avail of the services rendered by agricultural officers of the committees of agriculture.  In my own county, and I believe in most other counties, these are dedicated men, prepared to go out at any time, night or day to help in any way they can with expert advice in all spheres of modern farming. They and the Department should advertise the schemes available and tell the farmers the areas in which they could show them how to do better.  In my county I understand these officers have contact with 80 per cent of the farming population.  I suppose that is good but I am a little upset to think that even 20 per cent of the farmers in my county, where there is supposed to be good communication, do not use the services of these officers and do not use the committee of agriculture schemes.  If the available services were properly used it would benefit production and be a <Col N="1829" /> tremendous boon to the farmers themselves.</P>
    <P>The setting up of industries in farming areas will probably become more necessary from now on.  Fewer people will be needed in agriculture because of the increasing use of machinery. As far as possible we should try to get industries based on agricultural products.  In that way we could boost farm production, income and employment in these areas.  That would be the right approach.  There is much talk about the flight from the land and I agree that in my own area most of the farms are big.  We also have very small farmers and those with mostly bogland.  Most of the flight from the land is due to people leaving agriculture for industry or even going to Britain.  When an agricultural worker loses his job&mdash;which is inevitable, I suppose, in the light of mechanical progress&mdash;it does not matter to him whether he goes to Limerick, Dublin or London since he is leaving his own environment and is an emigrant in any case.  It is vitally important to get agriculture-based industries into these areas if at all possible.  We should be devoting much more thought to this than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>The cattle breeding services are doing excellent work in artificial insemination but some of them are not placed to the best advantage.  They should be in the centre of areas where there is a good cow population so as not to involve travelling the great distances they sometimes have to travel.  If agriculture is to continue to grow as we would hope and if farm incomes and agricultural workers incomes do not grow together, this would be a mistake.  We should ensure that every forward step by the farmers, in incomes and otherwise, would be matched by a similar step forward by the farm worker.</P>
    <P>I conclude by wishing the Minister luck in his post and I thank the Chair for bearing with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to compliment the Minister on his very comprehensive opening statement which I read over the week-end.  It is a very detailed and unusual resumé <Col N="1830" /> of the state of the agricultural industry at this time.  Not only did the Minister show us a rosy picture here and there but he very concisely underlined the many problems facing the industry in the critical years ahead. The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary and his officials have made quite an impact in their work.  I was a little disappointed to read in the report of last Wednesday's debate a rather sharp attack on the Minister's performance by Deputy Collins.  Perhaps that was a pity because I think the Minister has worked extremely hard.  He came into his Ministry at the deep end, as it were, at the beginning of our entry into Europe.  Despite what may have been quoted from the newspapers, his progress as leader of the Irish delegation on agricultural matters in the Council of Ministers has been significant to date.</P>
      <P>His performance during the fixing of the common agricultural prices for 1973 and 1974 was a significant contribution on behalf of this country and of the farming community.  On that occasion he had to take on not only the Minister and the people from the United Kingdom but also many other representatives from other member States.  By and large, we came out extremely well with the increases in prices which were negotiated successfully from our point of view.  Despite the tremendous opposition mounted by two of the most powerful members of the Community, the Minister won increases in the major products which we have to sell.  The guide price for beef was increased by 10.5 per cent and for calves by 7.5 per cent.  The price for milk delivered to creameries was increased by 5.4 per cent, for skim milk powder by 22.2 per cent, for pig meat by 4 per cent and for cereals by 1 per cent.  Perhaps they were not sufficient for some but, nevertheless, back in the spring of the year, it was suggested that there should be reductions instead of increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this because it is unfair to attack somebody for not doing a good job when the record shows that the achievements of the Minister and his senior officials who were with him <Col N="1831" /> and advised him during the crucial negotiations were a significant contribution. The ordinary market price within our country has considerably exceeded those guide prices.  Statistics now tend to show that, since we entered the enlarged Community, agricultural prices in general have gone up well in excess of 30 per cent this year.  All in all, Irish agriculture has benefited considerably from our joining the Community.  The picture is good and there can be tremendous confidence in agriculture because, for the first time since this State was founded, we have a guaranteed system of prices.  People can now afford to plan ahead and to raise capital to invest in their own farms in the sure knowledge that they have a definite and guaranteed price structure which we never had before.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also reasonably successful in negotiating a fair beef incentive scheme.  The negotiations on the hill farming policy document were difficult.  This document did not make many of the headlines here but it is an important regulation for the Irish farmer.  Too few people understand the difficulties which faced the Irish negotiators and people who spoke on these problems at any level in Europe. When that document came out first the scale of grants was aligned in some way to the height of the region. The general theory was something like this: the higher up the mountain the farm was, the higher the rate of grant.  This would not suit a country like Ireland and it certainly did not suit Holland where so much of the land is under sea level.  In the enlarged Community the difference in climatic conditions, in crop husbandry and in modes and ways of farming is fantastic.  When people sit around a table to iron out price levels or new schemes the point of view of people representing these completely different regions and types of agriculture must be taken into account.  The Minister and his officials and those of us who had an opportunity of speaking in the European Parliament on these documents have all contributed in some way towards making <Col N="1832" /> these proposals and regulations more meaningful and, perhaps, a little easier for the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister's most recent achievement is the fact that last week when the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Lardinois, announced details of his new amendment to the common agricultural policy, and after a vigorous campaign by the Minister pressing for the setting up of a common organisation for the marketing of sheep and lamb, he announced that provision would be made for a common agricultural policy on sheep. This is something for which we must thank the Minister in particular because our country stands to benefit mostly from it.  At present our sheep farmers seem to be the only people who are not benefiting by the guarantees which are built in to the common agricultural policy.  So, when the new policy comes into effect as I am sure it will, there may be some slight reductions possibly on the dairy side but, from a national point of view, this will be compensated for to a tremendous extent when stability is introduced into sheep husbandry and the production of sheep and lambs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins was critical of the fact that Ireland had applied for such a very small share of the funds available through the FEOGA grant.  I find this a little difficult to take.  As reported at column 1471 of the Official Report for 7th November, 1973, he said:</P>
    <P>Ireland could have done better but for the bungling of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Advertising in the newspapers regarding availability of FEOGA grants is just not good enough.  The Government can be charged, fairly and squarely, with lack of initiative in this instance, Emphasising the essentiality of continued capital investment in Irish agriculture raises the necessity of a proper expansionist long-term programme for development.  At the very minimum the Government should have an agricultural development blueprint for the next four years, that is until the end of transitional membership in 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> That may be true.  I am surprised that Deputy Collins who was a member of the last Government, should level such a charge at the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his Department.  There was no forward planning by the previous Minister for our entry into Europe.  Even in Northern Ireland the United Kingdom Government have applied for grants totalling £21.3 million in comparison with our application for £12 million. The criticism here should fall squarely on the previous Minister because there was no forward thinking or planning.</P>
    <P>In every Department the EEC sections are not properly established. The sections are grossly understaffed and those of us in Europe found that this places us at a disadvantage.  The previous Government were remiss in this because two years ago they should have arranged to set up sections in the various Departments with sufficient personnel to ensure that applications and schemes would be prepared to present to the institutions in Europe at the appropriate time.  I regret it has to be said that this was not done.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed with the civil servants of the Department whom I have met in Brussels.  Many of the people seconded to work with the Commission have made a tremendous impression on their European colleagues and I should like to take the opportunity to pay this tribute to them. While it is a pity the cream of the civil Service have been sent to Europe, nevertheless it is good that in the many important posts we have been called on to fill, highly qualified Irishmen&mdash; many of them more highly qualified than the average&mdash;are carrying out their new duties with distinction and in a manner that is bringing credit to their country and to the positions they held before taking up their new roles in Europe.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy Carter said with regard to brucellosis and other diseases.  The most important sector of our economy is the export of beef, which amounted last year to £134 million, and it is important that we give it our closest attention.  It is expected that this figure will be greatly increased this <Col N="1834" /> year because of the higher prices.  It is a national scandal that unscrupulous farmers&mdash;admittedly they are in a minority&mdash;who should voluntarily go into the Department's brucellosis eradication scheme can avail of the new pre-intensive scheme for the eradication of brucellosis.  These people are getting their cows and heifers tested at the expense of the taxpayers.  Some of them are offering reactors for sale in cattle marts and thus are infecting good herds.  I know that the managers and the committee members of cattle marts are doing good work and I am sure they do not wish to be a party to this kind of operation.  The onus is on the Minister or his Department to draft a regulation insisting that every identified reactor must be marked so that there would be no doubt that the animal is a reactor. If there is no legislation to deal with this matter now, measures should be introduced as a matter of urgency. As the Minister rightly pointed out, we have only four years in which to finally eradicate brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis.  This is a very short period and it will be a costly operation.  People should not be allowed to spread the disease by offering for sale an animal they know is a reactor.</P>
    <P>At the moment marts are selling diseased heifers and cows and this is aggravating the problem.  People may not understand that even a champion animal, one that wins prizes at the show, may be a reactor.  When they are isolated as reactors they should be clearly marked.  The strength of the law must be applied in these cases. The present fines are inadequate and it is essential that more substantial fines be imposed so that they may be a deterrent.  These people are attacking one of our national assets and unless we become a disease-free area we will not be able to export our livestock to the United Kingdom, to Europe or to the United States.  The only way the Department can ensure this is to bring in a regulation directing that no heifer should be offered for sale unless accompanied by a disease-free certificate.  This will cause a certain amount of difficulty and <Col N="1835" /> trouble for farmers but it will save millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>The officials of the Department are too strict in their application of the regulations when paying compensation for reactors, even reactors to the bovine tuberculosis test.  If a small farmer has a reactor it can cause hardship.  A heifer calving for the first time can be quite weak if it had a difficult calving.  If the vet comes at that time and a heifer which has been down&mdash;this is a technical term&mdash; should become a reactor, the value can be put at as low as £50.  This would be the proper value to a meat factory.  After a month these heifers will be back to normal.  In the case of the small herd the potential value of these animals should be offered as compensation and not the value to the bone factory.  Many cases have come to my notice where poor farmers in mountain areas, during the winter months when the cattle were thin, were unfairly treated.  There should be flexibility here.  Special provision should be made for such cases where it would be justifiable to have the Department's inspectors assess the potential value of the heifers which have had difficulty in calving.</P>
    <P>The pre-intensive scheme for eradication of brucellosis, which gives a grant of £30 per reactor for slaughter, £20 after two years or £15 after three years, is an ungenerous inducement. The Department should have been more realistic.  Their present prices are very much behind the market prices. It is not fair to expect the majority of farmers to accept this scheme.  If these people put their reactors on the market they would get double the value offered by the Department.  The Minister should look at this point and bring the price structure up to date. The price paid for reactors should be tied to the value of the replacement animal.  Over the past 20 years we have spent a vast sum of money on the eradication of animal diseases.  We enjoy a disease-free status which is envied by other countries.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that no effort has ever been made to introduce preventive veterinary medicine to any great extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> This is an aspect of veterinary practice which has been neglected.  When we consider the large amount of money we are spending on the eradication of diseases it might be a good idea if we could perhaps short-circuit the whole procedure by introducing a system of preventive medicine.  This would have to be done by the ordinary practitioners even if it were initially introduced as a pre-spring calving or pre-autumn calving inspection.  The practitioner would look at the herd and advise the farmer on the preventive practices they might adopt to curtail the spread of the disease or prevent the disease flaring up in the herd.  The Department should set up a treatment organisation.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to encourage this practice immediately.  I do not know how costly it might be but it would be a modern way of attacking the problems which have not been solved.  Nobody can say that the efforts to eradicate bovine tuberculosis have been successful over the past 16 or 18 years.  That leaves something to be desired.  There have been instances of the disease reappearing after a number of completely clear tests.  This in itself would indicate that there is a need for preventive medicine in this sphere. There should be a campaign to highlight and advocate greater care and instruction in the use of antibiotics, especially the more dangerous ones. Perhaps they could be restricted but I would not like to see complete control.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hynes, the head of the veterinary section of the Department, said some time ago that tuberculosis or brucellosis testing could be done by technicians.  I would agree with this line of thought.  Antibiotics as cerates for mastitis and minor ailments, which are quite a problem could be applied by farmers or herdsmen.  There is need for care and for instruction since the careless use of these cerates can be dangerous.  But to deny farmers the use of them would be short-sighted and might very well negative the benefits one would like to achive by controlling their use.  In the Animal Diseases Act of some five or six years ago an effort was made to control the use of both antibiotics and cerates. It was not successful and rightly <Col N="1837" /> so.  However, there is some thin ice there and something should be done on the lines of instruction to alert the farming community to the dangers that could result by the indiscriminate use of these products and by a lack of proper care in their use. Indeed, that can apply right across the board in veterinary practice.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the CBS Board and its chief executive for the progress they have made in the short time in which they have been in operation.  Their promotions abroad have been reasonably successful.</P>
    <P>Now that we are going in with the common agricultural sheep policy it is important that standards should be maintained.  Heavy penalties should be imposed for any infringement of those standards.  Quality control should take precedence in the case of exports such as beef, lamb, mutton and bacon and heavy penalties should be imposed for infringements of standards.</P>
    <P>Our export of meat will be one of our most valuable assets.  In the June census the cattle population showed an increase of over 500,000 and I have seen a figure of ten million for our cattle population before 1980.  I believe that we will still export cattle on the hoof in about the same numbers as we have been exporting them up to this.  Large numbers will be exported in the processed form.  This will give additional employment in the meat processing industry, particularly when we get chilled transport and more roll-on-roll-off ferries.  There is the difficulty of some get-rich quick merchant wanting to make a quick buck by substituting old ewes for lamb.  That happened some years ago when they started exporting lamb to the Paris market.  We must have standards and vigilance must be exercised to ensure that the goods we sell live up to their reputation.</P>
    <P>The reaction of Europeans, especially the Parisians and some Italians, to the initial shipments of Irish beef and lamb over the last few months has been very heartening.  I think too much emphasis is being placed on the Charollais and the <Col N="1838" /> Fleckvieh.  Europeans have commented on the succulence of Irish beef and I believe it is the fat that everybody is against which gives that extra flavour to Irish beef.  One does not get the same flavour from continental meat.  Most continentals have not yet had experience of our Irish beef but those who have have expressed satisfaction and pleasure.  Our meat was a tremendous success at the Cologne Fair this year and I wish the CBS continued success in their efforts. But the Department must impose standards and must supervise to ensure that those standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>I believe commercial beef production will be the worst off section of the agricultural industry in coming years. Commercial beef production uses the least imported raw materials.  It is a product which provides jobs in fertiliser factories, meat factories, cattle marts and transport.  We export almost 100 per cent of the product on the hoof or on the hook, but the beef farmer gets the least aid compared with other sections.  This section has been neglected for far too long.  It is relegated to second place behind the dairying industry.  I hope the dairy people will not take offence at this, but commercial beef is the most valuable single export we have. The Department could have been more generous with the beef scheme and the other aids which should go to this valuable industry.  Farmers should be encouraged to stay in beef production.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais and Irish agricultural advisers readily admit that this country grows grass with the highest protein content in the world, never mind Europe, and that is why we are able to produce such excellent beef.  Yet the emphasis for far too long has been on milk.  It is annoying to hear people say in Europe that by 1980 the Irish will have doubled their milk output.  That is a nice figure to quote, especially if you are trying to knock down the price of milk or to knock the common agricultural policy <i>in toto,</i> but expressed as a percentage of total EEC production even double the present Irish production is insignificant. <Col N="1839" /> Nevertheless, people bandy this figure around to show that we in Ireland, despite what we say, want to cripple the German and the UK factory workers by calling for more subsidies to double our milk production.</P>
    <P>We should put more emphasis on beef production.  I hope that our beef conversion scheme will be given every possible aid by the Department.  We have not given sufficient thought to our beef breeds here.  I must be 16 or 17 years on a county committee of agriculture.  In that time the emphasis has always been on dairy breeds.  Indeed the premiums paid to herd owners to keep dairy bulls have been twice or three times the amount paid to a farmer who keeps a beef bull.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should have a rethink on the kind of beef breed that will sell best on the butchers block in Europe, in the UK or wherever we are going to sell over the next few years.  We must get down to a long term policy for this important part of the industry.  The &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing of course is the Charollais.  This breed is one that has its disadvantages, mainly at calving time.  There is perhaps a greater risk with this breed than others.  The Fleckvieh to a lesser extent is gaining in popularity.  I think for a distinctive Irish flavour it is hard to beat the Hereford, the Friesian or a cross of both.  Yet the Department have always shied away for opting for either a beef or a dairy or even taking the dual purpose.  Perhaps there is room for everything here.</P>
    <P>I was looking at some statistics for Norway recently, prepared when Norway was thinking of coming into the EEC.  I found that 60 per cent of their herd are Ayrshires.  This is a breed of cattle that is not terribly popular here.  It seems to be, perhaps like the Kerry, a very economic animal to feed and when crossed with some of the European beef breeds has produced extraordinary results.  The difficulty here is that there is some antiquated regulation which prohibits the use of semen for cross breeding with <Col N="1840" /> this dairy breed.  I wonder whether the time has come for the Department to have a re-examination of many of these old regulations which were originally brought in by breed societies. Even breed societies ought to move with the times and if by a clever cross we can produce a better type of animal to suit our terrain or Irish conditions the Irish farmer should be given the advantage of this kind of animal.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned our hopes for the beef industry.  I think the people who compile the figures can be relied upon to have done a good job and they say that our herd will increase to ten million by 1980.  Their projections, back over the years have been, wholly accurate.  What worries me is that, while we have projections of what our exports will be for the coming years, there is no long term policy to ship cattle, either alive or dead. This is a vital national industry and we should have a long term gilt-edged policy on shipping.  Since the B &amp; I are now a semi-State body they should be given the responsibility of seeing to it that adequate tonnage is available to ensure that the Irish beef industry will not be handicapped for the want of adequate shipping capacity in the years ahead.  Those people, and indeed private enterprise, have not shown such a great interest in this aspect of Irish life.  Perhaps they are right when they say it is not a very viable operation but it should be made viable.  There is no use in producing ten million cattle if we cannot ship them.  They will not fly out.  We must, as a matter of urgency, have a long term policy on the export of meat both on the hook and on the hoof.  This should be drawn up within the next three months.</P>
    <P>We must also look now at our cold storage capacity for dead meat.  We should provide adequate cold storage here because an increased amount of our national herd will be exported in a processed form.  The demand in Europe seems to be for meat&mdash;whether it is bacon, mutton or beef&mdash;in a processed, polythene-wrapped form.  We must also be able to transport our major produce to the most lucrative markets in Europe.  Only 17 per cent <Col N="1841" /> of our total exports of fresh or chilled meat is transported out of this country in Irish transport.  This puts us in a very insecure position.  The semi-State organisations concerned must consider it their duty to the national economy, to the farmer and to the workers in the meat factories, to ensure that no one's position will be endangered because of inadequate transport facilities. That transport must be Irish-controlled. So far as I am aware CIE have only three trans-European lorries.  This is not a sufficient number. The Italians have a regulation whereby meat imported into their country is accepted only if it has been transported on a vehicle owned by the country of the origin of the produce.  A lack of Irish-owned transport would result in a curtailment of our exports.  In respect of a trade which, last year, was worth £134 million, the Government should be in a position to direct the B &amp; I and CIE to get together and ensure that there would be adequate transport for our meat exports.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, too, CBF might consider erecting modern-sized deep-freeze depots at points between some of the major cities in Britain and also on the Continent so that produce could be left there from the juggernauts for easy distribution on whatever happened to be the most lucrative markets.  This would be a worthwhile exercise because it is not the best idea to leave the final distribution of our products in the hands of people from other countries who might not have the same diligence in regard to our products as our own people would have.</P>
    <P>Regarding pilot development schemes, the Department should be a little more ambitious and should endeavour to find people who are prepared to try out new ideas and to allow their neighbours to watch the progress that is being made.  This could be done in conjunction with the pilot extension farms or in any area where it would be possible and desirable that farmers should try out new means of production.  Slatted floors, for instance, are quite common where pigs are concerned, but I notice a development now <Col N="1842" /> whereby floors of this type are being used also for cattle and sheep.  New ideas are being put forward, too, in regard to the construction of pighouses.  If the Department wish to propagate this development they should endeavour to find farmers who would be prepared to implement their idea and, perhaps, compensate them by way of extra grants under the pilot development scheme.  I can foresee a very good future for hoggets on slatted-floored fattening houses especially for those farmers whose stocks in the past were subject to attacks from dogs, <i>et cetera.</i> The idea should be tried out in as many areas as possible and as soon as possible.  It will be highly desirable to have it implemented by the time that the CAP policy is extended to include sheep.  It is a pity there are not more places where farmers could see these fattening houses in operation because it is more effective for one to see something than merely to read about it.</P>
    <P>Anyone engaging in any such a project should be entitled to something over and above the usual grants.  There is precedence for this in respect of the extension demonstration farms which are to be found in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>One aspect of agriculture that I did not hear mentioned during the debate is that of land use.  It is time we concentrated on land use throughout the whole country and not only in urban areas.  Our future in respect of agriculture is assured by reason of our membership of a Community of 254 million people.  Therefore, the use to which we put our land will be of great importance.</P>
    <P>Starting on 1st January a retirement pension scheme will be introduced by the Minister for Lands and I hope it will prove successful.  In my view this scheme is a big advance on the inducement that was built into section 12 of the 1963 Land Act and now it might be possible to reorganise, readjust and reconsolidate our small holdings to a greater degree.  I hope this scheme will contain sufficient flexibility to enable farmer's sons to settle.</P>
    <P>On the question of land use, it is <Col N="1843" /> my view that we should have a land use authority.  Such a suggestion may sound grandiose but we are in a new situation.  We are entering a new era and consequently we should be more concerned about our land and its use. People do not seem to bother about the land or whether it is being used to the fullest extent.  I am not suggesting that we should have inspectors telling people what to do but with a growing tendency between now and the end of this century towards famine throughout the world because of a general protein shortage, it is a shame to see potentially good arable land being planted by the Forestry Division. This land could be used for the production of beef or the type of protein that is in such short supply in the world.</P>
    <P>In this regard I feel it is a pity that so little thought has been given to the people of Ethiopia over the last four dry seasons they have had.  Irish people, looking back in history, tend to look unkindly on the people of Britain who allowed so many of our ancestors to starve to death in the late 1840s.  We are nearer to Ethiopia today than the people of Britain were to Ireland in the 1840s and, therefore, I am justified in asking how interested are we in the plight of the people of that country.</P>
    <P>We are within one day's travel of the starving people of Ethiopia whereas the British people in the 1840s would have had great difficulty in reaching the west of Ireland.  We ought to be concerned about the people of Ethiopia and we should have made a greater effort to alleviate the hunger, starvation and malnutrition in that country.  Ethiopia is one of the nicest countries in Africa and it has a very charming and cultural people.  I am aware that some aid went from this country but it is terrible that the world looked on and did so little.  We have done very little.</P>
    <P>Agricultural organisations and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary might mention this to the Minister&mdash; should give a lead in this regard.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, <Col N="1844" /> one of the best organised Departments, should be able to lead public thought in this respect and should be able to divert some protein foods which we are at present endeavouring to export throughout the world.  I do not think it would break the Irish coffers if we gave more generously than we have done to these people who have had a difficult time over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Returning to my suggestion of the establishing of a land use authority, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what thought he, or the Minister, has given to the considerable tracts of land throughout Ireland on which Bord na Móna has ceased work.  Is the Minister alive to the fact that this semi-State body is compulsorily acquiring potentially arable land from Irish farmers for £20 per acre?  When the turf has been removed the land, in my view, is worth at least £400 per acre.  This matter should be of concern to the Department, the section of the Government responsible for the welfare of the farmers of this country.  Are we to have in a few years time huge farms owned and operated by a semi-State body, Bord na Móna?</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that Dr. F. Cole in Lullymore is, and has been for some time, carrying on interesting experiments on such land in his district.  He is carrying the equivalent of a bullock and three-quarters per acre on this reseeded cutaway bog left by Bord na Móna. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of this potentially arable land throughout the country which is at least worth £400 per acre.  Where does the nation stand in this regard?  Is it fair or right that a semi-State body in the name of the taxpayers of this country should compulsorily acquire land and pay £10 or £20 per acre for it and when they have their mineral wealth extracted from it leave it idle?</P>
    <P>Problems such as this could be solved by a land use authority. Legislation should be introduced soon to enable farmers to lease bog land to Bord na Móna rather than having it compulsorily acquired.  Provision should be made for the return of this <Col N="1845" /> land to the farmer when turf cutting operations have ceased on it.  Earlier this year I had occasion to intervene in a case where Bord na Móna served a CPO on a small farmer for 40 acres of his land and offered him £800 for it.  It is grossly unjust that civil servants, who are well insulated from the economic breezes sitting in the better off areas of Dublin, are able to decide on the power and strength of an Act that goes back to the early forties.  It is wrong that they should cast a greedy eye on a piece of land the acquisition of which inconveniences and destroys the potential viability of a holding.  Such acquisition is carried out without any long term planning or any knowledge of what is to be done with the land when turf cutting operations have ceased.</P>
    <P>Under the common agricultural policy there is overproduction in some lines of agriculture with the result that the EEC are not anxious to bring some land into production.  However, I feel that farmers should be given the opportunity of leasing their land to Bord na Móna for a number of years and when turf cutting has ceased on it that it should revert back. At that stage the farmer would qualify for reseeding and drainage grants to help him prepare the land for full crop production, because at that stage the additional acreage would make the small farmer's property a viable holding.  It is a pity that with all the agricultural trials and experiments we have had, whether carried out by the Agricultural Institute, the Department or the universities, little has been done about mountain farming.  The authorities must have been aware for some years back that a considerable amount of money was available for mountain or hill farming projects and for farming pursuits in the less productive and less developed areas, but in this country we have had no official experiment carried out on high altitude farming. To my knowledge, there is one such experiment and that is being carried out on the Cappard Estate, Rosenallis, County Laois, where an individual farmer is endeavouring to break the pan on the Slieve Bloom Mountains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1846" /> He experimented this year there with some 40 acres and had some cereal crop at a height of over 1,000 feet.  If this method of introducing a huge bulldozer or plough on the slopes is successful on the 40 acres, it will mean another 50,000 potentially arable acres in that region at a level between 100 and 1,000 feet.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of experiment that should be made.  The only support this man got from the State so far is that the Land Commission have served notice of inspection on him. I am disappointed at this: if a person is prepared to invest a considerable amount of private means in the sort of experiment that will obviously enhance the fortunes of a large number of people living in higher regions, the Land Commission should be a little more discerning and should, perhaps, wait and see what is the real potential of this land.  With the tendency for starvation and, perhaps, famine to spread across the world before the end of the century we need as much land as possible available for protein production.  Therefore, somebody should be charged with responsibility to assess the potential of land in various regions and at various altitudes.</P>
    <P>Now that we are in the EEC there should be a regrouping of the agencies that have been successfully aiding the agricultural industry.  Perhaps we should join the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Lands, the ACC and the Agricultural Institute and divide them again among a number of Ministries in a more meaningful way.  At local level the time has come when the personnel of the land project, the farm building schemes, the ACC and the local advisory services should be housed in the same buildings, in other words, co-ordinate the local services for agriculture.  This could be done if we built on the existing structures of the county committees of agriculture which, by and large, have served the farmers and the economy very well over the years.</P>
    <P>We should now examine closely the possibility of launching a new rural development authority.  This thought <Col N="1847" /> has been around for some time.  I am not dissatisfied with the work of any of these organisations individually. Their contributions to Irish agriculture over the years have been significant, each working in its own particular field, but for the competition we must now face we need greater co-ordination of effort.  For instance, for the World Bank loans one must have a five-year farm plan. The best possible way to achieve this, at least in the transitional period, is to have all the people engaged on the various schemes working at local level under the one roof.  This should certainly ensure greater co-operation; the people would know each other much better and the benefits accruing to the farming community would be significant.</P>
    <P>In the past few years I have noticed a growing discontent in the advisory service.  The Minister must have given some thought to this problem.  I think the agricultural industry, as never before, now needs the help, advice <Col N="1848" /> and guidance of a top class advisory service.  From my observations and, perhaps, cursory examination of advisory services in the eight other member states of EEC I am convinced that our own services are ahead of the rest in their organisation and availability to the community. The discontent within the service stems from the fact that there are too few rungs in the service, not sufficient promotional opportunities.  We have only 27 county agricultural officers and 31 or 32 deputy CAO's.  This does not give sufficient promotional opportunities for a service comprising over 600 advisers.  We need some promotional grades, not just to provide promotional outlets, but I think the time has come when, as farmers, we should have the benefit of specialist advisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that under the accelerated programme for the completion of the Government subsidised rural electrification scheme by 1975, applicants for electricity supply in each of the board's 792 rural areas are being given their final opportunity of availing of supply at subsidised rates; residents in approximately half the rural areas have already been given this opportunity.</P>
      <P>In order to get the best value from the capital allocated for the scheme it is essential to adhere strictly to a planned &ldquo;area by area&rdquo; order of development which enables the available resources of materials and of men to be deployed in the most economic way.  If these resources were diverted to supply individual applicants outside the course of the planned programme the operation would prove very expensive and accordingly, the board have no option but to resist the large number of requests it gets for such individual connections.</P>
      <P>If an applicant is not prepared to await the normal development of his area, he voluntarily opts out of the subsidised scheme and the unsubsidised terms for supply may include a substantial capital contribution.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the ESB has demanded a large <Col N="1745" /> sum of money from people, particularly in remote areas, who are seeking electricity; and the plans, if any, he has to eliminate these heavy charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present four year programme aimed at completing rural electrification by 31st March, 1975, will cost £18 million, towards which the Government are contributing £10 million.  This outlay will bring the total cost of rural electrification up to £67 million, including Government subsidy of £27 million.</P>
      <P>Capital contributions are sought by the ESB where the cost of the network extension is excessively high in relation to the revenue expected.  It will be appreciated that some limitation has to be placed on the capital cost of providing a service having regard to the limited resources available to the ESB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that a very high special service charge applies to some consumers of electricity, particularly small farmers in remote rural areas: and the steps he will take to rectify the matter.</P>

      <P>Rural consumers in cases where special service charges apply, are paying fixed charges which are only about a quarter of what they would be if full economic rates were charged.  In the circumstances I have no plans for changing the existing arrangements for determining such charges.</P>
