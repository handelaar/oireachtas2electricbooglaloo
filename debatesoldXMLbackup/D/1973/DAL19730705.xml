      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to enable the Minister for Labour to regulate for a limited period the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment of employees of banks and to provide for matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to ask the Minister to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are so courteous that we anticipated that.  The House will be aware that each of the last two pay settlements in relation to the banks was found by the Labour Court to be at variance with the national pay agreement but that, despite the findings of the Labour Court, the settlements in question were implemented.  These were in breach of the national agreement.</P>
      <P>In view of this background and having regard to the Government's policy endorsed by the people in the general election, to promote economic development, stability and growth in jobs and making possible voluntary agreements between employers and unions, I have deemed it necessary in the national interest to do what I could to prevent a repetition of what happened in the past.  Accordingly, with the approval of the Government, I ask that whatever settlement might emerge from the current negotiations should be referred to the Labour Court for a report on whether it complies with the national agreement and that this be done before balloting takes place.  Up to this time the representatives of the Irish Bank Officials' Association have not found it possible to comply with this request.  In the circumstances, the Government agreed that temporary legislation should be introduced and be brought into operation, if necessary, to ensure that the Labour Court would be in a position to advise whether any proposed settlement breached the national agreement, that national agreement which has been entered into voluntarily by the vast majority of Irish trade unionists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, then, is the background to the introduction of this Bill.  I hope that, in view of the urgency of the situation, it will be possible for the House to deal quickly with the Bill and that all Stages can be taken next week.  In the light of the proposed legislation, I have asked the banks and the Irish Bank Officials' Association to suspend their negotiations.  I emphasised that I have no desire to proceed further with this proposed legislation if there is compliance with the request that the <Col N="297" /> Labour Court be given the opportunity of examining pre-settlement proposals so as to ensure that the national agreement provisions are not breached for a third time.  I need scarcely add that there is no question of preventing bank officials from sharing in the improved pay and conditions which workers in general are obtaining in compliance with the provisions of the national agreement.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say whether the introduction of this Bill heralds the Labour Party's abandonment of the free collective bargaining principle in industrial relations and whether the Minister would relate the purpose of this Bill to the Bill that was introduced and passed in this House in relation to the rather similar situation that existed in the ESB and which was opposed so vehemently by the Labour Party?</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition has said already that he would have sought a statement. It was my intention to make such a statement.  To answer Deputy Lynch simply, I would say that it is merely in token of our desire to uphold the national agreement entered into voluntarily by the vast majority of Irish trade unionists that we are taking this action to ensure that the people involved in this dispute refer the elements involved in it to the Labour <Col N="298" /> Court.  We have no wish to proceed any further if there is any undertaking on their side to the effect that they are willing to utilise the Labour Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasised at the beginning of this debate that the Ministry of Labour, in the circumstances of the new Government, is not neutral in the struggle of Irish working people for better conditions, either living conditions or conditions in their places of work.  All our legislation and activity is designed to ensure an improvement both in working and living conditions.  I made the point that in the past it is possible that less positive features of the Ministry have not been emphasised and that, in so far as it is possible in the future, I propose to take up new areas of activity on behalf of the working people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point last week that periods of unemployment have hitherto been periods of frustration for unemployed persons.  I hope that when periods of unemployment occur in the future they will be put to productive and profitable use for the benefit of the individuals concerned. I made the point that the training authority under my Department, AnCO, will this summer commence industrial induction courses on an experimental basis at about 50 technical schools and colleges throughout the country and 100 teachers will be involved.  We are involved at present in selecting those unemployed people who would best profit from such courses.  The idea in general is to give Irish citizens who, through no fault of their own, have been out of work, extra training so that they may re-enter the work force as quickly as possible.  It is hoped that between 500 and 1,000 people will attend these courses.  Experience in both Sweden and the USA has shown that it is possible to equip those most affected by seasonal and unemployment phases during the year, with additional skills, <Col N="300" /> thus freeing them from the tyranny of sole dependance on seasonal industry.</P>
    <P>We have at present 1,400 training places which, on the present range of courses, allow a through-put of 2,800 trainees a year.  I propose as a next step to open new centres in Sligo and Limerick and by 1978 we hope to have a total of 2,850 training places with a through-put of over 10,000 trainees a year.  We have made application to the European Social Fund for a loan from the World Bank.  I am not, however, satisfied that we have made sufficient progress in this area.  If we compare our position with that of Northern Ireland we have less than half the number of training places that they have in Northern Ireland.  While we may not be in a position to reach the high level of attainment in training that the Swedish economy has reached in a short period I think we should aim for a similar proportion of our workforce to undergo training as in the case of the Swedish economy.  People have noted that it is no accident that you have such a high concentration on training in the fully developed economies.  It is a pre-condition of economic success that you have a high concentration of training open to the employees in any State which would aspire to having a fully developed economy.</P>
    <P>To help in that we are improving the allowances payable to people undergoing training.  The old rates for people undergoing training meant that there was only a small differential over the unemployment benefit rate so that in strict monetary terms there was little inducement to the unemployed person to undergo training.  The old rate for an unmarried adult was £7.50 a week and for a married man without children £12.50 a week.  The new rate for adults without dependants will be £15 at 21 and £17 at a later age and supplements will be paid for each adult dependant and in respect of children. These inducements are necessary to ensure that quite apart from the advantage to the individual there is also a financial inducement to the individual to undergo this training.  The whole <Col N="301" /> area of training is very important and these are some of the steps we are taking to ensure that more citizens will participate.</P>
    <P>Another point is the area of crossBorder co-operation.  Under our training system we operate at least three training centres which are adjacent to the Border.  We operate training centres in Dundalk, Sligo and Gweedore.  The Dundalk and Sligo centres are new ventures and we are only now commencing operations in a large way. Since we are planning major extensions of training facilities in the country it would make a lot of sense if we and the Northern authorities could get together and discuss expansion plans on a joint basis to ensure that training facilities could be provided on a cooperative basis, particularly for people living in Border areas.  This would help to avoid duplication and overlapping of facilities.  Granted it is difficult to see these plans acquire a formal basis in the present politically unsettled conditions in Northern Ireland but I would hope, in the near future, at any rate, to get the process under way by which we could lay long-term plans for co-operation.  This would seem an ideal area of advance for the proposed Council of Ireland. It would appear to be of mutual benefit to people on both sides of the Border; it would be for the economic advantage of both regions, would avoid duplication of facilities and would ensure a cash saving on either side if there could be co-operation in courses provided in centres adjacent to the Border.  I hope that very shortly we can have discussions to advance this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was always there but not availed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. Many things were there but not availed of, but the Deputy will agree that where we are planning an expansion, where we are looking for funds from the European Social Fund, where people on both sides of the Border have a need for this kind of training, it would be a waste, in the literal sense of that word, to pursue separate courses on either side of the Border, to plan and to expand without regard to what is happening a few miles away on the other side of this political border.  I hope very shortly that in discussions we can advance the idea further with the Northern authorities and that when the Council of Ireland is set up we will already have been engaged in preparatory work which will be of value to the Council.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that we should give greater assistance to the trade unions in their educational programme. We have a Bill relating to trade union amalgamation.  The material included in this Bill was agreed on after a great deal of discussion with the trade unions and we have sought permission to introduce it in the House.  The main features of the Bill were drawn up under the aegis of my predecessor, Deputy Brennan, during his period of office.  I have thought it desirable to add to this Bill a provision for funds for the trade unions to help their educational programme on the general principle that such help was in their interest, and in the general interest of equity.  We give a great deal of assistance at present to the Irish Management Institute for management education.  In the current financial year, for example, it is proposed to pay a non-capital grant of £300,000 and a capital grant of £150,000 to the Irish Management Institute. On the other hand, we offer to the educational and advisory services of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a grant of £45,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that under the technical assistance of AnCO there is a certain amount of cash available to AnCO which can be utilised by trade unions. In broad outline the position at present <Col N="303" /> is that the amount of investment by the State towards management education is in excess of that given for the similar purpose to trade unions.  I am satisfied that there is an urgent need to increase the amount of trade union education currently being provided in view of the proposed development in the field of worker participation both at national level and through the various schemes being drawn up by the Employer-Labour Conference at the level of industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Employer-Labour Conference at present has a sub-committee working on the whole idea of worker participation. We are committed to introducing a similar principle into the State industry.  Nobody would suggest that we can jump from the situation at present where workers have little say in the direction of their firms in consultative procedures to one of fullyfledged worker participation in decision making without a great increase in the availability of trade union education. This is why I have come to the conclusion that it would be desirable in any proposed Trade Union Amalgamation Bill that there should be a section to permit greater funds to be made available to trade unions to advance trade union education.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to discuss with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions the allocation of additional funds for the training of women trade union officials so that they will be able to play a more active part in their organisation, and in industry generally. The Equal Pay Bill legislation will be of no great practical import unless there can be an equalisation of opportunity which will allow women in industry, industrial life, and women in our community, to take their rightful place.  The number of women trade union officials is too small at present.  I would welcome a greater number of female trade union officials to ensure that equal pay provisions are followed up throughout the trade union movement.  For this purpose I think it desirable that we should consider favourably grants for the education and training of women trade union officials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> One of the bulwarks of a mature democracy is that there should be a strong trade union movement.  For that purpose the trade union movement should have an independent educational programme.  We seek no control of any sort over the educational programme of the unions; we simply wish it to expand and to be of a sufficiently high standard.</P>
    <P>On the question of rights commissioners I should like to state that this has been a successful service.  It was inaugurated in 1970.  Mr. Con Murphy is now the sole inheriter of the service and he has been extremely successful.  We must reconsider the role of the service.  At present it investigates individual disputes unconnected with pay or hours of work. Many disputes commence, not because of any major matter, but with some individual grievance.  The rights commissioner service was designed to meet this aspect of industrial relations. It is one that concerns the individual who feels that an injustice has been committed.</P>
    <P>Consideration must now be given to perhaps a regional organisation of rights commissioners.  It may be considered desirable that particular regions of the country should have a rights commissioner residing in such an area.  Very shortly I am having a full discussion on this matter with Mr. Murphy.  I believe we can come to certain conclusions about the service which will see us move forward to be of further use to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court&mdash;an independent body, governed under the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;I propose to meet shortly to see how the service of the court can be expanded and made more beneficial for Irish industry.  It might be considered that the conciliation service attached to the court should now have a number of people proficient in productivity agreements attached to it.  It may be considered also that a more active role should be designed for the conciliation service.  Under present legislation they have the power, as I read it, to intervene in disputes; but I would hope that they would be given a more active role to permit them to move in ahead of an industrial dispute <Col N="305" /> breaking out.  I would hope that the court would be given a more active role which would ensure that grievance procedure is installed in every firm in the country, to ensure that joint consultation arrangements are available throughout Irish industry.  We must review the position of the conciliation service of the court and all services in industrial relations against the background of the development of consultation in industry as a whole and the development of worker participation.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with training matters, and with some aspects of industrial relations, trade union education, proposed legislation, and social policy of the EEC.  I have already made the point, when dealing with the social policy of the EEC, that we are anxious to see that the social policy should be the dominant policy, the policy which shapes other policy, the pace setter.  I take literally what the heads of state said last October about the future of the Community, that it should have a human face.  We must take it from that source to be an important pronouncement on the future development of the Community.</P>
    <P>The resources of the Social Fund, on which that social policy depends for financing, must be adequate to make a real contribution to the rapid development of training, retraining and resettlement programmes in the less-developed regions of the Community. That fund must be substantially increased. I see in this morning's papers that the commissioner is seeking an increase in the funds at his disposal. Even with the increase in funds it is difficult to see how all the commitments on that fund can be made from the existing budget allocation.</P>
    <P>I believe that serious consideration should be given to the introduction of differential rates of Social Fund assistance related to the relative needs, and resources, of the different regions.  The idea is&mdash;and I made this point at a recent meeting of the Council of Ministers&mdash;that the major purpose of the Social Fund should be to equalise the opportunities for employment between the different countries of the Community. <Col N="306" /> If the Social Fund is raided by the larger countries of the Community to settle the internal problems of these countries&mdash;problems such as migrant workers in Germany and France&mdash;if the funds at the disposal of the Community are raided to settle these problems for the benefit of the major economies, nothing will be left to deal with the problems of small countries such as Ireland, our need for more job opportunities and for expansion in the training facilities available to our work force&mdash;a use we have sought from the fund, the main thrust of the Irish application being designed to obtain more money for training of our work force.  But if there is no money to meet our request, if the money has been exhausted due to the demands of Germany and others to settle the vexed question of migrant workers then, obviously, the social policy of the Community will be a mockery.  That is why it is important that there should be a clear statement of principle in any social document adopted at Community level that it is to be a Community social policy and, if that is so, its first objective must be to make employment opportunities equal between the regions.  Therefore, I believe that there should be a limit on the amount of cash that could be sought by the larger countries, that there should be a clear statement of principle ensuring that smaller countries' problems would have first priority and first call on available funds.  In the absence of such a statement of intent in relation to the Community Social Fund the problems which Irish entry into EEC was expected to solve will remain unsolved and the lack of employment opportunites over our whole economy will continue in intensified form.</P>
    <P>That is why our delegation at Council of Ministers' meetings has been insistent that there should be this clear commitment to a Community social policy and not to one which the larger powers may use to settle the after-dinner growth pains of their own economies.  The position we have adopted is in true accord with the national interest.  Deputies of all parties will agree that this is not political <Col N="307" /> pique on our part in regard to the commissioner himself&mdash;the newspapers attempted to cast that aspertion on points made by the Irish delegation at the last Council of Ministers' meeting. It was solely to ensure what we conceived to be and what Deputies of all parties will agree is in the national interest that the social policy of the Community must serve the interests of smaller countries.</P>
    <P>There is one point I want to make regarding the safety aspects of factory legislation.  I have appointed a medical consultant to the staff to make a report.  The whole area of factory legislation is in need of revision and, obviously, worker-safety legislation requires a new dimension which would answer certain changed conditions. Legislation in other EEC countries has taken account of the need for expert medical advice to ensure that hazards to health unforeseen by earlier legislation should now be catered for.  We hope to have additional recruits with a medical background to the factory inspectorate. That is important in view of the new requirements.  The survey by the medical consultant will begin within the next month and I hope his report will be with us shortly so that we may incorporate his recommendations in any legislation that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Department will so far as possible see that training facilities are expanded throughout the country more rapidly and we shall speed up and tackle at as formal a level as political conditions permit co-operation across the Border with the Northern training authority for the greater benefit of people on either side of the Border to avoid overlapping in courses and so on; also to ensure that we do not go separate ways in our requirements regarding the European social funds.  The placement service for getting people jobs has been expanded at a very high rate in the past few months.  I am still not happy that there is the same quality of service available throughout the country.  I do not want a situation where it could be said that the service <Col N="308" /> and the attention of the Department is focussed on any one part of the country because any citizen in any part of the country is entitled to the best service available.  This will mean constant expansion; more offices must be opened and staffed by the right people.</P>
    <P>I am giving close attention to the matter of an increase in the resettlement allowance which permits a worker to change his place of work, to move house and family and so ensure greater labour mobility.  I am actively considering increasing the allowance for resettlement.  This is very important for less developed regions where very often an industrial development can be held up through lack of housing or lack of key workers.  It may be necessary in the interests of starting an industry that difficulties regarding house-buying and resettlement of key workers should be eased as much as possible by the State.  Otherwise, an industrial development in an area crying out for new jobs might be held up.  I hope to make a decision about an increase in that area very soon.</P>
    <P>Generally, we are seeking to update all legislation governing conditions at work because in many cases the provisions are out of date going back as far as 1936 and need review.</P>
    <P>In industrial relations in general I hope to expand on the foundation of the service available at Labour Court level.  I have in mind especially the extension, perhaps on a regional basis, of the rights commissioner, and the possibility that the conciliation service of the court might be given a greater area of initiative to ensure that a conciliation officer could be available before the actual dispute had reached crisis or breakdown proportions the possibility that the conciliation service could come in at a very early stage in disputes and in the light of this more positive role, take on such tasks as ensuring that grievance procedure is installed in firms.  Since it is part of their work to ensure that disputes can be settled quickly, it might be considered helpful to ensure that part of their task would be to see that certain steps were taken by firms that would be in that general direction.  It <Col N="309" /> might also be necessary to ensure that officers in that section would have special training in reading productivity agreements, because more and more in Irish industry we see evidence of these agreements coming into being.</P>
    <P>That is the picture as it faces us at this time: legislation in the areas where we can legislate; in general, the economic centre of the ministry to be expanded, to be improved; abroad, in our contact with the Community, at the Council of Ministers' level, a determined pursuit of the idea that the social policy of the Community should dominate all other policies of the Community.  There is a tendency in Community decision, as Deputies will have noticed, to see economic decisions to be totally separate from social policy.  I would hope, to the limit that it is in my power at the council meetings, to ensure that this would be corrected, to help the commissioner to ensure that social policy is the dominant policy, so that the eventual social policy to be adopted later this year will be a Community policy in the true sense, not a social policy simply at the beck and call of the great powers of the EEC but a genuine Community policy aimed at securing Community cohesion.  I do not think we can have cohesion in the EEC if one region has less opportunities than another.  If our future in the Community is simply to be a supplier of cheap labour, then the hopes that many people rested on entry to the EEC will be set at naught.</P>
    <P>It so happens that the national interest of this country and our economic predicament coincides with the necessity for the Community to adopt a true social policy.  Certainly this Community will not develop into the political entity that some of its founders wished for it in the aftermath of the economic and monetary union, in fact, such a step would be unthinkable, in the absence of the espousal of a correct social policy.  That is why we should continue to press for the adoption of such a policy.</P>
    <P>The note I have attempted to sound in regard to all the activities <Col N="310" /> of the ministry is that we are not neutral; we are solidly on the side of the people who work for a living in Ireland, in order to ensure that they enjoy better conditions in their place of work, have greater economic possibilities open to them, and training possibilities which will increase their bargaining power for better wages and a better standard of living.  My Department will do all in its power to improve their chances in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last night I had covered the whole question of conservation and expressed the view that the Department of Lands was the ideal co-ordinating Department in relation to conservation.  I also mentioned that I thought we were not doing enough towards the establishment of national parks and suggested Glengariff as being the ideal location at which to start this policy.  As the House knows, the importance of conservation was realised a long time ago, and I do not think any country can rival America for the national parks programme upon which they embarked so long ago.  It can be said as well that in that country technical and industrial civilisation has reached a higher peak than in any other country in the world. Therefore, the pressure on them to conserve their wildlife and their natural habitat was extremely high.  Again, it can be said of America that it is civilisation of waste.  Where you have technical and industrial development of that magnitude you do have this waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Kennedy, in his term of office, saw the importance of adopting <Col N="312" /> a series of measures in relation to conservation and the maintenance of a proper natural balance and providing proper legislation to ensure victory in the battle against many forms of pollution. One of those Acts, the Wilderness Act, indicates that the American nation wishes to reconcile material progress with conservation of natural resources.  The time has arrived in this country when we are showing the maturity as a nation to have beauty and the preservation of beauty as part of our national purpose.  I realise very well that the Minister, in the administration of this branch of his Department, has a most difficult task in that he has so many authorities to deal with&mdash;all the local authorities and a great many public authorities, such as the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Foras Forbartha, the Department of Education and the planning section of the Department of Local Government, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, the time is now ripe for the Government to take a decision to place the entire responsibility for conservation and the preservation of our natural habitat in the hands of one Minister.  The present multiplicity of authority means duplication of effort, inefficiency, lack of co-ordination and, in the event of anything going wrong, an unwillingness on the part of the various authorities involved to accept responsibility. Strictly speaking, none of these authorities deals with nature conservation as such and many of them have duties and responsibilities which conflict with conservation.  That is why I say I think the time is now ripe for us to adopt a comprehensive policy on conservation. The problems of conservation must in a general sense be linked with man's survival.  It is no function of ours to take the part of the philosopher; man has made serious mistakes in regard to his environment. It is time we signed a new pact with nature to ensure that we, our children and our children's children survive in harmony with nature.  If we do that we will ensure the survival not alone of nature but of man as well.  We have no right to go on attacking nature as we have been doing.  The most charitable <Col N="313" /> thing that can be said about these attacks is that we operated in the main through ignorance but ignorance can no longer be claimed as a legitimate excuse for our acts because everybody who reads, who listens or who watches must now be aware of the dangers that face us unless positive action is taken.</P>
    <P>A national policy of conservation will not be easily attained.  There will necessarily be involved the reconciliation of conflicting interests.  On the one side there will be the industrialists and the question of bringing employment into an area and, on the other side, there will be those anxious to respect and preserve our national character, our traditions and our historical heritage in every area.  I do not believe we need to destroy one in order to create the other.  I believe a fine balance can be attained.  This all goes back again to the definition of a national policy.  If we formulate such a policy we will not then be faced with the danger of vast industrial development and the destruction of nature because the two, under a properly designed policy, can go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>Industrialisation should always be as far as possible complementary to the area into which it goes.  Because of our history we have had to devote a tremendous amount of our thoughts and energies to material things, to a materialistic society, to economic development. We were a poor country and we needed to do a great deal very quickly.  While we may not as yet be classified as a developed country we are certainly a fast developing country and more of us now must take a responsible attitude towards conservation. The Minister's Department and the Forestry Branch must make up for the lost years, endeavour to have more afforestation and lay out as many nature trails as possible together with visual displays of nature.</P>
    <P>It can be fairly said that the Department of Lands is doing a reasonable job.  There are very dedicated and efficient staffs working in the Department.  While we may criticise them at times, and criticise especially their inaction in certain respects, we <Col N="314" /> should remember that a great deal of that inaction has been due to a lack of financial commitment on the part of the central authority to the Department. There is no problem that cannot be solved if there is sufficient money provided to solve it.  If we want to control our environment and control pollution we must remember that the obstacles to such control are, in the main, economic; they are not technical.  As I said, pollution is a by-product of industry and, if we have the money to spend, there are technologists available who can, who will and who must control pollution.</P>
    <P>I would press on the Minister the urgency of his immediately implementing more effective laws to prevent pollution by laying down the strictest possible standards, especially standards in regard to what may be discharged or may not be discharged into the air, the sea, the rivers and the lakes. Everybody should know that it is illegal to pollute significantly.</P>
    <P>Of course, as in all cases prevention is much better than cure.  Factories should be required to use smokeless fuel and to instal equipment to purify fumes or effluent and to take effective and specific measures to prevent spills.  Are there enough scientists and qualified technical men in the Department to advise the Minister on what are the standards and permissible levels which should be enforced? On the political front we have shown a certain inertia about this problem.  From now on none of us should be complacent about the tremendous countryside we have inherited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Lands will assume a more important role in the years ahead.  I should like to convey my compliments to the Minister on his appointment to that office.  We have confidence that in the years ahead he will bring the mature and well balanced consideration to the Department necessary to arrive at mature decisions.  Never before have we been presented with more favourable opportunities to external markets for our agricultural produce.  The Department of Lands <Col N="315" /> have played and will play in the years ahead a vital role in bringing about a more economic and successful well contented rural community.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor was a very courteous and approachable Minister.  The officials at Merrion Street and in the County of Clare have been very helpful to me and to my constituents.  They could not have shown more consideration in dealing with the day-to-day problems of their Department.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are to invest more money in the acquisition of land in the years ahead gives some indication of the Government's policy on the importance of creating viable units in congested areas.  It is one of my regrets that over the years when land was relatively cheap the Land Commission were not given adequate funds to purchase land in areas where people were disposed to sell their land.  There should have been more foresight.</P>
      <P>Because of our impending entry to the European Economic Community and knowing that the prices and high values placed on lands on the Continent, it was easy to see that on our coming into the Community values of our property would go very high.  Had there been more foresight at the right time we would have acquired a pool of land, particularly in the congested areas, which would have been much more economic to the State.  We would have conserved our resources by buying at the right time and at the right price, rather than now in a highly competitive market when we are competing with people from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, we do not seem to be in a position to restrict speculators. When I say &ldquo;speculators&rdquo; I do not refer to our Irish people engaged in farming, big or small, or people associated with giving a service to farmers: in an open market they are entitled to the full exercise of their rights to have freedom to buy land. Nevertheless, one must be influenced by conditions in one's own area when dealing with the Department of Lands. One must be influenced by conditions as seen in the area in which one lives. Broadly speaking, people residing in <Col N="316" /> areas where the quality and potential of the land is not good, express a real desire to continue to live where their forefathers strove to retain their small holdings.  My opinion is reinforced by the complete failure of the retirement policy which the Department of Lands attempted to introduce some years ago. The fact that so few people in their old age were inclined to give up their holdings for acquisition meant that the scheme had to be abandoned.  That is a clear indication of the real love of our people to cling firmly to their small holdings.</P>
    <P>We have a problem of an inadequate pool of land in congested areas.  We have more applicants for that pool than we have land to give.  What can we do in order to satisfy people who wish to live in their own areas?  It is obvious that the Land Commission must have a tie-in with the other Departments of State, particularly the agencies promoting employment, such as the Industrial Development Authority and, in my region, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company. Because of inadequate sources of livelihood in the congested areas, an attempt must be made quickly to tie up industrialisation. Otherwise, it would seem that we are happy and contented to allow a situation of depopulation, which has been painfully obvious, to continue.  The policies which have been implemented were not successful in combating this continuing trend.</P>
    <P>Let us bear in mind in particular the many thousands of people in the congested areas of the extreme West who find it necessary to emigrate.  Despite the national policy to stop the flow of emigration it is obvious that the powers that be allowed this flow to continue without taking much notice of it.  Land alone will not solve the problem of the congest.  Of course, a congest living in an area where vast estates could be acquired would be luckier than others, but we must deal with the situation as we find it in any area.  Strangely enough, statistics show that the highest rate of production in this country is in areas where there is a great problem of congestion.  I refer in particular to high milk production in areas such as West Clare, where pilot areas have been established, where we have <Col N="317" /> pioneered our way into the future and can show others what it is possible to achieve by the adoption of a proper farm policy, even on holdings which were not considered to be viable.</P>
    <P>In the context of our future expansion within the EEC it is important that we make the best use of the funds that will be made available to us and that a proper farm policy be adopted. The expansion of that programme should be undertaken now, all the various services should be co-ordinated and we should concentrate on certain regions.  I refer in particular to areas of high congestion.  It was not for fun that, some months ago, representatives from the West of Ireland gathered in Galway to discuss certain matters. They came together because of the serious discontent which had been brewing for many years and which was then reaching a climax.  This discontent resulted from the failure of existing policies to bring about the necessary changes and to create the same opportunities for the people in the West as those enjoyed by people in other parts of the country.  Is it not strange that it should have been left to public representatives, both of the Oireachtas and of local authorities, as well as to members of chambers of commerce and others to bring to the notice of the authorities the urgency of doing something practical to correct the trend which has been accepted up to now.  The gravity of the situation is no less today than it was when that meeting took place in Galway.</P>
    <P>The Government should now put forward a policy in which the Department of Lands could play a vital role, a policy that would undo the harm that has been caused down through the years by the very obvious neglect of the West.  From the 1st October next the special system of aids within the EEC will be channelled to the poorer and more congested areas.  It is vital, therefore, that we should have a regional policy so that we might redress the ills of the past.  We should have had such a policy long ago.</P>
    <P>From time to time the Land Commission are subjected to much criticism because of a slowness in resettling people in congested areas.  However, <Col N="318" /> those people who criticise most are often unaware of the procedures that must be adopted in regard to the relief of congestion.  Such people very often ignore the fact that a man has the right to retain his holding and that every opportunity will be given to him to do so if he considers himself fit to continue working his farm.  Such factors are taken into consideration before there is any question of acquisition, and inspection is considered also in some cases.  Critics of the Land Commission ignore the fact that a man has a right of appeal to the Land Commission courts in his efforts to retain his holding.  Questions of title arise also and there can be long delays in this regard.</P>
    <P>The determining of an applicant's suitability for land is always a problem for officials of the Department but I have never yet known them to make a bad judgment in this regard.  Neither have I ever seen political influence manifesting itself in any case.  I have absolute confidence in the Department of Lands and in the impartiality of the manner in which the officials carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Forestry Division it is clear that some counties have fared very well but it is painfully clear that other counties have not got a fair share of the moneys that are allocated for afforestation.  In my own county it is only comparatively recently that areas have been planted which should have been planted long ago because of their great potential for the growth of native timber.  I do not know why that potential was ignored but because of that failure, in an area where we are fortunate enough to have a timber products factory of worldwide fame, I can see a difficulty in the years ahead in securing the necessary supply of timber to continue in production and to give the employment which is at present enjoyed by the people of that area.  It is no great comfort to say that a proper survey was not made of available land which could have been planted over the past 25 or 30 years.  However, perhaps it is better late than never.  I would ask that every available acre be surveyed, bearing in mind the necessity <Col N="319" /> to keep people employed in our timber industry in Clare.</P>
    <P>Forest fires are caused by obvious carelessness and neglect and not always by people on holiday.  Huge sums of money have been spent on alerting people about the necessity for protecting our forests but people who do not think still continue to do untold harm.  In the months of March and April tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage has been done to our State forests.  When will we cultivate a civic spirit and when will our young people, and perhaps our old people, realise the seriousness of having State forests ravaged by fire?  There is nothing worse to look at than a blackened mass of grass and young trees marring the rural scene.  It is a blemish on us as a people that this continues from year to year unabated. One wonders what approach should be taken by the Department, whether it should be done through the schools, the Press, radio or television.  I think it must be done on a local basis in order that one gets the impact in one's own area.  Notices have been displayed, notices have been ignored.  If we could cut out this national damage we would certainly enhance our prospects and we would increase our acreage of native timber in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley dealt very adequately with wild life conservation.  I was very interested in what he had to say.  His remarks would apply to the whole country.  We have a conservation policy and we should maintain its impetus in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>From time to time would-be planners seem to think that the scrapping of the Department of Lands and the Land Commission would bring about a rapid improvement in the relief of congestion.  I could never subscribe to that view.  Any delays which have occurred in the past were due to the inadequate number of staff available and to the fact that the Department did not have the money to purchase an adequate pool of land.  I look forward to the role of the Department of Lands being an influential one in the creation of an improved economic existence for the people in the congested <Col N="320" /> areas.  The Ministry is a very important one and I would urge on the Government to see that every available pound is channelled into that Department so that they will have what they need to do a job they have done well over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in complimenting the Minister and his staff on the detailed manner in which this Estimate was introduced and on the way the work of this Department is carried out.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him every success.</P>
      <P>Coming from a constituency where good land is at a premium the question of land and the division of land probably take up about half of our time as public representatives.  Land is of vital importance in my constituency and, indeed, in the country as a whole.  I am glad to see that the Minister is continuing the policy which has been in operation with regard to the congested areas.  I am glad that the Minister is providing extra money to help people acquire more land in these areas.</P>
      <P>I believe that the scheme for the distribution of land should be broadened somewhat.  At present a farmer who wants to acquire land from the Land Commission must be a tenant, or have land in his own area or own land before he qualifies.  It is a shame that over the years farmers' sons and people engaged on the land did not have an opportunity of getting land when estates were being divided in other parts of the country.  The Minister should consider this question of trying to provide land for people who are genuinely interested in making a career of farming.  I am referring to people who do not own land already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of speculators is a big problem.  These speculators try to grab everything that is going.  If there is a farm for sale in the vicinity of a town we find that the keen businessman who has the ready cash endeavours to grab it.  This means that there is less land available for the farmer, or his son.  Quite recently the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="321" /> introduced a scheme restricting salmon licences to those who were genuine fishermen.  The Department of Lands should operate on the same basis.  They should make it part of their policy that only farmers or those genuinely interested in farming should be permitted to purchase land.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the activities of the speculators make land scarce they also put the price of land beyond the reach of farmers.  If, through the actions of the Land Commission, land does fall eventually to a farmer it means that he has to buy it at a price which is far in excess of its agricultural value.  The Minister should investigate this matter and ensure that, as far as possible, farmers are given first choice.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is causing concern in my county is the delay in the allocation of land.  Lands are left idle by the Land Commission for many years after they have been acquired.  It is hard to explain to the farming community why this should happen.  In Mayo during the past few years I noticed that many holdings were left idle and Land Commission houses, which could be used by young married couples, were allowed to fall into disrepair.  This should not be allowed to happen.  There is a loss in rates to the county council.  The use of Land Commission houses by people in need of housing would also ease the burden on the local authority. In Mayo the question of these houses lying idle while so many people in the county are in need of housing has been raised many times. The Land Commission may be understaffed but I believe this should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>From the Minister's statement I notice that a good deal of land has been allocated.  This gives the lie to what I have already stated but the fact is that the general public are not aware of the problems involved in allocating land, especially the legal problems.  The Minister should use his good offices to try to get the Department of Justice to move quicker when dealing with the legal aspects of the allocation of land.</P>
    <P>At present in my county there is a big drive to improve land and increase <Col N="322" /> the acreage of land which is productive.  Under the small farms scheme there are 3,570 applicants who are trying to increase their stocks, and make their land more productive.  Because of the value of stock, and because markets are now available more people are taking a genuine interest in the land.  I believe that the rate of emigration in the West has been slowed down because people now see the real value of land and the benefits that are to be gained from making their land more productive.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware there are huge tracts of bog in County Mayo. Bord na Móna are working some areas but there are still vast areas which they are not likely to use.  They have reported that there is not sufficient depth of bog available and it would not be economic for them to extend their operations in the county. The Minister has a choice of purchasing that land from the local farmers, or tenants for forestry but if he examines the position in Glenamoy and the grassmeal station at Geesala he will find that cuts of silage are being taken which would compare with anything being done in the country.  It is quite obvious to everybody that this bog can be made productive and going on the information and knowledge gained from the work at Glenamoy and at the grassmeal plant in Geesala the Minister should try to have this land put to use for congests who could use it for grazing and to extend their present holdings.</P>
    <P>In many areas of Erris private individuals have also reclaimed bogs and, taking the example at Geesala and at Glenamoy, they are making bogs productive.  As Deputy Enright said last night, next to our people the land is the greatest wealth we have and it is important that every possible means be used to make the land productive.  If we take forestry as against the argument I have made, I find at present in our part of the country there are people who have sold land to the Forestry Division who would be glad to have it for grazing.  Because of sheep and lamb subsidies they find that land for <Col N="323" /> grazing sheep and cattle would be of more benefit than having it used for afforestation.  I am sure the Minister will have representations from those who have sold land for afforestation asking him to leave them the land. If a number of tenants who sold land for this purpose had a choice I am sure they would re-purchase it for grazing.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the amount of employment given locally when an afforestation scheme is in progress. Generally very little local employment is given and from that point of view afforestation does not seem to have the desired effect.  I wonder if the afforestation programme undertaken by the Department of Lands is having the desired effect and bringing the results expected.  I am in no position to judge but perhaps the Minister would examine the situation. I think the methods we use in planting might also be examined.  I understand that on the Continent, instead of doing a blanket job as we do whereby a whole area is planted, they plant trees in belts.  This is probably more costly in that it increases fencing costs and so on, but there are compensations because space is left for grazing, the falling leaves help to fertilise the land and shelter is provided for animals.  If this is feasible here it might help to satisfy those who are not satisfied at present because large areas are taken over in blanket developments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton mentioned commonage and its development.  A few weeks ago I had a very detailed reply to a Dáil Question regarding the division of commonage.  Because every inch of land in the west is so valuable we have a situation where one or two tenants, because of their location, always have the benefit of the commonage whereas people living a distance away are not so well served.  I am sure there is no need for me to mention this; Land Commission officials are probably more aware of it than I am; the one or two people who are doing very well will always try to hold up any division of the commonage. This means that there is a long-drawnout process and it becomes next to impossible <Col N="324" /> for the Land Commission to make any progress in this type of development.  The Minister should make the fullest use of any powers he has to ensure that commonage is divided especially where it can be proved that this would create greater benefit for the people of the area.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has set down in such detail the EEC regulations but I hope we shall not take all of them too literally.  If we were to accept all this jargon about what is a viable farm it would be a shame if we were to denude our countryside of its people and destroy our whole rural set up by having farms brought up to a standard which could be regarded as viable and which would, in fact, leave our countryside bare of people.  This can be seen working already in parts of the West, and the previous Minister, Deputy Flanagan, a few years ago made reference to this question.  Take, for instance, the town of Westport.  Westport has a record for industry inasmuch as people of that area, long before there were State grants or before the IDA, got together and pooled their finances in order to bring industry to the town.  If you look at the parishes immediately in the vicinity of Westport town you will find that there are small land holders, with 20-25 acres, sometimes less, whose families are coming into Westport to work in the factories.  The farmer himself very often has a job in town and between the little holding and the job he has in town they are living quite comfortably. People who are engaged as agricultural instructors and so on will tell you that the man who has a job in town and who is farming, generally speaking, is doing quite well. Therefore, the answer would be to provide industries close to the holdings and have the farmers coming into work rather than depopulate the whole countryside by providing what we call viable holdings.</P>
    <P>One of the things that causes a great deal of concern&mdash;and again this does not come within the Minister's territory but if I might, with your permission, refer to it briefly&mdash;is the question of land registration or the <Col N="325" /> transfer of land.  It seems rather strange to me that the Minister for Lands should not have control of this aspect of things.</P>

If you are changing your car you just go into the local tax office, have a stamp put on it and that is it.

      <P>Another matter to which the Minister did not refer in his speech, as far as I am aware, is the question of lakes and rivers. There are a number of lakes and rivers which are, I understand, under the control of the Department of Lands.  They are a tremendous tourist asset and here there should be more <Col N="326" /> liaison with Bord Fáilte and, possibly, in certain areas, with Roinn na Gaeltachta and the local authority to see that these rivers and lakes are utilised to the full.  Very often they can be quite good for trout fishing.  I understand Bord Fáilte have a programme for restocking these lakes.  I know that in certain areas there are complications about ownership.  Some of the old landlords selling their property to the Land Commission hold on to the gaming rights and very often perhaps some local people such as hoteliers or groups who are interested in having the lake developed for the sake of tourism find themselves in an impossible position when it comes to tracing title.  The Minister should, if it is not within his power already, introduce legislation providing that where lakes and streams of this kind are not being fully utilised they should be handed over to local development associations, angling clubs, or people of that kind who would be anxious to develop them for their own pleasure and also in the tourist interest.  In this respect I am sure he would have the full co-operation of the Inlands Fishery Trust and other groups.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crowley referred to conservation. He made a very good case for conservation and I thoroughly agree with everything he said.  We should all be interested in conservation and it is a shame that we have not been more active in this field.  Perhaps the new curriculum in the schools will help to give the youth a greater appreciation of the value of wildlife and its preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to forest fires, it is a sad reflection on us that it costs in excess of £300,000 annually to safeguard plantations.  How is it our people are so careless?  How is it they have so little respect for beauty that they will throw away cigarette ends and cause so much damage to their own property? Perhaps, as I say, the new curriculum may help to educate the childern into a greater appreciation of these amenities and give them a greater respect for property and for wild life.  There are a great many ways in which that £300,000 could be spent.  I can think of <Col N="327" /> hundreds of areas in which this money is badly needed.  I really was appalled at the figure of £300,000 having to be spent on safeguarding our plantations.</P>
    <P>In order to get the greatest benefit from the EEC in the development of our land it is important that all the essential programmes should be fully prepared.  For the life of me, I cannot see how with the present set-up, the Land Commission could hope to do the necessary work in preparing all the essential plans.  I hope the Minister will employ all the extra staff necessary to ensure we do not neglect in the slightest degree the possibility of obtaining the maximum grants for development.  The Minister referred to mountain areas and to the possibility of having money made available to improve land in such areas.  He will have the full co-operation of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and I hope he will get down to work immediately so that we will not be coming back here later making excuses because we have not availed to the full of EEC funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the full support of everyone in this House in ensuring that our land is fully utilised for the benefit of the community.  I wish the Minister well in his work and I compliment his staff.  The Land Commission staff are very often the subject of bitter criticism.  Some of us in public life have been fairly critical of their work from time to time but when we meet the officials and have closer contact with them, we discover the problems they have to face and we realise what a tough job they have to do.  They have my sympathy.  It is impossible to please everybody.  I certainly would not like to be in their shoes.  Re-arrangement is going on at the moment near my own village and I doubt if the Lord Himself could satisfy everybody. It is just impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the introduction of the Estimate for the Department of Lands the Minister's predecessor described himself on two occasions as being redundant.  I do not think anybody here would wish <Col N="328" /> that the new Minister would be declared redundant because, after agriculture, his is probably one of the most important Ministries in the Government.  It is a Ministry which is not always seen in its best light.  I hope when the Minister finds his feet he will be able to make a great many changes in his Department and I should like now to take this opportunity of pointing out where those changes should be made.</P>
      <P>It was natural to expect that this year the EEC would feature prominently in this debate, but I think somebody should take a message across to Merrion Street to let the Land Commission know we are in the EEC.  If we are to be able to avail of the opportunities membership of the EEC should bring to us, the amount of land which the Land Commission hold should be allocated immediately. If the Land Commission continue at the speed at which they now allocate land, all our opportunities in the EEC will have passed before the land is allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased to note that the Minister intends to recruit more inspectors with a view to speeding up land division.  It is beyond my understanding why it takes so long from the time of acquisition to allocate a holding.  It may be useless making comparisons, but if one takes the matter of subdivision one finds the process getting through quite quickly. In the matter of division, however, inspectors go out to farms year after year and the people in the vicinity say when they see them coming: &ldquo;The farm will be divided this year&rdquo;.  Of course the inspector is only going to the local auctioneer to ask him to let the holding for another year.  This causes so much frustration among smallholders that they are inclined to give up the ghost, to give their small holdings to auctioneers to sell and to take jobs in factories, and if they cannot get them, to take the boat.  The Minister must look into the question of speedy allocation of land very carefully because at the moment people expecting allocations of land are giving up the ghost and are vacating <Col N="329" /> their small holdings.  This means further denuding of the countryside.</P>
    <P>At this point I should refer to the people who are advocating that farmers be taxed.  If the people who advocate this would look around they would see that the number of farmers who would come into the tax net would be very small indeed.  Most smallholders are dependent on their few acres.  They are not even in the category of part-time farmers who spend their free periods working in factories.  It is on their few acres that they depend solely to eke out an existence.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Land Commission continue to hold a huge bank of land for years on end.  I might say that a lot of this land is not even paid for.  Solicitors were mentioned as being bugbears in the matter of land registry.  I know the Land Commission cannot always be blamed for not paying for holdings because sometimes the solicitors do not do their end of the job, but if a solicitor holds up the transfer of the title deed for too long the holding should be returned to its previous owner by the Land Commission.  I know of a case where the holding has been so long in the hands of the Land Commission because the solicitors have not done their job, that the owner, when he gets paid, will receive a price which is not only unrealistic but which will be an insult. Indeed, he will probably be paid in land bonds.  In the meantime, the Land Commission are letting that land and out of that letting the man who owned it will not get sixpence a year.  It is a disgraceful procedure. In another case very close to my home, three ladies were waiting on payment for their holdings and it was only with the greatest difficulty that they got paid, to such an extent that they thought the money had been eaten up in some legal process or other and they had resigned themselves to not getting anything.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessor have spoken here about the desirability of people of a certain age relinquishing their holdings, giving it <Col N="330" /> to the Land Commission and taking pensions.  I wonder how many people would accept the paltry few pounds offered to them as compensation for giving away what has been to them their homes all their lives.  Admittedly, they are not being asked to leave their homes: they are being asked to give up the land so that somebody else may work it.  I am in agreement with that principle only if the compensation is adequate.  I suppose the greatest right a man has is to own property.  I agree that a person also has a responsibility to see that land is properly worked and if he is not able to do so he should pass it on to others who can work it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned briefly the question of subdivision and the speed with which it is carried out.  However, there is a tendency to subdivide below the economic level and I make a suggestion which, although devaluing a holding further would safeguard certain people.  It is that where an uneconomic rearrangement was made, the holdings would not qualify for additional land in the future.  As I have said, that might devalue the holdings but it would safeguard many people in the future from having to make land available to build up the earlier rearranged holdings to an economic standard.</P>
    <P>The letting of land held by the Land Commission is a bone of contention among many people, particularly among smallholders in the vicinity of an acquired farm.  The system being operated has led to the birth of the Land League.  Nobody can blame smallholders for complaining when certain holdings of land are being let, perhaps comprising between 50 acres and 200 acres, when such farms, no matter what their size are let by auction as single lots.  No smallholder can hope to compete against the man with the cheque book.  In my own county I know of a pocket of land comprising ten or 12 acres which has yet to be allocated.  Living in the vicinity of this land are about five smallholders each of whom would qualify for the land and who would be ideal tenants.  However, the Land <Col N="331" /> Commission have not yet decided on allocating the land to anybody and on Monday next it will be auctioned as meadow.  It is very unfair that agreement was not reached with the adjoining smallholders in regard to this meadow so that they might have extra bales of hay with which to feed their cattle in the coming winter.  Instead, it will probably go to an outsider if any such person should happen to outbid the locals.  This illustrates one of the tragedies of the system operated by the Land Commission in regard to the letting of land.</P>
    <P>Of course, the farmer is entitled to the best possible price whether in respect of the sale or of the letting of land and the Land Commission, as the holders of the land in trust, are entitled to their fair share but the benefit goes ultimately to the local smallholders on whose behalf the Land Commission hold land until such time as it is allocated.</P>
    <P>The one-mile limit is used as an excuse for not giving land to some people.  However, that regulation is not sacrosanct because it has been breached in the past.  Because of the regulation, many capable farmers have been denied the opportunity of an enlarged holding.  I have known of cases where farmers lived only one mile as the crow flies from land that was being allocated but who were a distance of, perhaps 1½ miles away by road and, therefore, were excluded. If there are not sufficient smallholders within the mile limit, people are brought in from outside but this is galling for local people who are trying to improve their standards of living.</P>
    <P>There is also the policy whereby a landless man will not qualify for land that is being allocated.  Every Deputy will know of many excellent farmers' sons who live on the family farm in the hope that some day they will have holdings of their own but, unfortunately, in many cases they will not achieve their ambition because of the regulation which excludes landless men from qualifying for allocations. They also have the problem of not <Col N="332" /> being able to borrow enough money with which to buy land.  If the Land Commission were to become engaged in the provision of capital for this purpose, they would be doing a very good day's work; otherwise many of those young men will be lost to Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Finance will take some action in regard to death duties because, very often, when a parent dies, the young men of the family have to utilise whatever few pounds they happen to have so that they can save the farm.  This is a situation that one would not find in any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will consider the few points I have made and that when he is introducing his Estimate next year he will be able to indicate to us that he has given his Department a facelift.  I hope, also, that at that time he will be able to tell us that all available land has been allocated and that all the other changes that are necessary will either have taken place or will be in the course of taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I extend to the Minister the customary good wishes for his term of office.  This Estimate is one that evokes contributions from many rural Deputies and rightly so.  This reflects the concern of all of us for the maintenance on the land of Ireland of as many people as the land can maintain in decent comfort.  The standards that apply in determining what constitutes decent comfort have changed considerably, even during my time.  In the early days of the State it was considered that farms of 20 or 25 acres would not be sufficient in some cases to provide a decent living for a man and his family.  That is the case yet and will always remain the position although there are certain specialists who can extract a good living from a small holding but, by and large, the present policy of the Land Commission of giving farms of 45 acres would need to have a large degree of flexibility because we must bear in mind that with the increase in industrialisation, with the mechanisation <Col N="333" /> of farming and because of the well-established drop in the proportion of the people who are engaged in farming in recent years, the size of the holding occupied by the people who remained should be somewhat bigger.  The standards that were acceptable to our fathers and the standards that were acceptable even 15 or 20 years ago are not acceptable to the young men in rural Ireland today and it is well to recognise that.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have been operating in a rut.  I do not mean that in a derogatory sense, but they have a standard practice which they have been applying since their establishment all those decades ago and it is generally true to say that during much of that period farming was a depressed industry. It was difficult to make farming profitable.  In that particular respect there has been a revolution. With our entry into the EEC it is now possible for us, for the first time, to sell all the farm produce that we can produce and sell it at a guaranteed price.  This is a situation that we have never known before.  We have broken out of the British stranglehold at long last.  This raises questions for the Land Commission and for their function as people who regulate the tenure of land. I speak with some trepidation on this subject because I happen to be a farmer.  I think the present Government are at a disadvantage in that no member of that Government, as far as I know, is, in the ordinary understood sense of the word, a farmer.  They are, therefore, somewhat at a disadvantage in keeping themselves <i>au fait</i> with the feeling of the country or trying to realise what farming attitudes are to land problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With our tradition of the land war and the long and bitter fight that we who come from the land had to wage for the possession of our land, it is very difficult to ask us to contemplate any system of tenure except outright ownership but I should like the Minister, when he is replying to this debate, to let us have the benefit of his opinion on a system that obtains pretty well throughout the EEC, in every country except our own&mdash;a system of <Col N="334" /> long leases.  There are many young men struggling in farming today who can never hope to be owners, can never hope to be farmers in out sense of the word, simply because the price of land is such that they cannot ever hope to buy land.  The previous speaker referred to the Land Commission rule which, in my experience anyway, is very rigidly enforced, the rule that prevents the giving of Land Commission land to people who are described rather inaccurately and very heartlessly as landless men.  If the Minister is introducing changes I would recommend that he should introduce some flexibility in this.  It is not sufficient when you are dealing with people, when you are dealing with men, to say: &ldquo;You are a landless man and, therefore, you get no land&rdquo; without any further argument or discussion.</P>
    <P>As we all know, within that general category of landless men there are some people who would be potentially farmers of the very best kind. I suppose every rural Deputy knows a few personally, men who by one means or another, by the use of conacre especially, build themselves up. If they are tillage men they build up into machinery and if they are stock men they build up herds of cattle and flocks of sheep.  Still in the eyes of the Land Commission they cannot and will not be considered for the allocation of land.  I realise the reasons the Land Commission introduced this rule.  I realise the pressing urgency there is on the Land Commission to relieve what is called congestion. At the same time, I think nothing justifies something that is unjust in itself and I believe that this is.  In the matter of selection of allottees for land, I believe potential allottees should definitely be put through the hoop.  Their potential, their age, their marriage status, their intelligence, their ability to work, all these things should be determined as they used to be in Holland when polder land, newly reclaimed from the sea, was being allocated.  We must really face up to the fact that poverty in itself alone ought not to be the sole determining factor in deciding who will be allotted land.  Since land and <Col N="335" /> the products of the land are now so valuable, the person should get land who is most likely to make the best use of it and very definitely preference should be given to the younger men and preference, of course, should be given to men who are married.</P>
    <P>The question of land in the possession of the Land Commission being let year by year was raised.  It always is.  I would suggest to the Minister that he consider only letting this land to farmers who would be potential allottees in the locality.  He probably knows very well himself, since he represents a rural constituency, that this is a constant source of grievance. At an ordinary open auction the person who is least likely to require the land for his living is most likely to get it because he can pay more than the other people can.  It is as simple and as brutal as that.  This, again, seems to me to be somewhat unfair and since it is, I would suggest to the Minister that he think about it &mdash;only allot Land Commission land to people who would normally qualify for allotments of land from him.  This would help to rule out the longstanding grievance of small, uneconomic holders against people who have financial resources at their command and who can outbid them at auctions.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of the purchase of land by people from outside farming here some time ago by way of Parliamentary question.  This is a pressing problem and one on which some action should be taken.  I am not talking in particular about foreigners. I am talking about people in our own country who have large sums of money at their disposal and are from outside the farming industry. For the purpose of investment, of dealing in a more satisfactory way with the Revenue Commissioners, such people buy farm land.  Every acre of farmland that people with wealth, obtained in other ways, purchase they drive some young farmer out of the business, and possibly out of the country.</P>
    <P>I invite criticism of this statement. <Col N="336" /> I believe it is true and the procedure is unjust.  Since it is unjust I urge the Minister to examine it.  I recognise it is a difficult question and that it may well involve constitutional problems. It is, however, a pressing need.  If our purpose is to maintain our rural people on the land we cannot sell our land resources to people outside farming, Irish nationals or anybody else. I believe that we should introduce stipulations such as exist in other countries, for example, France, in the matter of the purchase of land.  In other countries it is necessary for a person buying land to show that he has worked on the land for a stated period and that he is intent on making his living solely from farming.  This is what farmland is for.  We are well endowed in this country with farmland and we are obliged to make the best use of it.  Surely its sale to wealthy people as a means of either maintaining or expanding their wealth is not the best way to use our land.</P>
    <P>I should also like to recommend to the Minister for consideration the question of designating land as development land.  Every rural Deputy has had experience of land coming on the market, especially small portions of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all heard about it then.  When land comes on the market in an area where there are people who do not have sufficient land to give themselves a living it usually happens that another farmer, with sufficient land and probably more money, buys that portion of land.  The other farmers are then allowed to remain in their uneconomic situation. Looking at this from a purely moral point of view, I do not think that the big farmer has a moral right to deprive his neighbours of a living.  Looking at it from the Government's point of view, I think there is an obligation on them to seek a land policy that would prevent this type of undesirable purchase of land.  I am not saying that farmers who have bigger farms should be prevented <Col N="337" /> totally from buying land.  That would be a foolish, a false and short-sighted policy in the long run.  However, they should be prevented from injuring their neighbours, as frequently happens in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that it is possible to determine some notional number of acres and say that no man shall own any more land than that.  This would introduce an unnecessary restriction on farm development.  What is necessary is the securing of the position where one farmer, because he is wealthy, cannot injure the livelihood, and prospects, of his neighbours.</P>
      <P>The question of succession is another hardy annual.  Dr. Scully of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries carried out a very brilliant research into farming in the west of Ireland recently and one of the alarming things about his findings was the astonishingly high age of farmers, and the astonishingly large number of unmarried farmers.  This is the hangover of decades of the old British dictated system of market quotas which strangled any hope we had of real farm development.  It imposed on farmers on small acreage, whether they liked it or not, and, no matter how good they were, a low standard of living.  Since it did no girl was willing to marry poverty.  That is the cruel fact of the matter.</P>
      <P>This can now be altered because of our new marketing situation.  On the question of the passage of land from father to son, I would hope that we would never see the day that this traditional passage of land would be restricted, or inhibited, by the action of this or any other Government. We are all familiar with the problem of the reluctance of the old farmer to hand over the land to his son.  In my experience I believe that the working life of a farmer is in the region of 30 years.  They are safe in waiting until they are 48.  Thereafter many of them are not able to stand up to the hard physical work of farming and they should be contemplating the passage of their land to their sons or heirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another, and more pressing <Col N="338" /> need, for this.  It is unfair, and unjust, for the young men to sit in expectation of the demise of the old farmer which might not take place until the heir is lapsing into senility. This is totally unsatisfactory and it is a very serious social problem of the rural Irish.  There is an obligation on us to think about it and see what can be done to improve the situation. The reason that old farmers are reluctant to relinquish their farms is that they are worried about their own security.  There is also the difficulty because of the affection of all farmers for their land.  This is a formidable quantity, difficult in definition, but we have all seen it in action.  Farmers, even though they are living in poverty, have refused to leave that poverty if it involved relinquishing the ownership of their land.</P>
    <P>Now that we are in the EEC we will have better encouragement than we have had by way of pensions to the older men to relinquish possession of land.  There may be some intermediate steps that would ease the shock to the older man of being suddenly deprived of his land and finding himself in the condition of being a landless man overnight.  Both the old and the young man are entitled to some measure of security. There must certainly be a compromise on the part of the older man in order to get the land into the young and vigorous hands of his successor: it is necessary that ownership should pass from one to the other.  Possibly guaranteeing to the older man the right of residence and provision of a second house and payment of a pension sufficient to maintain an elderly man and his wife in comfort would be a help but nothing less would be acceptable.  Participation of the younger man in partial payment of his parents might be arranged in a legal way.  In any case, we know the problem is there and is not easy to overcome. Many wise and diligent men&mdash; some in the Land Commission&mdash;have recognised this problem for a long time and tried to cope with it but there is now an urgency that never before existed.  There is an imbalance in the age and marital status of the people of rural Ireland, especially in <Col N="339" /> Connaught, which bodes ill for the province's future unless very radical measures are taken quickly.  I urge the Minister to consider this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I want to praise the Forestry Division for their work in the provision of forest parks.  I think nobody would object to my mentioning the name of the late Henry Grey of the Forestry Division whose idea, I think, it was originally.  Some of the State forest parks are a credit to the Forestry Division and the country generally.  It is notable that practically all our timber is commercial timber. The reasons for that are very plain and pressing.  We needed our forests to pay as quickly as possible.  Many of them are paying now, providing pulp wood and other commercial timbers. I think we should now consider providing some trees for purely ornamental purposes particularly deciduous trees such as beech, ash, sycamore and the indigenous tree of Killarney&mdash;and many other places&mdash; the oak.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division, in their time, committed a few sins and in my opinion one of their worst was in relation to Torc mountain, Killarney. Originally, it was clothed in oak trees.  They were removed and replaced by coniferous trees.  Norway, spruce, contorta and so on.  They died for some reason and Torc mountain &mdash;unless it has changed in the past couple of years; I have not been there &mdash;was injured very severely, temporarily of course, by the operations of the Forestry Division.  Killarney is a very special case and the clothing of Torc mountain and other mountains in trees should get particular attention. My own view is that the indigenous trees should be planted, encouraged and developed.  Possibly mine is a layman's view.</P>
    <P>Another problem which is not now within the ambit of the Forestry Division arises in many towns and villages throughout the country where there are stands of lovely trees. Naturally, I know those in my own constituency better than others, such as the village of Castlecomer which <Col N="340" /> has a very stately row of lime trees on each side of the road, or the village of Freshford with its chestnuts, or the very well-known village of Inistioge and, in Kilkenny city itself, there are some lovely wooded roadways. I think&mdash;I am not certain&mdash; that these trees fall to be attended to by local authorities.  There are lime trees in the village of Ballylinan, Laois, that have been &ldquo;pollarded&rdquo; by somebody; they have been horribly mutilated and will never be the same again.  This should not happen.  There are many people in the Forestry Division who are expert in the maintenance of trees, the pruning, care and replacement of them and their advice should be available to local authorities.  I am certain that if the local authorities sought it they would get it but this has not happened.  A couple of the lime trees in Castlecomer have died.  I believe this was because tarmacadum was laid surrounding the roots and they were unable to respire properly.  They have not been replaced.</P>
    <P>These trees are very important to us in rural Ireland.  There should be a way to maintain them, to replace them when they are past maturity and keep our towns and villages as lovely as some of them are.</P>
    <P>Some of the State forest parks are in areas where, like Gougane Barra, the whole area should be included for special consideration as a national park area.  This idea was current a few years ago when the Office of Public Works set up their parks section.  It would be natural and good evolution if that excellent service and the Forestry personnel together could designate certain large parts of the country as national park areas where special attention would be paid to the erection of buildings and the provision of trees and amenities.  I would ask the Minister to consider this, because we do happen to have, in my opinion anyway, the only remaining unspoilt countryside in western Europe today and we ought to recognise it and keep it, certainly for tourists, although I would prefer to think that we would be motivated in the preservation of our own rural heritage for ourselves and for our <Col N="341" /> children rather than for anybody else. We should recognise the marvellous beauty of our countryside and protect it for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Very serious inroads are being made into the beauty of our countryside.  It has been mentioned with increasing frequency: the pollution of our waterway, the pollution of the air in certain places and the erection of undesirable and ugly buildings in the wrong place. This is controlled to some extent, but not sufficiently, by the planning legislation. There are large parts of this country that should get special treatment. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle himself will know the area from Clogheen over &ldquo;The Vee&rdquo; into Lismore and Cappoquin.  This is very special and is only one of thousands of places in this country, but to treat it as just anywhere is to fail to recognise its great importance to us and to our future.</P>
    <P>I wish to give briefly to the Minister some highly personal opinions about wildlife.  I am concerned about the disappearance of certain species from the countryside.  When I was young, at the cutting of the corn, it was more usual than not to start several coveys of partridges from every field of barley.  I have not seen a partridge for 20 years. I do not know what has happened to them, but they are gone.  At the same time, we have the most astonishing proliferation of wood pigeons and if you consider a little more you will discover that sparrow hawks have almost totally disappeared, as have some owls as well.  I believe that the disappearance of the hawks is directly responsible for the proliferation of wood pigeons and they are very predatory and damaging birds when they exist in the numbers in which they now exist.  Incidentally it must be 20 or 25 years since I heard a corncrake.  I do not know what has become of these either.</P>
    <P>I suspect that in the case of hawks it may well be that they were killed because of their well-known tendency to eat the livers of their prey, usually pigeons.  I am told by men who know that mercury dressings of seed ingested by pigeons, in the springtime, while it does not actually poison the pigeons, is concentrated in the <Col N="342" /> birds' livers.  Since the hawk, being a predatory bird, eats the livers of its prey first, it gets a lethal dose of organic mercury or, if not lethal, it may induce sterility in the hawks' eggs.  At any rate, the balance itself is severely upset.  I think magpies did operate as a balancer to prevent the proliferation of wood pigeons and they, too, have been diminishing somewhat in numbers.</P>
    <P>We are living in a time when there is very extensive use made of all kinds of organic chemicals whose many possible effects on our ecology are only partly understood, if they are understood at all.  There are some tragic examples of the shocking effects of the use of organic chemicals without exhaustive trials being made as to their safety for humans and animal and birdlife as well.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would consider what I have said as a countryman.  The balance of nature, without which nature will not function properly, has been upset by the ignorant intrusion of men with their chemicals into something that was functioning properly before.  I know that what the Minister or anyone else can do about this is sharply limited, but at the same time, when we are aware of the destruction of some of our species, I think we shall seek more diligently for the solution of the problem.  I want to repeat my good wishes to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to wish the Minister well in his office.  Coming as he does from my own county&mdash; at least originally he came from it&mdash; he would be very familiar with the problems of that area, and down the years the Department of Lands, through the Land Commission, have endeavoured to bring farm sizes to an economic level.  It was a laudable, though sometimes a slow process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of 76,000 acres is mentioned in the Minister's speech as being held by the Land Commission, and according to replies to parliamentary questions the Land Commission seem to hold a considerable amount of land in some counties. When this is compared with a mere <Col N="343" /> 893 acres&mdash;the figure at the 1st April &mdash;which the Land Commission hold in Monaghan, it shows a great imbalance. While one must admit that there are not as many large estates in Monaghan as in other counties, from time to time there are still large quantities of land being offered for sale in the county and there are times when the buyers of those farms offered are men who have many other interests and who are not depending at all on farming as a means of livelihood. There are other cases of farmers who already have adequate farms buying other farms.  They buy these more as a speculation than anything else.  It has been my experience that some of the most progressive and efficient farmers are those who obtained their farms from the Land Commission, having given up to the Land Commission small holdings, or who had additions made to their existing holdings.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about the Mansholt Plan.  That plan aims at making farms an economic size and, in order to achieve that, pressure has to be brought to bear on small farmers.  From an economist's point of view that may well be the correct approach but one should always remember that when one is dealing with land one is also dealing with people.  The farming tradition goes back many hundreds of years and people with a farming background do not usually yield very readily to pressure. That is true not alone of Ireland but of other EEC countries, as the policy planners in Europe may have found out by this time.  In no country does the small farmer wish to be pushed off the land and this is something of which economic planners should take note.  Economic necessity can be pleaded for this action, but we should never forget that one of the main achievements of the Land League was fixture of tenure and we must, therefore, not allow planners to force our farming stock off the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should investigate what can be done in rural areas so that the people will <Col N="344" /> stay on the land and get a decent living.  Part-time farming is a solution. It has already been forced on many small farmers in my area.  Most of them have to bolster their earnings from farming by off-farming employment of one kind or another.  Our policy must be to formulate a plan which will enable people to stay on the land and yet provide them with the standards, the amenities and the facilities available to those in purely industrial employment.  It may be argued that, while this is an ideal solution, it is not a feasible one.  I do not accept that.  We can have the solution if we are willing to work for it.  I believe this solution has substantial support at local level from many members of the EEC countries. The Government will have to take steps to encourage the establishment of suitable seasonal or part-time employment for small farmers either through the medium of co-operatives or through private enterprise.  This would result in limiting the growth of large towns and it would make possible more worthwhile village development. It has been proved that the sons of small farmers are very adaptable and make excellent workers.</P>
    <P>The area under forestry in the Monaghan-Cavan area is approximately 16,000 acres.  As the Minister is aware, employment is very, very badly needed in these areas, especially along the border areas of these two counties.  The forestry acreage on the northern side of the Border is very substantial in both County Tyrone and County Fermanagh. There is a very substantial pool of timber there.  It may be wishful thinking on my part, but I would suggest to the Minister that he should endeavour to get some agreement with the Northern Ireland forestry authorities for the provision of some timber-based industry in the area to which I referred.  A great deal of this timber will be reaching maturity in a few years' time and an industry on the lines I suggest would provide badly needed employment along the Border in an area in which there is at the moment very little employment. <Col N="345" /> It could also be a fruitful field of co-operation for both sides.</P>
    <P>Across the Border from Monaghan there is a very fine picnic area provided for the use of the local people and tourists.  I do not know if there are such areas in other forests.  I do not think there are any in north Monaghan.  Such a facility would be a tremendous amenity.  Picnic areas could be provided in some of the forests adjacent to Castleblayney, Castleshane, Rossmore, Knockatallen and Derrygurry.  These would be a valuable amenity.  People could enjoy themselves in picturesque surroundings. The forests are the property of the nation and as many as possible, particularly children, should have every opportunity of enjoying the beauty of these forests.  I appeal to the Minister, if possible to set up picnic areas in those forests convenient to built-up areas such as Monaghan town which has a fair-sized population.  It would be of great advantage along the Border area if there was one similar to that at Favour Isle.  Incidentally, that picnic area is well signposted for those wishing to avail of this amenity.</P>
    <P>An employee of the Forestry and Wildlife Section in Monaghan for 25 years&mdash;before that he had served in the Army&mdash;resides with his wife and a large family in a house belonging to the Department.  The house has no water laid on and no toilet facilities of any description.  The man made an application to purchase the house. The Department would not agree to the sale, but informed him that if he provided those facilities at his own expense they would have no objection. He will be retiring in a few years and will probably have to vacate the house.  I do not think it would be advisable for him to provide these facilities.  The Department should provide these facilities if they are not willing to sell the house.  Because of its situation, the Department might not wish to dispose of the property.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional investment which the Land Commission have for the purchase of land.  I hope the Minister will act favourably <Col N="346" /> towards my county in securing more land.  As I mentioned earlier, the pool of land held in County Monaghan, 893 acres, is very small.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to provide as much money as possible for that county to build up more economic holdings.  A number of years ago land had not the same value or meaning as it has today. People were glad to get some of it cleared up for planting trees.  Since then, some of this land has been declared a pilot area and terrific progress has been made.  Viewing some of these forests now, one cannot help thinking that with drainage systems, liming and fertilising, that land would be excellent for grazing&mdash;not tillage, because it would be of a very wet variety.  It is a pity to see trees growing where bullocks could be grazing.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his office.  The Land Commission have not a very big acreage in County Monaghan, but their officers are very helpful and very fair in allocating land. They get a lot of brickbats and criticism, but I think if they do their job well they should get credit for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Land is one topic which has caused heated argument in the past few hundred years.  Anything dealing with land is very controversial. Anybody dealing with land, such as the Land Commission, and trying to bring farms up to economic holdings, is bound to be criticised.  By and large, the Land Commission are doing a reasonable job.  They are curtailed in some ways, pricewise, and I feel a serious look will have to be taken at their position because of that.  The price of land has gone up considerably in Dublin, Meath, Kildare and to some extent in Wicklow.  The Land Commission cannot pay these high prices.  In Duleek they bought dear land&mdash;dear by ordinary standards&mdash;for allocation and paid £540 to £550 per acre for it at the end of last year.  They balanced that with cheaper land and made it into a pool price.  They bought another lot at Athboy, which cost about £570 per acre and they hope it can be pooled with a cheaper lot.  If they have to <Col N="347" /> buy the land at £570 an acre it means the land will cost them not much less than that amount.  The Land Commission inspectors have to make inquiries in the area to see if farmers can pay that price for the extra land.</P>
      <P>What is happening now in Dublin, Meath and Kildare could spread throughout the country.  There are pockets of land in part of the country making just as high a price. I know a farmer, who is considered to have an uneconomic holding, who bought a few acres to bring his holding up to standard a few months ago. Since then he bought another bit of land, 17 acres, and paid £1,000 an acre for it.  That was a very high price but the land in the good areas of Meath is making from £500 to £1,000 an acre in extreme cases.  Even at the lower level of £500 it would be hard to buy land at the moment.  Such land is too dear to give to the holder of an uneconomic farm.  The Land Commission could buy land with Land Bonds or some of the cash which is available to them, but the people might not be able to take it.  If that happens there will be trouble straightaway. There could be a strike similar to the rent strike of the local authority housedwellers.  That should not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>If land is available at £50 or £60 an acre, people would not be able to afford to pay for ten or 20 acres, especially if they did not get the expected high returns from the extra acreage.  A small group of people could start objecting to the high prices.  I do not want to give such ideas to the people, but the Land Commission should take note of what could happen.  The only alternative is to use the EEC funds for the relief of underdeveloped areas.  I think there is £40 million available at low interest rates.  That money could be used to bring interest rates down to 4 per cent or 5 per cent.  Rents would be more realistic and farmers would be able to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should consider methods of acquiring land and making it available at reasonable prices.  Nobody wants the land for nothing or at <Col N="348" /> a very cheap rate.  The figure of £20 or £30 which is being asked is high, but some farmers are glad to get land at that price.  I have seen farms bought at high prices this year, and I wonder what the rents will be like in two or three years time when the land is allocated.  In the Meath constituency which I represent, only two or three farms have been bought since the beginning of the year.  The pool of land will run out.  There are many uneconomic holdings in Meath.  The big ranches which were in that county some years ago no longer exist.  They have all been sold.  In many cases the Land Commission have acquired them.  The Land Commission made a survey of uneconomic holdings a few years ago.  It showed that 60 per cent of the farms in County Meath were under 40 statute acres.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done in County Meath.  Many of the Land Commission farms are uneconomic and there are a large number of small farms which already existed before the Land Commission allocated land.  The price factor is responsible for the shortage of land.  What is happening in Meath will happen in the rest of Ireland. The nearer one gets to Dublin the higher is the price of land.  The Land Commission cannot operate in County Dublin now.  They cannot buy.  They have no land to give out there.  Kildare is in a similar position.  I should like to see the Land Commission in a position similar to that in which they were ten years ago when they were practically the best buyers of land in the country.  At that stage they could reasonably expect to get every second or third farm which was offered for sale.  Many farms were made available to the Land Commission even after they were sold.</P>
    <P>Land prices are inflated.  The Land Commission have not been able to cope with the position.  A new Government policy will have to be implemented. If the Land Commission could buy every second or third farm which comes on the market they would be able to meet their requirements.  I would not like to see the Land Commission competing against a small farmer who, through his own efforts and through money borrowed from the <Col N="349" /> ACC or the bank, was trying to buy a farm adjacent to his own.  It is safe to say that the Land Commission would not interfere in such a case. They usually take precautions to see that they are not taking land in which small farmers in an area have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>Many farms are being sold all over the country.  If the Land Commission could buy them at reasonable prices and allocate them at reasonable rents they could solve the problems which exist.  With so many uneconomic farms it is hard to persuade farmers' sons to start farming on their own.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to leave five or ten farms over every year for farmers' sons who get the top places in the farm apprenticeship scheme.  This would mean that young men who have an interest in farming but who have no chance of getting farms of their own would be able to start on their own.  It is impossible for such young men to get farms of their own unless their fathers have a considerable amount of money to give them. I am thinking particularly of sons of agricultural workers.  These men have worked on land all their lives and, while they have no chance of getting farms of their own, they would like to see their sons getting farms.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission sometimes hold over land too long.  It may be five or six years after they take it over before they allocate it.  Sometimes there is a reason for this but I find if there is a change of plan the scheme is delayed for a few years.  I realise that in the allocation of land you must have patience and be sure that you are getting the right people for it.  However, the Land Commission should be able to allocate land within a year or 18 months.  If they have it for three years they should be required to put before both Houses of the Oireachtas the reasons for the delay.  This would be an incentive to them to allocate land quickly.</P>
    <P>It is often known locally that the Land Commission have a particular farm.  They may have bought it but until the title is right and the deeds are handed over they do not actually own it.  It is very welcome to see so much money being allocated this year <Col N="350" /> for the purchase of land.  It was not publicised enough during the past year that land bonds were saleable on the stock exchange and that cash could be obtained for them.  Many people throughout the country felt they could not sell them.</P>
    <P>When allocating land I feel it is a pity that some of the houses on the land are held so long before they are disposed of.  The Minister recently mentioned the Noone estate, Billinakill, Enfield.  When I was first elected to the Dáil in 1961 the owner was living in that house but within six months the land was sold to the Land Commission.  That house, which was built in the 1950s is now derelict.  It should not have been left vacant for such a long period.  The Land Commission, shortly after taking over land, should be able to decide what is to happen to any house on it.  Such a house should be sold immediately and not allowed to go derelict.  I know the estate I mentioned is an exceptional one.  The Land Commission changed their mind twice on this.  At first it was to be a pig fattening unit but that idea fell through after a few years.  Most of the land was divided and then the idea of a group farm came up.  Now I believe there is a further change.  In rural areas a vacant house is very welcome and you can get a fair price for it, even if it is very small.  In my constituency it is certainly possible to get a good price for an empty house on an estate.  This will help to bring down the price of the farm.  You only have to sell the house with maybe a garden or a half acre at the most.  If it is a bigger house you have to take in perhaps an acre or two, or whatever ground is around it.  There is a ready market even for big houses.  The Land Commission should sell off the houses reasonably quickly after they acquire the estates.  At one time the staff working on the estate had to wait until it was divided but, in the past couple of years, whatever compensation was to be given to the staff was given in a very short period.</P>
    <P>Group farming which is in its infancy has not been very successful.  I am glad that the Department are persevering with this scheme.  What is <Col N="351" /> being done at the Ballinakill estate near Enfield may possibly be a solution. The Minister mentioned that there are a few other areas which will be developed along the lines that the people apply for the scheme.  They have to sell the idea to the Land Commission as against the Land Commission coming to them and asking them to take part in a group farming scheme.  Psychologically speaking if the people apply themselves there is a better chance of the scheme working.  The expertise of the people working this scheme in the Department should be available to farmers who would like to join a scheme.  There is a great potential for this idea.</P>
    <P>We have all seen enough machinery on one farm to be used on two or three farms.  It would be better to pool the machinery.  The young men feel they are tied on Saturday and Sunday.  If they go to the seaside, at 5 o'clock they have to go back home to milk.  If I have put on my good clothes to go some place, when I come back I am not in the humour to change into my old working clothes.  I can imagine what it is like for the father of a family who is at the seaside or at a football match and has to go home, change his clothes and milk the cows.  If two or three of them could group together they could make arrangements for the weekend.</P>
    <P>There is a need for group farming. The number of group farming schemes throughout the country at present could be counted on the fingers of my two hands.  The younger people want to be free for an odd week-end or an odd Sunday.  There is no reason why this scheme should not work.  People say that it is too hard to get farmers to agree but they are as capable of agreeing as anybody else.  People can join together to start a business.  In companies big numbers are involved and work together perfectly. The same applies to factories. If this can work in industry and commerce I do not see why it cannot work in agriculture.  If the formula can be found it can be worked.  Quite a number of farmers are prepared to <Col N="352" /> work it.  The five-day cow has not been bred yet.  All stock has to be looked after over the weekend as well as during the week.  I note that the Land Commission practically achieved their target in forestry of 25,000 acres last year.</P>

Advertisements will be published in the local newspapers beforehand inviting unsupplied residents in the area to apply for connection.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the person in question lives in an area which was scheduled for closing to applications for subsidised electricity supply under the rural electrification scheme on 31st May, 1972.  Terms for supply were quoted on 15th May, 1972, to the householder who was informed that a reply was required by 24th May, 1972.  On 16th June, 1972, a reply was received by the board stating that the terms quoted were too expensive and on the 7th July, 1972, the board issued a letter stating that the terms could not be altered.  The board have also informed me that the person concerned called to their Clonmel office on 31st May, <Col N="356" /> 1973, that is, 12 months after the closing date regarding electricity supply to her premises and that a letter which issued on 13th June, 1973, stated incorrectly, due to a typing error, that the area in question was scheduled for closing on 31st May, 1973, instead of 1972, and that, therefore, her application was late.  The board are now writing to the householder concerned correcting the typographical error in their letter of 13th June 1973.</P>

      <P>Yes, I do.  I am pleased the Deputy had the foresight to appoint Commander Stephens to the board.  It was a wise move and I endorse it.  However, if he wants to take credit for the appointment of Commander Stephens he must take the blame for allowing two vacancies to exist on the Electricity Supply Board, one since February, 1968, and the other since February, 1969.  If he was so concerned about getting a member of the farming community on the board he could have done it at any time in the last three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the desirability of raising standards in some Irish restaurants and, in my speech at the annual dinner of the Irish Restaurant Owners Association on 28th June, I said that the ideal solution would be to have registration and grading of restaurants carried out by Bord Fáilte.  However, a registration and grading system would require considerable resources in funds and manpower and, unfortunately, Bord Fáilte are not in a position to develop such a system at present because of their other commitments.  An amendment to the Tourist Traffic Acts would also be necessary.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the restaurant industry would play its part in improving standards.  Where there are poor standards, pressure on the proprietors to eliminate such standards can also be exerted by their customers. Bord Fáilte are currently endeavouring to achieve greater customer awareness.  The need for guidance to overseas visitors is a matter to which the board have been giving consideration.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I appreciate the urgency of the situation in regard to the level of employment and emigration.  My attention has been brought to this unsatisfactory state of affairs and while the Deputy would appreciate that in regard to the allocation of resources, the problem must be considered in a national sense and not in regard to a particular area, this particular area has suffered in a rather special way and I propose finding out if it is possible, within the resources available to me and in co-operation with SFADCO, to remedy the situation.</P>

      <P>In regard to the latter part of the question, the hope of the ending of emigration is not the property of any particular party at any time because it is the wish of all parties that emigration would be arrested.  There is a problem regarding resource allocation but the case has been made to me that the area referred to by the Deputy is one where the problem of emigration is most acute. If one measures need in that sort of statistical way, I recognise that the problem is very great in the north and west Clare areas and I have indicated this concern to the responsible bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, as a result of the classification of the whole of Ireland as a peripheral area, he will introduce measures to counteract the US government proposals to eliminate the tax-free holiday which has been a feature of Government incentives to US industrialists for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The classification of the State as a &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; area by the European Commission has the effect of allowing our present system of State aids to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> The question of measures to counteract the US tax proposals is a separate issue not immediately affected by the Commission decision. Since the tax legislation eventually passed may differ from the original US Treasury proposals, it would be premature to introduce at this stage measures to counteract these proposals.</P>
    <P>I have, however, visited Washington for discussions with representatives of the Administration and of Congress and the Senate to endeavour to ensure that regard would be had to the effects of the proposals on Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that there are certain industrial proposals for this country that have been held up as a result of the announcement by the President of America to take these measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is so aware.  When the Deputy speaks of the statement of the President of America, I take it he is referring to the US Treasury's proposals.  They have created a situation of uncertainty which is inhibiting decisionmaking in regard to the establishment of new US industries in Ireland which I considered to be so serious that I went to the United States to make the position clear.  When that is said, it is necessary that we await the outcome of the Ways and Means Committee of the US Congress which is the actual body from which the final legislation will emanate and that is likely to happen within a matter of, perhaps, two or three weeks. We cannot initiate in specific form protective measures until we know exactly what we are protecting ourselves against.  The Deputy can be assured, and I think my action in going to the US is index of it, that we are watching the situation literally from day to day, that we are profoundly concerned about it and that we will take every possible step to mitigate harm to Irish industrial development by US tax law when it emerges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is being optimistic when he says two <Col N="369" /> or three weeks but that is a matter of opinion.  In the event of the American Government taking action that will remove the benefits to American investors in this country that they gained from the tax-free holiday, as it has come to be known, is there not provision in the agreement we have with the EEC to introduce a similar benefit for American industrialists and should the Minister not now at this stage be discussing with the European authorities what steps we might take if this tax recommendation becomes law in the US?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is satisfied that we have the power, within the agreement negotiated, to provide an alternative as good as what would be ruled out by American tax legislation, if we have that power then there is no need for us to discuss the measures we are taking with the Community but I would reiterate the point that we are continuously reviewing the situation and that we will endeavour to provide a package at least as attractive if the present aids are made impossible by US tax legislation. It is a very delicate situation. It is delicate in regard to the confidence of industry itself, it is delicate in regard to the decisions that will be made by the US Congress initially and the proposals made and I would beg Deputies to accept my assurance that we are literally monitoring it from day to day and not to do anything that would make an already difficult and delicate situation more difficult.</P>

All I could do on behalf of Ireland was to indicate the effects on us of the proposals which came from the Administration.

I would like to ask, having regard to the question Deputy Lemass has put as to our designation as a peripheral area within the EEC, have the Minister and his Department drawn up any precise plans to be submitted to the regional commissioner of the EEC so that we can effect maximum benefit, whatever the outcome of the US negotiations may be?

He will also, perhaps, appreciate that this is not the responsibility of a single Department.  When that is said, he can be assured that the matter is under continuous review, that plans are advanced but not finalised.  He is also, perhaps, aware that there is a great deal of uncertainty at Community level in regard to the whole regional policy and specifically, which is much the most important single <Col N="371" /> issue in regard to planning, the size of the regional development fund.  He is aware that the original figure mentioned is ridiculous and unreal and that a much larger figure has now been tentatively mentioned but it is far from being settled.  For us to try to finalise plans, as distinct from having them in preparation, in that context would be premature because that has to await the final decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The fifth draft directive on company law has not yet been adopted by the EEC and is likely to be changed before being adopted. When it has been adopted company law in this country will have to conform to its provisions.  The most important proposal in the draft directive as far as this country is concerned is the proposal that there should be workers' representatives on the supervisory board of each company above a certain size.  I would welcome at this stage a much greater degree of public discussion of this proposal and of the forms which workers' participation might most suitably take in the circumstances of this country.</P>

      <P>I support the idea of worker participation.  There is very widespread support for the idea of worker participation.  The issue that has to be settled is the form, or forms, of worker participation.  It is a matter where we cannot be doctrinaire and where the appropriate forms have to be discovered in each particular context. It is in that area that discussion, and opinion-gathering, is valuable.  On the basic point of worker participation I am in favour of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The deposits mentioned in the first question are being currently investigated under prospecting licences.  The licensee is required to furnish annual reports of work done under the licences and information about the drilling of boreholes.  Information given to me in this way is confidential. As a computation of ore reserves and grades to date of lead/zinc minerals by the Geological Survey of my Department would be based on such information, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be proper for me to give the data requested by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the company in question is a <Col N="375" /> private concern I am precluded from giving information about its business apart from information which it publishes. A recent statement by the company to the Press indicated that estimated total reserves amounted to 77m short tons and that arrangements have been made with seven European smelting firms for the sale of concentrate products.  This is confirmed in the company's last annual report which indicates ore grading at approximately 2.63 per cent lead and 10.9 per cent zinc.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House that undertakings have been given to the company named in the second question that a lease of State minerals in a number of townlands included in a prospecting licence held by them will be granted.  It is my intention, as soon as I am in a position to do so, to grant a lease on foot of these undertakings subject to such terms and conditions as I may consider proper or desirable in the public interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>The Minister does agree that we are entitled to that information.

It is normal commercial prudence not to invest a large amount of money in a smelter if the materials to operate it are not available.</P>

      <P>The Continental Shelf Act, 1968, provides a statutory framework for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of this country's area of the Continental Shelf in accordance with the principles of the 1958 Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>The Continental Shelf is defined in the Geneva Convention as the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the territorial waters to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the waters permits exploitation.  The convention provides that a coastal state may exercise over the Continental Shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.</P>
      <P>The 1968 Act does not lay down the boundaries of our area of the Continental Shelf but provides that the Government may, by order, designate the area over which the rights of the State with regard to exploration and exploitation of our natural resources may be exercised.  Under the Act, a large section of our Continental Shelf area has to date been so designated.  Further areas may be so designated as information becomes available as to their potential, and in the light of technological developments.</P>

      <P>What I was curious about was that the voltage rating here is 220 to 250, whereas on the Continent it is 110.  On account of the different voltage that is applied, would this not cause difficulty?  Then there are such snags as screw-in bulbs as against stick-in ones.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is misinformed as to the voltage on the Continent being 110.  It is not as simple as that.  If it were the same everywhere it would be rather simple. It is a rather patchy situation in different parts of the Community. <Col N="383" /> culties in harmonisation, but the wish of the Irish trade and the manufacturing industry is that this should be implemented quickly.</P>

      <P>My Department, working in close consultation with the planning offices of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, keeps under constant review the educational needs of the developing areas of Dublin city and county.  The present position in regard to the provision of primary schools in south county Dublin is set out in a statement, which with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to cater for the immediate post-primary needs of this area by the provision of schools in Ballinteer, Cabinteely, Ballyroan and Lucan districts.  In the longer term, schools will be provided in the Balally/Sandyford and the Holylands, Rathfarnham, areas, as well as additional schools in the Tallaght area, when the population growth in these areas warrants such provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational and other qualifications, including age, to be required of students admitted to the National College of Art and Design are matters for the board of the college, under the terms of the National College of Art and Design Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>Apart from the National College of Art and Design, art classes are provided in many vocational and secondary schools throughout the country, in the schools of art in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire and in the art departments of some regional technical colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister saw the report recently that this age limit of 18 is proposed and it is this proposal that gives rise to this question. Is the Minister aware that there are numbers of children who have a tremendous aptitude in this field and who have a very difficult time in completing the two years' schooling in their efforts to get the leaving certificate to qualify for the art classes?  If the age were reduced to 16, would the Minister agree it would be helpful to these children if an outlet were readily available for them, or is the Minister trying to indicate to me that these children can join the vocational school at 16 years of age and get as comprehensive a training there as they would in the National College of Art and Design?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a difference between the type of art course followed in the National College of Art and in the other schools mentioned. With regard to the question of age, it is desirable, I think, in general that the age of entry into third level education should be around 18 years. <Col N="392" /> Actually, in most European countries that is regarded as too low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of preserving and extending our national cultural heritage is basic to everything I undertake in my capacity as Minister for Education.  To enumerate specific proposals in that regard might be to imply that the development of our native culture is something separate from the general intellectual and educational development of our people.  This I would not concede because I consider that, for Irish people, there is what might be called an Irish dimension in practically every aspect of intellectual activity.</P>
      <P>I would say, however, that I have high hopes that the two new courses at present in course of preparation for post-primary schools, in Gaeilge and in Irish studies, will stimulate in our young people a greater interest in and love for our cultural heritage in all its aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> One observation I would make.  It might be inferred from this question that the preservation and enrichment of our cultural heritage is the responsibility of my Department solely.  This is not so.  Success in this regard will depend on the extent to which every organ and institution of our society and each individual citizen plays a full part.</P>

All of these aspects of our educational system are receiving my closest attention.</P>
      <P>Among the improvements which I have introduced since assuming office are: the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools; the extension of the provision for remedial teaching; the institution of arrangements whereby the training course for national teachers will, as from next year, be extended to one of three years as against the present two-year course; and the introduction of proposals for curricular development in the post-primary sector.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the criteria used in deciding on temporary release or parole for convicted prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two kinds of temporary release: (a)  day-to-day temporary release normally for employment involving return to the prison or place of detention at night; and (b) full temporary release either for a specific period or until end of sentence.</P>
      <P>There are no absolute standards or criteria laid down for the granting of temporary release.  Each case is decided on its individual merits and then only after full consideration of all relevant factors.</P>
      <P>Day-to-day temporary release is normally considered when an offender is nearing the end of his sentence. Full temporary release is considered on compassionate grounds in cases where urgent family or domestic circumstances arise.  It is also considered in cases where an offender has been progressing satisfactorily on day-to-day temporary release and full liberty under supervision for the remainder of his sentence would be likely to further advance rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Factors taken into account in deciding whether temporary release may be allowed include the nature and the circumstances of the offence, the offender's own attitude towards rehabilitation, his educational, training or employment needs and opportunities, his conduct while in custody, his family background and the general background.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that Calvary Hospital, Galway, is a privately owned hospital which is independent of the public health services.</P>
      <P>Arising out of an approach by the Calvary Hospital authorities the Western Health Board set up a sub-committee to examine and report on the future of the maternity department of the hospital.  The report of the sub-committee was considered and adopted at the meeting of the health board on Monday last.  The proposals were received in my Department yesterday and are being considered.  They involve a radical change from the normal relationship between health boards and a private hospital.  Furthermore, the proposed arrangements for the working in Calvary Hospital of a general practitioner maternity service for eligible patients raise many questions which require very careful consideration. When these issues have been explored in consultation with the interests concerned I will convey my decision to the board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in reply to previous questions, there is now substantial uniformity throughout the country in the guidelines adopted by health boards for deciding on eligibility for medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing eligibility, a number of factors, such as whether a person is married or single, the number of dependent children, and the amount of fixed outgoings on housing, are taken into account.  The guidelines adopted by all the health boards in respect of a married man and in respect of each dependent child are much the same.  There are some differences in the guidelines relating to single persons, but experience to date would suggest that there is a tendency towards increasing harmonisation between boards in relation to all aspects <Col N="406" /> of the guidelines for determining eligibility.</P>
    <P>My Department recently communicated with the chief executive officers of health boards drawing attention to the need for uniformity in the application of the agreed guidelines.  The replies received to date indicate that the position in this respect is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In view of the general uniformity in the guidelines adopted by the health boards, I have not yet made up my mind whether it is necessary to reverse the decision taken by my predecessor and prescribe national standards for eligibility for medical cards.  I intend to keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>It is an aim of the Treaty of Rome to have mutual recognition of medical qualifications throughout the Community. Discussions on a draft general directive aimed at this are proceeding with the Commission and the other member states.  These are at an early stage and the eventual form of the directive cannot be anticipated, so that I cannot say what, if any, changes it might require in the training of doctors in Ireland.

    </Speaker>
    <P>An associated problem is the failure to register deaths.  A reorganisation of local registration services which is in course of implementation will include the appointment of a full-time superintendent registrar for each health board area.  The duties of these officers will include liaison with clergy, undertakers and any other persons associated with burials.  This development should, it is <Col N="410" /> hoped, go a long way towards the elimination of unregistered and uncertified deaths.  If the results are not entirely satisfactory a further review of the matter will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given to the possibility of requiring death certificates to be issued before burials could take place.  Such a measure would need the most elaborate administrative arrangements which would be justified only if the steps which I have outlined prove to be ineffective.</P>

Having said that, all of us here would wish to have the Defence Forces of this State at full strength.  All of us would disagree with advertisements soliciting young people <Col N="418" /> to join the army of another State.  We would not wish that to happen.  Deputy Blaney has a very serious thing in mind.  He is right and I will look at it.</P>

      <P>I can see the technicality which arises in regard to the printing but the publishing of or distribution of such newspapers in our territory is certainly contrary to the spirit of the regulations.  I would suggest that the Minister might look at the powers to restrict the circulation of these papers within our State if they are not prepared to conform to the intentions of the regulations on this quite serious matter.</P>

My desire is to bring our Irish Army up to strength and see to it that there will be no question of people, as they are doing at present, spending 100 hours per week&mdash;even though some of that time is spent in barracks&mdash;to see to it that security arrangements on the Border and such like are carried out. I take that point completely.  I am glad that Deputy Blaney has seen fit to draw my attention to the fact that outside newspapers are advertising for recruits.  I am advertising for recruits as best I can.  These recruits will be used for nothing else but security.</P>

      <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that he imposes a condition on county council grants that does not apply to local government grants.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <P>Responsibility for the formulation of measures to relieve traffic congestion in the Dublin area rests with the local authorities, that is Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  In general, action is proceeding by these authorities on a number of fronts.  Non-essential traffic, and in particular private car commuter traffic, is discouraged on major and central roads through the exercise of parking controls; the use of public transport is facilitated in consultation with CIE; use is made of traffic management measures to secure more effective use of existing streets; an expanding programme of road improvements and construction works is being implemented with the aim of providing improved and new facilities where required on major routes. Grant assistance from the Road Fund in the current year in support of the road works programmes in the Dublin region amounts to £4.31 million, an increase of £1.25 million on last year.</P>

I know that is not what the Minister <Col N="430" /> is saying but I am sure he is aware that they have this sense of grievance. They think they are being sent from pilliar to post.

However, I appreciate that some of them have been confused by statements made to the effect that the matter is being held up by the Department of Local Government. This is not so.  A sub-committee of the ICTU are at present trying to work out an agreed solution with the County Managers Association and I assume that they will reach early agreement.

Is the Minister aware that, from a national point of view, there is a danger that the correct form of urban renewal will not be carried out unless the Minister takes legal powers to do more than he is entitled to do now even by way of taking the Liberties as a pilot scheme?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to difficulties <Col N="437" /> arising out of Dublin County Council's building by-laws in so far as these lay down in the interests of public health, requirements for drainage of building sites which have not access to a public sewer.  These by-laws were made by Dublin County Council in 1967 under the powers conferred by the Public Health Acts and duly confirmed.  The administration and any alteration of them which might be considered necessary are matters for the county council in which I have no power to intervene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the by-laws that is so, but the appeal Deputy Lemass referred to is against the refusal of planning permission because of the incorrect method of sewage disposal or the failure to have any method of sewage disposal.  That is what Deputy Lemass was talking about.  It is a different matter altogether.  If Deputy Walsh wishes I shall read out the reply to his question again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of an appeal arising as a result of rejection on the grounds stated, the location of the septic tank, that matter would come by way of appeal surely to the Minister and would be considered by him under the Planning Acts and he would exercise his right on that appeal and the matter of where it emanated from or how it arose would not actually come into his dealing with it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there are two but let us not confuse the issue.  If and when an appeal arises on the basis of the application being rejected on the grounds of inadequate facilities for a septic tank, surely this matter is decided as an appeal by the Minister and he does not have a split personality in his approach to it as to whether it contravenes a by-law or whether it is good or bad planning because the overall concept of good planning must take these things into consideration and if he is satisfied, despite the local health authority's views, to uphold the appeal then I hold he is entitled to do so</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney is talking about an appeal against something which is laid down but if the decision is that while they refuse the planning permission for one or two stated reasons they also, on the side, say that it does not comply with the by-laws. There is no appeal against the by-laws which have been approved by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree but if the contravention of the by-laws is a matter of planning criteria such as the location of the septic tank, then the <Col N="439" /> Minister for Local Government surely is entitled to decide on the merits of that particular case and if and when he does grant planning permission to that appellant, then it surely supercedes the objection raised, whether under bye-laws or otherwise, by the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision on whether to grant or refuse planning permission for any proposed private development, including the development of roads, which would have the effect described is primarily a matter for the planning authority for the areas concerned.  I would be involved only in the event of an appeal being made to me against any decision made by the planning authority, and it would not be possible for me to try to anticipate the result of any such appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If what the Deputy has in mind is road development proposed to be undertaken by a local authority, the position is that such development is not subject to planning control but a road scheme cannot be undertaken until the land needed for it has been acquired.  If the local authority seek to acquire the land compulsorily, people with an interest in the land would be entitled to object to me; if the objections are not withdrawn, a public local inquiry must be held to consider them and a report on the inquiry furnished to me before I decide whether or not to confirm the relevant compulsory purchase order. <Col N="440" /> Again, it would not be possible for me to anticipate the outcome of such proceedings in any particular case.</P>

The function of the Short-Term Economic Policy Committee, which was set up by a Council Decision of the 9th <Col N="442" /> March, 1960, is to provide a forum for consultation between the member states and the Commission of the EEC on policy relating to current economic trends.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the EEC Council Resolution of 28th June, 1973, called for a cutting back of Government public expenditure as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>The opening paragraph of the resolution recognises the position of those countries in which capacity utilisation is not already high, and recommends that in such cases the rate of expansion of overall demand should not become excessive.  Ireland is specifically included in this group of countries.</P>
      <P>In regard to fiscal policy, the recommendation for 1973 in the case of Ireland is that the budget policy measures to stimulate the economic upswing should be implemented in a way which will not jeopardise the moves to moderate price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recommendation on fiscal policy for 1974, addressed to all member states, the resolution urges that the rate of growth of expenditure foreseen in the draft budgets for 1974 should be moderated.  Ireland's position in this regard was made clear to the Council.  In the case of other member countries, the recommendation for 1974 was based on preliminary draft budgets furnished by member countries.  In the case of Ireland it was explained that, because this year's budget was later than usual, we were not in a position to supply even tentative figures for 1974, so that it was not possible to form even a preliminary view regarding fiscal policy for that year.  This position was fully <Col N="443" /> accepted by the Council, and it was not necessary to seek a formal amendment of the resolution on this point.</P>
    <P>I might recall that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in their 1973 annual review, in considering alternative forms of desired stimulus for our economy, selected faster rates of government expenditure as an appropriate source.  Current budget policy reflects this view.</P>

The guidelines for Ireland recommended that, given our low degree of utilisation of production capacities, measures to support economic activity should remain the chief ingredient of short-term economic policy in the months ahead and that, to this end, public and private investment should be encouraged through an appropriate monetary and budget policy.

      <P>It is now accepted in all developed countries that there is a correlation between the national level of scientific and technological activities, including research and development, and economic growth.  It follows that there is an obligation on Government so to allocate resources in science and technology as to secure the maximum contribution to economic and, of course, also social development. The achievement of this maximum contribution must postulate a planned strategy for the utilisation of resources in science and technology. The Government accept and will promote the contribution which science and technology can make to economic development.</P>

      <P>The protection of individuals and families against economic hazards and the alleviation of hardship are matters which receive the continuing careful attention of the Government.  I would remind the Deputy that this year's budget gave social welfare concessions amounting to an additional £39 million in the current year and £53 million next year.  These amounts are almost five times greater than the amounts provided for similar concessions in last year's budget.  Also, of course, provision was made for a substantial easing of the rates burden by a transfer <Col N="447" /> to the central Exchequer of £12¾ million, representing the first stage of the complete removal of health charges and housing subsidies from local authority rates.  Furthermore, value-added tax is being removed from food as from 3rd September next and this will benefit all sections of the community but, in particular, the less well-off whose food bill represents by far the largest item of their weekly outlay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the subject matter of a question in relation to a primary national school in the area of Moyglass, County Galway, in the parish of Ballinakill, where there are four primary schools. Following a question from me to the Minister I got a reply regarding the rumour which went through the parish.  The parents were not notified, nor the manager of the school, that it was intended to close the school but rumours spread rapidly and I put a question to the Minister for written reply and found it was provided that Ballinakill national school would cater for the pupils of Moyglass district.  It was proposed to close Moyglass national school as soon as the necessary transport arrangements could be made to convey the children to Ballinakill.  It was intended that the amalgamation should take effect on the date of re-opening of Ballinakill NS.</P>
      <P>The parents of the area summoned the public representatives to a meeting. I attended the meeting at which the manager was also present.  I have here an old jotter signed by every one of the parents and the signatures are good and clear.  I am not an educational examiner by any means but all, or most, of the parents went to that school in their day.  There are 38 children in this two-teacher school. Recently, the Minister has expressed &mdash;and I have read it&mdash;his intention of retaining two-teacher schools and even one-teacher schools if the parents and the manager so wish.  I wondered why he would not apply that intention in Moyglass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the methods of education are really a matter of opinion. I went to a number of schools and I am not educated, nor indeed can I talk on education, but I met people <Col N="449" /> who were in these mixed schools and came out uneducated.  I know of people who attained the highest rank from one-teacher schools.  Indeed, the President of America, Abraham Lincoln, never went to school at all. Also, if you read Robert Service's poem, you would know of the parson's son who retired with a verse of Latin and awoke with a verse of Greek.  So, education is only a matter of opinion.  The Minister has stressed that he will adhere to the idea of considering the views of parents and manager. In this case all the people in the area have signed their names in this jotter asking that their school be retained. A week before that I read in the papers where a school similarly situated in County Monaghan had been allowed by the Minister to retain its present status.  That is what I ask.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard (Dick) Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the question put to me by Deputies Loughnane and Callanan today I said that I was arranging, in consultation with the reverend manager of Moyglass NS, to have a senior inspector of my Department visit the area and meet the parents of the children attending the school to discuss the proposal for its amalgamation with Ballinakill NS.  I said I would review the situation following that discussion.  The papers in my Department did not disclose that there was opposition on the part of the parents.  Certainly, I had no indication that there was strong parental opposition.  The statement in the Deputy's question today was, in fact a reiteration of the information conveyed to me, as I said, by Deputy Hogan O'Higgins, which was, in fact, the first intimation that I had that the parents in general were opposed to the amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has in the normal way been treating with the manager in relation to the proposed amalgamation. I wish to give some details of that.  The school building in question consists of two rooms erected in 1940.  Improvements were carried out there in 1964 at a cost of £250.  Moyglass is one of four two-teacher schools under the managership of Very Reverend Father <Col N="450" /> Ó Murchú.  The others were Drim, Ballinakill and Doire Uí Bhrian.  Drim and Ballinakill were built in 1940 and Doire Uí Bhrian in 1893.  In accordance with departmental policy on small schools at the time a Department inspector was asked, on 20th November, 1970, to consult with the manager about reorganisation of educational facilities in the parish and to furnish a report.  In accordance with the inspectors' recommendations the manager was written to on 7th May, 1971, stating the Department's belief that, as a long-term project, a new central school to replace all the schools in the parish would be desirable.  There was, in addition to the present four schools, also a one-teacher school, Cnoc Maol, in the parish.  Interim rearrangement of schools as follows was suggested to the manager: Moyglass with Ballinakill and Cnoc Maol with Drim.  It was proposed to effect the amalgamation as soon as prefabricated classrooms would be provided at Ballinakill and Drim.  Cnoc Maol was, in fact, amalgamated with Drim on 1st July, 1972, when the Drim assistant resigned, thus obviating the need for an extra room at Drim.</P>
    <P>On 16th June, 1971, the manager gave his agreement to the interim proposals of the Department.  However, he expressed uncertainty as to the attitude of the parents and added that he would have to have time to ascertain their feelings during the summer vacation and ascertain whether a meeting of the parents, as suggested by the Department, would be necessary.  He also stated that the Department would hear from him later.  On 18th August, 1971, the manager said that Moyglass was &ldquo;ripe for amalgamation&rdquo; and, accordingly, it was assumed that the parents' consent was forthcoming. The manager requested priority for the extra room at Ballinakill.  The manager indicated on 12th June, 1973, that the prefabricated room had been erected at Ballinakill and arrangements could accordingly be made for an early amalgamation and it was suggested that the amalgamated Ballinakill school would be a three-teacher school for 98 pupils, Ballinakill being <Col N="451" /> approximately four miles from Moyglass.</P>
    <P>It was stated here today that the manager is anxious to keep the school open.  All I can say is that this is recent news to me: all the indications on my Department's file were to the contrary, which indicates why I replied as I did to a question put to me by the Deputies at the end of last month.  I repeat here what I said earlier today and what I said on the Adjournment of the House on 13th June, 1973, at columns 446-50 of volume 226, that the closing of two-teacher schools is no longer an automatic process and that consultation with all the interested parties will take place from now on.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not feel called upon to apologise for that attitude or to deny the parents of Moyglass school area the opportunity of having their views on the proposed amalgamation considered by me.  I have already today stated in reply to Deputy Loughnane&mdash;and I ask him to accept the statement&mdash;that the matter referred to in Monaghan has no connection whatever with any possibility of a by-election.  It is simply in pursuance of a new direction of policy which I announced in the Dáil on 13th June, a decision which was made on 11th June.  That is a factual account of the situation as it rests now.  The inspector will report to me and I will sympathetically review the situation on foot of that report.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Loughnane for the information which has been added to our knowledge of the situation.  In reply to Deputy Gallagher, I wish to state what I stated on the night of the 13th June referring to a decision of mine, when I said that it illustrates the new approach of the Government to the question of amalgamation of schools that reorganisation will be pursued through discussion, advice and co-operation and not through compulsion in disregard of the views and wishes of the parents. That is the factual situation.  Prior to that the policy would have been to take a decision in regard to these small two-teacher schools without having regard to the opinions expressed.</P>

I know the way in which they have been dealt with and I know the attitude of people.  The Department of Education should have a mind on this matter.  They need not enforce it entirely, but there seems to be a complete departure now from the thinking of the educationalists in the Department of Education as to the course that should be pursued in this primary education field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
