      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the waiting period of seven to nine months for people requiring a cataract operation has been reduced; and, if not, if he has any plans in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the position at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital about which he had a question answered on 2nd May last.</P>
      <P>The non-urgent cases mentioned in that reply had a waiting period of seven to nine months measured from the time they were booked as needing an operation, and including some time when the patient was not medically ready for an operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> There has been a disimprovement in the position since then due, I am informed, mainly to the junior hospital doctors dispute.  The comparable waiting time is now eight to ten months.  This disimprovement would I expect be a temporary one only.</P>
    <P>More urgent cases, as mentioned before, are placed on a special waiting list for admission within a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>The provision of a separate ophthalmic unit at Sligo General Hospital which will be fully operational next month, should relieve pressure on the Royal Victoria Hospital arising from the North Western area.  Similarly a development of the opthalmic unit at Ardkeen General Hospital, Waterford, recently agreed to, should help as regards the area served by that hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number and location of geriatric units in Dublin; the total number of beds involved; and if he is satisfied that this number meets the geriatric bed requirements of the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars about geriatric assessment and rehabilitation units in Dublin general hospitals were given in my answer to the Deputy's Parliamentary Questions of 17th July, 1973.</P>
      <P>As regards long stay geriatric units for the aged in Dublin provided by public authorities, I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to circulate with the Official Report, details of this accommodation. I believe the accommodation available satisfies reasonably current demands.</P>
      <P>The following are the particulars: St. Brigid's Home, Crooksling, 207 beds; Brú Chaoimhín, 275 beds; St. Clare's, Ballymun, 92 beds; St. Laurence O'Toole Centre (Old Coombe Home), 18 beds; Clonskeagh Fever Hospital, 18 beds; St. Mary's, Phoenix Park, 322 beds; St. James's Hospital, 358 beds; James Connolly Memorial Hospital, 137 beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that doctors are finding it increasingly <Col N="1267" /> difficult to obtain beds for geriatric patients or patients in the older age group who require beds?  Is the Minister aware that such patients are not admitted by virtue of the fact that they are over 65 or 70 years of age?  I should like the Minister to look into this matter in view of the fact that a hospital which was catering for such patients, St. James's, has cleared out the geriatric section of that hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total cost of the choice of doctor scheme to date; the amount by which this cost exceeded the estimated cost; the average number of patient visits to doctors; and when it is expected that a review of the scheme will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The choice of doctor scheme came into operation in the Eastern Health Board area on 1st April, 1972, and was extended to the whole country on 1st October, 1972.  I have taken the figures from the later date as it is only from then that the scheme can be viewed as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The estimated cost for the year ended 30th September last was £9.9 million.  The actual cost is estimated to have been £12.5 million, or £2.6 million more than the original estimate.</P>
    <P>The estimated average number of visits by patients to doctors was 4.3. The domiciliary visiting rate was about 1.2.</P>
    <P>I intend during the present month to communicate with the medical organisations regarding a review of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that school children attending secondary schools are not eligible for free dental services; and if he will arrange for an extension of the school dental services to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the dental services at present available to children attending national schools have been brought to an adequate level, it is not proposed to extend the services to secondary school students.  Continuing steps are being taken by health boards to improve their existing dental services for school children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that some children when attending national schools are scheduled for examination but by virtue of the fact that they have transferred to secondary schools they are not eligible for this treatment?  I should like the Minister to ask the officials of his Department to look into this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I made inquiries yesterday to discover that if there was treatment being given to a boy or a girl going into secondary or vocational school it would continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that children have been moving from primary to post-primary education at a much earlier age than they did ten years ago and that invariably they now move at 12 years of age?  In fact, while one would expect progress in this area there has <Col N="1270" /> been a lack of it in so far as the age group between 12 and 14, who formerly received such treatment at primary schools, no longer get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information. I, like all Deputies in this House, do not regard the dental service provided for school-going children to be adequate but the first priority should be in respect of primary school students.  However, even they are not being fully catered for, due to many reasons.  The main reason is the shortage of dentists. Recently 47 posts were advertised.  Up to this there was not a great response to advertisements for dentists but there may be an improvement now that the marriage bar has gone and women who were not eligible before will now be eligible to fill these posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While primary school children are covered by the school medical service and third level students are covered by medical cards, why is it that those in between, in second level education, are not covered by either and is there any proposal to make some comprehensive provision to fill this apparent gap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is so.  Unfortunately, even those with medical cards in most of the country are not provided with the dental services to which they are entitled for various reasons.  While the fact that they have medical cards entitles them to treatment, for various reasons, including the shortage of doctors, they do not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the middle group is not covered in any respect?  They are not entitled to service by virtue of any legislation or regulation of the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are holders of medical cards, or if their parents are, and the applicants are under 16&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I want to clarify.  Primary school children, whether they can obtain it or not, are entitled to the school medical service.  Those in third level education are entitled in their own right to medical cards.  Second level students, <Col N="1271" /> although their parents may get them, have no particular entitlement in their own right to get medical cards and are covered by no specific regulation, or provision of the Department of Health other than what might come to them through their parents' cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Those at primary level are entitled to dental services.  Those who are under 16 and whose parents have medical cards are entitled to dental service also.  On the third level, students are entitled to medical cards and would also be entitled to dental benefit but, unfortunately, the personnel are not available to provide the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister has intimated that the scarcity of dentists is one of the principal factors responsible for the inadequacy of the dental services to meet health authority requirements, would he urge his colleagues in the Government to reach a favourable decision on the erection of the new dental school and hospital in Cork?</P>

The Minister earlier indicated that in respect of services which were the due entitlement of children attending primary schools&mdash;and, indeed, of those in third level education&mdash;it was not possible to satisfy those because we had not sufficient medical personnel and dentists.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is no processing available to us <Col N="1277" /> in the country for colour films.  The advertising agency which received the contract from my Department had to make the decision whether an Irish director, if employed, would have to go to London to oversee the processing of the film there and see to various other matters.  They were not restricted on what they should do but it was considered by them that the wiser procedure would be to get an English director who would bring over the minimum number of people with him.  In fact, he brought with him an assistant director and one cameraman. The team involved numbered nine.  It was impossible in the time available to me to check whether the other six members were all Irish nationals but all of them are resident here.  All that happened in respect of this non-restricted company who were appointed to handle the very important recruiting compaign is that three non-nationals worked on the film; processing was not available here and that is why the company involved considered it wise to act as they did.  The other six people are resident here.  If I had had the time to find out if each of the six was an Irish national, of course I would have done so for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, as requested by ACRA, he will agree to the subsidisation of mortgage interest rates so that fixed interest rates can be guaranteed at the time of signing of the house purchase contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to mortgage interest on loans advanced by building societies.</P>
      <P>Building societies must pay a competitive rate of interest on investment in order to attract and retain funds for housing purposes.  The interest rate which the societies offer on shares and deposits is reflected in the mortgage interest rate they charge on house purchase loans and for this reason, they must include, and borrowers accept, a variable interest rate clause in the conditions attached to the making of a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the introduction by the Government in May last of a <Col N="1279" /> temporary subvention for building societies shares' and deposits, it has been possible for the societies, in present circumstances, to offer an 8 per cent rate of interest on investment while limiting house purchase loan interest rates to a maximum of 11¼ per cent.  An investment rate of 8 per cent would normally require a mortgage rate of 12½ per cent.  Increases in mortgage rates have, therefore, been effectively limited as a result of the Government's action and it is not proposed to provide for subsidisation on the lines suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says the interest rates have been restricted, what is the reason for the present conflict involving thousands of families?  This has been dragging on for the last few months without any intervention by the Minister.  I call on him now to intervene in the conflict between the members of ACRA and the building societies, to bring both parties together and start negotiations so that some solution can be found to this conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a dispute occurred between certain members of ACRA and certain building societies but I am not aware it is as widespread as Deputy Burke suggests.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy asks a question I expect him to listen to the answer.  In present circumstances if this were allowed to happen borrowers would have to pay 12½ per cent.  The only thing I can see is that certain people are trying to encourage those who have borrowed from building societies to kick up a row under the impression that they may be able to get a higher subsidy from the Government, although ACRA have told me personally they do not want a subsidy.</P>

This price is subject to discount for quantity.  I am not in a position to state the cost of production of dried beet pulp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that so far as Comhlucht Siúicre <Col N="1288" /> Éireann are concerned everything is in order.  The company sell the beet pulp at £16.25 per ton to growers and allow them 1½ cwt for each 1 ton of sugar beet delivered while they sell it to others at a cost of £34.30 per ton.  If a farmer who purchases beet pulp at £16.25 per ton decides to sell it to another farmer at a price much in excess of that figure the sugar company can hardly be blamed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come to the notice of the Department that beet pulp has been sold at prices as high as £56 per ton but, as I have said, the maximum price charged by the sugar company is £34.30 per ton in the case of non-growers while the price charged to contractors is £16.25.  The amount of beet sold this year was 128,000 tons.  The amount sold at the contractual price was 80,000 tons while 48,000 tons were sold at the higher price.</P>
      <P>It is most undesirable that some people should make easy money on the re-sale of beet pulp.  However, my view is that a farmer who contracts to grow beet for the sugar company and who, consequently, qualifies for an allowance of pulp at £16.25 per ton is entitled to sell it at the best price possible.  This is one of the perks of contracting to grow beet for the company.</P>

I am not talking of the farmers but of the non-growers because it is at this level that control is required.  So far as the growers are concerned it is fair enough if they get £34 per ton on their allowance.</P>

The results are now being examined by that office in consultation with my Department so as to determine the most suitable areas in the harbour in which the boring survey should be carried out.  At this stage I am not in a position to say what improvements may eventually be approved for execution at Skerries harbour or when work might be commenced.</P>

      <P>Negotiations under Protocol 22 of the Accession Treaty concerning relations between the Community on the one hand and the Associated African and Malagasy States and the independent developing Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Carribean on the other were inaugurated by a conference in Brussels on 25th and 26th July, 1973. The conference agreed that detailed negotiations between the Community <Col N="1294" /> and the associate and associable states would begin in October, 1973, after a suitable mandate had been approved by the Council of Ministers.  The mandate was adopted by the council at its meeting in Luxembourg on 15th October and the negotiations opened on 17th October.  Because of uncertainty as to the wishes of the negotiating partners certain parts of the mandate were left incomplete, the details to be decided in the light of the attitude of the negotiating partners as revealed in the course of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to anticipate the likely results of the present stage, which has only just begun, of these negotiations.  As soon as this stage has been completed the commission will report back to the council.  The Government will then have the opportunity of considering the progress that has been made and of making such proposals as may seem necessary at the time.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the recent OECD publication drew a blank in respect of all these bodies so far as Ireland was concerned but, as I mentioned to the Deputy, by virtue of membership of Euratom, Ireland is participating in the Dragon project. Since the Deputy represented Ireland at Brussels when Ireland acceded to the European Computer Program Library, he will recall that we are involved there to an extent of about £3,000 per year at the moment and very great benefit is coming to this country by reason of computer information and skills which we are getting. As far as being involved in Eurochemic is concerned, the Deputy can be sure that as we are now, in consequence of a Government decision, proceeding in principle towards the establishment of a nuclear power station we will, of course, become more involved in these organisations.  In the meantime, I should like to emphasise that we have full access to all information which these organisations have at present.  Even though we are not a formal partner we are not a loser.</P>

The 12 in 1973 include the subscriber about whom the Deputy is concerned.  As I have explained in answer to a number of questions on this whole matter, the connection of a number of telephones has been held up as a result of an insufficient capital injection in the past in circumstances into which I have already gone on the Telephone Capital Bill.  I am concerned about the situation in general.

      <P>I am certainly concerned that the people in the valley should receive as good reception as possible, but it is a fact that there are certain areas, including valley areas of this type, where reception at the moment is unsatisfactory. That is the case not just in this valley but in many valleys of similar configuration. This is a general problem and it is a problem that must be dealt with generally.  It is not a fact that people are without television there.  It is a fact that reception is less good than it is in more favoured areas.  We will do what we can to improve reception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the current oil situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is very highly dependent on oil, which accounts for 69 per cent of primary energy sources and 65 per cent of production of electricity by the Electricity Supply Board. In 1972 our total imports of petrol products amounted to 4.8 million tons. Of this total 2.7 million tons were imported in the form of crude oil for refining at Whitegate and all or practically all of this crude oil originated in Arab producing countries.  In addition to refined oil products from the Whitegate refinery we had net imports in 1972 of a further 2.1 million tons approximately.  Fuel oil, which is used principally by the ESB and heavy industry, accounts for almost 50 per cent of our use of oil products and half of this amount or approximately 25 per cent of total oil requirements is used by the ESB.  Gas diesel oil accounts for some 20 per cent of our consumption.  It is used for agricultural tractors, central heating, industry and commercial transport.  The consumption of gas diesel oil has been growing at a very rapid rate, particularly for central heating, and it is one of the oil products which has been in particularly short supply even before the outbreak of the Middle East War. Motor spirit accounts for approximately 15 per cent of our user and demand has been growing in step with the expansion in private motoring. Approximately two-thirds of our <Col N="1309" /> motor spirit are supplied by the Whitegate refinery.</P>
    <P>We do not purchase either crude oil or oil products direct from any of the Arab countries; practically all our requirements are purchased through or from the major oil companies in Britain.  In the present situation therefore we expect to receive supplies at the same level as the British domestic market.  I have made our expectations in this regard plain to the Irish subsidiaries of the major oil companies concerned and I understand from them that this is in fact the position.  There is in any case no official restriction on the export of oil or oil products from Britain to this country.  The precise impact on consuming countries of the cut-back in Arab production is not yet entirely clear.  The oil business is very complex and is integrated internationally on a wide basis; supplies of crude are drawn from both Arab and non-Arab countries by the companies.  The best assessment I have been able to make of the level of supply in this market is that we have up to now been suffering an overall shortfall of something over 15 per cent of our normal requirements. Within the overall level of supply, the position varies between different oil products and even between different companies.  Certain other oils, particularly gas diesel, are and have been in tight supply for some time.  There are also current difficulties about bunkers for ships and jet fuel for aircraft.  I have, however, received reports from the oil importing companies this morning that they expect a substantial deterioration in the supply position in the New Year amounting in some cases to as much as 30 per cent of their current requirements.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the oil crisis our stocks overall amounted to 65 days supply.  There has been some reduction but this downward trend was arrested by the introduction of restrictions on deliveries.  The position of our stocks is kept under close scrutiny together with the level of supply and further restrictions will be imposed if the situation deteriorates further.</P>
    <P>The restrictions in supplies from <Col N="1310" /> abroad required steps to be taken here to conserve supplies.  To deal with this growing scarcity I made orders on 16th November restricting deliveries of oil products on the basis of deliveries in the winter period of last year.  On this basis deliveries of motor spirit have been held for the current quarter to 95 per cent of normal deliveries for commercial users and to 90 per cent of normal deliveries to garages for retail sale.  In the case of other oil products, deliveries for central heating have been held to 90 per cent of normal deliveries and deliveries for commercial and industrial consumers to 95 per cent of normal deliveries.  Provision exists for increasing deliveries in special circumstances.</P>
    <P>Because these restrictions on deliveries for the whole quarter, October/December, came into effect only in the middle of the quarter, they bore very heavily on garages or other consumers who had supplied or used oil products at normal or even higher levels up to that date.  It was necessary to apply the restriction to the whole quarter both for administrative reasons and to ensure that those who had been hoarding supplies or had obtained excessive deliveries would not benefit from them.  I had publicly warned of the need for economy as early as 22nd October and had then indicated that I would ensure that those who hoarded excess stocks would not get the benefit of them. The situation has been difficult for garages because no steps to restrict retail deliveries were really practicable in advance of my order restricting wholesale supplies.  In these circumstances I have informed the oil companies that they may, in their discretion, issue to garages in difficulties up to 5 per cent of their normal winter supplies as an advance against whatever allocation may be set for them in the next quarter.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the arrangements made for other users of oil products in industry and agriculture may I digress for a moment to deal with the question of petrol rationing. The level of supply of motor spirit up to now has been adequate to meet <Col N="1311" /> essential requirements and has not required formal rationing.  The steps taken by the garages themselves in fixing the minimum purchases and making special arrangements for essential users together with the commendable good sense of many motorists have together been adequate to stop panic topping-up and restore some level of normality.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Government decided that our plans should be completed for the formal rationing of petrol in case rationing became unavoidable. Contingency planning for rationing can only be said to be complete when coupons are in the hands of vehicle owners ready to use immediately if the need arises.  As Deputies are aware, arrangements are now in progress to do this.  Advertisements have appeared in the Press giving detailed instructions as to how application should be made for basic allowances.  These allowances will be expressed in terms of &ldquo;units&rdquo; and no decision has been taken as to the value of the &ldquo;unit&rdquo;.  This will be done if and when it is decided to introduce rationing.  The issue of coupons at this stage is a prudent step, which will enable the Government to introduce rationing at short notice.  No decision to do so has yet been arrived at but I will have to examine the situation very closely in the light of the information about the supply situation now coming forward.</P>
    <P>Motor spirit accounts for only 15 per cent of our total imports of oil or oil products.  It is used largely by private motorists and it is relatively irrelevant to the real economic problems which threaten us if cuts of the order now threatened are realised.</P>
    <P>In the case of oil products other than petrol there is already in effect, as a result of my orders restricting deliveries, a <i>de facto</i> scheme of rationing which is being administered in close consultation with the oil companies.  This is possible because the users of these oils are almost always, without exception, supplied direct by the oil companies and deliveries to them can be restricted <Col N="1312" /> in accordance with an allocation system.  The situation is very complicated however in the case of industrial or commercial users.  Because of the growth of the economy requirements of some users may now be far greater than they were and for others the highest priority is essential in the national interest.  For instance the essential requirements for the beet sugar campaign must be met as a first priority.  Broadly the priorities which must be maintained are firstly essential services such as public transport, production of food and other essential goods, and secondly the maintenance of industrial and commercial employment at the highest possible level.</P>
    <P>Essential or priority users in these categories who, after effecting all possible economies cannot maintain their services or production, should take up their difficulties in the first place with their suppliers.  Under the arrangements made between my Department and the oil companies their needs may be investigated and reported to the Department through the Oil Advisory Committee we have established.  It may be necessary at some future date to formalise this system and to establish formal official rationing schemes for certain categories of oil but at the moment these flexible arrangements are more appropriate.  They avoid the rigidities which must attach to any formal official scheme.</P>
    <P>Should, however, the supply position deteriorate seriously in the future, resort would have to be had to formal rationing, despite its drawbacks. It is not possible at this stage to lay down a scale of priorities which would be applied in such an event. Any such scale would depend on a number of factors such as the level of supplies available, the season of the year, the volume of employment provided and the essential nature of the end product manufactured or transported. The maintenance of employment and production would, of course, have a very high priority in all supply situations.  The present system is quite effective to meet the present difficulties and it has the advantage that by contact with users' requirements through the oil companies <Col N="1313" /> very useful information is being built up in my Department which would be enormously helpful in dealing with any tighter situation which might develop in the future.</P>
    <P>The ESB have stocks of oil to meet their requirements for about 70 days and are therefore in a relatively good position for the present; but their prospects for future supply are uncertain and the need for economy applies to the use of electricity as to all other forms of energy.  The ESB are drawing up provisional plans for rationing in case it should prove necessary but, as in the case of petrol rationing, it would be far better to avoid formal rationing of electricity if that can be done.  The ESB have in recent months been forced by outages of plant and industrial disputes to resort to selective load shedding and reductions in voltage.  No such measures have been in force since the beginning of the month: such measures are of an emergency nature and would not normally be used to ration consumption.</P>
    <P>Town gas, which used to be produced entirely from coal, has for some years past been made from oil. The main feedstock for the gas companies is naphtha which has been in tight supply throughout Europe for some time past.  The maintenance of supplies of gas for home and industry must receive a high priority but there is the greatest need for the utmost economy in the use of gas, particularly for central heating.</P>
    <P>Liquid petroleum gas, commonly know as bottled gas, which is used for industrial and commercial purposes, accounts for some 2 per cent of our consumption of oil products.  About half of our requirements is imported and half produced at Whitegate. Storage is limited and there are no official restrictions on supply.  Propane which is the particular form used for industrial purposes is in particularly short supply.</P>
    <P>To meet essential social, industrial and commercial needs we must make every endeavour to conserve our restricted supplies of oil and oil products. There is practically no one in the country who cannot help towards <Col N="1314" /> this end in some practical way.  We are all users of energy and by the standards of our fathers, let alone our forefathers, we are profligate users of energy; and a great deal of this energy is used for convenience, even for luxury, rather than by necessity. Because almost 70 per cent of our total energy depends on oil, reduction of the use of energy in almost any form helps to conserve the use of oil. It should be possible to make substantial savings in central heating not only in homes but in hotels and offices, and other places of work as well.  The thermostat can be set four or five degrees lower; the hours of heating can be restricted; all lamps need not be lit at all times; weaker bulbs may be adequate.  There are innumerable ways in which savings can be made in the home as illustrated in the regular advertisements now published by my Department.  Similarly it should be possible for industry and commerce to make real savings.  Many of their practices may be wasteful in energy though up to now financially justified; but we are now moving into a dear energy economy and the economics of such practices may be sound no longer.  All industrial and commercial users of energy should scrutinise and rethink the pattern of their consumption.  Not only convenience but jobs may depend upon it.</P>
    <P>In appealing for economy by all, and indeed I would now recommend it as a most practical form of patriotism, I do not wish to create panic or unnecessary fears.  The present level of supply could in the short term be tolerated both by individuals and by the economy without serious hardship.  But the most recent reports of a further cut-back by the Arab countries may make a further reduction in the level of supplies inevitable. As the situation clarifies I shall have to consider what further reductions in deliveries may be necessary. We would be foolish to expect an early end to severe restrictions on supplies of oil.  Moreover, though oil may come back into unrestricted supply at some date in the future, there will never be cheap oil again.  We, in common with other countries in the west, have come to take cheap energy for granted and it has been in large measure the basis for <Col N="1315" /> much of our industrial development. The future will be somewhat different, though I do not think that anyone is in a position to forecast now how the new situation will affect growth or development either in Ireland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we should maintain the closest watch on the trend of events and foresee the possible effects on our economy and provide as far as possible against them.  The Government have decided to set up a broadly based consultative committee to advise during the present critical situation in relation to measures which may be necessary in the future.  I am in consultation with my colleagues about the precise membership and functions of this body and I hope to be able to make an announcement shortly.  In the meantime, a small inter-departmental committee has been set up and is engaged in developing a methodology to monitor and forecast the effects of the shortages in the different sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>I would finally conclude by reiterating, as I hope to reiterate in coming weeks, my appeal to all to conserve fuel to the utmost whether it be in the form of petrol, heating oil, electricity or gas.  They are all part of the common fund of energy on which we rely to maintain our economy and the welfare of our people.  No measure of economy that anyone can practise is too little.  Every light switched off, every unoccupied room left unheated, every car left at home in favour of public transport is a worthwhile effort in this case.  The Government are determined to take all steps necessary to maintain essential services and employment at the highest possible level but they can successfully do so only if they continue to receive the full and generous help of the public in securing every possible economy.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, I should say that that speech was largely prepared over the weekend up to last night and since then, as Deputies may gather from the second paragraph, page 2, further information has come to my notice that presents an even grimmer picture.  I should like to bring to the notice of Deputies that this morning <Col N="1316" /> I received an intimation from the oil companies in this country that to the best of their knowledge supplies of energy from January on will be down by 30 per cent.  I have not been able to get a firm confirmation of that from England or European countries but, if this is so, it would be impossible to exaggerate the effect that this would have on our economy in terms of growth, employment and the very standard of living that we have been enjoying up to now.  Our whole economy, the growth in our economy, has been based, of course, on energy that is supplied as to 70 per cent by oil and if that is reduced, then everybody here and I hope everybody outside will realise the effects this could have on employment and on growth.</P>
    <P>The situation is extremely serious. The Government have up to now taken the right steps in handling it. If it becomes worse, of course, we will have to ration petrol.  As I have said, petrol is only 15 per cent of our consumption of oil and it will be very unimportant whether private cars are on the road at all or not, not to mind petrol rationing.  If the situation worsens, then of course we will have to ration petrol.  That is not the important thing.  Many people do not realise that you cannot switch the petrol saved by rationing into running an industry.  There is a special type of oil needed for that and this is the one we must endeavour to use as sparingly as possible.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, as I have said a number of times since I first started talking about this two months ago, it is essential as the most practical form of patriotism in the immediate future, whatever about the long term&mdash;we will have to devise plans for long-term supply of energy because all growth is based on the availability of energy &mdash;if we are to maintain the level of employment at the moment and the standard of living that we have, that every single person in the country cuts down their use of energy to the minimum, whatever source it comes from, be it electricity, gas or oil.  It may be necessary that in the New <Col N="1317" /> Year, if this voluntary restriction on the use of energy is not complied with by the people, they will be compulsorily restricted.  We will do this if we have to but we will do it primarily to maintain the fullest number of people in employment.  This is the prime concern of the Government at the moment, to ensure that people continue in their employment and that our standard of living is maintained at its present level.</P>
    <P>I must continue to warn about the effect of this situation which is changing rapidly from day to day.  It is very serious at the moment.  If the news that I had this morning and which I have just given to the House is true of a 30 per cent reduction, then it could become extremely serious and there could be a diminution in the growth of the economy and some unemployment in the New Year.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we start now and that everybody agrees to cut back the use of energy from now on.  This situation will not just pass away.  This is not a cloud that will disappear when the winter is over and we turn off the central heating.  We are facing a period in the economy of the western world when energy will not only be scarce but extremely dear.  We can never again look forward to a position where petrol or oil products will be available at the prices we have been accustomed to and which we have come to expect.  We complained when there was a minimal price increase but never again shall we see petrol and oil available anywhere in the western world at the prices at which it has been available in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation for the country and it is extremely important that we should all realise that everybody's efforts are required.  We can get over it with the minimum damage to the economy but we can only do that with the co-operation, help and full understanding of the Deputies and the public that the situation is serious and warrants our closest attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>When we requested this debate last week we were of <Col N="1318" /> opinion from the information available to us and what we were able to believe from reports on the oil situation that we were slowly heading for a very serious crisis in this country.  The Minister's statement has confirmed our fears and for that reason alone it is well to have this debate and also in order to highlight the seriousness of the situation to all the people and exhort them to do all they can to restrict the use of oil and oil products.</P>
      <P>It will be argued that an Opposition has a responsibility to support the Government in a crisis situation.  This is true, but it can also be said that an Opposition has a responsibility to awaken the country to what is happening and to the dangers that exist.  In July, 1973, the Minister replied to questions from Deputy Timmons and said that at that time reserves amounted to approximately 100 days' supply.  He may have been taking those reserves at a period when oil was not being used as extensively as recently when he spoke of lesser reserves, and indicated that we would have reserves sufficient for 45, 50 or even 60 days.  That is very different from what we were told in July.  We note, also, that these figures include the finished product from a doomsday reserve which we are supposed to have at Whiddy Island. This is a reserve of crude oil only.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that we use approximately 5,000,000 tons of oil and of this 2.5 million tons are imported in the from of crude oil.  The other 2.5 million tons are imported as a finished product.  When the Minister speaks of reserves we would like him to clarify whether he is including in these reserve figures the reserves of bodies such as the ESB, CIE or the Sugar Company.  Do these reserve figures include the reserve of private companies such as Cement-Roadstone, Guinness and other big concerns?  We should have this information so that we would know our exact reserve position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The daily headlines have concentrated very much on the chaos at the filling stations, particularly in the Dublin area, but as the Minister said, cars absorb only 15 per cent of our <Col N="1319" /> total fuel.  However, as he said, there are far wider implications which appear to be about to bring our economy down to a very low level at present.  These are the aspects of the situation that need most serious consideration. We would have to get on without cars if that situation came about and I am sure the people would be able to overcome this difficulty, although it could be a tremendous hardship.  In order to maintain employment and level production I believe we would be prepared to do this.</P>
    <P>The fact that other countries are suffering as we are, particularly in western Europe, is not necessarily an acceptable explanation from our point of view.  There are west European countries which are not suffering nearly as much as we are.  We face difficulties under various headings that many of these countries do not have.  If we take the supply problem first we see that we have a great weakness compared with other EEC countries.  We can provide only 50 per cent of our total oil needs: the other 2½ million tons must be imported as a finished product.  We now realise that we have only very limited storage capacity in Dublin, which is the principal area of consumption and which is responsible, I understand, for about 60-65 per cent of our total consumption.  This creates a very serious problem and this lack of storage is something we should consider immediately and try to remedy. Until we have ample storage we cannot hope to have reserves.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the proposed Nuclear Energy Commission and the setting up of a nuclear plant will help but not until the eighties, a considerable time away now.  We must think about what we can do immediately to combat a trend over which we have no control but which was precipitated by the Arab countries.  Even though we are told that we are regarded as a friendly nation we certainly are not being treated as a friendly nation in respect of the cuts in our oil supply at present.  It is not possible, either, to separate the supply difficulties and cost difficulties because, as the Minister <Col N="1320" /> said, costs will go up and up and we shall never again have cheap oil. Cost will be a very serious factor in our supplies in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I understand we have been getting the 2½ million tons of finished product through the usual oil distributors, the big companies such as Texaco, Esso, Shell and so on.  They have been supplying us only with the surplus from British oil refineries, as far as I know. If this is the case under normal conditions this will surely be a very valuable surplus to the oil companies now.  While these people would like to maintain good relations with this country in regard to distribution, and so on, they have a very definite eye on profits each year; nobody is ignorant of the way big oil companies operate throughout the world and profits are their main concern.  If this surplus, which we were buying in order to meet half our oil needs, now goes on the open market at higher prices we may not be able to compete for it or to buy it.  We have no guarantee from these people that they will continue to let us have this surplus and we must take that factor into consideration.</P>
    <P>These people may express the view that they would like to keep up the supply but the profit factor will come into the matter.  As the Minister has said the economic implications for us are frightening.  The Minister for Labour said during the weekend that it may affect our whole economic situation but this was the first indication we got from the Government. Having regard to the deterioration in the oil supply position it was obvious that this would happen.  As far as I know, 95 per cent of our oil originates in the Arab countries who are imposing their embargo on the oil consuming world, particularly on Western Europe.</P>
    <P>The electricity supply will be very seriously affected.  If the ESB are successful in obtaining sufficient quantities of fuel oil to maintain supply, the fact must be faced that the cost of electricity will increase enormously.  The ESB get a certain percentage of their present needs from Russia but I understand that in the contracts they have signed for the oil there are escalating clauses that take account of the prevailing <Col N="1321" /> price of oil at any time during the contract period.  Thus, if the price of oil from the Arab States and elsewhere is increased, the cost of Russian oil will increase also for the ESB.  I would ask the Minister to give us some idea of how much the ESB costs will increase&mdash;will it be £5 million or £10 million?</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly stressed that industry is all-important.  What industries will be affected to a greater extent than others?  Obvious ones that come to mind are the Irish Glass Bottle Company and the Waterford Glass Company; indeed, any industry connected with the manufacture of glass will suffer severely.  I understand that if even 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the supply is cut they may not be able to make their products because a certain amount of oil is required to make bottles and if the amount is reduced it is not possible to manufacture the product.  It is unfortunate that the glass industry is so totally dependent on oil but that is unavoidable now.  The plastic industry will also be in trouble.  For instance, Wavin Pipes and tyre manufacturers will be adversely affected.  I understand it takes five gallons of crude oil to make a tyre.</P>
    <P>These are obvious industries that will be affected but to some extent all our industries are dependent on oil.  In addition, the increased costs will affect our balance of payments and exports.  Every feature of our industrial and economic life will be seriously affected by the shortage of oil as well as by the increased prices we are bound to have in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Drivers and domestic users of oil will also be affected.  Many towns have been built in rural areas principally because transport was readily available to workers to take them to their work.  Whether it was outside Cork or Dublin, people have tended to live outside the city and to travel to the centre to their places of work.  All these people will be under a serious handicap.  It is no use thinking CIE will be able to bridge the gap because with the shortage of oil that will affect them and the increased costs <Col N="1322" /> they will not have a hope of catering for the increased traffic throughout the country.  They are not equipped to do this.  If there was a complete cut in petrol consumption for private cars tomorrow there would be utter chaos. The Government will have to give serious thought to this aspect.  Housing will also be in trouble because many houses and flats are totally dependent on central heating, whether oil or electricity, and have no fireplaces.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is one industry that must be catered for as favourably as possible.  Having regard to the economic crisis we will face, agriculture will be the only industry we have that will help us to overcome this crisis. We must maximise agricultural production to the highest level in order to keep some semblance of sanity in our balance of payments position and our general economic growth in the coming months.  I would ask the Minister to give very serious thought to the important industry of agriculture when considering the oil situation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that rationing must come.  The people can do a lot, as the Minister has said, and I am sure they will rise to the occasion as they have done in the past.  However, such measures will certainly not remedy the crisis situation we are facing.  The first and most important thing is to try to increase our storage and we must face this fact.  The only way it can be done is to prevail on the oil companies to co-operate with the Government in building the necessary storage tanks to store more oil and thus build up our reserves as soon as possible to a level that will keep our industries going for a longer period than that already mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the mid- or long-term the most obvious method is to build oil refineries because it is the only sure way of having supplies of oil for future needs.  The example that comes to mind immediately in this matter is France.  That country is completely independent of the present oil crisis as far as I am aware.  That is my information but the Minister for Industry and Commerce may contradict it.  The reason France is independent is that they have a 100 per cent <Col N="1323" /> State-owned company and another company that is 80 per cent State-owned. The two principles on which the French oil supply is based are: (1) the source of supply and (2) its capacity to refine that supply.  These oil companies, which are practically fully State owned, have secured sources, some of them in the Arab countries&mdash;Libya and Saudi Arabia&mdash; and some in Nigeria and other west African countries.  They have been able to maintain the flow of crude oil to their refineries.  They have the capacity to refine it and at the moment they seem to be the one nation not facing a serious problem. Britain is probably facing a more serious problem than ourselves.  With their serious economic situation announced over the last few weeks and with the oil crisis adding to that, Britain will probably be the worst hit of all.  Here are we depending on the surplus we get from those refineries.</P>
    <P>We must set out to build oil refineries. Where we build them is another question, but build them we must. They should be sited in the most economic places possible for the purpose of distribution in order to cut down costs.  When attempts were made before to build oil refineries all sorts of organisations&mdash;I am not denigrating any of them&mdash;such as An Taisce went out and kicked up a hell of a row about pollution, about the environment and so forth.  We will be in a far worse state if this crisis develops and goes on developing.  Is it not important to secure a supply of oil, even with some slight harm to the environment or some slight pollution? A study was done by a state agency on one of the proposed oil refineries and they came up with the opinion that the amount of pollution or damage that would be done to the environment was negligible.  We must face up to the fact that we must have a modern, properly run, oil refinery which will be capable of supplying our needs, refining as a finished product the 2½ million tons of crude oil which we have now to import.  The sooner we have those facilities the better and more secure will our economy be.  We <Col N="1324" /> should set about establishing such a refinery immediately, even though it might be two or three years before it becomes functional.  People seem to run every time they hear of an oil refinery nowadays but I should like to quote from a report issued by the OECD Oil Committee in 1973.  This was a group set up to study the oil needs of the member countries.  At paragraph 163 it recommended:</P>
    <P>When an area is dependent upon outside sources of supply for oil it is on economic grounds preferable to import this supply in the form of crude oil for refining in the area itself.  Costs of transport are lower for crude oil compared to equivalent amounts of petroleum products. In some consuming countries refineries are demanded for reasons of regional or industrial policies, or for the profits available in this downstream activity.  Moreover, there would appear to be more security in supply in imports of crude than in imports of products. A loss of a crude source can be made up more easily under today's market than can the loss of a product source.</P>
    <P>Finally, crude oil is considered less expensive to import (in terms of foreign exchange) than the equivalent in products, and for this reason, crude imports are more attractive for balance of payments reasons.  OECD Europe has substantially moved towards self-sufficiency in refining capacity. Within the past two decades the relative reliance of OECD Europe on imports of petroleum products has declined from 37 per cent of total supply in 1950 to about 5 per cent in 1970.  Inasmuch as demand for products has roughly tripled during that time, this has meant that refining capacity has been established at an even greater rate.</P>
    <P>I have quoted that to back up my argument that the only real solution to the oil problem is to set about building ourselves an oil refinery which will be adequate to refine the 50 per cent of our oil requirements which are now being imported as the finished product.  The Government <Col N="1325" /> should tackle this seriously as of now. I hope they will, for the sake of our economy.</P>
    <P>For the immediate future it is very difficult to decide on the best way to fill the gap.  The Minister might tease out the possibility of buying oil from other places.  There was an announcement at the weekend that the President of Romania, who is now visiting America, offered to sell oil to the United States.  It might be well to make some contact with Romania to see whether it is possible to buy oil from them.  I understand he was talking about the finished product.  If this could be made available to us at present it would help to tide us over our present emergency.  I understand it is very good quality oil.  It might be worth our while too from the point of view of cost because they would be exporting it from Constanza and the Black Sea through the Mediterranean and it would not have to come around the Cape in large tankers as much as our crude oil must do.  I would ask the Minister, in view of that statement, to investigate whether they would have oil to sell to us.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's concern and I endorse everything he said in asking the people to do everything humanly possible to conserve our oil supplies so that we may at least be able to protect our essential and vital industries, our industrial and agricultural life and other essential services. As in the past during emergencies and rationing periods, I am sure the nation will be fully prepared to pull up its socks, to tighten the belt and to comply with the Minister's exhortations to do everything possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a poor member of a very poor Opposition who would attempt to make political capital out of the position in which the Minister finds himself now.  On this, the first occasion on which I have spoken on any matter connected directly with the Department of Transport and Power, I wish to extend to the Minister my best wishes for him in his Office and also to offer him my <Col N="1326" /> sympathy in the predicament in which he is placed as a result of the oil crisis.</P>
      <P>I intend speaking only for about 15 minutes but during that time I hope to put forward a couple of random thoughts that may be of assistance to the Minister.  I would ask him to bear with me while, in the course of my comments, I make a plea in respect of sections of the community distinct from those to which Deputy Barrett, who has spoken at length and with greater knowledge than I, has referred.</P>
      <P>In viewing the situation as of now one travelling into the centre of the city sees several double-decker buses carrying only half their capacity and many motor cars travelling towards the city centre carrying, perhaps, only one passenger.  No doubt one would find also that the compartments on trains are not full to capacity either while motor cars carrying only one or two passengers travel long distances. Taking these factors into consideration we must have regard to what could happen early next year.  In this context I wonder whether the Minister could consider offering free bus transport to the people of Dublin and free train transport to those who travel long distances.  This idea may sound somewhat revolutionary but unless the problem is tackled now in some such way we may find that in 12 months' time the buses, trains and motor cars will be lying idle.  Justification for a free transport service such as I have mentioned could be offered to the erstwhile motorists of Dublin on the grounds that these people have already paid substantial tax in respect of their cars but they will not be able to derive from their cars the service to which they would be entitled normally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps after the Minister has considered this proposal he may be in a position to indicate the difficulties that would arise from its implementation but it is an area where I believe some saving could be made.  On the question of a saving, those of us who listen to the radio in the mornings learn of the areas of the city where roadworks are taking place and where, consequently, there are serious <Col N="1327" /> traffic problems and we all know that the delays caused by these problems result in an increased consumption of petrol and oil.  Perhaps the Minister might have discussions with the trade unions concerned so as to ascertain whether these roadworks might be undertaken from 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening onwards.  There is adequate public lighting on the main streets and having regard to the hardship that would be circumvented by carrying out the work during the hours I have suggested trade unions might accept in respect of the workers they represent that it would be better for these workers to tolerate the hardships that would accrue from working unusual hours rather than to have a situation in which they would have no opportunity of working.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, that the situation in regard to heavy lorries, such as those carrying cattle, may be reviewed and that an appeal may be made to the people concerned to arrange for the lorries to travel, in so far as possible, at certain times when it might be arranged that the roads would be open to them only during those hours.</P>
    <P>So far as the railways are concerned we now see the folly of having accepted that the steam engine was required no longer.  While outside Rome last year I was pleased to note that the Italians had not been as foolish as us and that they had retained their steam engines.  Perhaps ours are in cold storage here.  If so, to reactivate them would be a means of conserving our supplies of oil which are steadily being exhausted.</P>
    <P>Regarding oil for heating purposes, some of us are lucky enough to have fireplaces in addition to having central heating and, therefore, I would not have any great sympathy for anyone in that position.  However, there are areas in this city&mdash;I am thinking particularly of Ballymun&mdash; where people are depending entirely for heating on central heating.  Therefore, we should not regard central heating as a luxury in such circumstances. We can appeal to these people to reduce their heating, and no <Col N="1328" /> doubt they will be happy to respond, but we must accept that heating is as essential to those people as is fuel to keep the wheels of industry turning. This will be especially true in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>Again, perhaps the Minister in his consideration of the allocation of whatever resources we have or we anticipate having, might spare a special thought for the people of the Gaeltacht or those who would be described as living in the more backward areas, who might be accepted as being dependent to a far greater degree on the supply of oil than people living in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Another area in which it might be possible to effect some economies is our schools.  I might say in passing that I am not at all enamoured with the situation which often obtains where children are reporting to schools and are being told that, because of a shortage or an absence of oil supply, no school will be held on that day.  In city areas this can create major problems because both parents may have already gone to work and the children return home to locked houses and there is no one to supervise them until late afternoon. School authorities should be asked to give an early indication of whether they have a supply.  If they anticipate that schools will not be operative because they have not got a supply, word should be sent to the parents at least 24 hours before.</P>
    <P>With regard to transportation in the mornings, I wonder whether the schools might be asked to make a contribution by changing the starting time.  In the morning when people are going to their places of employment children are in the same queues, as they are entitled to be, waiting to be brought to school. Perhaps this situation could be helped by making the starting time half an hour later.  This would encourage people who are using cars to leave them at home and travel by bus.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the ESB, notwithstanding serious opposition and criticism at the time, on their foresight and tenacity in staying with the Turlough Hill project.  It was claimed that because of the ready supply of oil, and because of the fact that 50 to 60 per cent of power came from oil, <Col N="1329" /> hydro-electric power was obsolete and was not worth the effort or the investment. The present unfortunate position indicates, <i>inter alia</i>, that the foresight of the ESB who stayed with the Turlough Hill project was justified.  I hope the Minister gets all the support and guidance he requires at the moment.  I would also wish him oil but I am afraid my wish could not give it to him.  I have no criticism of his handling of the situation to date.</P>
    <P>There is one trivial matter which, perhaps, I should not even mention. There were days last week when motorists in Dublin were not in sympathy with the Minister when he told them there was plenty of oil.  In the few days that have elapsed they have had evidence that what the Minister was saying was absolutely correct. Because of the manner in which people were panicking the emergency was arising.  He indicated to them what the position was but they were reluctant to accept it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all about the serious position which exists in relation to the whole question of power.  I want no flippant remark here from in front or behind me.  I am not talking about political power.  I trust the Minister will have the assistance and co-operation of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tease out a little the aspects of the current power crisis and the current oil crisis, particularly in relation to the area of my own responsibility, and particularly in relation to industry.  I do not intend to deal with the matters of supply which have been and will be dealt with by others.  I want to deal more with the matter of energy usage and its effect on the economy than the matter of securing energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say first that this is a profoundly serious situation in which we find ourselves.  The most recent round in the fighting between Israel and the adjoining Arab states took most countries in the world as much by surprise as it took the Israelis.  It has created a new situation, a situation of a quite profoundly new kind.  Having set the scene in that <Col N="1330" /> way, perhaps, this is the appropriate moment for me to indicate that I think the speeches from the other side of the House are examples of a responsible and serious attitude to a profoundly serious problem.  For me that is a matter of pleasure, and for all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The events of October created a profoundly new situation in the world.  If we look at the economies of the free market world since the late 40s we see a period of almost uninterrupted growth&mdash;with one little hiccough in the middle 50s&mdash;speaking of the economies as a whole.  There was already evidence from the beginning of this year that that long period of growth&mdash;indeed longer than either the optimists or pessimists had predicted&mdash;if not ending permanently was at least turning down.  That evidence existed before the oil crisis started in October.  We have a shortage of energy and particularly a shortage of oil coming at a time when already by the late summer the Japanese economy, which had been the economic wonder of the world in a sense for a decade or more, was already slowing and a number of other major economies also.</P>
      <P>We had the circumstance that not the Minister for Transport and Power, not any Member of this House, not any person anywhere could indicate exactly what the oil and energy perspectives for Europe are at this time. One of the key components of the present crisis is the uncertainty, the unpredictability; nobody can know whether there will be a rapid conclusion of peace between Israel and the Arab states, which, I think, is something everyone profoundly wishes, and therefore a resolution of the crisis of energy supply or whether, indeed, at the opposite end of the spectrum of awfulness there will be a further outcome of fighting.  It is impossible to tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, perhaps, well that I remind the House that on the 6th November of this year the Foreign Ministers of the Nine made a very important statement, a unanimous statement of those <Col N="1331" /> Foreign Ministers, reiterating the conditions in which they would wish to see peace.  Indeed, this resolution of the Nine was very much in line with the pre-existing position of the Irish Government over a long period and that is a policy that anti-dates the formation of this Government by a considerable time.  We had always been upholders of the now famous Resolution 242 of the United Nations and this, in a sense, was a reiteration of 242, this November 6th statement of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine, indicating the basis on which we would wish to see a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>The point I am making in this context is not to reiterate our foreign policy position, about which I think there is very general agreement, but to indicate that it is impossible at this moment to predict with certainty whether the shortage of oil will remain approximately the same, or rapidly deteriorate, or the difficulty will rapidly resolve itself.  It is a period of great uncertainty.  We had the circumstance of a certain economic down-turn anyway which was taking place in the world economy.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect relevant to the development of our economy which has not been referred to, and, indeed, if there was even an example of the interdependence of economies, this is it, because no country of the Nine or no country of the world, of the free trading market economy world, will escape this if others suffer severely.  None can survive alone.  If I disagree a little with Deputy Barrett in regard to France it is because, though I agree with the general tenor of what he said about France, the French will, though less than others, feel not just the direct oil shortage, which they will feel a little, but will feel very severely the indirect repercussions on other economies of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>This is not a situation which any nation can survive individually because of the interpenetration of economies.  The circumstance is that, with the increase in the price of oil, the Arab countries will become, over a short period, a period of months, the <Col N="1332" /> possessors of much of the reserves which Europe and the United States now hold.  They will become the possessors.  The extrapolation from this year to next year is a growth of almost three times the current reserves they hold over 12 months and they possess the power to move those reserves around the world.  They do not simply possess an oil weapon, which they do possess and which they are wielding effectively, but they possess a currency reserve as well which, in the long term, is an even more powerful weapon.  This is another factor in the whole situation.</P>
    <P>If we tease out the matter of prices, the energy input goes into every product, be it wheat&mdash;there is an energy input both by fertilisers and by tractor fuel&mdash;be it plastics, not just for fabricating them but actually making the raw material, be it any industrial or agricultural product, there is an energy input in it; if you, therefore, have a rapid increase in the price of oil&mdash;I could say, in parentheses, that even if the volume of supply returns to the pre-crisis level, the price will never go back down and that sudden input from the increase of energy cost into the end price of a whole range of products is inescapable and is potentially very socially destructive. It is coming at a time of very severe inflation, world wide, and it is coming on top of that.  It is, I think, fair to say that that is an evolution which none of the pundits, whether they were energy economists or politicians, or whatever they were, were thinking of at the beginning of October of this year.  It is a new factor in the whole prices spiral and it is a serious one.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if his Department have made any study at all of alternative sources of energy and could he tell us how long the transition will take from oil to that alternative energy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with that later on but only in so far as it involves my Department.  Much of it will be the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power, who will be replying to the debate.  It is a serious question.  I will deal with my section <Col N="1333" /> of it later on.  We could, of course, tease out the effects of this increase in cost and, more seriously, of the diminution of oil, of energy of all kinds, because energy is interchangeable. If you have a shortage of oil you have a greater demand for other energy sources and then they go into short supply as well.  All energy has to be considered globally.  Deputy Barrett dealt with this in his speech, with the effect of whole sectors of industry and, when one looks, one finds that, in fact, there is no sector of industry unaffected, some more acutely than others obviously, and this presents, particularly to my own Department and to the Government as a whole, the responsibility of quantifying need, sector by sector in a very precise way.  Deputy Barrett gave the example of glass.  If you do not keep the heat up and the stuff cools your manufacture is done for.  They must have 100 per cent.  There are others who can have diminishing proportions of their requirements and a very careful analysis of the way you move around the available energy resource to keep industry maximised in its function needs detailed study and the mechanism for that detailed study has, indeed, been set up, is beginning to function, and more details of that will be given to the House at a later stage.  The point to make about the immediate effect on industry is that there is no unaffected sector and it requires very detailed and delicate planning to see that, if you do not have enough, you share what you have got absolutely to optimise its value in terms of keeping production going.</P>
      <P>Again, it is easy to tease out the effects in a superficial way in regard to agriculture, but the detailed teasing out of those effects is a matter for careful study.  This also is in course of being lifted off because it is not just a matter of energy for machinery; it is also a matter that fertilisers are, one might say, congealed energy in a sense. They are largely produced, currently, from oil sources.  That applies also to so many of the fine chemicals now essential for the efficient functioning of agriculture to a high yield.  The ramifications there are also enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another particular concern of my <Col N="1334" /> Department is the matter of the formation of new industry because clearly many industries, while they will not abolish a project, will just decide to pause for a while because there is no point in going ahead and building a plant for which extra new energy will not be available.  This naturally presents very serious matters for re-thinking and it is, indeed, a cloud over the remarkable industrial growth that had been achieved in job creation, volume production and exports in the recent past.</P>
    <P>One can go on then, to the social effects in the matter of electricity and gas not just from the point of view of availability but also from the point of view of cost.  These are matters that are being looked at with the greatest vigour because we need detailed planning against the contingency we all hope will never arise, but the only prudent policy of the Government is to take the path that it may arise and that we must be fore-armed with detailed investigation and with ranges of contingency plans.  Our attitude as a Government&mdash;it is, I think, the attitude of the Opposition&mdash;is not an attitude of panic.  That is not the attitude of the House.  Neither is it the attitude of the people.  That is not the style of the country, of this House or of the Government.  It is not an attitude of panic.  We have seen a little indiscipline in the matter of petrol supplies which, I think, is now waning. In general, we have been calm and realistic.  We are in the course of assessing the scale, the magnitude, the possible danger, but we are doing it in a disciplined, calm, mature and responsible way.  I think that can be fairly said for the nation as a whole and for the whole of this House.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the people as a whole, through this forum, that our view of it is that it poses a very serious potential threat to our whole economic and social well-being of a profound kind.  This is not to create panic.  We are, indeed, far from panic. There are real perspectives.  I emphasised at the beginning the uncertainty, the impossibility of predicting what supplies will look like in three months time and what the economy will look like in five or six months time.  Nobody <Col N="1335" /> can claim to have the wisdom to make a blueprint and say &ldquo;It will be like this&rdquo; or &ldquo;It will be like that&rdquo;. What one can do, and what prudent Government requires, is the most detailed planning based on the most detailed investigation and that is being done.</P>
    <P>Speakers from this side of the House and from the Opposition have made practical suggestions.  At a time like this we have need of all the wit and talent of the country.  I know from my Department and other Departments that we will not reject sensible and practical suggestions on the basis that they come from a responsible Opposition. Rather the contrary.  We want the input of the talent of the whole country at a time like this.  We welcome it.  We welcome it in the sense that it has already been given in this debate.  We hope for a resolution of the energy crisis.  We need to plan, as we have started to do, in detail for the immediate situation.  I do not propose to invade the area of responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power but some parts of it are industrial matters.</P>
    <P>The whole question of energy policy, if I use it in its most global sense, involves the whole of our society.  We will never be profligate with fossil fuels, whether oil or other fuels, again in the world's history in the way in which we were up to very recently.  That time will never come again.  Possibly, in the long-term, we will see it as the beginning of the wisdom in the way in which we use the earth's resources forced on us by a crisis but producing a good result.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we have an energy policy which breaks into three sectors.  One is the sort of immediate response to a crisis situation in regard to the availability of the energy, in regard to its allocation and the minimising of its use, that is the detailed planning which is going on at this time.  Secondly, we have a middle level which would comprise, for example, the building of refineries and extra storage space to which Deputy Barrett and others referred.  In the long-term <Col N="1336" /> we have the fundamental provision of energy, the rapid exhaustion of the world's supplies of fossil energy and the research and industrial building of facilities, such as the recent decision about a nuclear power station which will make mankind in general, and this island in particular, independent of fossil fuels over the period of a few decades.  Apart from their shortage they will become important as the basis or the synthesis of new material rather than as things you burn for energy.  There is a growing recognition, a worldwide recognition of a need for a detailed energy policy with three layers, short, middle and long. Certain aspects of that are being actively pursued.  This is an area in which a great deal more national thought and effort by scientists, as well as politicians and administrators, is necessary, pretty briskly in the near future to get a current energy policy.</P>
    <P>It is fair that we look frankly at the dangers of the present situation. This is the right place to do it so that the people as a whole can be aware of our thoughts and minds.  It is fair also that we put this crisis into the context of the world.  This was unforeseen, not just by us but by almost everyone.  It has come very rapidly.  The Japanese economy, which is so intensely dependent on imported oil, is in much more difficult circumstances than ours.  This is a world-wide phenomenon, and its effect is world-wide.  Even if we could get all the oil we wanted, there would still be grave repercussions on our economy because we are a country building more and more on exports. If demand in Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom turn down, this will have grave repercussions on our economy.  Even if we had all the oil we could use, we would not have all the orders we could use.  As I have said, this is a world-wide crisis and one which no one country can solve alone.  When I say &ldquo;solve&rdquo;, one can either react courageously, vigorously and with foresight or one can fail to react.  One cannot solve it alone.  Its solution is international.  It shows the inter-relationship and interdependence of many economies much more <Col N="1337" /> acutely than anything in the last quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>It is fair that we tell the people about the dangers, not guaranteeing that they will arrive but profoundly hoping that they will not arrive, facing them squarely and talking about them.  It is obligatory that we indicate the direction of our thoughts in regard to planning, countermeasures, the use of all our ingenuity and national discipline, and I think it is fair to use the word &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; to call on a response from the people if it becomes necessary&mdash;and we hope it will not&mdash;in a very disciplined way to minimise these risks.</P>
    <P>A debate like this, approached in the way in which it has been approached by all sides, is profoundly useful and is an opportunity for those of us not directly responsible, as is the Minister for Transport and Power, with the supply of oil, to tease out the effects on the economy and indicate the direction of our thoughts.  I wish to express my gratitude, and the Government's gratitude, for the seriousness, calmness and responsibility with which this serious situation has been faced.  I emphasise again that this is a serious situation which may never materialise.  The only prudent course is to plan, to work out details and to have ready all the counter-measures on the basis that the less desirable or advantageous options will materialise.  This is the only way to approach it.  It is the way we are approaching it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking this debate very seriously.  Anybody who has listened to the speeches by the two Ministers will realise that we are facing a very grim situation.  We accept our role as Opposition in a responsible manner and will offer our advice.  Any criticism we make will be constructive rather than personal. The other speakers covered a very wide field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is aware of the implications of the oil shortage.  Once again it is a case of a small nation being tossed around in the waves of international politics and our economy being almost shipwrecked.  The Minister <Col N="1338" /> for Industry and Commerce spoke about the great economic growth which had been made throughout the world.  The more economic growth which took place the more dependent we became on oil and electricity.  Then came the oil crisis.  The Arab-Israeli war was the cause of this trouble.  We seem to have got completely caught up in it. We are depending on the oil companies for our requirements which they are purchasing through Great Britain.  Is there any fear that at any time in the near future the British Government can say that they will freeze the oil assets and we will be out in the cold?  Oil has been freely available in the last few years and the present situation was not foreseen. The Minister and his advisers should be on the alert lest there might be a loophole whereby any country, such as Britain, could freeze oil supplies coming to this country.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Arab-Israeli war it must be remembered that this nation is playing a big part in trying to preserve the ceasefire.  Our troops are in the Middle East.  Yet this country is suffering from a lack of oil from Arab countries.  The Minister has not indicated that he is seeking oil other than through the traditional channels.  Deputy Barrett has suggested Romania as a country with which the United States are trying to make a deal.  Would there be any point now in our making contact with Arab countries as a country that is a member of the United Nations and that has troops in the Middle East, doing a service to these people?  We should not go cap in hand.  We should make a direct request to some of these Arab nations that they should intercede on our behalf.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that the Arab-Israeli war is the cause of all our troubles.  I pose the question: would the present situation have arisen in any event?  Are the Arab countries involved so rich that they do not require the royalties from oil?  They have invested money all over the world, in the sterling area and in the dollar area.  Articles have been published suggesting that it would be <Col N="1339" /> better for the Arabs to leave the oil in the ground for 40 years when it would command a higher price.  The sources of oil are not inexhaustible.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful if the oil supplies are as plentiful as they were in the past. Certainly oil will never again be as cheap as it has been.  I recall what Herr Willi Brandt said to the Germans: &ldquo;This winter we will be cold but we will not be hungry.&rdquo;  Are there any implications in that in regard to the future world economy? I hope not.</P>
    <P>There is one criticism I have to make which I hope is constructive.  In an addendum to his speech the Minister said that he had got news this morning that there would be a cut-back of 30 per cent of oil supplies in the month of January.  Then he said that he had not had firm confirmation of that as yet.  If six or seven hours can elapse before such a statement can be confirmed or otherwise, something should be done about that. In the present situation six or seven hours represents a great deal of time. It might be a matter of having enough oil to keep going or not having enough oil.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would like to state what the attitude of the EEC is. It might be more prudent not to state what that attitude is.  What is the attitude of the Foreign Ministers of the Council in regard to the present position?  Will the nine member states stand together and help one another? I do not know what the position is. There are people who say that it may be more prudent not to mention what their attitude is, for many reasons, but I should like the Minister to refer to it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, quite rightly, that agriculture and industry must be kept going and must get priority.  In a situation such as exists at present, where there is a shortfall of oil, a decision has to be made as to how best to use the available supply; should oil be rationed or should the present system be allowed to continue? Employment must be maintained and industry and agriculture must be kept going as a matter of top priority.  All <Col N="1340" /> Deputies subscribe to that view.  There are many of us here who could do with a little less motoring.  If there is any further cut-back in oil supplies the private motoring section would be the people who would feel the pinch first.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, when one considers the position one realises all the effects it will have.  In regard to agriculture, the supply of fertilisers will be affected.  The responsible Minister should consider that aspect of the matter and ensure that supplies will be available.  He should also consider the method of distribution.</P>
    <P>There will be a scarcity of petroleum products and plastics of various kinds.  The supply of alkaline will be very limited next year.  All these matters must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House must express our views, personal or otherwise, as to what should be done and what should not be done.  There is one way in which petrol could be spared. In built-up urban areas it is customary to see long traffic jams.  The Minister for Transport and Power should contact the Minister for Local Government and the Garda Síochána with a view to eliminating these traffic jams. It may be suggested that these traffic jams are caused by the volume of traffic but the traffic jams that I refer to are the result of water schemes and sewerage schemes being left unfinished and road works being carried out. Very often road work is left unfinished over the winter months and is resumed in the next financial year.  The Minister should advise the Minister for Local Government that such works should be finished as quickly as possible. The money should be provided, where necessary.  The various local authorities should be instructed to see to it that the work is done.  I have no doubt that there would be a ready response from them.  The Minister for Local Government should instruct local authorities to see to it that hazards of the kind I have mentioned which cause traffic jams should be eliminated immediately.  I have no doubt that the money will be readily available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> There are many areas in which the Minister will consider restricting oil supplies.  However, the school transport system should be maintained and should get a high priority.  If the school transport service is reduced parents will be tempted to drive their children to school, with a consequent waste of petrol.  If necessary, the school week could be shortened by one day.  There could be discussions with the INTO, managers' associations and the Department of Education in regard to lengthening the school day by an hour or two and having Friday or Monday a free day.  This would result in saving of petrol in the school transport service. I should like the Department to take note of my suggestions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to central heating.  There is central heating which is necessary and there is central heating which is a luxury.  Any effort the Minister makes to determine what central heating is necessary and should get an adequate supply of oil will get the full support of this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he had established an oil advisory committee.  I take this to be a committee to which complaints can be made.  Many people are complaining, for many reasons.  It is only right that there should be a committee where complaints could be heard.  Complaints come in the main from persons starting up an industry who find that they cannot get a supply of oil to satisfy their needs.  They should be able to contact somebody who would be able to issue an instruction that they should be supplied and who will see to it that they will get a supply.  In the agricultural sector young farmers starting on their own have to seek a supply of diesel oil for their tractors.  Some are successful, some are not.  I have given cases to the Minister already.  It is a good thing that this committee should be established for the benefit of these people.</P>
    <P>There are some people who seem to have a very strong grievance, people who are a long time in business, but who in October, 1972, did not use their usual supply of oil.  The present allocation is based on what was used in October, 1972.  There was <Col N="1342" /> one firm which had its own supply of oil but the machinery went completely out of order.  I had another case of a firm that was on strike at that time and as a result were not using their normal quota of oil.  I have no doubt the Minister will be able to satisfy those people and, perhaps, refer back to a period a short time previously when they were in full production.  These are the general complaints we meet.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly gave much advice to people as we saw in the papers about turning off lights and lowering the heat and so on but we in this House, and the Government especially, will have to set a very good example.  My information is that the Minister himself has changed his mode of transport and I compliment him on that.  H now travels by rail to his home and that is a good example which other Government members should follow.  A deputation which I accompanied last week were not very complimentary because they were in a room here which they felt was overheated. If there is to be a general cutdown on heating in Government offices the same regulations should apply in Leinster House.  The example should begin here where we are exhorting people to economise.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether oil becomes plentiful or not, it will never again be as cheap: it will be very dear.  I suppose the day has gone when taxing various oils will be a method of getting revenue to balance the budget. There are certain cases in which, if the price goes very high and there is a tax included, it will raise the cost of living.  If the Minister introduces rationing, he will have no difficulty in sorting out such cases so as to see that they get tax-free oil.  I am sure he will bear that in mind when the time comes.  I think there is no doubt that the future will show that rationing will have to be introduced.  I suppose the Minister does not want to be first in the field in rationing oil, petrol, diesel oil, gas and so on, but in a situation like this we must consider what is the fairest system.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that there is a general reduction of 10, 15 or 20 per <Col N="1343" /> cent but we are depending on the various distributors, the wholesalers and retailers, to allocate supplies fairly.  This will be done probably in about 80 per cent of cases but the other 20 per cent of people do not seem to care what they do.  I know of various garages where petrol is freely available on condition you buy other goods.  I know where you can fill your tank if you buy £2 or £3 worth of groceries.  That is most unfair.  I have proof of it.  There are such cases, perhaps less than 20 per cent, and they are giving the present system a bad name.  The only way of getting around this, I suppose, is to introduce general oil rationing.  When you have your coupon you will get full value whether you are rich or poor.</P>
    <P>We know we are facing a grim future.  We know that when oil becomes plentiful it will never again be as cheap as it was.  In the past we often had to tighten our belts and it is likely that we shall have to do so again in the future.  It will be some time before we shall have the nuclear energy station.  I suppose other forms of heating will become popular again. In my constituency there is a very big bog in one place and at present there is a big queue for an allocation of turf, briquettes and so on.  May I ask the Minister to ensure that this fuel will not also become scarce and ensure that the less-well-off members of the community who have open fires&mdash;many of them have no central heating or electricity which will be very dear&mdash;will have sufficient turf briquettes available and that the supply which appears adequate at present but which in time will not be adequate for our needs, will not be gobbled up by the better-off members of the community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have nothing but the utmost sympathy for the Minister in his present predicament and in the predicament, indeed, of the country. Through the weeks he has made several pleas to the people about economising and has assured them that if everybody behaves responsibly supplies will be almost adequate for all.  But many of the people we are now asking to cooperate are under a misapprehension. If we could fault the Minister in anything it might be that he has not succeeded in communicating to those people exactly what the position is. Many people find it hard to understand that while we have a 10 per cent cut in our oil allocation, and allowing for the increased usage, the effective cut is 17 per cent or 20 per cent, yet in my own area I know garages that have suffered a 40 per cent cut.  People are asking why this is happening.  This leads to a certain amount of suspicion. I think it is imperative that the Minister in his concluding speech re-affirm exactly what the position is in total.  I should like to hear from him, first, how many days' oil supply we have in stock.  That is very important.  Precisely what cuts have occurred in our landed supplies?  He might also try to indicate, even though I know it will not be easy, what the cut will be for January, February and, perhaps, March.  He may not be able to do that.  If he can make that kind of forecast it will show his <i>bona fides</i> in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most insidious kind of whispering campaign I have been listening to in the last few weeks is that the oil companies are deliberately hoarding their stocks in the certain knowledge that there will be an increase in prices from which they will benefit massively. The Minister should reassure the people this is not the case.  I do not believe it is the case but I am not sufficiently <Col N="1345" /><i>au fait</i> with how the oil companies are controlled by the Department, how knowledgeable the Department are about imports or the actual stocks held.  I presume the Department have the exact figures but the Minister should give an assurance to the people on this matter.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, it is at a time like this that we ask our people for a display of practical patriotism but this is not easy to achieve if people are under certain delusions.  It behoves the Minister to speak in the clearest possible way, to tell us that no such hoarding is going on, as has been alleged by some people.  If he does this he will be going a long way towards getting the cooperation of the people.</P>
    <P>From the start I believed a system of rationing was far preferable to the queuing, to the underhand dealings Deputy Meaney outlined, and to the kind of blackmail that has occurred in some cases.  Of course there are people who will suffer as a result of rationing but in a time of crisis everyone will suffer to some extent.  The Minister is taking the right steps in ensuring that at least we can put a rationing system into operation quickly.  Of course, it is another story how the system will operate.  I had intended pointing out the chronic shortage of diesel oil but everyone seems to be aware of it.  I was surprised last Saturday to be visited by 11 people, all of them begging me to get them diesel oil.  In my constituency an industrialist cannot get enough diesel oil to put his lorries on the road.  Obviously that position is not peculiar to my area; it is on a national scale, probably on a worldwide scale at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an important job to assure the people about the exact position and about the <i>bona fides</i> of all those involved in the present oil situation.  He has been talking continuously about this matter for the past few weeks but much of what he has said is not getting through.  The queues at the petrol pumps are a typical example of that.  Another <Col N="1346" /> allegation being made is that the petrol companies are supplying non-tied stations with a view to wooing them in the future to stock their brand of petrol.  I do not know if this is going on or on how wide a scale, but if this practice is going on it should be stamped out immediately.</P>
    <P>We are going to ask our people to make sacrifices and I know they will be prepared to make them.  However, if the present crisis continues the future will be bleak.  Unfortunately we will have unemployment, inflation, a reduction in our exports, a balance of payments problem and all the disadvantages associated with a slowed-down economy.  That is why it is so important that we plan now for the future.  We must call on the reservoir of brains and talent available to look for alternative sources of energy. Deputy Barrett referred to extra storage space and more refineries. That is a valid point but we are still involved with oil and the same thing can happen at any time in relation to the Middle East situation, the area from which our supplies come.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned turf. Can the Minister tell us the present position in relation to Bord na Móna? What kind of reserves or energy are left in the bogs?  If there are such reserves how best can we capitalise on them?  The Minister might contact the Minister for Local Government and try to insist that from now on a certain type of house is built &mdash; I mean the type that will use the energy generated by itself and the occupants of the house.  I am assured by experts that is now possible.</P>
    <P>Insulating is another way we can save much energy.  We are faced with a crisis situation but now is the time to ensure that this situation will not recur.  If there is an oil crisis in the world we must make certain we are in a position to meet it and to overcome it.</P>
    <P>With my colleagues I sympathise with the Government on the position in which they find themselves.  We know this is no time to make political capital out of a situation like this. <Col N="1347" /> The Minister can be certain of the fullest possible support from this side of the House in our present difficulties.</P>

      <P>As this debate proceeds the value of the request made by the Opposition last week for the debate has been provided by the seriousness with which the various speakers have treated the oil crisis. The value of the debate was particularly emphasised when it elicited from the Minister the information that he was informed this morning of a 30 per cent reduction.  In his statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have, however, received reports from the oil importing countries this morning that they expect a substantial deterioration in the supply position in the New Year amounting in some cases to as much as 30 per cent of their current requirements.</P>
      <P>If this is to be the case, as they say in another House on the other side of the Atlantic &ldquo;all previous statements are inoperative&rdquo; and the previous exhortations of the Minister to the people have to be reinforced and doubly reinforced to make sure that oil supplies are conserved and that there is no wastage of our present resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nation is facing an economic crisis with repercussions for all sectors of the economy.  This, following the statement of the Minister concerning the 30 per cent reduction in the New Year, is without doubt.  Previous speakers on this side have spoken about the national situation, about conserving supplies, about the possibility of other sources of supply, about the erection of oil refineries and other such subjects.  I want to bring the mind of the Minister to the problems facing one constituency and this is probably typical of the whole country.  I would bring him on a short tour of the constituency of North County Dublin and the problems facing my constituents there.  There is there the glasshouse industry, the <Col N="1348" /> horticultural industry, the fishing industry, Dublin Airport and Ballymun with houses and apartments that have no source of heating other than oil and gas.</P>
    <P>In the case of the glasshouse industry the Minister and the country must be aware that one night's frost, when a glasshouse owner is without supplies, is sufficient to destroy the family income for at least 12 months.  I must press the Minister strongly to take action to guarantee continuity of oil supplies for the horticultural industry in North County Dublin and in the country.  I feel particularly strongly on this question. The principal areas involved in this industry in my constituency are Rush, Lusk, Skerries and Balbriggan.  It is a family business.  It gives employment to the sons and daughters in a family as well as to the father.  There is no use in the Minister's saying they can have 90 per cent of their supply if for one night a glasshouse owner is left without supply.  There is no use in giving him 90 per cent, the following morning, of what he got last year. He must have his supply day after day.  He can never be left without oil during the winter period.  The Minister should make some reference to the horticultural industry when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to jet fuel for aircraft and the fact that there are current difficulties.  In Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and the Associated companies at Dublin Airport there are approximately 6,500 people employed. In the tourist industry the figure, directly and indirectly, runs into many thousands more than that.  The case for the provision of jet fuel to Aer Lingus and to charter operators using Dublin Airport to bring in tourists is self-evident.  Without adequate supplies of jet fuel, Aer Lingus cannot operate.  They have a complete jet fleet now and they are strangled without adequate supplies.  They must have guaranteed supplies.  It is no use to plan a flight a week ahead of schedule.  They must plan months and months ahead of schedule.  The Minister is well aware of the problem <Col N="1349" /> facing Aer Lingus.  I know he has it under review.  I would like him to make a very special case of the situation of Aer Lingus and the staff employed at Dublin Airport and at the other airports.  The largest number of staff is at Dublin Airport which is in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is also a problem industry because trawlers use diesel and without supplies they cannot go to sea.  If that happens the Dublin market and the rest of the country will have a problem in regard to fish supplies and there will be the problem of unemployment in the industry. The fishermen, because of the expansion of the industry over the last number of years, have invested large sums of money in new boats. For them to keep up the repayments to the financial institutions from which they got the money, they must keep at sea.  Without adequate fuel supplies, they cannot do this.  The fishing industry is something to which the Minister will have to give particular attention.</P>
    <P>I come now to the problem of central heating oil and a case that will bring it home to the mind of the Minister is the situation in Ballymun. In Ballymun there are no fireplaces in the flats or houses.  I would ask the Minister to conjure up a picture of somebody living in a 12 or 13 storey apartment with five or six children and no heating.  It is typical of the newly developing housing areas in the city and county of Dublin.  Many houses are being built without fireplaces.  The necessity for supplying heating oil is evident and I am sure the Minister will give it special consideration.</P>
    <P>There are other industries in North County Dublin.  Wavin Pipes, one of the fastest growing industries in my constituency is based in Balbriggan. They make pipes, the raw material for which is plastic.  Without oil supplies, the raw material for this industry is not available and there is consequent unemployment.  Apart from oil supplies to keep their motors and electricity going, the necessary raw materials would not be available.  No doubt the Minister knows of many similar cases but the ones I have mentioned <Col N="1350" /> are deserving of special attention.</P>
    <P>Everybody who has spoken this evening has expressed concern about the effect that this crisis will have on our economy.  Undoubtedly, the situation is very serious and this fact has been highlighted by the Minister's statement today concerning the 30 per cent reduction.  The Minister must do all in his power to clarify as soon as possible the question of whether this reduction is to be put into effect or, if not, to clarify what will be the situation after Christmas.  The people should be made aware as soon as possible whether this reduction will take place so that their sense of patriotism may be brought to bear on the situation. Our people have never let this country down in a time of difficulty and they will not do so on this occasion either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other speakers I share the concern of the Minister and the Government in regard to the present serious situation.  It is not my intention to speak on this matter for very long but there are a couple of items which I would ask the Minister to examine. The last speaker referred to the fishing industry and this is a matter with which I am particularly concerned. While appreciating the seriousness of the problem regarding the supply of diesel oil I would point out that fishing is different from many other industries in that it is seasonal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, for example, the herring fishing season is in full swing at Dunmore East.  This is probably the most important season for the fishermen because it is from herring fishing that they derive the greater part of their income.  People who are using diesel for heating purposes have been told that they may obtain 90 per cent of the supply they got during the previous year and this is to apply also to fishermen. However, if a fishermen must leave, say, Killybegs and go to Galway or Dunmore East or to some other place around the cost, he will find that a supply will not be made available to him at a port at which he has not fished previously.  Fishermen would be very happy if they could be guaranteed <Col N="1351" /> a supply of oil during the herring fishing season and they might be prepared to work on a 50 per cent or lower ration at other times of the year. I do not know whether some such body as An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have apprised the Minister of the present situation but I am bringing it to his attention now in the hope that he will give it very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Last week I raised, by way of Parliamentary Question, the matter of people returning from England to spend their Christmas holidays in Ireland.  I had already been in touch with the B &amp; I and had been informed that between now and 5th January there are approximately 3,000 cars booked for the car ferry service.  Many of these people return because their families are still living here and for many of them, too, the Christmas period is their annual holiday.  I realise that it is not easy for the Minister to guarantee supplies for them but perhaps either in his reply or by way of a public announcement he would appeal to suppliers to endeavour to help any such persons so that they may be facilitated in so far as possible while they are at home.  It is hardly necessary for me to mention the benefit that accrues to the economy as a result of the home-coming of our people from England.  If you were to ask any business person in the west what were his periods of greatest business you would be told that the August holiday period is first in that sense and that the Christmas period is the next best. Therefore, it is very important to try to facilitate our tourists from the point of view also of the business community.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, too, the Minister may tell us whether there is any possibility of extending our own resources.  I refer, in particular, to turf.  The services of the power stations, such as the one at Bellacorick in north Mayo, might be expanded to some extent.  The present situation brings us to the realisation of how foolish we may have been in not paying more attention to our own resources during the past number of years and in allowing ourselves to become so dependent on oil.  We, on this side of the House, will endeavour in every way possible to assist the Minister <Col N="1352" /> and the Government in dealing with this very serious situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have promised to speak for not longer than two minutes so that Deputy de Valera may have an opportunity of contributing to the debate in the time left to us.  In this short time I shall make my speech by way of putting points to the Minister and the first point that occurs to me is that during the recent apparent panic on the part of many motorists, despite the Minister's warning that there was no need for any such panic, there were some very bad examples of citizenship.  There were many instances of motorists who were storing petrol and we heard of cases where tanks overflowed after only about 25p worth of petrol had been put in.  Because of the long queues at garages during that panic-buying period there were many doctors who were unable to obtain petrol supplies and I know of one instance in which a doctor left his car, in which there was a gallon of petrol, at home and went by public transport to the hospital where he worked so that he might conserve his small supply for use in the event of an emergency call.  Something should be done very quickly to ensure that doctors do not have to queue for petrol.</P>
      <P>Recently I saw in an edition of Time magazine&mdash;and it seems to be borne out by the Minister's statement today&mdash;that anyone who says there is not a difficult time ahead, or that the fuel situation will be all right in the months ahead, has his head in the sand.  I believe that is so.  I hope I am wrong but I believe the situation will get worse.  We must be fully prepared for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce reminded me about the Nine EEC countries.  It is very important that the EEC countries should stick together.  If there is a free-for-all, all hell will break loose and no one will get anywhere fast.  It is terribly important that the EEC countries should honour the part of the Treaty of Rome which refers to the pooling of oil resources in time of shortage. The attitude of Britain and France <Col N="1353" /> towards Holland has been shameful. If we have any honour at all we should honour that treaty.  Our representatives at the meeting of the Heads of State later this month should see to it that we stick together.</P>
    <P>While we are dependent on Britain for imports I should like the Minister to tell me do we export crude oil to Britain.  If we do, this gives us a weapon.  During the second world war &mdash;I am open to correction on this but I believe I am right&mdash;when we had contracts with Britain for supplies of tea from Mincing Lane we were let down badly.  If we have an answering weapon we are all right.  When many countries are in difficulties they tend to forget their agreements with others.</P>
    <P>It is very important to realise that many people use central heating not only for heating the house but also for heating water.  We should bear this in mind.  It is also important that the oil companies should keep their customers well informed on the latest situation.  If we are to be cut down to 90 per cent or 80 per cent or 75 per cent, we must know when to order.  There is unnecessary delay in deliveries.  If somebody with a week's supply orders oil and it takes three weeks to arrive, that is no good to him.  The oil companies should let their customers know how many days notice they want.  Then there will be no panic.  Running out of fuel during the winter causes panic.  The oil companies must play their part.</P>
    <P>I am sure that when the Minister is introducing the coupons, if they are to be introduced, they will not be issued to anybody who does not present a current tax disc or registration book.  The last thing we want is a racket.  Everybody who gets coupons must be a motorist.  We must ensure immediately that doctors have a supply of petrol.  I have made my points and I will not delay the House any longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I am grateful to Deputy Briscoe for cutting short what he had to say to let me in.  The first point is that there is more to this than a passing phase.  This has been emphasised by the Minister and by practically every speaker.  I should like to follow up something said by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This crisis, of its nature, is a manifestation of something broader that has been going on in the world.  In a sense it is a question of conservation.  It is a combination of all the major things that have been bothering humanity: conservation of resources, conservation of the environment, inflation and prodigality generally by humanity in disposing of the goods available to it.</P>
      <P>To summarise what I gathered the Minister for Industry and Commerce was saying the oil crisis stems not only from the political events of recent times but also from economic financial and political sources all working together.  There is a genuine limit to the availability of the oil resources of the world which has been worrying people for a long time. Sooner or later humanity has to face restricted supplies of oil eventually available.</P>
      <P>Next, there are the complications brought in by inflation which has two effects to which I can refer only briefly now.  I should like to have developed the point a little more if time permitted.  One is the financial disbalance which results in the amount of money flowing to the oil owning nations to which the Minister referred, and the other is a very natural desire on their part to cope with inflation.  Inflation meant a depreciation of values and money as a store of value was not at all able to compete with oil in the ground as a store of value.  Lastly there were the political factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you have a combination of things like that it is futile to hope that the problems will pass.  Therefore, while agreeing with the Minister, I should like to make a few very general suggestions.  The Government should look at this whole problem on a broader basis than merely the basis <Col N="1355" /> that energy is running short.  Assuredly the Minister for Industry and Commerce is right in pointing to the fundamental nature of energy in industry and in economic activity generally.  It is fundamental but the disruption which will follow from a shortage of energy will not be completely catered for by a mere rationing of the energy available.  It will entail a fairly large element of reorganisation of the whole community to adjust itself to the new situation.</P>
    <P>If I may, from this side of the House, I should like to emphasise what the Minister's colleague said.  I hope the Minister does not feel that I am, so to speak, down-grading the importance of his function or that of his Department.  I am not.  He is the spearhead.  He is the commander who has to fire the first shot.  He must solve this problem.  There is a broader basis here which needs looking at. Before mentioning the broader base, on the Minister's own line I want to make one short point and I hope the Minister will interrupt me if I go over my time.</P>
    <P>Up to this economically nothing could compete with oil in the matter of power generation.  That situation has now changed.  Naturally people talk about nuclear energy but it may be, so to speak, a little bit of escapism to concentrate on that.  Mankind will have to fall back on it, but it will take time and it has its problems. Could I suggest to the Minister again that a survey of the power available in the wind be again carried out and re-assessed?</P>
    <P>Even the schemes which are so grossly demanding on capital and which are not very likely to be economic, like tidal power stations&mdash; we have practically exhausted our hydro-electric and other sources&mdash; should these not be examined in the new context, even getting down to such possible small solutions as local wind units for local purposes where practicable?  Before rural electrification the wind charger was a common enough thing in certain parts of the country.  I understand wind chargers in the past gave some little service.  I <Col N="1356" /> do not suggest they would solve the Minister's problem but, on the broader aspect, it might be worthwhile examining again the potential of the wind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher mentioned fishing. There are other vitally important things.  Time does not permit me to develop to the full the line of thought I should have liked to develop here and I come now to my final point, and something more definite in the context of the broader aspect.  It is time the Government started thinking of some co-ordinating ministry for the whole economy.  During the war years in the emergency here we had a Ministry of Supply under the late Deputy Seán Lemass, a former Taoiseach, who brought us successfully through that wartime emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy de Valera did not come in earlier and did not have a chance to develop to the full his point about the broader implications of this crisis for the whole economy.  Apart from what he said, there are other implications.  As Deputies have said, it is easy to be wise after the event.  How none of us saw, in the last 15 years, the way in which we were putting our heads into the oil lion's mouth is something I cannot understand.  Neither can I understand how we continued so blindly increasing our dependence on this mineral as a source of energy.  I suppose we were whistling past the graveyard.  Oil was the cheapest form of energy we could get and there seemed to be an unlimited supply.  It was, of course being pushed hard by the oil companies as a cheap form of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> The ESB have been preaching for years, and certainly since I came into office about the necessity of finding an alternative.  Their reliance on oil as a source of energy manufacture was causing them intense worry and they were very anxious to get a decision from the Government on the nuclear energy station.  I shall come back to this later.  That will not be available for eight years at the very minimum and the cost of a nuclear energy station in the light of the present price of oil will go up.  Up to a few months ago it was not economic to produce electricity from turf, certainly not as economic as it was to produce it from oil, but that position has now changed.</P>
    <P>The world is now trying to move away from oil for electricity and the only place they can go is to nuclear energy.  It is the only other known source.  It may well be that competition for nuclear energy stations will drive up the cost of them and we are in a very confused and very dangerous situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out today the possible dangerous effects not alone for us but for the whole world because the economies of the whole world are interlocked. The price of oil will go up and up.  This will affect our balance of payments.  If the economies of other countries to which we export are affected they will cease to import the goods we manufacture and our balance of payments will again be affected to a marked degree.  We shall have to cut down on our exports.  That will change our standard of living.  The chain of events will follow right through.  The 30 per cent I spoke of this afternoon, the news of which I got this morning, is a serious cutback in the energy supply of this country.  We are at the moment probably operating an 8 or 9 per cent growth, and a 10 per cent cut in that, about 17, 18 or 19 per cent&mdash;it is impossible to quantify it&mdash;and a further increase of 50 per cent on that could bring us up to 30 per cent in January and that, if it comes, will be very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>But we must remember that all these things are happening&mdash;this is why I would not like to create panic &mdash;in the background of a summit <Col N="1358" /> conference of European heads of Government this week and of a peace conference between the Arab and Israeli States next week.  They may have no bearing.  The shortage may come anyway, but this is the background, and it may be that there will be an effort to influence the atmosphere in which these conferences are being held.  I have no doubt that the major time of the heads of Government meeting in Europe will be taken up with the oil crisis and the oil situation and the means they should adopt collectively to solve it.  We are one of the Nine and we will be equally affected.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, Japan, the wonder child of the post-war world economy, is now finding itself subject to ordinary economic diseases which affect all countries placing too much reliance on an imported product at a cheap price, a product which could be cut off at any time by someone in another country.  We have all exposed ourselves to this and we will all now have to pay the price.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is a lesson in this for all of us.  In future years we may look back with horror, but we may well say to ourselves: &ldquo;Is it not a good thing that we learned this lesson when we were only 70 per cent and not 90 per cent dependent on oil&rdquo;?  The style of life which has evolved in the western world over the last 15 or 20 years was an affluent style with people wanting everything. Perhaps the style is based not so much on real affluence as on the external accoutrements of affluence.  Very few of the parents of the Members of this House knew a centrally heated house. Perhaps we all do now.  Many of our parents had not even one motor car. Some of us have two.  How many of our parents went on holidays using jet aircraft?  Every Member of this House has been abroad at some time.  These are things we take for granted, but they are not the most important things in life.  They make life very comfortable, but they are not the most important things.  The important things are a roof over one's head, a job and the means of heating one's self and one's family.  It will be the concern of the Government to see that as many <Col N="1359" /> people as possible have a roof over their heads, a job and the means of heating themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Deputies on the other side for the responsible attitude they have taken in this debate.  No Minister likes to come in here and preach doom, telling of the dark things around the corner, advising that we must tighten our belts, knuckle down to hard work, with no play: but a member of a Government would not be responsible if he did not explain fully the situation as it is and try to show where it may lead, but he can do that without engendering panic and bringing about an even worse situation.  I believe this Government have behaved in a responsible way and I believe Opposition Deputies realise that.  Their contributions have been very helpful and I hope that what they said will be heeded by the people generally.  They have shown clearly that when it comes to tackling what is a national problem in an international situation all Members are united in the measures that can and must be taken.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the points which have been raised by various speakers.  Deputy Barrett referred to questions I answered in the Dáil.  The question I answered on that occasion related to the total stocks of fuel in the country at a time when the fuel stock was high.  They are now down to 60 days.  They include CIE and the ESB but do not include Cement and Roadstone or other big private companies. He also said that there were countries in western Europe which were not suffering as much as we are. He probably alluded to France and the provisions of the French oil refineries. This was answered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Outside France every other country is in the same position.  The Italian Government sought to impose rationing by increasing the price of petrol to 60p or 12/- a gallon.  The banning of Sunday driving has not been effective in cutting down motoring because the trip to the supermarket or to the country was merely transferred to either Monday or Saturday.  The same <Col N="1360" /> amount of motoring was done.  In England the speed limit was reduced to 50 miles per hour.  This Government are considering this measure and we may bring it in here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also spoke of our securing supplies from the oil companies in Great Britain.  As I have said on a number of occasions I wrote to all the oil companies ten days or a fortnight ago asking them to ensure with their parent companies that we would get the same percentage of supplies or that our cut-back would not be greater than the cut-back in the British domestic markets.  I have no doubt that that will be so.  Deputy Briscoe related the position to the time of the war when tea supplies to this country were cut off.  That was the position then.  That was the wartime situation.  This is different.  We were not both in Europe then.  I have no doubt that their promises will be honoured.  I will keep a careful eye on the situation.  If the situation is worse here than in England I will take the matter up with the oil companies and their parent companies in Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to the medium-term solutions we have taken to increase storage, oil refineries and diversification of supplies.  I agree with him.  We will have to take these measures to ensure that there will be an increased amount of oil available. Oil refineries depend on crude oil. The problem at the moment is that the Arab countries have reduced their production of crude oil.  No matter how many oil refineries we have, if we have not the crude oil to feed into the refineries, the position would be just as bad.  There is a merit there because each oil refinery would carry a certain proportion of space to be used as storage.  There are a number of applications before the Minister for Local Government for the building of oil refineries.  I expect a decision on them at an early date. The Government are concerned to see that if, in the future, this position arose again, we would have some more padding to protect us from the vagaries of other countries' markets. We will be looking at the erection of oil refineries.  This will be more <Col N="1361" /> benign now than it was in the past. Their location will be important. Modern oil refineries are not as dirty as some people think.  Certainly some of the old ones were extremely dirty. If modern refineries are properly landscaped and the sites chosen carefully they cannot be as environmentally offensive as the old type were.</P>
    <P>As regards oil from other sources we will look at this subject in the future.  At the moment, 100 per cent of our supplies come through the oil companies.  We have to stick with that.  Maybe we should diversify in the future.  There is no point at the moment in seeking other supplies. For one reason, we do not have the refining capacity.  The only refinery in this country is at Whitegate, County Cork.  It was working at 100 per cent and it is now cut back to 85 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked if we are exporting crude oil.  We are exporting fuel oil in small quantities from the Cork refinery.  Crude oil comes in giant tankers to the oil terminal and is re-exported to various other refineries in Europe.  In that sense we are exporting crude oil but in the real sense we are not.  It never finds its way into our oil supply and is merely a transit point for the rest of Europe.  The erection of oil refineries would probably be of benefit in the long term but in the short term the erection of a refinery which would take two to three years, could not be of any use to us at the moment.</P>
    <P>A few speakers referred to the oil companies diverting supplies from us on to the open market because it would be more lucrative.  This came up in the Dáil last week.  The companies have not the supplies to divert anywhere. They are very short of supplies. No company like to be cut back on the amount of business they are doing. They would like to be selling the same amount of oil as they were earlier this year.  They do not like the position any more than anybody else.  There is no evidence that they are using the present situation for an increase in price.  In fact, the quantity of petrol they have went down sligthly last week. There is no evidence that they are hoarding oil and waiting for the price <Col N="1362" /> to go up so that they can get an increased margin.  There is in some countries what is called &ldquo;participation oil&rdquo; that is, where some Governments insist on having a stake with the oil companies in the well, in the oil field from which it is being produced.  They retain 5, 10 or 15 per cent which they are free to sell anywhere.  There is a reasonable quantity of oil in tankers on offer around the world by middlemen. The price is sometimes five, seven or ten times as dear as it was six weeks ago.  This is rationing of a severe kind. If the ESB had to pay five times the present price for oil this would have an effect on the consumers inasmuch as they would have to cut down on the use of electricity because they could not afford to pay for it.  The ESB are getting some of their supplies from Russia. They are negotiating for a further supply in the New Year but certainly not at five times the price.  It will be up in price considerably and this will have an effect on the price of electricity. The housewife should be warned of this.  If we buy oil at five times the present price and manufacture electricity from it, then there will be an effect right through the economy because from the smallest house to the largest industry, electricity plays some everyday part.  This would be affected by an increase by five times in the price of oil.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked about the increased costs to the ESB.  It is impossible to say as yet what these will be because the ESB are negotiating for a new oil deal.  Again I can say, as I can say about the petrol, the price will be up. That is the only thing you can be quite sure of.  The prophecies in regard to the supply situation next year may be wrong.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have said, we hope they are wrong.  One thing we will not be wrong about is the price we will pay for it and the effect this will have on our economy.  It will increase our costs; it will reduce our competitiveness; it will interfere with our growth. We must bear this in mind.  Without a scarcity at all the price will affect our economic position next year and we should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney spoke about free <Col N="1363" /> transport in the city of Dublin&mdash;I am sure he will pardon me for saying so&mdash;as if the rest of the country had no problems.  Unfortunately I found a fortnight ago when I was talking in the House about panic buying of petrol that it was referred to as if it were confined to the city of Dublin. People seem to forget that there is a whole rural area outside of Dublin which must be catered for also.  Free transport might be effective in persuading people to use their cars less but the same effect can be obtained by people voluntarily giving up their cars and using the public transport which is there now.  In this regard the taxation of cars was referred to in regard to the issue of petrol coupons. There are advertisements on this morning's and yesterday morning's papers to the effect that the tax book of the current year in respect of the car must be submitted and that coupons will be issued only to those who have taxed their cars.  There is no question of persons who have untaxed cars getting a ration of petrol should it become necessary to ration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley spoke about nuclear energy.  I have already referred to that and to alternative sources of energy.  The first station will be in operation about eight years from now and it will then take up what will be the growth in the demand for energy, if things are normal between now and then, and will at that stage represent about 20 per cent of the demand for electricity.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera suggested that we should examine the possibility of generating electricity from the tides. I am not sure if this is feasible.  I am having it examined.  The last time it was suggested was during the war. It did not prove economically feasible. The situation was worse then and I presume costs have gone up proportionately since then.  We will have the matter examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher spoke about turf. I am told by Bord na Móna that all the bogs capable of being developed by mechanical methods are now being developed and are in use and that the ESB are using turf to the maximum, representing about 24 per cent <Col N="1364" /> of the production of electricity from turf.  The ESB are taking that up. Of course, what was uneconomic three months ago from the point of view of Bord na Móna might well be economic now.  We will have to look at that to see if it is feasible.  Small bogs which it was not economic to develop then might now be economic. It is a possible source that we can look at.  The life of our bogs is generally thought to be in the region of 20 to 30 years.  Many people advised during the years that this should be left as an emergency fuel supply.  Of course, that suggestion was tut-tutted and nobody took it very seriously ten years ago.  Now many people are saying that perhaps they were wiser than they were given credit for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney asked about the EEC policy.  I do not think he was in the House when I referred to it and said that I thought the policy that would come out of this week's meeting of Prime Ministers would occupy most if not all of their time this week.  I would not like to preempt their discussion.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Local Government is now next to me in the House.  Deputy Meaney suggested that traffic jams occurred because road works were left unfinished. His point was that traffic jams are being created and energy is being wasted because road works are left unfinished.  I do not know to what extent that is so.  Deputy Tunney suggested that road works should be undertaken outside the normal working hours, when there are no traffic jams.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should enlarge upon what I said about the supplies of oil and the difficulty in getting firm information about the quantity we will get at any future time.  We were satisfied up to today that our shortfall was in the region of 15 per cent, perhaps a little over that, of what we would need now.  The companies' forecast for January, as I said earlier, is a shortfall of 30 per cent of what we will need then.  We have already catered for an actual cut of 10 per cent in the orders I have signed, plus the growth, as I said, making a shortfall of 18 to 19 per cent.  If that goes <Col N="1365" /> to 11 per cent it will be serious but the whole situation changes nearly every day and the information one gets from different sources seems to change every day.  Sometimes it is not clear when a company talks about a shortfall of 30 per cent whether they are talking about the oil that they get from Arab countries or whether they are netting that with the amount of oil they would get from non-Arab and other sources and whether, in fact, they would get 10 per cent from non-Arab sources; or whether the shortfall is 30 per cent from Arab sources and they are getting 10 per cent from non-Arab sources and these will be balanced out.  It is very difficult to get precise information.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley was looking to me to give some guarantee that I would say that in January such a thing would happen, in February such-and-such a thing would happen and in April something else.  This is not possible. It is not possible to forecast that next week the information I will have for January will be the same as I gave today.  It is more than probable when a figure comes to me that this is the best information and the one most likely to be true that the oil company can give.  This is the 11th December.  This is the first figure we get for January.  I cannot say what will happen in the spring and early summer.  It is not possible to see ahead that far at the moment.</P>
    <P>The situation is also confused by the fact that until I have every reason to believe the oil companies in Ireland are giving me the proper information as they have it, they are subsidiaries of companies in England which are subsidiaries of international companies and the oil market is intergrated not alone between Ireland and England, not alone amongst European countries but very largely on a world-wide basis.  It is an integrated market.  The companies supply their products to any part of that market, depending on where they have tankers and where there is demand. Each of them probably has a bias in favour of one type of oil rather than another and where there are known to be experts in one field <Col N="1366" /> they supply to that.  It is difficult to get precise information as to what oil we can have available in January and that is only a fortnight away. The information we have is not precise. The further one goes from 1st January the vaguer the field you are getting into except, as I have said a number of times, the knowledge that it will be dear.  If people would only remember that, that should be the carrot that will lure them to make greater savings.  It will cost more and saving fuel will save them money. That may not be the best or most compelling reason but if even for that reason we can get savings it will be a help.</P>

      <P>Deputy Meaney said some of his constituents were worried about the cuts that they had got.  I think this was because there was some confusion.  One of the oil companies sent out a circular that was less than clear as to what the cut was.  It did not show that the cut was 45 per cent on a six months basis stated in three months.  It merely underlined the point of 45 per cent and this was confusing to many people.  Deputy Meaney also referred to the ESB advertisement in this morning's papers advising people how to save energy.  I should like to bring one statistic in that advertisement to your attention.  There are 66,000 water heaters in this country that are not lagged and are without heat conservers.  Each of those uses more than one extra ton of oil because it is not lagged.  If only this were rectified we would save 66,000 gallons of oil.</P>
      <P>Somebody else mentioned that Government buildings are too highly heated.  I have written to all the the Ministers and all the State companies under my control asking them to reduce the heat in this building and other buildings to 63 degrees, the lowest level permitted by the Offices and Premises Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke spoke about aviation fuel for Aer Lingus.  To bring tourists <Col N="1367" /> in here Aer Lingus must take up aviation fuel at some point outside Ireland; we only supply them to fly tourists out, take back tourists who have been here.  At present Aer Lingus are trying to ensure that they will get the same level of supply in countries to which they fly as they are getting here.  We shall have to give the same type of assurance to air companies flying in here that they will get the same level of supply as Aer Lingus are getting in their countries.  This is important.  Aer Lingus is a big employer. Deputy Gallagher spoke about people coming back for Christmas and I appreciate this point.  Tourism is also under my Department but it would be impossible to pick out tourists coming off a ship and give them a special allowance.  Apart from that, it would be unfair if we gave tourists or visitors a special supply which was not guaranteed to our own people living here.  If people living here go across to England or France on holidays at Christmas they will not get a special allowance.  It could be argued that tourists or visitors from Britain are all the year in England and that their quota under the present restrictions is where the car is taxed.  I have a great deal of sympathy for them but we must face the fact that nobody can get all the petrol or oil he wants. This is something we shall have to live with, certainly for some time.</P>
    <P>I must impress on the House and the public that we are in a very serious situation in regard to the energy supply and its effects on our economy. If everybody makes the maximum economy, it is possible that we may get through.  Unemployment has already occurred among people on night time work in garages.  The worse the crunch becomes, the greater the shortage of energy the more livelihoods become endangered.  It is in the interests of all of us here to see that we cut out non-essential use of fuel, that we give a lead to the country in not using energy for non-essential purposes.  If necessary, if they do not get voluntary co-operation the Government will take power to see that sources of energy are allocated in the <Col N="1368" /> most equitable way so that industry and agriculture and concerns that are necessary to keep people in jobs will be the first to get supplies of this very scarce and very dear commodity, energy.</P>

    <Title>Telephone Capital Bill, 1973: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early stage of my reply on this Bill I stressed the point that the sum indicated in the Bill represents the scale of the effort required to improve, extend and modernise our telephone system measured in terms of 1973 prices and costs.  If, as is only too likely, inflation should erode this position further, then it will be necessary before the completion of the five-year period to introduce a new Telephone Capital Bill so as to ensure that the effort required is completed. I stressed that, costly though it is, this is an effort that we cannot afford not to make.  It is essential for us economically, for our progress and indeed, our survival, to modernise our communications system if we are to compete in Europe.  It is particularly essential if the areas of the country which are less economically advanced are to catch up.  More than any other areas these regions need quick communication. Business will not go to certain areas; investment will not take place in them unless the telephone service in particular can be relied on and unless their communications particularly with Europe and with other markets are adequate. These are the main reasons for the very high requirement in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to try to answer all the points made in the debate but I would like to deal at least with the major ones.  I should like to amplify my previous comments on certain telephone capital estimates and expenditure figures for recent years in the light of remarks made by Deputy Brugha about a clash, as he thought, with figures previously quoted.  The <Col N="1369" /> clash is only an apparent one although I recognise that the appearance was adequate to justify this very legitimate query by Deputy Brugha.</P>
    <P>When general capital requirements for 1971-72 were examined in 1970, the Post Office stated their requirement of telephone capital to be over £11 million, as I said on 20th June last.  This figure was made up of £10.73 million which was sought in July, 1970, plus £0.5 million extra needed for wage increases arising out of the 12th round.  Only £9.48 million was allotted and, accordingly, the restrictions imposed in 1970 had to be maintained.  In August, 1971, it was agreed the restrictions could be lifted and, in the event, expenditure exceeded £11 million.  The telephone capital allocation for 1972-73 was, first, £13.48 million.  Subsequently this was increased and the out-turn was £16.9 million approximately.</P>
    <P>I am glad to recognise my predecessor's efforts in seeking, and to some extent getting, substantial increases in telephone capital allocations.  However, I am at a loss to understand why he considers I have been unfair in my references to severe capital restrictions in 1970-71.  This is no more than he said himself at the time.  I refer him to his own remarks on 18th November, 1971, as quoted at column 2442 of the Official Report of that date:</P>
    <P>Coming now to the question of costs, the programme of new works for last year had to be curtailed to conserve capital.  Nevertheless, it cost about £9.5 million.  The original allocation for the current year was also fixed at £9.5 million approximately, but this was far below requirements and efforts to keep to it have reduced the rate of connection of new telephones.  The Government have recently agreed to increase the allocation to £10.73 million and I hope to get more next year when heavy forward commitments for exchange and truck plant will mature.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear in this connection that I am not criticising, and have not been criticising, my predecessor. I know Deputy Collins made every effort to obtain the necessary <Col N="1370" /> capital for his Department and that he warned of the dangers and the effect for years to come of cutting back telephone capital commitment.  If I have emphasised this here it is not for the purpose of making a party political point but to emphasise to all concerned the importance of maintaining the flow of telephone capital, which is the purpose for which this Bill was intended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha raised a more technical point and I should like to give him an answer.  The Deputy said:</P>
    <P>The Minister has not referred to the type of equipment being installed. If he has any information on this matter I should like to know if it is the latest solid technology, or are we importing mechanical equipment.  This is merely a matter of interest.</P>
    <P>The equipment being provided is of various kinds but, broadly, it falls under three heads&mdash;exchange, trunk and subscribers' equipment.  It is the most modern type available for its purpose and for our conditions.  In the last 11 years the policy has been to instal cross-bar equipment in all new exchanges and to phase out the Strowger equipment which, although fully satisfactory, has not all the advantages of cross-bar.  As a matter of interest, I might mention that Strowger equipment is in use extensively throughout the world, including the USA and Britain where over 95 per cent is Strowger equipment.  Both systems are electro-mechanical.  The Department are keeping in close touch with the development of electronic-type exchanges in other countries.  We do not propose to introduce telephone exchanges of this type until we are satisfied they have been fully proved elsewhere and are suitable for our conditions.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies were interested in the extent to which the £175 million will be spent within or outside the country.  It is estimated about £50 million will go towards salaries, wages and allowances payable to construction and installation staffs.  About £10 million will be spent on buildings which, of course, have a high employment content.  Of the balance of £115 <Col N="1371" /> million, taxes payable here, plus stores, plant and equipment manufactured or assembled in Ireland will account for approximately £60 million.  I think it is clear a satisfactory proportion of this high capital commitment will go to people in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputies Fitzpatrick and Fitzgerald asked why the rate of return on capital has fallen in recent years.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, telephone costs have been affected by inflation but telephone charges during the years have advanced less than consumer prices generally, notwithstanding very steep increases in telephone pay rates.  Telephone charges were not adjusted sufficiently to maintain the rate of return of a few years ago.  Increased telephone charges came into operation on 1st October last.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson interrupted my opening statement last Tuesday to inquire if I would consider introducing a 2p call from Dublin to London. Such a service has been available for about two years from the ordinary telephones, that is the non-coinbox telephones in the Dublin area.  The charge is 2p per 12 seconds by day and 2p per 18 seconds after 6 p.m.  I indicated in my opening statement that a number of STD coinboxes have been ordered for experimental use in Dublin and the provinces and that it was hoped to provide STD boxes on an extensive scale during the next five years.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Fitzgerald suggested that private enterprise should provide the telephone instrument while the Department provide the cables to link them.  In my Department's view, the amount of capital saved in this way would not be significant relative to the total amount spent on cabling and providing telephones.  The Deputy may be interested to know that in respect of certain subscriber installation work involving considerable cost, namely the installation of private automatic branch exchanges, the Department permit private firms to instal the equipment on the basis of the subscribers bearing the capital cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> Deputy Geoghegan referred to crossed lines and the over-hearing of conversations on some dialled calls. While everything possible is done to minimise this kind of trouble and while the installation of the additional equipment will undoubtedly help, no telephone authority in the world has succeeded in completely eliminating it.  My Department aim to reduce it and I believe it will be reduced during the period of this capital development plan.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dowling and Timmons in the course of their remarks referred to the opening of newly-laid roads in order to instal telephones.  I understand this happens very infrequently. My Department keep in touch with local authorities and developers and generally arrange to have duct lines put down when new roads are being laid.  We will endeavour to see this is done uniformally in the future.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that social rather than economic criteria should apply to the provision of telephone kiosks.  The present kiosk programme accepts a certain measure of subsidy for kiosks that are provided in replacement of call offices in rural post offices.  I welcome the suggestions of some Deputies in response to my invitation in regard to the basis on which future rural kiosk programmes may succeed.  These and any other suggestions in the matter will be carefully considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the problem of protecting public telephones in large residential areas and suggested that public telephones be provided for community councils or associations in the areas, possibly in private houses.  I share the Deputy's concern and I appreciate his suggestion. However, I do not think a public telephone installed in a private house would be a satisfactory solution. Occupiers of these houses might, understandably, be reluctant to admit all callers late at night and, in practice, the availability of the telephones would be restricted accordingly. There can be little doubt that a street kiosk is by far the most satisfactory <Col N="1373" /> means of providing public telephone facilities but the problem is to keep the telephones in working order.  This problem is particularly acute in large urban areas.  I hope that a new type of coin box which is expected to be available early in the new year will overcome the problem. The intention is to provide the boxes in street kiosks that are subjected to a good deal of vandalism.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to vandalism in telephone kiosks.  Various measures have been taken to combat this.  These include the replacement of small glass windows in kiosks by large sheets of strong plastic material, the use of steel plates in the kiosk structure on to which the coin box is bolted, the installation of continuous fluorescent type lighting and the fitting of alarm systems.  A specially strong coin box was designed by Post Office engineers and given field trials in the past year. The results of these tests were highly satisfactory and the contract was recently placed for a substantial quantity of the new type of coin box which will be used to replace existing coin boxes in areas where the level of vandalism is highest.  The new coin box will have a solid steel case and will be equipped with a specially strengthened handset and steel encased cord.  Supplies of the new coin boxes are expected early in 1974.  As regards clearing of coins from public telephones, every effort is made to ensure that the coin boxes do not become overloaded.  The frequency of collection varies with the use made of the public telephone.  Those which are used very extensively are cleared daily.</P>
    <P>I referred in my opening statement to the question of the re-organisation of the Post Office and a number of Deputies referred to this.  I hope I do not misrepresent Deputies O'Connell, Gallagher and Calleary as generally favouring the idea of making the Post Office a semi-State body, while Deputies Staunton and Carter opposed the transfer of functions to a semi-State body.  Deputies Desmond and Fitzgerald noted the remarks made but were non-committal.  Deputy Brugha did not refer to this matter as spokesman for his Party.  I do not know <Col N="1374" /> whether it can become appropriate for him to refer to it at all in the remaining Stages of the debate, possibly not, but I should like to have an indication from him whether, in consultation or in the course of the proceedings of the House, he has given the matter some thought. I should like to keep in touch with him about it.</P>
    <P>The Government decided at their meeting today, on my recommendation, to set up a Post Office Users' Council and I hope before too long to announce the composition and terms of reference of that body.  One of the first matters which I will put before the Post Office Users' Council will be this question of the possible re-organisation of the postal services generally, this very large question, and without at all rushing them on it, because it is a very complex question, I would hope to get their recommendation on it some time next year, preferably in the first half of next year.  By that time I hope I will also be able to obtain the views of others concerned including, of course, the unions, the professional organisations which have a strong interest in this.</P>
    <P>I should like, in conclusion, to thank all the Deputies who contributed to what was quite a full debate on this Bill and to tell them that their many suggestions, comments and criticisms will be very carefully considered in my Department. I commend the Second Stage of this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I would want to have discussions on such an important aspect.  The Minister when he was replying just now, and also earlier, referred to his predecessor and said that he did not wish to criticise him in any way and I appreciate that but there are some points I must raise with the Minister if only to set the record right in regard to the discussions that have gone on over this Bill and the Estimate in regard to capital expenditure.  The Minister in his reply the last day referred to some Estimates and it is appropriate that I should try to put the picture in perspective regarding the level of capital expenditure by the Fianna Fáil administration.  This ranged roughly from 1968-69 to the outgoing year 1972-73, from an increase of £144,000 in 1969-70, or 9 per cent, followed by £1,969,000 in the following year, or 18 per cent, followed by £1,892,000 in 1971-72, or 20 per cent, followed by £5,299,000 odd, or 46 per cent, in the final year which is 1972-73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister said he was not criticising his predecessor but that he was criticising the Administration but I would take issue with him on the question I raised <Col N="1377" /> here on the last day regarding a wrong figure he gave.  I refer to his having quoted Deputy Collins wrongly&mdash;I think he has agreed about this&mdash; regarding the figure of £11 million being reduced to £9.48 million whereas what had happened was that the figure of £9.48 million had been increased to £11 million.  Consequently, I must put it to the Minister that in those circumstances the words he used following that error were used improperly. He referred to another cut and to this not being the Coalition Government of 1957 but by the Fianna Fáil coalition that had left office.  The Minister is entitled to express an opinion but in these circumstances he was quoting figures that were not accurate.  There had not been another cut in that particular case and his reference to a cut being not by another Coalition in 1957 but by a Fianna Fáil coalition was improper particularly since it was based on figures that were incorrect.  The Minister should withdraw those remarks and in the sense that he was relating them to figures used by Deputy Collins he owes the Deputy an apology.</P>
    <P>To refer further to the capital involved in respect of this Bill there is a matter which I intended clearing with the Minister.  On the last occasion I asked the Minister where the difference arose between the £19 million and the £25 million and the Minister told me that the additional £6 million was coming from the Exchequer.  Can the Minister tell me whether the Minister for Finance has sanctioned this extra capital?  It involves a substantial amount of money in the current budget which already is of the order of £85,500,000. So far as I am aware this has been the practice on previous occasions and there were no Supplementary Estimates involved.</P>
    <P>Another question arising in relation to capital expenditure relates to the European Investment Bank loan which, as the Minister states, is based on the £19 million estimate for the present year which I presume is expected to be £25 million finally.  From the figures the Minister has given us <Col N="1378" /> it seems this would mean that if the £7,500,000 that is becoming available this year is included in the overall estimated capital expenditure which is envisaged now as being £25 million, we are left, after deducting £7,500,000 from £25 million, with a figure of £19,500,000.  If my calculation is correct this is the increased capital which the Minister is so fortunate in obtaining from the European Bank for an improved telephone system.  This money is not being raised in the way in which normally we raise capital but is being made available to us by reason of our membership of the EEC.  This is very good so far as the State is concerned but no doubt the Minister will appreciate that the total amount to be made available by way of our ordinary capital budget system for the coming year will be £19,500,000.  To refer back to the figures I gave earlier, in 1971-72 there was an increase of 20 per cent provided by the previous Administration and an increase of 46 per cent in 1972-73 while this year, if one disregards the European Bank loan, the increase being provided is a couple of million pounds.  If I am correct in my assessment I do not think the Minister can stand over the criticisms he has made.  That is not in any way to play down the additional loan which the Minister has been able to secure from the European Bank plus the amount of additional capital he is getting, which is about £3½ million roughly, over and above what the Fianna Fáil administration provided last year or to suggest it is not in itself a good thing.  Anybody who studies impartially the figures I have read out will agree that they do not warrant the criticism in which the Minister indulged and to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise to the Minister that capital has to be found in the community and that criticism of a previous Administration because you think the money was not properly allocated or in the way you think it should have been allocated, is merely a personal opinion and has nothing to do with the realities of an Administration trying to provide and distribute <Col N="1379" /> capital in the best interests of the community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brugha has ranged rather widely considering that we are on Committee Stage and that what we are supposed to be discussing is section 1 of the Bill to which I do not think the Deputy referred specifically at all.  He has gone into a lot of matter which was covered in the Second Reading debate and which was covered in my reply just now to that debate.  On other matters which he raised he could, if he wished, put down questions to me which I should be glad to answer in the ordinary way.  At this stage I should like to confine myself to section 1 which is the matter, in fact, before us.</P>
      <P>This section provides authority for the further issue from the Central Fund of sums not exceeding £175 million to meet the expenditure on telephone development works.  It is to be noted that the wording &ldquo;as has been or may be required by the Minister&rdquo; would cover expenditure already incurred in excess of that authorised by previous Telephone Capital Acts.  Also, the issue of money by the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is subject to estimates of expenditure being approved by the Minister for Finance.  Estimates of expenditure for each financial year are submitted to the Minister for Finance for approval about the previous December.  I should like to commend section 1 to the House.</P>

      <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I was seeking additional moneys from the Minister for Finance and I was given to understand by officials of my Department that if, at a given time, I got an allocation from the Minister for Finance out of a capital provision of £2 million it was possible that I would not be able to spend that money because we had not got the personnel available, the experts, the installers and the technicians who would enable the Department to spend the money.</P>

      <P>If we are making provision to give £175 million to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I should like to feel that the Department had the personnel and the capacity to spend it.  Unless the Minister can tell me he is in a position to spend the money I certainly would be opposed to providing it.</P>
      <P>In his Second Reading contribution the Minister indicated that together with the assistance they are getting from the EEC loan they will be spending far more than was spent last year. My understanding is that the availability of sufficient installers and technicians could be open to question in so far as there is a restricted form of recruitment.  The recruitment into the engineering section of the Department is by way of trainee installers and trainee technicians and the Department have objected traditionally to taking in already trained technicians and already trained installers.</P>

Will the Minister open the doors of the Department to installers or technicians who were trained in the US or in England, Irishmen who want to come back <Col N="1381" /> home and find this type of employment? In view of the fact that the Minister is seeking money in this House to enable him to increase the provision of telephones and telephone equipment, we are entitled to know whether he has the personnel, or whether he is making arrangements to take on additional personnel with expertise who can be recruited directly to the Department, or whether we have to wait for two or three years to build up a team by reason of the fact that they can be taken on only as trainee installers and trainee technicians.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Lalor's question, the matter of the preparedness of my Department to carry out the capital works concerned was very fully gone into as the Deputy will imagine it would be both in my Department and between my Department and the Department of Finance which naturally, in view of the magnitude of the sums involved, went into this matter with the most particular care.  We are satisfied that we are in a position, if we get the capital, to use it to carry out the works concerned.  If it should appear at any stage that there might be a bottleneck due to existing recruitment practices&mdash;and we are not satisfied that there is such a bottleneck&mdash;we certainly would take steps to deal with that situation.  Our concern is to expand and modernise the telephone system and if, for that purpose we have to cut red tape, we shall cut it. There is no doubt whatever about that.  Deputy Lalor may possibly have a particular case in mind and, if he has, I shall be glad to look into it with him.  The general answer to his general question is as I have described it.</P>

    <P>Deputy Lalor referred to my having lectured the House.  I would regret it if I had adopted a tone which would justify that.

I did not attempt to deal on this section with all the questions raised by Deputy Brugha because it appeared to me that they were more relevant to the Second Stage.  I have, in fact, <Col N="1382" /> replied in substance to many of them and I do not think the Chair would permit me, even if I did so wish, to renew the whole Second Reading debate on the basis of section 1.

      <P>When the debate adjourned on the last occasion I had outlined the manner in which I believed the Minister could have approached the revision of the constituencies. I set out, as I saw it, the way in which, if he were true to the principles he expressed here away back in 1968, he could quite easily have revised the constituencies with fewer incursions across county boundaries. I outlined the situation west of the Shannon.  I pointed out that the Minister could have approached the revision of the constituencies west of the Shannon in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy, our spokesman for Local Government and the former Minister for Local Government, said he saw no reason why the Minister had decided to take two Deputies out of the representation pool in the west.  The figures for Connacht, together with Donegal and Clare, <Col N="1384" /> would justify, even on the present national average per head of 20, 123 the retention of 30 Deputies in that particular area.</P>
    <P>I went on to suggest to the Minister, in his absence on very important business elsewhere now, reluctantly accepting the fact, and, from my point of view, it would not be accepted in a Fianna Fáil revision of constituencies, that there were only going to be 28 Deputies west of the Shannon.  I pointed out that it was possible to have a situation whereby we could stick to the arrangement he had as far as Donegal was concerned, making it a five-seater, but he could have maintained Leitrim as an entity with Sligo.  The population of Sligo-Leitrim is such that it would justify the creation of a four-seat constituency covering that area.  The population of Sligo was 50,275 and Leitrim 28,360, making a total two-county population of 78,635.  One must add 2,835 electors who were taken out of Donegal and this brings the gross totals for Sligo-Leitrim and portion of Donegal to 81,470.  This would be the ideal figure for a four-seat constituency embracing all Sligo-Leitrim without the necessity of splitting Leitrim in two.</P>
    <P>I went on to express my amazement &mdash;I will not say horror because after eight months I have come to realise what National Coalition compromise means&mdash;that the county of Leitrim was split in two despite the five year old protestations from the Coalition Deputies in relation to interfering with the county of Leitrim on the last occasion.  Following the national average which the Minister for Local Government outlined, we would then have a five-seater in Mayo and a three-seater in Roscommon.  This would involve a very small breaching &mdash;I understand this was what the Minister was anxious to aim at&mdash;of County Mayo to enable Roscommon to become a three-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>I then dealt with the amalgamation of Galway and Clare.  This was spelt out by Deputy Molloy at the opening of this debate.  He said that more than 12,000 voters are being taken out of County Clare, and transferred into the constituency of West Galway in <Col N="1385" /> order to make it a four-seat constituency. The population of Clare is 75,008.  If 2,000 people had been moved from Galway into Clare, instead of 12,000 being moved from Clare to Galway, Clare would have been made into a four-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>Without any question of breaching the Galway county boundary, there is an area of Limerick on the Ennis Road end, where 2,000-3,000 voters live who could have been put into the Clare constituency to make it a four-seater. If this were done we would have a justifiable 29 seats in the region west of the Shannon.  We could still retain the five-seat constituency in East Galway with a three-seat constituency in West Galway and four seats in Clare.  The Minister obviously set out to leave the minimum number of Deputies to the Connacht western region.  The reason is obvious.  It permeates the whole Electoral Bill as far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned.  If there seemed to be a prevalence of people who favoured the Fianna Fáil administration they were deprived of Deputies in order to build up the Deputy strength in the part of the country where the National Coalition felt they were strong or they might be able to scrape a seat.</P>
    <P>My contribution last week was subjected to a considerable amount of interruption.  I made a remark in the Minister's absence which I would like to make again as he is present.  I drew attention to the fact that in the discussion on the Second Reading so far &mdash;I presume it has been reported&mdash; the Minister had in fact interrupted on 260 occasions.</P>

      <P>When I made reference <Col N="1386" /> last week to the 260&mdash;now 262&mdash;interruptions that have come from the Minister for Local Government in this debate I was told by Deputy Harte that they were not interruptions, that they were corrections.  I had proceeded to deal with some of the corrections that have come by way of interruptions from the Minister. If I could develop that I would like to refer specifically to the comment the Minister made which gives the game away from the Government's point of view.  Deputy Molloy, in his contribution on 15th November, at column 2010 of the Official Report asked:</P>
      <P>Can the Minister state why he put a five-seater in mid-Cork, a good rural area, and why he put two three-seaters in Mayo, another good rural area?</P>
      <P>The Minister, as I suggest, gave the game away when he said:</P>
      <P>If that part of Cork could be moved to Mayo I would have given a five-seater there also.</P>
      <P>That in its own way explains the thinking behind this National Coalition consolidation Bill.  The situation is that while the Minister on the surface openly denies that this is what I have said it is&mdash;a Coalition consolidation Bill&mdash;in those little interruptions, by way of correction, as Deputy Harte suggested, he tells the true story.  In fact, when Deputy Molloy was making reference to the fact that 12,000 Clare people were being transferred to vote in West Galway the Minister for Local Government interrupted to say:</P>
      <P>The other alternative would be to lump 18,000 persons into Clare.</P>
      <P>He then went on to say:</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be able to count.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister for Local Government going to give lessons in addition to his opposite number or anybody else on this side of the House?  If he tells any Deputy on this side of the House that he should learn to count, I showed last week where the Minister had been wrong, very prominently, and had half apologised for his misstatement in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> As I have already said, the population of Clare is 75,008 and a person would not need to be a genius to be able to establish that, taking a round figure, fewer than 80,000 will justify a four-seat constituency.  The difference between 75,000 and 80,000 is 5,000. Nevertheless, the Minister for Local Government, at column 2011 of the Official Report of 15th November interrupted Deputy Molloy to say that the other alternative to taking people out of Clare would have been to lump 18,000 persons into Clare.  He added insult to injury when he went on to say that the Deputy should be able to count.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy said at column 2013:</P>
    <P>... Not alone has the dagger been thrust in by the Coalition in depriving the West of any representation at Cabinet level but the dagger is now being twisted in the backs of the people in depriving them unnecessarily in this revision of two seats.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, said:</P>
    <P>It was placed there by the Deputy's Government the last time his Government were revising the constituencies.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what the Minister means.  That western area was given 30 seats and the present rearrangement deprives the western area of two seats, without justification, because, as I have said already, the population of that western area would justify the return of 30 Deputies to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I am showing where the Minister for Local Government bogged himself down in his justification for depriving Cork city of a seat. I suppose the population of Cork city is continuing to increase.  According to the last census returns the population of Cork County Borough was 128,645 people, a number which clearly, justifiably and incontrovertibly merits a six-seat constituency. The population upon which the then Minister for Local Government was working in the creation of the two three-seat constituencies in Cork city under the 1968 Act was certified at that time as 122,146, well above the figure that would justify six seats in Cork city.  Yet, the Minister for Local Government at column 2016, in reference to Cork city, said that it was gerrymandered to achieve that.  The expert on gerrymandering made that type of comment.  Another correction by the Minister for Local Government came later on.</P>

I elaborated on the last occasion and again today on the manner in which that part of Ireland west of the Shannon could be redrawn with the same number of Deputies as the Minister wants to put into it&mdash;I do not agree with that&mdash;but to provide for 28 Deputies I have suggested that that area could be divided with three small incursions across county boundaries, which is very different from the manner in which the Minister for Local Government plans to do it in this Bill.  I say quite justifiably that that is constructive criticism and I propose to proceed to make further constructive criticism.  I was forced by heckling and ignorant interruptions to justify the criticism I made of the 260 interruptions by the Minister for Local Government during the course of this debate.  Deputy Harte said that they were not interruptions, that they were intelligent observations and corrections.  I had been drawing attention to a number of corrections by the Minister for Local Government. So far some of them have been blatantly unjustified interruptions.  On the other hand, we had a priceless one from the Minister when Deputy Molloy was dealing with the constituency including County Meath. Deputy Molloy was drawing attention to the fact that that constituency had become a four-seater in order to consolidate the position of the Minister who had a very shaky election on the last occasion.</P>

      <P>On that further, corrective interruption by the Minister let me recall a quotation from the Minister's remarks.  I am making these as I go along because the Minister is reminding me.  The Minister, in his short speech earlier said:</P>
      <P>...In bringing forward a constituency revision Bill at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am quoting from column 1984 of the Official Report of 15th November, 1973&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>therefore, we are continuing a process already started by the previous Government and there can, therefore, be no disappointment on this point...</P>
      <P>I accept that.  It was said on the Government side: &ldquo;Why did you not change the constituencies when you were there?  You had the opportunity.&rdquo; The constructive approach of the Fianna Fáil Government was that revision of constituencies was a secondary consideration by comparison with the country's other requirements. We had quite an amount of other legislation for the betterment of the country to which we gave priority rather than revision of constituencies that could be aimed at trying to consolidate the Fianna Fáil position.  We are now in Opposition because of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tomorrow night we shall have a debate on the Adjournment of the second session of the present Dáil and the only new legislation that was not prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government that has gone, or is going through the House is the Electoral Amendment Bill.  Any other legislation that has been passed&mdash;in fact, I could nearly say that any other legislation mentioned or introduced&mdash;was legislation prepared by the former Fianna Fáil Government.  The difficulty with the present Government and one of the reasons why we are fast going down hill economically and why the public failed very noticeably&mdash;the comparison is £8 million as against £27 million&mdash;to show their support and confidence in the present <Col N="1392" /> Government, is that the present Government have spent eight months doing nothing else since their election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  Getting back to the Bill, having dealt with Connacht, I should like to move to the province of Munster.  I want to draw the attention of the House to a few basic facts with regard to Munster, facts of which the Minister for Local Government does not seem to be aware.  The population <Col N="1393" /> of the Munster area, excluding Clare which has been dealt with as being on the other side of the Shannon, was shown in 1971 as 806,994.  According to the 1966 census the population was 785,737.  Between the years 1966 and 1971 there was a population increase in Munster of 21,257.  We know from the Minister that the national average is 20,123.  Having regard to the increased population in Munster of 21,257 one would legitimately expect an increase in representation of one Deputy but as explained in the explanatory memorandum Munster, excluding Clare, will retain its present number of seats.</P>
      <P>The Connacht area was victimised to the extent of two seats.  This is all a build-up for Dublin, with which area I shall deal later.  Although the population in Munster increased by more than 21,000 it will only retain the 40 seats it holds at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should like to pay tribute to the ingenuity and the capacity of Deputy Coughlan and I am glad he is present to hear my personal commendation.  I am referring to the way he handled not only the Minister for Local Government but the National Coalition in general. He deprived them of the possibility of being able to fiddle another seat out of Limerick by maintaining the four-seat constituency in East Limerick.  I can assure the Deputy that Fianna Fáil will be forever grateful to him for ensuring that we maintain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not do us such a good turn as on this occasion and we express our gratitude to him.  I am glad to learn the Deputy got the message from the right quarter and did not allow himself to be nailed to the mast on the next occasion.  I will not repeat the logical criticisms and arguments presented by Deputies Molloy and Wyse in relation to the hammering being given to Cork city and the disfranchising of a number of people in that area.  The Minister for Local Government said that the city was gerrymandered on the last occasion in order to provide six seats.  Taking a 20,000 population as the national average, any city with a population of 120,000 is a natural six-seat area.  This is what happened in 1968 when it was made a two three-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote from a very eminent gentleman, the former Deputy Stephen Barrett, now a highly <Col N="1395" /> esteemed judge in our courts.  In 1968 he was very critical of the manner in which Cork city was dealt with.  At column 1276 of the Official Report dated 27th November, 1968, he said:</P>
    <P>On the last occasion the constituencies were carved up&mdash;and plainly in a spirit of gerrymandering which had no regard whatsoever for a portion of the constituency which, whilst it was then in the county, always looked upon itself as part of Cork city constituency&mdash; the Minister and his Party proceeded to carve up the areas of Blackrock and Douglas in such a way that an area of the city, within a quarter of a mile of the City Hall, was shifted into a constituency which sprawled itself away down through County Cork and on to the borders of County Kerry so that people actually living in an area which is portion of Cork City Borough were completely disfranchised so far as Cork city itself was concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not need to add to that.  If Mr. Barrett were still a Deputy I am sure he would be arguing solidly against the actions of the Minister for Local Government.  The population of Munster has increased by 21,000 but has not got any recognition from the Government.  In Cork city and county there was an increase of population of 13,180.  The city area increased its population from 122,146 in 1966 to 128,645 in 1971, an increase of 6,499. A total of 128,000 people are living in the Cork County Borough area but only 100,000 will be represented in the new constituency while 28,000 are being flung into the Mid-Cork area. This matter has been dealt with by Deputy Wyse.  As a result of Deputy Wyse's hard work which has made him one of the most popular men in Cork city, we have this measure taken by the Minister for Local Government. I do not want to quote but I remember reading a contribution made by Deputy Tully in the 1968 debate in which he criticised the then Minister for Local Government for having almost taken the toes off one of the <Col N="1396" /> Deputies in Meath.  Here the Minister for Local Government comes within four doors of Deputy Wyse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should reiterate the point made by Deputy Molloy. The Minister justified the creation of three-seat constituencies in Dublin on the basis that it was a built-up area.  I hope the Minister, when he is replying, will be able to justify the manner in which he dealt with Cork city.  What mental process did he go through to arrive at the conclusion that the proper thing to do was to make Cork a five-seat constituency? <Col N="1397" /> There is no area in the country in which six seats were as justified as in Cork city.  If he adopted the same system that he adopted in Dublin, it would appear that he should have taken a little bit from the county area and brought it into Cork city to make a four-seater and a three-seater.  The Minister outstripped himself in relation to the Cork city area.  He did such a double deal that I doubt if he knows whether he is coming or going. The members of his organisation in Cork city will have difficulty in knowing what his actual intention was. Anybody with a normal degree of commonsense will see the mess that is being made of the country.  Here we have a five-seat constituency being created in Cork city and, shades of the late Deputy Casey, an impression is being created that a seat is being made by the Minister for a Labour man in Cork city.  They have not a dog's chance.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I am sure the Minister has made the remnants of the Labour organisation in that city reasonably happy in so far as he has shown that he is trying to help them. I doubt, however, if he will be able to prevail upon Deputy Barry Desmond or the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary, to go back to Cork to try to consolidate the position there.  I think what he really intended to do, when lopping off this section of Cork city for Mid-Cork, was to consolidate the position of Deputy Mrs. Desmond. Fair dues to him.  I hope he will not be caught up in the double deal when he attends some Labour convention in Mid-Cork and says this is why he did it and then goes, on the following night, to Cork city and says that the other reason was the one.  Cork city has been messed about wrongfully, disfranchised and completely gerrymandered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Meath situation is very interesting. County Meath has a population of 71,729.  The population of County Kildare is 71,977, slightly greater than County Meath.  That being so, the proper procedure would have been to take from Meath and give to Kildare, which is the bigger county.  Kildare justified this by having the greater <Col N="1398" /> population.  The population in Kildare had increased since the last census by 8.4 per cent, whereas the population of Meath increased by 6.5 per cent. Both showed appreciable increases but it seems obvious that Kildare will reach a figure which would justify four seats much more quickly than will County Meath.  Of course, if we have the National Coalition at that stage they may even disfranchise the rest of the Kildare people.  I should like to draw a circle around Dublin. I am looking at the census figures and building up to the lack of justification for the increase in representation in Dublin city from 38 seats to 43.  This has been done by robbing Kildare and Wicklow for short-term political advantage.</P>
    <P>County Louth has a population of 74,951.  The last census showed an increase in population of between 7 and 8 per cent on the figures for the previous census.  This was lower than the Kildare increase but with a population of 74,951 they were justified in aiming at a four-seat constituency, although this is being done by way of a deliberate attempt to bring in a colleague with the Minister for Defence.  The Labour Party boys in Drogheda and Dundalk are being persuaded that the purpose of the four-seater is to make room for them but we all know what will be the outcome of the exercise.  We know, too, that the Minister for Defence, like his colleague the Minister for Local Government, had the degrading experience of being the last man dragged in at the last election and, presumably, he wants to have some sort of crutch to lean on on the next occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I have already spent some time this evening endeavouring to draw the attention of the Minister to his own pettiness.  One would have thought that early on in office the Minister would have learned the lesson that he endeavoured to teach the then Minister in 1968 when he told Mr. Boland that he would have every <Col N="1399" /> opportunity of replying if he could refrain from interrupting.  Perhaps pettiness, of which the Minister accuses me, arises from the fact that I am merely quoting the Minister to himself. When I was on the other side of the House I sat and listened to quite an amount of abuse from across the floor.</P>

I am endeavouring to point out that this Bill is devised not from the point of view of giving fair play to the electorate but to consolidate the National Coalition Government against what obviously will be a major reaction from the general public at the first opportunity they are given.</P>
      <P>Kildare is more entitled to have a four-seat constituency than is Meath and, consequently, the process should be reversed in regard to those two counties.  When the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill was going through the House Deputy Tully said, as reported at column 1815 of the Official Report for December 8th, 1968:</P>
      <P>At that time I challenged the Minister in this House to put my area in with Louth or in with Dublin. As a matter of fact, I particularly wanted him to put me in with Dublin.  I said then, and I repeat it here now, that if he put me in with County Dublin where he is a representative himself he would not get things as cushy as he is getting them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why the Minister should have changed his mind in this regard, no reason why, instead of robbing <Col N="1400" /> Kildare he could not have robbed a little portion of County Dublin.  He could have done the same in order to serve the people of Kildare.  He could have made Meath a four-seat constituency by encroaching on Kildare.  In fact, he could do that also for Wicklow although their population is slightly less at 66,295 but I suppose that since it is less than the 70,000 mark they might not be justified in having four seats.  On the other hand, with the exception of County Dublin as a whole, the area in Leinster of greatest growth between the years 1966 to 1971 was County Wicklow which showed a population increase during the previous five-year period of 9.7 per cent.  Should Wicklow follow the same growth pattern during the next five-year period it will have reached a four-seat capacity.  The population increases of 8.4 per cent in Kildare, 6.5 per cent in Meath and 9.7 per cent in Wicklow justify increasing those constituencies to four seats when propped up by borrowing from the County Dublin area and by the end of the next five-year period each would be in the position of being justified in having four seats without any help from other counties. No doubt the gerrymander of this area was undertaken deliberately in order to consolidate the position of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the Dublin area I wish to draw attention specifically to the non-justification of the increase in representation to five-seat constituencies. Already I have pointed out that there was no need to deprive the area west of the Shannon of two seats. I have pointed out also, that the population in Munster has increased by more than 21,000, thereby justifying an additional seat but they are not to be given this.  The population increase in the area of Dublin County Borough, Dún Laoghaire Borough and Dublin County increased between 1966 and 1971 by 57,171 but they are to get five seats extra.  In other words, for little more than each 10,000&mdash;11,000 odd&mdash;the Dublin County area as a whole is to get one extra seat while Munster gets no additional seat for their extra 21,000 people and Connacht loses two seats, a loss for which there is no justification.  This Bill is <Col N="1401" /> a clear indication of the veracity of our prognostication that this Government would be a Dublin city oriented Government.  It is the first piece of legislation that has been prepared by the Coalition Government.  Any other legislation introduced by them so far was prepared by the previous Administration but in this, their first effort, they show clearly that they are Dublin-oriented and we now have the situation where the average rural dweller is to be ruled at the whim and by the general over-all pullings and draggings that take place between Ministers representing, in the main, the city of Dublin.  We will have that representation increased.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that the 57,000 extra people justify an increase in representation for the Dublin area of two or three Deputies.  Instead of South County Dublin encroaching into Wicklow&mdash;and so far as I know there are two encroachments into Wicklow &mdash;and instead of the encroachments into County Kildare&mdash;and there are two, one from Meath and one from Dublin&mdash;if the increased numbers to justify a four-seater in Meath had been taken out of North County Dublin, if the increased numbers to justify a seat in Kildare had been taken from south or south west County Dublin, and if the increased numbers to justify an additional seat in Wicklow had been taken from the South County area, we would have a more realistic situation and we would have three extra rural Deputies and three less city Deputies.  That could be fully justified.</P>
    <P>The danger of that equitable distribution was that the Fianna Fáil Party might find it easier to take the reins of Government again.  I am surprised at this display of a lack of confidence in themselves shown by the National Coalition.  This is the first piece of legislation to which they devoted themselves.  Deputy Tully's colleagues said to him: &ldquo;We know we are very shaky.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When I need a prompt from the Parliamentary Secretary I will ask him for one.  When the revision of the constituencies was being debated in 1968 almost everybody in the Opposition wanted a commission. I do not want to bore the House by going through all the Dáil Debates at that time to point out the number of occasions on which the then Minister was asked to hand this matter over to a commission.  It has been said often in this debate that there was nothing genuine about the Opposition spokesmen at the time.  I take it I must leave the Ceann Comhairle out of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1403" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Very definitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an almost unanimous request from the then Opposition spokesman for a commission to do an impartial job in carving up the country into constituencies. It is remarkable that we have heard no mention of that from the Government on this occasion with the exception of Deputy Desmond who gave a small hint.  He said that he has not changed his mind.  I am paraphrasing him and he said: &ldquo;It would be as well to try to consolidate ourselves first and then we will talk in terms of a commission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have been asked for suggestions. I have spent the night making suggestions for the Minister's observations. I should like to hear the Minister justify the number of slices west of the Shannon by comparison with the three little incursions which were made previously.  I think &ldquo;incisions&rdquo; would be a more appropriate word because a particular scalpel is used for that work and I take it the Minister is expert at it.  I am suggesting rather neat incursions, one rather minor one, the one he already has made in Donegal, a minor one into County Mayo and a minor one into Galway and that finishes the west and leaves him with 28 Deputies. I am not saying that is acceptable to me but it is more acceptable than what he is proposing.  If he is dedicated to giving the people west of the Shannon 28 Deputies I recommend this to him and he has it for free.</P>
      <P>I will give another piece of information to the Minister for free.  He will find that the figures I quoted are pretty accurate.  They are not open to such criticism as I have found it appeal to the Minister not to recast but to set up a commission to make recommendations to the House.  A commission looking objectively at the necessity to re-cast the constituencies would examine them from the point of view of what is to be learned from the percentage increase in population in the various areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> If we are to have a revision of the constituencies after every census we could save a good deal of Parliamentary time if we had a commission. In the areas where the population was increasing substantially they could go below the average while keeping within the 1,000 limit.  With a tolerance of 1,000 below and 1,000 above that is 8,000 in a four-seater.  In a constituency where you have an expanding and growing population you could create a four-seat constituency.  A four-seat constituency could be created there based on a figure slightly above the 19,123 figure in the knowledge that, while you have the accepted norm of population, at the end of the five year period it may not have gone up by 8,000 and therefore the constituency will not need to be revised.  On the other hand, where you have constituencies in which the population does not fall within that projection, you could aim at it in the other way. I offer that for free to the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I said I wanted to refer to a contribution made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in which he drew attention to how unfair it was, in his opinion, that in some isolated cases it cost poor Fine Gael 12,000 votes to get a seat while Fianna Fáil got a seat with 8,000 votes.  I thought there was something false in this situation.  I knew the Parliamentary Secretary was being factual in the examples he quoted and I knew he would not try to deceive the House, but the few examples he gave could create a wrong impression. They could give the impression that there was some over-representation by Fianna Fáil in relation to the number of votes they got nationally.  It is no harm to spell out, therefore, quite clearly to the House how extraordinarily accurate the returns were from the point of view of the 1968 Act.  The Minister for Local Government was heavily criticised; he was accused of gerrymandering.  Every speaker on the Opposition benches argued that the whole thing was a gerrymander.  In fact, the figures in the last general election show how fairly the constituencies were drawn from the point of view of representation and how, in that election, everyone <Col N="1405" /> got a fair opportunity of sending back to the Dáil his chosen representative because in that election Fianna Fáil obtained 46.24 per cent of the first preference votes and we got 47.9 per cent of the seats, 1 per cent higher than the number of votes we got.  If we had a properly filled House I am sure Fine Gael would say how lucky we were.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael got 40.05 of the votes and 37.5 per cent of the seats.  On the other hand, the Labour Party, of which the Minister is a member, got 13.67 per cent of the votes and they filled 13.2 per cent of the seats.  Surely that is an indication of how fairly the constituencies were drawn in the last revision despite the interminable criticisms to which the then Minister for Local Government and his Government were subjected.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see Deputy Reynolds in the House.  With the exception of Deputy Begley, the Parliamentary Secretary, he is the only Fine Gael representative at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the Deputy shed crocodile tears for the people of Leitrim because of the way in which, according to him, the constituency was being carved up and suggested that the counties of Roscommon and Leitrim should have been put together. Fair enough.  I have outlined how Sligo-Leitrim could be put together.  I can see why Deputy Reynolds would not like that&mdash;a five-seater in Donegal and a three-seater in Sligo.  The situation is that the population of Sligo of 50,275 would <Col N="1406" /> not justify a three-seater.  Even with the addition of 2,835 odd votes from Donegal that still would not justify a three-seater.  I examined the Bill to see could Deputy Reynolds be accommodated on the lines outlined by him in 1968 and I found what he wanted could not be done any more than it could be done by the then Minister for Local Government in 1968.  There was, however, an opportunity on this occasion for the Minister for Local Government to make Sligo-Leitrim a four-seat constituency, keeping Leitrim intact.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Deputy from Leitrim is present and will make his contribution.  I hope he will join with me in appealing to the Minister to do as I say, so that the appeals he made in 1968, in which I join with him now, will not again fall on deaf ears.  He was worried at that time at the shifting of a number of pieces of nine counties by the then awful savage, the Minister for Local Government, in 1968.  The extraordinary thing is that the present Minister in slicing up the constituencies proposes to take a bit from Donegal, take two pieces of Leitrim, take a bit from Roscommon, a bit from Clare, a bit from Cork, a bit from Wexford, two bits from Kildare, two bits from Wicklow and one bit from Monaghan&mdash;12 incisions into nine counties.  There are 12 slices of nine counties being taken off there.</P>
      <P>I have not checked the actual set up with regard to the number of counties which were being interfered with under the 1968 legislation.  I am taking Deputy Reynold's word for it that nine counties were involved.  He went on to say at column 1395, Volume 237 of the Official Report on 27th November, 1968:</P>
      <P>As I have asked before, why has Donegal not been made a five-seater? Why has Sligo not been made a three-seater?  It would have been quite easy to do this.  Why could counties Roscommon and Leitrim not have been left together with five seats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate why Deputy Reynold, having had the privilege and honour of representing that constituency, would still like to represent it. <Col N="1407" /> I have a more pronounced feeling that despite his protestations of love for County Leitrim and his allegiance to it he would not want Leitrim to be consolidated and put in with Sligo. He then might not have the privilege of representing that constituency in the future, should the justifiable amalgamation of those two counties be brought about again.  As he is proposing to speak, I do not wish to interfere with him in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach in his contribution referred to the slicing up of the constituencies. He said at column 2029, Volume 268 of the Official Report on 15th November, 1973:</P>
    <P>In 1973, this was the situation in the constituency of Dublin Central, Dublin North Central, Dublin North East, Dublin North West, Dublin South Central, Dublin South West&mdash;I have omitted Dublin South East because it was a three-seater:</P>
    <P>He was drawing attention to the fact that Fianna Fáil got more representation than their votes entitled them to. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil won 85,534 first preference votes, while the figure for Fine Gael was 56,986 and Labour got 51,317 votes.  With their votes Fianna Fáil returned 12 Deputies, Fine Gael returned seven and the Labour Party returned five.  If one were to break down these figures into terms of cost per seat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is an academic exercise at which the Parliamentary Secretary is good; he picked out selected areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>as any schoolboy might be asked to do, it would be seen that the cost per seat to Fianna Fáil was 7,128 votes, the cost to Fine Gael was 8,141 votes per seat and the Labour Party got their seats at a cost of 10,261 votes each.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary felt that that was a tremendous sacrifice.  Dublin is being carved into three-seat constituencies in order to redress that imbalance as he sees it.  He is a spokesman for the Dublin area.  He sits in at Government meetings and listens to the <Col N="1408" /> Dublin slant in relation to this.  He saw that this was a desperate thing, that the Fine Gael Party should pay 8,141 votes per seat and Fianna Fáil should get seats for 7,128 votes.  In a North Kerry constituency a Fianna Fáil seat in the 1973 election cost 13,049 votes.  The Fine Gael seat cost 50,530 votes and the Labour seat cost 5,856 votes.  The total cost to the National Coalition for two seats was 12,386 votes, a lesser cost for two seats than it cost Fianna Fáil for one; 13,049 voters had to troop in in order to send one Deputy back and a total of 12,386 votes sent in a Fine Gael and Labour Deputy, supporting the National Coalition.</P>

      <P>I could go on <i>ad infinitum</i> on this.  The Parliamentary Secretary was whinging about it costing Fianna Fáil 1,000 less votes than Fine Gael.  I have gone into the total statistics across the board and it shows the actual percentages of votes as per return.  It was quite equitable.  This should be put on record.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government is swiping a part of Kildare and shoving it into Dublin for obvious reasons. It cost 15,233 votes to elect a Fianna Fáil Deputy in Kildare.  A Fine Gael Deputy could be elected for 8,297 votes and a Labour Deputy for 6,971 votes.  Again, the comparison is the same as in North Kerry.  A total of 15,088 votes elected two National Coalition Deputies and it cost more than the combined votes to elect the Fianna Fáil man.  There is a similar situation in my own constituency.  It cost Fianna Fáil 10,197 votes to send in each Deputy and Fine Gael have three Deputies at a cost of 7,136 votes.</P>

      <P>Where there is good organisation&mdash;the comment of the <Col N="1409" /> intelligentsia on the Front Bench&mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach seems to find that the good organisation of Fianna Fáil in Dublin is not entitled to any credit.  During the course of my submission I have endeavoured to show two things.  If the Minister for Local Government and the Government genuinely set out to be fair, it is possible to be fair.  I have suggested the manner in which they could do this.  It may be said that the Fianna Fáil spokesmen are wasting their time trying to get a message across.</P>
      <P>There is no point in my repeating the comment or the appeals made by the people on the other side of the House five years ago.  I find it remarkable that they can do a complete somersault, change the tone of voice, the overall approach and change their principles.  On the first day two groups get together and decide to form a coalition, it is a necessary prerequisite to the emergence of a coalition that the two groups must be willing and prepared to sell their principles.  We have in the Electoral Bill a fine example of that.  I have no doubt that nobody wants to listen to me much longer.  If I were to go through the Second Reading debate and draw the attention of every Deputy to his statements made at that time and compare how they fall in line with the presentation on this Bill, and with the statement of the Minister for Local Government in his introduction, and the statement of a silently contributing back bench group, all the Deputies who contributed at that time would be shown to be what they have proved to be since, sellers out on their principles.  Let us hope that tomorrow's Adjournment Debate does not show further confirmation of that.</P>

At the conclusion of his speech the Deputy was talking about coalition government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Lalor could not wait.  Deputy Lalor made reference to my having cried during the debate here in 1968.  I asked him on numerous occasions to quote me.  The only quotation he gave was that in my speech in the debate in 1968 I said that Roscommon-Leitrim should be a four-seater constituency and that Donegal should be a five-seater constituency.  If anybody, to use the Deputy's words, has cried and whinged in this House about a constituency, it is Deputy Lalor.  He was the best crier and the best whinger that I have listened to for some time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy commenced by telling us that Donegal should be a five-seater. He said that he was going to give the Minister an alternative Bill but he did not say that there had to be a number of people moved out of Donegal in order to leave it a five-seater, nor did he suggest where they should be moved.</P>
      <P>It is quite evident to anybody who looks at the figures that there is an over-population in County Donegal to justify five seats and that some people would have to be moved out.  Perhaps the Deputy was hoping that in the future we would get them in from Derry.  I do not know what he had in mind.  It was a pity he did not say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was quite annoyed about the loss of seats in the west of Ireland.  Everybody knows that seats are based on population.  Let us look at the population in the west of Ireland since Fianna Fáil came into office.  The figures are rather interesting.  I will take the figures for the past 30 years until Fianna Fáil left office nine months ago, with the <Col N="1411" /> exception of a very short period of six years.  Prior to the advent of Fianna Fáil in County Leitrim alone the population was 55,907.  In 1971, the last census year for which figures are available, the figure was 28,360 &mdash;a drop of 27,541.  Let us move to County Galway.  Listening to Deputy Lalor, one might get the impression that the population of these counties had increased.  When Fianna Fáil came into office the population of Galway was 169,366.  In 1971, the population was 149,223, a drop of 20,143. In Mayo, when Fianna Fáil came into office the population was 172,690. According to the 1971 census returns, the population is 109,000&mdash;a drop of 63,165.  In Sligo, when Fianna Fáil came into office the population was 71,388 and in 1971 it had dropped to 50,275&mdash;by 21,113.  In Roscommon when Fianna Fáil came to office the population was 83,556.  It is now 53,509, a drop of 30,000.  These figures that I have quoted represent a total drop of 162,000 in the population of the west of Ireland.  Deputy Lalor should be ashamed to make the slightest reference to it.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Lalor spoke about the division of County Leitrim; the boundary should be here and the boundary should be there.  Does Deputy Lalor forget that in the last Constituency Bill introduced in this House County Leitrim was divided into three parts, one of which went to Donegal, one to Sligo and another to Roscommon, that each part had approximately 7,000 voters and that the quota in any one of these constituencies was in the region of 8,500?  It was the intention there that no Deputy from Leitrim should be or would be elected. It happened in the first election. It very nearly happened the last time. It just did not.  If anybody was crying about seats inside or outside this House, it was not I and if there were some of the Fianna Fáil people crying and whinging, as Deputy Lalor said, I suggest that he should think of somebody other than me.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the revision of the constituency as far as County Leitrim <Col N="1412" /> is concerned.  Does Deputy Lalor know that one cannot leave south Leitrim and go to north Leitrim without going through either County Roscommon or County Cavan? The Minister for Local Government cannot be blamed for that any more than the former Minister can be blamed.  There is a natural boundary.  The part nearest Roscommon went to Roscommon and the part nearest to Sligo went to Sligo. It certainly is a move towards restoring to the county its identity.  It is not divided into three parts; it is just divided and it was not done by any Minister.  It is the county boundary. That is the situation in regard to County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that some Deputies in these constituencies did not want Sligo-Leitrim back as a constituency in case some Fine Gael Deputies might lose their seats.  But in 1961 there was a bye-election in Sligo-Leitrim which was won by Deputy McLaughlin who beat the Fianna Fáil nominee by 2,000 votes. In October, 1961, there was a revision of constituencies and it was Deputy Lalor's party who did away with the old Sligo-Leitrim constituency, not the present Minister for Local Government. There is no point in Deputy Lalor saying we were afraid to do this or that; the Fianna Fáil Party created the situation.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused the other day when he referred to what Deputy Andrews said.  I quote from the Official Report of 5th December, 1973, where Deputy Andrews said that there seemed to be an unholy haste about the manner in which the Government are anxious to rush this Bill through the House.  Perhaps that is wishful thinking.  Can anybody recall the leader of Fianna Fáil being on Radio Éireann on a Saturday morning, I think, saying that the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party were too busy fighting about the Constituencies Bill to have any other work done?  Shortly after that the Bill came.  Now we are told this was haste and that we want to get it through the House, that we are afraid of this and that.  You cannot have it <Col N="1413" /> both ways.  You cannot have the party leader saying one thing and Deputy Lalor another.  I do not know if these two people agree but they cannot have it every way.  If they are to be an Opposition at least they must be honest with themselves.  We do not have to account for this but they will ultimately have to account for this themselves.</P>
    <P>As far as I and every other Deputy is concerned&mdash;Deputy McLaughlin is the other Leitrim Deputy&mdash;we are quite satisfied with the revision of constituencies.  Deputy Lalor maintained we were silent, afraid to open our mouths.  I am not and I congratulate the Minister for Local Government on his revision because it is a fair effort.  It guarantees that each part of County Leitrim will have a representative in this House whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We must recognise the difficulties of any Minister for Local Government who attempts a revision of constituencies.  It is a very difficult job.  It is practically impossible to satisfy each party much less individual Deputies.  The mistake the Minister made was that he rushed into this Bill to prove that he could do this revision in a very short time.  He has made very serious mistakes, the most serious being made in my constituency of Clare.  He has revised it by chopping and changing. He has taken a bit away and put it into West Galway.  He has given back a part that was part of Clare previously, the part around Tullow Feakle, Scarriff and Killaloe.  He has taken away part that was around Lisdoonvarna, Doolin and Kilfenora and put this in to form a new constituency of West Galway.  I think a Minister in a previous Coalition Government said at one time that he would bulldoze the Twelve Pins in Connemara into Galway Bay.  I think the Minister has done a far more remarkable feat in that he has transferred the people from the famous Burren in County Clare into Eyre Square, Galway.  He has succeeded in bulldozing the Cliffs of Moher into West Galway also.  There was no need for this.  It is like a game of snakes and <Col N="1414" /> ladders where you give back a bit to County Clare in East Clare and take away a bit in North Clare and put it into West Galway.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have kept to the old administrative County of Clare and have four seats in that area.  He could have done this and the revision should never have been made and, to be fair, neither should Clare have been divided in the previous Act.  I opposed this at that time and I think many in the Labour Party opposed it and shed a lot of crocodile tears on the ground that Fianna Fáil in 1968 were trying to deprive the Labour Party in Clare of a seat.  They made a great deal of noise about Fianna Fáil trying to deprive Labour of the seat in Clare held by the distinguished former Ceann Comhairle, the late Deputy Paddy Hogan.  The Labour people in Clare particularly felt it was an attempt by Fianna Fáil to deprive the people of Clare of the Labour representation they always had in the constituency and prevent the Labour Party from ever winning a seat in Clare.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister has now let down the Labour supporters and his own party in Clare in an effort to facilitate people in West Galway who are anxious to win a seat for Labour there.  It is pretty obvious that he was pressured by certain individuals in the Labour Party in Galway to take in part of the North Clare area to suit a particular individual in Galway who is a member of the Labour Party, who claims connections with Clare and who feels that if he got a sizeable number of votes from the Clare area it might help him to win a seat for Labour in West Galway. I do not know how the Labour people in Clare will react to this change but it is a retrograde step which should never have been taken, transferring part of Clare into West Galway, giving back the part around Tullow, Scarriff and Killaloe.  I welcome this part back in to the constituency; it should never have been taken out anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My one other complaint about the Bill is that the Minister has completely ignored the people he has taken into West Galway.  I should like him to explain how he thinks the people of <Col N="1415" /> Lisdoonvarna, the Cliffs of Moher or Doolin or Kilshanny or Kilfenora can call themselves West Galwegians. He should at least recognise that they are Clare people and he should either call the constituency North Clare-West Galway or Clare-West Galway or North West Clare-West Galway.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a very bad mistake; he has made an unnatural transfer because the people of Lisdoonvarna and Doolin and Kilshanny and all this area naturally tend to move towards Ennis.  Now he is putting them in with Clifden, an area with which they have no connection and he has completely ignored their wishes.  If he will not facilitate them by leaving them in the old Clare constituency and giving us four seats in that area at least he should recognise they have some right to be called Clare people.  He should bear this in mind when bringing in amendments which I understand he can do at a later stage.  I hope he will be able to see his way to revising this area and calling the new constituency he proposes as West Galway either North Clare-West Galway or North West Clare-West Galway.</P>

      <P>In his speech on the Second Stage the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In drawing up this proposal my objective was first of all to ensure fair and reasonable representation for the people of every area.  This is what the Constitution requires. Secondly, as I have already stated, I endeavoured as far as possible to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and tried to ensure that natural communities were not split, unnecessarily, between different constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not so because the Minister did not adhere to county boundaries unless it suited him.  He should have been consistent in his policies, whether with regard to five-seaters or three-seaters, but he has been playing the game both ways.  He favours three-seat constituencies in Dublin which has a highly concentrated population because he thinks this will <Col N="1416" /> suit the Government, but in areas such as my own which did not give the Coalition Government a majority he tries to punish the electorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an exercise in gerrymandering.  We realise that the Government are greedy for additional seats but we thought that greed would have been restrained especially in Border areas such as Cavan and Monaghan.  However, there appears to be no limit to the greed.  The Cavan-Monaghan constituency was discriminated against by the Government because in the last general election, as in many other instances, Fianna Fáil got four out of the six seats.  This area covers a wide district, extending westwards for about 70 miles, and it also has a long border with Louth.  It would not be possible for a Deputy effectively to cover such a constituency; his only hope would be to concentrate on a particular area.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that it was natural that the Minister would attempt to consolidate his position in Meath and I do not fault him for what he did.  However, instead of making Meath a four-seater, of making Louth and a small portion of Monaghan a four-seater, and the balance of Monaghan with Cavan a five-seater, he could have retained four seats for Meath&mdash;thus safeguarding his own position&mdash;and he could have had three three-seat constituencies.  If he did that none of the counties would lose their identity and the constituencies would have been of a manageable size. Since 1961 Monaghan has had a portion of west Louth and the Minister could have given sufficient to Monaghan to allow for the three three-seaters I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has only to look at the map to realise that Louth, the smallest county in Ireland, is a four-seat constituency. It is a highly industrialised area and has a large population.  On the other hand, the large sprawling, unmanageable, hilly part of Monaghan and Cavan has only five seats.  The worst feature of this Bill is that it was introduced by a Minister who comes from a <Col N="1417" /> rural area, who realise how important it is for a Deputy to keep in touch with his constituents.</P>
    <P>I have a criticism to make of the Minister's proposal to amalgamate most of Monaghan with Cavan.  I have no objection to being linked with Cavan but I would like to point out that the constituency would be unwieldy. The Minister stated that he was endeavouring to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries. Not alone has the Minister breached the boundaries but, to use Paddy Kavanagh's phrase, he has put some of the &ldquo;stoney, grey soil of Monaghan&rdquo; into the very fertile land of Louth.  By doing this he has taken the birthplace and the resting place of Patrick Kavanagh&mdash;the only poet of note Monaghan has had&mdash;and transferred them to another constituency.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Oireachtas could decide to wipe the map clean and draw up new constituencies without any regard to the existing situation but that this was neither practicable nor desirable and that any revision of constituencies must take account not only of the constitutional requirements but also of the size and shape of existing constituencies, of local administrative boundaries and of physical features.  If this was the exercise he should have started in Donegal and continued on down.  His exercise is not to be commended.  The bulk of the representatives of Monaghan and Cavan seem to be in NorthWest Monaghan at present.  I do not think that is what he had in mind when he drew up this five-seat constituency. Across the border in Cavan, a short distance away, we have another representative and we have a Minister representing that area of Cavan too.  With the exception of one new Deputy, who seems to be moved to the far end of the constituency, they are all within a 13, 14, 20 mile radius.  I do not think that is why the Minister instituted this operation.  It is not a good job.  I believe the Coalition themselves will regret this exercise.  The people of Monaghan and Cavan will register their disapproval at the next opportunity. At the by-election we brought it to the people's notice that this was on the cards but I suppose they <Col N="1418" /> thought that the Minister might bring in some provision which would change this.</P>

        <i>Cavan</i>): Deputy Leonard seemed to suggest that a five-seat constituency consisting of Monaghan and Cavan was created by the Minister for Local Government in order to punish the people of Monaghan and Cavan who had three-seat constituencies since the last revision.  I do not think the Minister would have any reason to punish either Monaghan or Cavan because in their two three-seat constituencies, created by the former Minister for Local Government, Monaghan and Cavan behaved very well so far as the National Coalition were concerned. In 1969 Cavan returned two Fine Gael Deputies and one Fianna Fáil, and Monaghan returned two Fine Gael and one Fianna Fáil.  It is true that in the general election of this year the reverse was the case.  Cavan returned two Fianna Fáil and one Fine Gael and Monaghan returned two Fianna Fáil and one Fine Gael.

The health board architect has been instructed to prepare sketch plans of the health centre, and I do not anticipate any unusual difficulties arising on the subsequent planning and building stages of the project.</P>

As I indicated in my reply to a question on this subject on 18th June last, the further planning of stage two of the scheme, which will deal with the discharge of the town's sewage into deep water outside the harbour, depends on the outcome of additional technical investigations relating to the outfall area generally.  I understand that a report on these investigations is being prepared.</P>

      <P>Copies of the <i>Guide to the Redundancy Payments Scheme</i> have now been placed in the Oireachtas Library to facilitate Members of the Oireachtas.  I regret that due to an oversight they were not circulated to Members of the Oireachtas at the time of publication in 1971.  The system of distribution has been revised to ensure the problem does not arise with future publications.</P>
