    <Title>European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1973: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is, as already mentioned, also before the House an expediency motion to establish a Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I would propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission and with the agreement of the House that this motion should be discussed concurrently with the Second Stage of the Bill which is now being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the debate on the European Communities Act, 1972, Deputies <Col N="1340" /> have been practically unanimous in emphasising the necessity of establishing a Parliamentary Committee to consider draft Community legislation. More recently, the desirability of such a committee having a function in relation to regulations made by Ministers here under the European Communities Act, 1972, was also underlined.</P>
    <P>The expediency motion now before the House will establish a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas and give it authority to examine and report to the House of the Oireachtas at three different stages in the process of adoption of legislation by the Communities and of its implementation here.  At the first stage, draft acts for adoption by the Council &mdash;that is, draft regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions&mdash;can be examined by the committee who can report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on what in its view the attitude to be adopted by Ireland in their regard should be.</P>
    <P>At the second stage, the committee can examine the acts of the Council and of the Commission with a view to considering how best any obligations involved for Ireland might be implemented here.  I might perhaps remark in this connection that the decision-making power of the Commission is narrower than that of the Council in the sense that it is confined in effect to day-to-day administration of matters in respect of which the broad policy guidelines have been decided by the Council.</P>
    <P>The third stage at which the committee can intervene will be in relation to Ministerial regulations made here either under the European Communities Act, 1972, or under other statutes to implement our Community obligations.</P>
    <P>These are the important functions of the Joint Committee.  But, in connection with this third and last function of the committee it is proposed in the Amendment Bill that the committee should have power to recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that any national regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, be annulled and, if a resolution annulling a regulation is <Col N="1341" /> passed by both Houses, the regulation ceases to have statutory effect.</P>
    <P>Thus the confirmatory provisions in section 4 of the European Communities Act, 1972, become superfluous and the Amendment Bill removes them putting in their place, as I said a moment ago, a procedure for annulment instead.  Provision is also made in the Amendment Bill for the recall of the Dáil and/or the Seanad during adjournment on request of at least one-third of their Members in each case.  Such a recall would not, of course, apply in relation to regulations in respect of which a resolution for annulment had been tabled and defeated in either House.  Finally, and logically, it is provided that the new section should not apply either to regulation already confirmed in the European Communities (Confirmation of Regulations) Act, 1973, or to regulations which have already lapsed before the Bill passes&mdash;but, of course, it does apply to regulations made since the passage of the European Communities (Confirmation of Regulations) Act, 1973.</P>
    <P>The Expediency Motion and the Bill together represent, I think, a complex of measures which allows the Houses of the Oireachtas to involve themselves fully in the formulation of Community policy and in its implementation here.  As I have said elsewhere, the Secretariat of the committee will have the fullest co-operation of Government Departments in ensuring that the committee is informed of all relevant developments.  Ministers will also be happy to appear before the committee at mutually convenient times to discuss with the committee matters arising directly from secondary legislation.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a committee such as that proposed is an important new departure for the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government hope that its dual role will assist in increasing the effectiveness of the Irish input into the formulation of Community policy and in ensuring that the implementation of Community policy here is as appropriate as possible to Irish conditions. Both aspects of the committee's role can contribute to the greater involvement of the people in <Col N="1342" /> the evolution of European integration and thus to the creation of a European Union with which Irishmen in general can identify.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware of the interest the Government have shown in the whole question of improving the democratic process of the institutions of the European Communities.  It is our view that there is a pressing need to ensure effective control, through the European Parliament of the evolving European Communities.  This must be our primary objective&mdash;for nothing else will ensure the full operation of the democratic system in respect of Community matters.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill, introduced in response to legitimate concern expressed by Members of the Oireachtas, will not of itself provide an adequate answer to the problem. We should have no illusions on this score.  This Bill merely ensures that our own national parliamentary institutions will be able to control the manner of implementation of Community directives, to the extent that these directives leave room for national variations in their application.</P>
    <P>The real issue with which we must concern ourselves, however, is democratic control over the formulation of these directives themselves&mdash;and indeed of Community regulations and other decisions.  The establishment of the new Committee of the two Houses, for which provision is made in the Expediency Motion before the House, will provide a channel through which the Oireachtas can advise the Government on the approach it would wish the Government to take towards the formulation of Community legislation in the Council of Ministers.  But democratic control over the process of Community legislation can never be effective if it is confined to nine separate channels of national advice to nine Governments; it must also be brought to bear directly and in a unified way through a powerful European Parliament, its members elected direct by the peoples of the Communities.</P>
    <P>This is the objective of our policy. It is the Government's view that the extension of the powers of the European <Col N="1343" /> Parliament, and its direct election, are necessary preconditions of the establishment of an Economic and Monetary Union and of a European Union as projected for the year 1980. For without real democratic control through a directly-elected Parliament, such a Union involving as it will a full integration of the economies of member countries would be quite unacceptable to our people, and we believe also to the other peoples of the Communities.</P>
    <P>I see no conflict whatever between such a strengthening of the European Parliament and an expansion of our own Parliament's necessarily somewhat limited role in Community affairs: the two should and will complement each other.  Both are democratically necessary.  I hope that this debate will carry that message from this House to the country, and indeed from this State to the other member countries of the Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement emphasises two main points&mdash; the establishment of a committee and the power of a certain number of Members to recall either the Dáil or the Seanad during a period of recess. On both of these issues, I have no serious objection to the Minister's proposal.  At this stage I want to say that I am rather taken by surprise myself in that our spokesman on Foreign Affairs is not available.  I did not know until the House sat that he was not available.  In the last few minutes I have decided on my attitude to the Minister's opening speech.</P>
      <P>First of all, I take it that at this stage the composition of the committee is not in question apart from the fact that there will be the ten delegates to the European Parliament, together with 16 others, with certain proportions between the Seanad and the Dáil.  Otherwise composition has not been decided on.  Will the Minister confirm that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have indicated their views on the composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea of the setting-up of this Committee. <Col N="1344" /> It is obvious that with the volume of directives and regulations coming from Europe it would be impossible for the whole House, or for an individual Deputy, to examine these in a proper manner as they come.  I hope it will be possible for the Committee when set up to examine these matters and to report as succinctly and as intelligently as possible to the House, so that we will be in a position to know exactly what is happening.</P>
      <P>The second main point is the power of the joint committee to make recommendations for the annulment of regulations, or rather to recommend to the House resolutions annulling recommendations.  That is fair enough, during the course of the sitting of either House.  I am a little bit worried about section 1 (2) (a).  I do not wish to read it out at the moment, but in the first place it seems to me, on first reading it, that a certain number of members of Dáil Éireann or of Seanad Éireann, in fact one-third, can request the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, as the case may be, to recall either House, but it does not specifically say that the purpose of that recall is related to these regulations.  It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>If when regulations under this Act are made, or at any time within one year thereafter and while the regulations have statutory effect, Dáil Éireann stands adjourned for a period of more than ten days and if, during the adjournment, at least one-third of the members of Dáil Éireann by notice in writing to the Ceann Comhairle require Dáil Éireann to be summonded...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not say that the summoning of Dáil Éireann is related specifically to the regulations.  In effect, if regulations are made and if one-third of the Deputies get together and ask the Ceann Comhairle to summon Dáil Éireann, that one-third of the Members do not have to say to the Ceann Comhairle that they want to deal with these regulations.  They can summon Dáil Éireann on almost any issue totally unconnected with regulations or directives of the Common Market. This is my opinion as a result of a quick reading of the clause.  The <Col N="1345" /> Minister may be able to clarify that point.  He may be able, by reference back to the 1972 Act, specifically to relate the power of summoning to regulations or directives coming from the Community.</P>
    <P>I also want to make the point in relation to the number of Deputies or Senators who would have power to ask the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach to summon either House.  It seems to me that it gives the Opposition for the time being a rather undue advantage.  Again, specifically related to the fact that the purpose of the summoning is not specifically stated, one-third of the Opposition at any time could require the Ceann Comhairle to summon Dáil Éireann for any purpose. It suits us at the moment, but it gives an undue advantage to the existing Opposition in that one-third of their members could summon Dáil Éireann even for this specific purpose but, as it reads to me, for any purpose, as the Bill stands.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should amend that figure to one-half of the Members.  That would give the Government of the day reasonable assurance that the Dáil would not be summoned for less than serious matters. I should like the Minister, first of all, to correct me if I am wrong on the first point and also to deal with the second point which I think is a serious one because it would give the Opposition for the time being an undue advantage. If my interpretation of clause (2) (a) is correct the Dáil could be summoned for almost any purpose, unless the purpose is more specifically set out in this clause.</P>
    <P>On the general issues, we had the welcome visit here, during the past week&mdash;and it is still continuing&mdash;of the President of the European Parliament, Mr. C. Berkhouwer.  If he had any message for us it was the current ineptitude of the European Parliament in relation to the Council of Ministers and, secondly, the manner in which decisions are building up at Council of Ministers' level.  He foresees that at the present rate of decision-making the whole machinery is likely to become bogged down.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister <Col N="1346" /> in his opening statement that in order to ensure that our concept of democracy will be carried into the European Communities the European Parliament will have to get more powers and ultimately will have to be elected on universal suffrage.  In the meantime, now that the Minister himself is a member of the Council of Ministers, he will recognise that there is this build-up of decisions yet unmade, although they are important ones. Offhand, I do not know how increasing the power of Parliament would relieve the pressure on the Council of Ministers, but it is obvious that there could be some devolution of the power of the Council of Ministers to Parliament.</P>
    <P>This would almost necessarily involve an amendment of the original Treaty of Rome, although it provides that the Parliament have certain powers and can exercise certain strictures over the Commission but they have no power whatever in relation to the Council of Ministers.  It is rather too much on the pattern of the Council of Europe that the Council of Europe may make recommendations but that the Council of Ministers is omnipotent.  They may or may not accept any regulations no matter on what point emanating from that assembly.  It seems to me that there is a similar <i>modus operandi</i> imported into the European Communities.  It is one that ought to be cured very quickly.</P>
    <P>Other than these matters, I have no other points to make.  I feel strongly about one-third of the Members of the Dáil having power to recall the Dáil.  It is reasonable to assume that the Opposition at any time could summon one-third of the Dáil and so bring the Dáil back on any issue, as the Bill reads at present.  Even if that is cured, it would be an undue advantage if they could require the Dáil to sit even on issues relating to directives and regulations coming from the European Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the motion before the House.  I should like to make two brief comments. While welcoming the joint committee, I should like the Minister <Col N="1347" /> to elucidate what powers and privileges the committee and its members will enjoy.  I hope this committee will exercise a powerful influence on the formulation of policy in relation to Europe and in relation to its examination of directives and regulations. For it to be powerful in a parliamentary sense it is important that the committee should have proper powers such as powers in relation to calling witnesses and calling for documents.  It should have privileges analogous to the privileges which Members enjoy in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to elucidate those points particularly in view of his experience on a recent Dáil committee of inquiry which inquired into the matter of the £100,000.  I refer to the Committee of Public Accounts Special Inquiry into a grant in aid to relieve distress in Northern Ireland.  That committee found it was not as powerful as I would think it was originally intended to be.  This raises a valid point in relation to this joint committee and I should like the Minister to be a little more explicit on it.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to put to the Minister concerns the Council of Europe.  Is it intended at any stage to co-ordinate the involvement of Members of the Oireachtas in relation to development both in the EEC and the Council of Europe institutions? Recently, there was a wide-ranging debate in the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe on the very question of the future of the Council of Europe and its position <i>vis-á-vis</i> other European institutions.  Looking to the future, I think there is a problem in regard to the desire for co-ordination between the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. I know this is slightly outside the scope of the Bill before the House but I am sure the Minister will say something on it.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I received the Bill this morning and I have not had time to study it but I want to ask in regard to section 1 if the numbering is correct. <Col N="1348" /> Section 1 seems to me to be divided into subsection (1), subsection (2) and what would appear to be subsection (3) seems to be subsection (2) again. Perhaps there is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  Everything under the first two lines of section 1 is, in fact, in inverted commas. It is a quotation, so the (1) and (2) that you see on lines 9 and 22 are, in fact, within inverted commas and are part of subsection (1).  I think it is corectly numbered.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Bill and to compliment the Minister for bringing it in so soon in the light of the experience of the Irish members in the European Parliament and in the progress that has been made there to date.  The importance of regulations or draft regulations cannot be over-emphasised and the vast number of regulations going through each year is very difficult to keep abreast of.  I feel, however, that it is fortunate that the Treaty of Accession gives our Government authority to make or adapt some regulations so that the Community legislation will be enforced here to the advantage of our people and country.  By regulations formed to meet the Irish situation and the Irish position we will be enabled to obtain the maximum benefit from the Community legislation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A brief resumé of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the European Parliament will, perhaps, make it easier to follow what happens during the parliamentary sittings and the part it plays in the Community's decision-taking procedures. The European Parliament's main business is considering Community legislation proposed by the European Commission and of necessity these Bills are very often technical, <Col N="1349" /> as they are in national parliaments.  The final decision on them rests with the Council in which the Community's legislative power is vested.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament helps prepare Community legislation and the public discussion of proposals allows for a measure of democratic involvement in the Community's legislative work and provides a guarantee that it is brought to the notice of the public.  Parliamentary procedure gives members abundant opportunity to intervene and this is very important for another aspect of parliamentary work, that is, policy control.  It is the fact that members can intervene that enables Parliament to react directly to the latest developments in the Community, to call the Commission to account and to ask the Council for information.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament's main business is considering the legislation and the parliamentary procedure gives members abundant opportunities to intervene.  Members may, either individually or as members of groups, raise any point they think deserves the attention of parliament, the Commission or the Council.  For this purpose the members may adopt any one of a number of lines.  In the plenary sitting they can put oral questions, with or without debate, to the Commission or the Council.  These questions require the approval of the bureau of the Parliament which has a very strong governing body.  Motions tabled in Parliament are normally referred to the committee concerned except in the case of urgency.</P>
    <P>Question time, which, unfortunately, is not as effective as Question Time in this House, takes place on the second or third day of each meeting where if a point is not dealt with in full a group of at least five Members of Parliament may ask for a debate to follow directly.  That is technically described as a debate on request.  Outside the plenary session it is possible for members to put written questions to the Commission or the Council and answers are published in the official journal of the Community. Oral or written motions are taken in <Col N="1350" /> the relevant committees of Parliament and if a member raises a point in committee the discussions may result in a decision by the committee concerned either to put an oral question, with or without debate, to the Commission or the Council or to submit a report on the matter to the plenary assembly.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for members to get acclimatised to this rather complicated procedure.  The dual mandate of the Irish Members of the European Parliament is a heavy burden.  I am glad that a joint committee is being set up and I am sure it will help to ease the burden of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who have the honour to represent Ireland in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Irish Members have a difficult task. One does not have to be in the European Assembly for very long to appreciate that our facilities are not to be compared with the facilities offered to our European colleagues. Many of the European Parliaments provide members with a political aide or assistant.  I know one member who asks many questions and who has made quite an impression in the European Parliament; he has two personal assistants, one is provided by Parliament and the other by a trust.  It is difficult for Members of the Oireachtas to compete with people who have this dynamic background service.  I hope the joint committee will be staffed by people of sufficient calibre so that they may help to make matters easier for the Irish members of the European Parliament.  We must ensure that we have adequate senior staff to operate the workings of the committee.</P>
    <P>Between now and the re-assembly of the Dáil the new members of the joint committee should attend the September Plenary Session in Luxembourg and also visit one or two of the working committees in Brussels.  It is necessary that members of this committee should see the institutions of the European Parliament in working session.  Finance must be provided to enable these people to understand the workings of the institutions of the Community.  This matter is a complex <Col N="1351" /> one and is different from what is done in this country.  In addition to attending at the sessions in Luxembourg and Brussels, the members of the committee should also arrange a tour of the Berlaymont Building which is the Commissioners building and also the building of the Council of Ministers because, unless one visits these places and attends at meetings, it is difficult to understand the rather peculiar way they do things in these countries.</P>
    <P>In the six months we have been members of this greater Europe, our country has made quite an impression. I should like to take this opportunity of referring to the Irish Commissioner. He has the difficult task of setting up the Social Affairs Commission; this has not attracted tremendous publicity but by his dedication and the excellent work done by his cabinet, the commissioner and his colleagues have made quite an impact on the Community and have earned the respect of those people with whom they have been in contact. Our commissioner has one of the more difficult tasks to perform; it has not been said here and I should like to take this opportunity of referring to it now.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me in the past few weeks by nationals who are living and working in Europe that one feels proud to be Irish.  Perhaps it is not the correct thing to do in his presence, but I should like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has done a tremendous job for our country.  Some weeks ago there was a leading article in <i>Le Monde</i> to the effect that this small, insignificant country is providing the Council with a world statesman.  This is generally accepted in Europe and I wish the Minister continued success in his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last six months I have had the pleasure of serving in the European Parliament with my distinguished colleagues. Michael Hilliard has had a distinguished career in Irish politics and I <Col N="1352" /> should like to pay tribute to the work done by him and Sir Anthony Esmonde in the last six months.  They have introduced the less experienced members to this new kind of political life and but for them we would not have had the opportunity of being introduced to people who have made European political history in the last ten or 20 years.  Their contributions have been noticed and have been commented on.</P>
      <P>There are many small matters that make it difficult for the Irish members to get to and from the Continent. In the last few months there has been a certain amount of carping about executive jets.  Nevertheless, we must face the reality that the dual role of being a Member of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament is extremely difficult.  It takes the Irish Members almost 12 hours to get to Strasbourg or Luxembourg and this creates difficulties.  That is bad enough, but when one has to wait 30 or 40 minutes in a queue to get out of the car park at Dublin Airport one is not altogether awed with the efficiency and services of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus who are paid to transport us.  The Irish members were told they would probably have to spend a week per month on the continent but it has not worked out that way.  Most of us have made more than 20 trips to Europe in the past few months; this is greatly in excess of what we were led to believe and it is difficult to sustain this pace.  I should like to see everything possible done to make the journey to and from Europe easier and less tiring.</P>
      <P>We need a telex service in Leinster House.  It is not good enough for members of the European Parliament to be cut off as we do not have daily papers when we are abroad and it is difficult to keep in touch with events at home.  Small things like this mean a tremendous lot to members.  I am speaking of the ten Irish representatives. I do not profess to speak for them, but our problems are the same. Some effort should be made to provide these facilities so that we could more easily keep in touch with what is happening back home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> Irish industry in general has not &ldquo;copped&rdquo; on to the fact that many regulations affecting their products and their profits are being made in Europe, and that an opportunity is given to the members of the European Parliament to comment on these things and to amend the regulations governing them.  Only two Irish industries have contacted me about problems coming before the Parliament. This is a pity.  Perhaps the others do not realise that we have this opportunity.  A huge publicity operation is necessary to alert industry to that fact.  It would be very helpful to the Irish delegates if we had memoranda on these matters so that we would know exactly what suits Irish industry and Irish companies.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the semi-State organisations.  Many Bills and regulations have gone through dealing with sugar but I have had no memorandum from the Irish Sugar Company, which is a semi-State organisation.  We have had regulations dealing with duty free shops at airports and air control, and yet we had no memorandum of any description from Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus.  The list is never-ending. There are 3,000 or 4,000 regulations affecting every facet of our life going through each year.  If we are to be in a position to do the maximum amount of good for our country, and the people whom it is our honour and privilege to represent, we must have the back-up support so that we can speak with authority and fight for amendments to regulations to provide the maximum advantage for our people.</P>
    <P>Over the period when we were initiated into Europe the tremendous help given by the personnel of our mission to delegates in helping us to settle in and in explaining the various procedures, has been of great value to us and is deeply appreciated by the ten delegates.  I hope the Dáil will pass this Bill.  I should like to compliment the Minister on bringing it in so quickly.  It will be very difficult to find the ten Members of the European Parliament here on any one day during the session and, therefore, it is necessary to have a wider committee. <Col N="1354" /> I should like to see the committee broken down into sub-committees. This would make it easier to handle the regulations and we could have more expertise brought to bear on these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that Dáil and Seanad Éireann should be well informed of the EEC activities. Every Member of both Houses should be well briefed.  For that reason this committee will be of great importance. I should like to make a few suggestions in regard to the operation of this committee, not alone its operation in respect of directives and regulations which we can alter in the European Parliament but also other directives and regulations which we cannot influence.  As the last speaker said, all the directives and regulations made in Europe affect our industry, our economy generally, and the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>It is not satisfactory that we, as Members of Dáil Éireann, should try to elicit information on specific directives or regulations by way of question and reply in this House.  Having regard to the amount of work ordinary Deputies have to do and the amount of time they have to spend on other matters, this is sometimes the only way they can get quick, short, concise information on these directives.  I suggest that when the committee is set up we should have an information bureau from which we could find out the gist of a directive, what it intends to do, what it purports to do, and what, in fact, it will do.  Any interested Deputy whose constituents may be affected, or any Deputy who has a wider interest than his constituency alone, should be able to get the full momorandum on that directive and study its implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that Deputies should be taken by the hand and told what each directive or regulation means, but I am suggesting that, in general, all these regulations and directives should be spelled out concisely in brochure form which will make it clear to each one of us what the directive is, what it seeks to do, and so on, and even that it exists.  Our <Col N="1355" /> major problem is that we are not <i>au fait</i> with all the directives and regulations.  For instance, how many Deputies know that by 1st September a directive will bring into operation assistance to the less-favoured farming areas?  I tried to get some information on this by way of question.  I did not succeed.  I am interested.  On 1st September this year, two months' hence, benefits of various kinds will be available to certain areas known as the less-favoured areas.  I have no way of finding out what is happening. Have the Government put forward proposals for these areas?  What are the proposals?  What areas do they affect?  What influence can I, as an ordinary Deputy, have on the Government in listing the proposals?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy.  Doubtless what he is commenting upon is of great interest, but it could hardly be related to the subject matter we are discussing: the setting-up of a joint committee, and the reviewing of regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that something should be done to take Deputies like myself out of the predicament that I find myself in in regard to only one directive of the EEC which is in the offing.  There is information which I could not and cannot get on one proposed directive. I hope the committee will be able to follow up that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Social Fund I give one example of what I suggest the committee should be able to do. I suggest that even before directives and regulations are made, the committee should issue information so that Members of this House who may not be on the committee would have some access to a pool of information and can know what suggestions are <Col N="1356" /> being made in preparation for and anticipation of a directive of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Government, State agencies and private companies have put forward suggestions for aid under the Social Fund.  How am I as an ordinary Deputy to find out what these suggestions are, what proposals for aid have been put forward?  How can I object to them or seek to have additions made?</P>
    <P>These are two examples of the many problems facing the ordinary Member of the House.  For that reason I welcome the proposal contained in the Bill.  I hope it will go some of the way.  It would not be possible at any stage for every Deputy and every Government in every member State of the EEC to be fully up-to-date and &ldquo;with it&rdquo; as far as all the operations of the European Parliament are concerned. I am not asking for this.  I am asking for what I think we should have and that I think we can have in a reasonable form, namely, advice from a committee which, as Deputy McDonald has said, should have reasonable staffing so that it could look after the working of the committee but, over and above that, would be able to assist ordinary Members of both Houses who may wish to have access to the information they require in the everyday work of Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome this Bill in the main and, certainly, I welcome the spirit of the Bill.  It is very important to ensure that our national or parliamentary institutions will have some say and control over the implementation of Community directives, especially as they affect this country.  It is also important that the representatives of this Parliament going to the European Parliament should speak in unison about such directives or about any legislation that comes before that Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we are a member of three different groups in the European Parliament. This committee will ensure that at least we have harmonisation of thinking and of action in that <Col N="1357" /> European Parliament regardless of what political group our representatives may belong to.  It is important that this joint committee would have available to it the expert personnel that would be needed to interpret legislation and to prepare briefs for all the Members in the European Parliament. Our Members have been to some extent the poor relations of the other Members.  It is a sad state of affairs that we in Parliament should let our Members go out so ill-prepared.</P>
    <P>A tremendous amount of the legislation in the European Parliament is of a highly technical nature and unless one is a specialist one very often finds it practically impossible to interpret the ramifications of certain lines or paragraphs or, indeed, pages of the various Bills that may be going through the European Parliament. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the Minister should make available to this committee a reservoir of technical men who can advise our Members.</P>
    <P>In addition, extensive minutes of these meetings should be available to the Members of both Houses because, naturally, the questions that will be raised at the meetings will affect us all and there might be questions that some of us who are not at these meetings would like to raise but would have no opportunity of doing so unless we were to get exact and comprehensive minutes of the proceedings of the committee.</P>
    <P>It is rather ironic that we had Deputy McDonald, if not saying so in words, at least implying the loss of the executive jet.  I agree with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was unfortunate that during the election campaign we made a political issue of this proposal. The Deputy did admit that he did not realise that he would have to go so <Col N="1358" /> many times to Europe and the number of times will increase as we become more involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with the back-up necessary for our parliamentarians in Europe.  I only refer to it in passing as Deputy McDonald referred to it.  Nevertheless, there should be absolutely no impediment in the way of our representatives going to Europe comprehensively briefed and having available to them all the expert knowledge that even is available to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I realise that in a Bill such as this, which is a new departure, inevitably some mistakes will be made.  The Bill will probably not find its true level for some time until we have ironed out all the flaws that may be in it. Nevertheless, the Bill is a tremendously important step by this Parliament. It is vital that every Member of the House should give the spirit of the Bill wholehearted support because there is a pressing need to ensure that this House to some extent has effective control through the European Parliament of the evolving legislation and directives that may be coming through.  Very often when they arrive here and possibly are passed by this House we have, in the main, only a very vague knowledge of the implications of these directives. This committee will, to a certain extent, ensure that nobody can say that he did not know what the implications of pieces of legislation were. I commend the Minister for bringing in this Bill.  It is important that we have this back-up service for our parliamentarians and that our men can speak with knowledge and, indeed, with the certainly that they represent the views of this House because of the establishment of a committee such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on this Bill.  Everybody should know by now that our way of life from now on will be directed from Brussels to a large extent.  I was astonished to hear from <Col N="1359" /> Deputy McDonald about the very poor communication there is between here and Brussels.  Even during the campaign for entry to the EEC I said there was no use talking about what type of EEC you had, that it was what type of EEC you were going to have that mattered.  With nine countries in the EEC now, as compared with six before, the whole policy of the EEC will change drastically in the next few years.  We must have the best brains and the best methods of communication between this House and Brussels.  We, even as a small nation, should be able to play a major part in changing the structure of the EEC.</P>
      <P>It was also astonishing to hear Deputy McDonald saying that he was not sufficiently briefed on what was suitable to Irish industry.  I am very interested in wool.  I heard recently of people who went to France and they did not even know that we produced wool.  We must have a back-up service behind our attaches, too, to sell Ireland abroad.  We are treating our entry to the EEC much too lightly.  We went in for benefits.  If we do not send the best brains to Europe and if we do not have a back-up of expert advice behind those people, we cannot play our part in Europe or reap the benefits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham mentioned many things that I would have liked to mention.  I am very interested in what is to come from the Regional Development Fund.  I tabled a question the other day and I was astonished to hear that drainage is not covered. This may not be relevant but I welcome this Bill because we want to know more about what is happening in Europe.  I found that no money was to come to the Land Commission. This affects my area.  I heard that the only things that were covered were industry and making farms viable.  I do not know whether this is true or not but we just do not know enough about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see a situation in which, if the European Parliament were in session and if the Dáil were in session, our Members over there <Col N="1360" /> would know exactly what happened here the day before and we would know, and have a brief discussion here if necessary, if there were any changes made at the EEC which would affect this country.  Deputies here just do not know what is going on in Europe.  This Bill will do a good deal to provide the type of service which we want.  Deputy McDonald, in a very fine contribution, let us know a little about our shortcomings in regard to Europe.  As Deputy Cunningham said, we will have certain directives in September which will play a vital part in deciding whether a big area in my part of the country will survive or not and I know very little about them.  I would like to know a little more.  I hope more news will be given to this House about what is happening in Europe and that our people over there will know quickly what is happening here.  More of what is happening in the European Parliament should be debated here because it is of such vital importance to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important statement in the Minister's brief is:</P>
      <P>As I have said elsewhere, the secretariat of the committee will have the fullest co-operation of Government Departments in ensuring that the committee is informed of all relevant developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the secretariat will be bombarded with questions from Deputies.  The Community, as distinct from the Council of Europe, the UN or any other international body, affects the lives of every man, woman and child in the country. Therefore, the secretariat will be most important.  At the moment one can get a lot of documentation in the Library but I hope the headquarters of the secretariat will be in the House, as is the secretariat of the Committee of Public Accounts, so that Deputies, can go to members of the committee and get information.  As Deputy Callanan said, Deputies, Senators and others are not familiar with the directives.  I, as a parliamentarian, and Deputy Herbert and Deputy <Col N="1361" /> McDonald, can assure the House that we get volumes of stuff that we have not got the time even to read if we are to look after our constituencies and do other work.  We want a secretariat that will give us a concise brief of what is going on.  There is a weekly leaflet from the Confederation of Irish Industries issued each week which gives a synopsis of directives and decisions taken in the Community. This is an excellent document.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers is the decision-making body.  The European Parliament is still a consultative assembly. The Ministers are based in nine different states and have the problems of all matters connected with foreign affairs.  How can they deal with the Community as well which would be almost a fulltime job for a Minister? The Minister for Foreign Affairs will have to go to the United Nations in September and spend a certain amount of time there.  He will agree with me that at the moment on his desk in Brussels there are probably 300 to 400 resolutions or matters awaiting decision.  I do not know how this will be resolved, whether the Government will decide to appoint a European Minister or whether the Minister will have a Parliamentary Secretary who will act as Minister for Foreign Affairs while the Minister becomes Minister for Europe.</P>
    <P>Because it deals with the economy and the life of the people the EEC means more than any other organisation. I have been a member of the Council of Europe.  To the ordinary people the Council of Europe did not mean as much as the Community does.  They passed certain resolutions dealing with international travel, with transport, with matters that were not real bread and butter issues such as have to be dealt with now by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I welcome the part where the Minister refers to direct elections.  At the last summit that was held, as far as I am aware, the heads of Government were unanimous in their decision to give <Col N="1362" /> the European Parliament the power they need instead of, as at present, where they are all elected to their own parliaments, but then they are selected to serve in the European Parliament.  They will get certain budgetary powers in 1975, but if the Parliament of Europe is to be a decision-making Parliament with legislative powers, then the members of that Parliament must be elected directly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not here this morning for the Minister's speech, and it is a pity the Bill was circulated only this morning; in other words, we were unaware of this very important subject we are discussing. However, I welcome the committee and the fact that they will examine draft reports.  One of the most important drafts to be sent out by the Commission, especially in relation to this country, was the draft report on the guidelines for regional policy.  This was sent to the Council of Ministers in May this year.  It was returned to the Parliament to express an opinion.  A very fine report was presented by the rapporteur, Mary Delmotte of Belgium, and this very important document was discussed at length at the last plenary session in the presence of the Regional Commissioner, Mr. George Thompson. This very comprehensive and detailed report was lauded by Mr. Thompson. However, while I understand that the guidelines in this draft report were discussed in the Bundestag, in the House of Commons, and in almost every parliament in Europe, they were not discussed at all here.  I am the only member of the Irish delegation on that committee.  I had to do my own research, get opinions here and there from industry and from educational authorities, because it also embraces education.  This was the great defect, and I welcome the fact that this is being corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that my colleague, Deputy McDonald, spoke about the lack of briefing.  This is an enormous disadvantage for us.  We have been living out there in a vacuum since last January.  Our friends in the Irish mission in Brussels were very cooperative <Col N="1363" /> and gave every possible assistance, but this is not the type of service we are looking for.  We want a service that will give us a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of any subject in which we are interested. We are interested in very narrow fields of the European Parliament's activities.  I myself am interested in regional policy and transport. I specialise in this field as my colleagues specialise in their particular fields.  A briefing service is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Tom Nolan, spoke about direct elections.  I am all for direct elections, but I realise they are a long way off.  I also realise that while the European Parliament is the least powerful of the four institutions it is by far the most important. One has to democracise the entire concept; otherwise we shall become bogged down in bureaucracy.  The only way to democratise the concept is through the European Parliament. Our powers must be strengthened.  We should have the power of initiation in certain fields.  The budgetary powers are to be increased by 1975, and that brings me to another point.</P>
    <P>The Members of the European Parliament should receive every protection from their national government. It was suggested in a jocose way the other night that they should have the privilege of automatic reelection to the national parliament, but it should be appreciated that European parliamentarians make a huge sacrifice in trying to exercise dual membership.  The ten members of the European Parliament should be able to nominate a secretary to look after constituency work, and the State should pay for it.  When I say &ldquo;a secretary&rdquo; I mean a person who would do all the things we would normally do when we are at home, give our constituents our personal attention, deal with correspondence, perform all the day-to-day duties of a Deputy.  This would necessitate the appointment of a secretary of high calibre at a good salary.</P>
    <P>If the Government do not help to <Col N="1364" /> diminish the degree of political hazard entailed in trying to exercise a dual mandate, then many of us will have second thoughts.  None of us wants to commit political hari-kari.  We might return back to our people, and it might be difficult to get replacements. I do not know whether my colleague, Deputy McDonald, spoke about the jet.</P>

      <P>I think I have made my point about the foolishness of the Government on insisting on scrapping this jet.  Perhaps they will regret that before too long.  I should refer now to the latest happening in the European Parliament.  This is the advent of the new philosophy in the European Parliament.  I am a member of Fianna Fáil.  I am very proud and privileged to belong to the latest alignment in the European scene, the European Progressive Democrats.  We have been very much-maligned in recent weeks.  The other night, on a very solemn occasion, the Minister saw fit to make a caustic reference to this new party.  I am very proud to belong to that new party.  We will transcend many boundaries.  At the moment we embrace two countries but, as time goes by, we will spread out into the other member states.  I welcome the new Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clear up something for me.  The main purpose of this Bill is to substitute or to put into the original 1972 Act a new subsection (4), which is comprised in lines 10 to 45 on page 2 of this Bill.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on that, I take it that the purpose is that all the regulations which were confirmed by the European Communities (Confirmation of Regulations) Act, 1973, are now, as it were, firmly established and will not come within it and cannot be dealt with by the new committee in so far as referring them to this House at the moment is concerned? That Act confirmed about 19 regulations which were made under the original Communities Bill.  They are sacrosanct, as it were, and cannot be referred by this new committee to the House for annulment.</P>

      <P>They could be discussed by the new committee and examined, presumably, but without the follow-up of referring them to this House for annulment.  It is not a very vital point.  There is another matter which I wanted to raise.  The European Communities Act, 1972, will now have included in it, by virtue of this Bill, a new section 4.  Would that not, in itself, have been sufficient to deal with regulations made under the 1972 Act but not yet confirmed? Are the opening lines of subsection (2) of section 1 of this Bill really necessary?  Would the insertion of the new amended section 4 into the original Act not have been sufficient?</P>
      <P>There is one final point.  The old procedure of having a Confirmation Bill drawn up and introduced in the House at least listed and brought to our immediate attention the regulations made at a certain period.  They were compiled for us and brought to our attention in a very specific and direct way.  The new committee will be going through all these various regulations and examining them, but there will be many Members of this House who will not be on that committee. Would the Minister consider substituting some new process whereby these regulations will be brought to the general attention of the House in the same way as they were when they had to be included in a list in the confirmation legislation?</P>

      <P>I must apologise to the House for the fact that the Bill was not before them until today. This was connected with the wording of the motion.  Various problems arose about it which were not settled finally until yesterday.  In retrospect, it seems that we probably could have published the Bill before finalising the motion but that was not clear to us at the time.  That is why the Bill was not published until today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has resolved the problem by absorbing the Bill rapidly and Deputies have raised important points in connection with the Bill.  The points raised by the Leader of the Opposition about the power to summon <Col N="1367" /> the Dáil or the Seanad by one-third of the Members is the point which I wish to deal with first.  It is rather curious that we in Government should seek to give power to the Opposition and that the Leader of the Opposition should be seeking to hand it back to us.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition what was puzzling was that, as Deputy J. Gibbons so appropriately said, the section which he objected to was in the Act introduced by his Government.  This provision about the power of one third to recall is in the original Act. I do not know why the Leader of the Opposition should feel it was all right to trust Fine Gael and Labour with this power but as soon as Fianna Fáil get into Opposition the power must be removed.  I think, in fairness to the Leader of the Opposition, he did not have an opportunity to study this Bill because of the short notice.  Indeed, as he told the House, he was standing in for Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  Last night he was slightly critical of the Opposition party and the fact that we were all in attendance for a piece of legislation dealing with <Col N="1368" /> Oireachtas salaries.  He said he hoped we would continue this attendance.  I just want to point out that at the present moment there are quite a few Opposition members present and only one Government member and it would be as well if we had a quorum to hear the Minister.</P>

      <P>May I bring up a point of information in relation to what Deputy Lynch said?  He was talking about giving this power to one third of either House without specifying for what.  He mentioned there was no reference in the Bill to the fact that it might be in relation to the European regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point. When Deputy Haughey called for a quorum, I was just trying to deal with this point and to say that in the original Bill there is the same lack of any specific limitation.  The only change in wording is a technical one related to the fact that the original legislation involved confirmation in six months.  This is open-ended and in order to close the open endedness there is a one year time limit.  Apart from that technical change the wording of what is here is identical with the wording in the original Bill.  It seemed appropriate to the previous Government&mdash;we welcomed it at the time&mdash;that there should be this power and it was not found necessary or, perhaps, possible to limit the power specifically in so many words to recall the Dáil to deal with the particular regulations.  I am not clear how, in fact, that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the power to recall the Dáil is something which I think has to be technically left open-ended but when the Dáil is recalled, unless there is a Private Member's motion of some kind put down by the Opposition <Col N="1369" /> on the particular regulation it is a matter for the Government to decide what public business is to be discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to harass the Minister but there have been occasions over the years when the Opposition asked to have the Dáil recalled for other reasons.  I think what Deputy Lynch was referring to was that the Bill did not state for what reason it could be recalled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was going to deal with.  The fact is if you are going to allow the Opposition to recall the Dáil the control of what the Dáil discusses when it has been recalled is something which will rest with the House.  As regards Private Members' Time the Opposition can put down a motion but as far as Government business is concerned the Taoiseach decides that.  If the Dáil resumes, the Taoiseach can simply say there is no business, that it was a frivolous recall and the Dáil adjourns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the wording is exactly the same. Surely the difference is between the Dáil and the Seanad.  The original section 4 of the 1972 Act dealt only with the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but the principle of recall of a House of the Oireachtas by one-third without the limitation of a subject matter was clearly established by the previous administration.  Of course, we are bringing the Seanad in now because the new system involves the Seanad. That is new though not so much a matter for us to debate as for the Seanad to debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My only point was that inadvertently the Minister said the words were exactly the same as in the original section, whereas he now says he is bringing in the Seanad as well as the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The wording in the original legislation relating to the Dáil is identical with the wording here relating to the Dáil <Col N="1370" /> except for the technical change I mentioned.  There is, of course, the additional provision now relating to the Seanad.  I am sorry if I did not make that clear.  The position is that the previous Government, rightly I think, decided they would take the risk of a frivolous recall of the Dáil by the Opposition, that they could rely on the Opposition not acting in that way. We feel the same way.  I am quite happy to accept that Deputy Lynch will not recall the Dáil on something frivolous or attempt to pretend to use some ministerial regulation arising from the EEC as an excuse to recall the Dáil with a view to discussing something else.  I do not expect the Leader of any Opposition in the House to behave in that way and were it attempted the Taoiseach would simply say that there was no business and the Dáil would adjourn. I do not think there is a problem here.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything we have to worry about.  It seems to us it is right that if you are going to have parliamentary control and if it is going to be possible for the Dáil and Seanad to challenge regulations, and as these regulations can have immediate significant effect on economic and other interests in this country, the power must be one that could be exercised even if Dáil and Seanad are in recess.  You should not have a situation in which the Dáil and Seanad are frustrated.  If there is a matter which the committee feel should be raised and which one third of the Members feel should be raised you should not have a situation in which it is not possible for the Dáil or Seanad to meet.  Despite what Deputy Lynch has said, I would stand on the provisions here as they introduce no new principle as far as this House is concerned and merely extend to the Seanad the provisions made in respect of the Dáil in the original legislation.  So much for that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey raised a point earlier on about the numbering of the sections of the Bill.  I think what misled him is that alignment of the figures in brackets on the first page of the Bill is misplaced.  Subsection (2) <Col N="1371" /> (a), which is within the quotation marks, is aligned with subsection (1) of the Bill itself.  It should be aligned with subsection (1) within the quotation marks.  That is something which, I think, can be corrected in the printing.  Indeed, when I glanced at it when the Deputy raised the point, I had the same difficulty in reading it.  I think he was quite right to draw attention to that fact.</P>
    <P>He also asked if there would be power for the committee to discuss old regulations, even those which are now, in fact, law.  As I understand the terms of reference of the committee, any regulations of the EEC can be discussed.  I do not think there is any difficulty about that although, of course, they cannot be challenged by way of the procedure here because they have already been confirmed. The purpose of subsection (2) of the Bill is to ensure that where the confirmatory procedure has gone through, as we went through it a short time ago, in respect of a certain body of regulations they stand.  We are now introducing a new procedure for regulations not already confirmed by the Houses of the Oireachtas so subsection (2) of the Bill is necessary for that purpose as I understand it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also pointed out that there would be no listing of regulations if we changed the procedure as we are now proposing to do.  This is true so far as a Bill is concerned but we have and we intend to retain the system of twice yearly reports on the EEC, on how the legislation of the EEC is evolving and how it affects this country.  Within that twice yearly report we propose to list ministerial regulations made here, so that they are in handy form and are available just as frequently as previously but in this format rather than in the form of a Bill.  I think that problem can be solved in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I am at fault in that case.  I think there may be some confusion here.  I do not think we have been asked to produce a printed report more frequently than twice yearly&mdash;although I am open to correction on this point.  Members of both Houses are anxious to hear more frequently about issues that arise with regard to EEC membership and on this I have an open mind.  Without tying the hands of the Government or the House in a particular way, the position should be open for Ministers to make reports at various points when major issues arise and they should find an opportunity for discussion in the House without waiting for six months when the issue may be a dead one.  On this point the Government are sympathetic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get some order into this.  When we come to the actual legislation of the Community, that is best handled in the first instance through the committee which can report to the House.  When we come to major policy issues coming up for consideration, this House should be able to advert to them at an appropriate stage and to give its views.  That point has been mentioned here already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Deputy is referring to is that various forms of legislation of the Community, whether decisions, recommendations, regulations or directives, are prepared in draft in the first instance by the Commission and they are processed before being adopted.  I want to distinguish between the actual draft legislation, which is probably best processed through the committee and brought before this House when the committee consider it necessary and, on the other hand, major policy areas such as the Regional Fund <Col N="1373" /> which is under discussion at the moment.  The question has been properly raised in this debate by the Leader of the Opposition of the inadequacy of the decision-making procedures of the Community.  Matters such as this, and also the GATT mandate and the United States approach to the European countries, are matters that could be discussed in this House, and the Government are open to discussion on how this could best be done.  It would be a mistake to close this off and to say we cannot discuss these matters for six months until the problem is settled&mdash;and perhaps settled in a manner of which the House would not approve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with that point.  I have suggested that they be listed in the printed report issued every six months which is given to this House.  This listing will be in handy form and will be issued as frequently as obtained under the other procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, any regulations of this House which up to now had to be confirmed but which no longer will have to be specifically confirmed will be so listed in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am sorry I did not make that clear.  I tried to deal with that before discussing the more general question of the right of the House to discuss major issues.  We will need to make a distinction between the work of the committee at legislative level and the right of this House to discuss major policy issues. The Government will be open to ideas on how this can best be done.  Without clogging up the business of the House we should have such discussions from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised about the committee as well as more general points and I should like to deal first with those which relate to the committee and their work.  Deputy <Col N="1374" /> Collins raised a question regarding the powers of the committee.  The committee will not have the kind of power of the Public Accounts Committee or the kind of power that committee thought they had.  I do not think it would be appropriate to this committee. The committee is not a committee such as the Public Accounts Committee which is designed to pursue to an ultimate conclusion exactly what happens to funds dispensed under the authority of the Government and the House.  This was the view of the previous Government put to us in Opposition and they persuaded us at that time that there was merit in it.</P>
    <P>This committee should work more informally, and should have a secretariat which should have the co-operation of the Government Departments.  The secretariat should be able to furnish to the committee any information needed.  We thought, as did the previous Government, that the committees should not have power to call for papers or persons. So far as papers are concerned, some of them necessarily would be confidential negotiating documents which it would not be appropriate to have published at a particular time.  So far as persons are concerned, the work of the various Departments, some of them under great pressure, could be disrupted if the committee had power to call on one or all of them at any time.  Moreover, from the committee's point of view, it seems better that the committee should have their own secretariat working for them rather than being dependent on civil servants being called before them to give evidence and who would primarily be concerned with their allegiance to their own Minister.  The system under which the committee would have their secretariat which would have the co-operation of Government Departments is more effective.  If at any stage there was a feeling on the part of the committee that they were not getting that co-operation, the matter could be looked at again.  I can assure the House it is the intention of the Government to extend the fullest co-operation.</P>
    <Col N="1375" />
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state the composition of the secretariat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, that is a matter I think the committee should take up, probably through the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, with the Minister for Finance.  It is not within my competence.  My view, and I think the view of the Government also, is that any reasonable proposals will be sympathetically considered by the Government but I do not think I should lay that down in detail.  I am expressing a personal view about a matter that is not in my area of competence, that the secretariat could usefully be linked with those people who will be assisting the delegations to the European Parliament. What I personally have in mind would be a secretariat which would include officers whose job it is to service the committee and to service and assist the delegations to the European Parliament.  As a minimum, it is my view that each delegation should have at least one person to help them.  It is right that the Opposition delegation should have someone directly available to them to assist them.  However, it is a matter for the committee and for the European Parliament delegation, severally or jointly, to make representations as to what they consider they need in the matter of assistance.  Probably the right thing for them to do would be to start in a very modest way and if they find they have not enough help they could go back to the Minister for Finance who, I am sure, will be sympathetic on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the secretariat have the right of access to Government Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have emphasised this.  They would have the co-operation and assistance of Government Departments to ensure that the committee and the delegations to the European Parliament are fully informed.  As I said in my opening speech, Ministers will be prepared to appear before the committee to discuss secondary legislation if the <Col N="1376" /> committee so wish.  This could be done at a mutually convenient time; we do not need a formal procedure for summoning Ministers.  They would be willing to appear as and when this is thought desirable.</P>
      <P>In this way we have provided a framework and a basis for the work of the committee.  What we should do is to proceed with it.  In introducing this legislation and the motion today, I am doing so because of my anxiety to ensure that the various processes will be put through in time for the committee to be established before the Dáil adjourns for the summer recess so that the committee will be able to meet during that period.  The committee will need to formulate staff requirements and they will need to discuss how best they can work so that when the new session starts not only in this House but in Strasbourg and Luxembourg a nucleus of staff be there to assist them.  In this connection, perhaps I should explain to the House that, in addition to the expediency motions being brought forward in this House today and in the Seanad next week, when they have been passed in both Houses there will have to be motions nominating members of the committee.  That will be discussed by the Whips.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition raised the question of whether the composition of the committee was involved today.  It is not so involved.  The position is that there will be the ten members of the European Parliament plus 16 others.  The ten are fixed by prior agreement and the breakdown of the 16 is for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it will be in the same ratio as in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The view of the Government is that the composition should reflect the composition of the two Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the two Houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the two Houses are on it.  The representation of the Parties and Independents should be in that ratio.  The Government, being anxious to give the fullest facilities to <Col N="1377" /> the Opposition, are willing to concede one of their number to which they are proportionately entitled, to bring up the Opposition strength.  This would involve that, instead of the Opposition having six of the 16, they would have seven of the 16, reducing the Government's representation proportionately by one.  The composition then would be seven from the Opposition party, one Independent and eight Members of the Government, of whom I believe six would be Fine Gael and two Labour.  That is proportionate to the membership of the two Houses, with a shift of one actually from Fine Gael to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a new departure to give more than proportional representation, I suppose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the European Parliament delegation, the figures were worked out as near as you can get with ten to proportionality. Again the Opposition have a little more than their share, but the rounding up process has to take place, and fractions of Deputies are hard to find.  I am merely stating what the Government's view is.  I am not certain that the discussions have been concluded on this matter, but the Government are prepared to concede one of their proportionate membership for this purpose.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other points about the committee with which I should like to deal.  A point was raised by a number of Deputies as to whether Deputies of the House other than members of the Committee would have access to the secretariat and to information.  It seems to me that the most convenient way to handle the information needs of the Deputies is, on the one hand, to ensure that there is sufficient information in the Library and&mdash;again I express a personal view&mdash;to ensure that the Library is adequately staffed to assist Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> In so far as Deputies are seeking information, it would be convenient if the secretariat were able to assist Deputies who are not members, but I can do no more than express that view because what the staff of the committee does must be a matter for the committee.  It would be in line with commonsense if the committee, when they meet, decided to permit the secretariat to answer inquiries from other Members of the House.  That is a matter for the committee when they meet and decide on their secretariat.  It seems to be a convenient way of dealing with the problem of providing answers to queries additional to what can readily be found out through the Library.  Just how that will be sorted out will be a matter for the committee. The Government have no function in that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDonald raised the question of whether Members of the Committee other than the members of the European Parliament might not be permitted, encouraged, and presumably financed, to visit the European Parliament in Plenary Session and in Committee work and perhaps, also, the headquarters of the Commission in Brussels.  To me personally that sounds a good idea, but it is a matter which the committee would need to take up with the Minister for Finance through the Committee of Procedure and Privileges when they are appointed.  It would be of great help, I think, to the Committee, as Deputy McDonald said, if they had this direct experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely vital. The Committee could not possibly be technically equipped unless they had that experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dissent from that but I am moving into an area outside my own competence.  That is between the committee and the Minister for Finance.  I can only express my sympathy with the proposal. Deputy McDonald also raised the question of whether the committee might not establish sub-committees. This is worth considering.  One of the considerations in the mind of the Government in extending the membership of the committee to 26 from the <Col N="1379" /> original proposal of 20, as a result of the debate in the other House, and here, was that in so extending the membership it might be possible for the committee to break into sub-committees should they decide so to do. There is no difficulty about that.  Again that would be a matter for committee. In view of the highly specialised character of the work with which they will be dealing, working through sub-committees could turn out to be a useful method.  That too, is a matter for the committee.</P>
      <P>I was also asked whether the minutes of the committee would be published. I am not sure as to what the correct procedure is.  The minutes of the Committee of Public Accounts are published.  I do not know whether it would be normal or obligatory for the minutes of the committee to be published, but the committee would want to look into that themselves.  For the convenience of other Members of this House, if they were published, they would be very useful.  The committee may have a competence in that, and may have to decide that for themselves.  I would be sympathetic to the idea, but I do not want to interfere with their privileges in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

      <P>No, I do not think so.  The minutes are of what is said; the report is a separate issue altogether.  As in the case of the committee of which Deputy Nolan was also a member, the minutes were published currently after each meeting, but we then prepared our report to the House at the end.  I think I have dealt with most of the points raised in regard to the committee.</P>

      <P>They do not relate directly to the committee.  I will now deal with more general matters. Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition, had something to say about the inadequacies of the decision-making mechanism of the Communities.  He spoke of the Council of Ministers not working effectively and said that the system seemed to be creaking at the joints.  He did not use those words, but that was the effect of what he said.  He is right in this.  The present situation in the Communities as regards the taking of decisions is thoroughly unsatisfactory.  I have had the opportunity of attending four or five Council meetings and, in relation to the load of work on the Council and its obligations to take decisions arising out of matters in the Summit communiqué last year, the pace of work of the Council is grossly inadequate. I cannot see how, at the rate at which we are&mdash;I was going to say taking decisions&mdash;not taking decisions, we will arrive by next October at the position of having done what it is incumbent upon us to do by that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council will consider next Monday and Tuesday how its decision-making mechanism can be improved.  That certainly is overdue. Perhaps we who are a new member, like Britain and Denmark, feel this sense of frustration more than the older members who may have grown accustomed to the curious way in which the system works but to us, <Col N="1381" /> coming in from outside, it seems very unsatisfactory.  Part of this is a problem of political will.  Clearly no decision-making mechanism will work speedily if the political will to take particular decisions is not present. You can improve the mechanism as much as you like, but if there are particular countries who do not want a particular decision taken on a particular matter, or who find difficulty in agreeing with their colleagues, then the process is bound to be slow.  I am not convinced that the whole problem lies there.  It seems to me that there is a defect in the working of the system.  Deputies may or may not be aware that meetings of the Council are held in a very large room with a large attendance indeed&mdash;there might be 100 people in the room&mdash;and the feeling one has in addressing the Council is of addressing a public meeting.  This is, perhaps, a diplomatic conference at best but certainly it bears no resemblance to the Council of Ministers as we know it, as a meeting of the Cabinet around a table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A more powerful Parliament might not necessarily expedite the business either; it might even slow down further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible and I will come to that in a moment: the interaction of the different institutions. Apart from what may be done there, the Council itself needs to improve its procedures.  When dealing with policy matters, a greater intimacy could be achieved by less people being present in a smaller room.  On one occasion since I became Minister, we met in a smaller room with less people present, and there were moments of actual dialogue between Ministers, instead of the making of statements across a large conference table to each other.  These matters are being considered, and I can assure the House that our delegation will do all it can to improve the mechanisms within the Council itself.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the whole question of the relationship between Parliament, Council and Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> As Deputy Wilson said, changes one might make would not necessarily speed things up, but they could do so.  It is possible that the procedure of the Council itself could be accelerated if proposals coming to it had been fully worked out beforehand, and where the views of Parliament had been secured and taken into account.  Whether it would speed things up, it seems clear that from a democratic point of view there will have to be significant changes in the decision-making mechanism in the years ahead.  At present the views of the Parliament are not given the weight they should have.  Parliament has no power except to express its views and these views are not taken fully into consideration.</P>
    <P>There are various ways of tackling this.  One possible way&mdash;I merely throw it out as a suggestion because this has not been discussed yet in the Council of Ministers and I have an open mind as to whether it is or is not the best way&mdash;would be for the Commission to consult the Parliament before it prepared its draft proposals and perhaps in time, in a second stage, be bound by the view of Parliament in the proposals it submits.  Then, when the Council of Ministers receives those proposals, which would bear the stamp of Parliament's views on them, the Council of Ministers could either accept or reject; and if the Council of Ministers did not accept then perhaps there could be a further process of consultation with Parliament, perhaps some system of co-decision at that point.  In other words, one could introduce the parliamentary element either at the beginning in a dialogue between the Commission and Parliament as to the proposition to be formulated and/or at the end introduce a system of either second reading or co-decision between Council and Parliament, a second reading where the Council must again get the views of Parliament if it is going to depart from their views as originally expressed, co-decision if such consultation would be binding, so that, though no decision could be taken unless Parliament and Council were in agreement, that might be a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that. There are two conflicting requirements. One is to speed up the process; the other is to make it more democratic. I am not suggesting for a moment that the two are not necessarily compatible but we must make it more democratic.  To the extent that that may slow down the procedures, we need to streamline the existing procedures so as at least to achieve offsetting economies of time to offset any increase in time that may be involved in introducing a more democratic system.  There is a dilemma there which has to be faced.  We need a more efficient system, a more democratic system.  The two together are not easy to achieve simultaneously but that is our task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is missing is the democratic tension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  How well the Deputy expresses it.  Deputy Herbert put it very well, I thought, when he said the European Parliament is the least powerful but the most important institution.  Its importance is shown in the Treaty where lip service is paid to its importance by listing it first amongst the institutions but it is at this moment a very powerless institution and yet it has the potential to be a very important institution, to be, as it should be, the most important institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to accept that in the period of evolution of the Communities some dilution of the democratic process was necessary or it would not have been possible to achieve what we have achieved, but we are now approaching the point where the efficient and democratic administration of the existing body of laws will be <Col N="1384" /> as important as a further evolution of the Community.  I say approaching the point.  We have not yet reached it. But, as we approach that point the importance of reintroducing a stronger democratic element becomes greater; and certainly if it is proposed, as it is proposed, to move towards an economic and monetary union, towards something somewhat vaguely and perhaps grandiosely described as a European union by 1980, we must before we reach that point have firmly established democratic control.  It is the view of this Government that it would be intolerable&mdash;I use that word advisedly and deliberately&mdash;that we would have reached the stage of actually having full monetary union with the almost total interdependence of the economies of member countries, without having adequate democratic control of the whole system of legislation and administration of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult to get agreement on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to get agreement on it but here is where the democratic tension comes in, because there are countries which, for very good reasons as they see them, are determined to move ahead to achieve monetary union.  We accept that and, indeed, at the Summit Conference we endorsed that proposal; but the Summit Conference also made provision for democratisation of the institutions as an element in that process of moving towards monetary union.  What I want to say is simply that we cannot accept that there will be progress towards monetary union to the point where you have a monetary union unless there is equivalent progress at an appropriate pace in the democratisation of the institutions and in our view that would involve achieving a significant improvement in the present situation some years in advance of the point of the third stage of economic and monetary union and the creation of a European union.  We do not think it would be appropriate to carry on as we are at the moment until the very last minute in the 1980s and then suddenly try to make the system more democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> The test of people's willingness to create a democratic community will be if they are prepared to concede to Parliament far greater power and direct election in advance of the date for the conclusion of economic and monetary union and European union.  What this Government will seek to achieve, therefore, is that within the second half of this decade, around 1977-78, we will reach the stage where Parliament will really become effective and where it will be directly elected and unless that is achieved, in our view, it will be very difficult to justify moving to the final stage of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make clear our views on that, views which we will press strongly.  There are other member states who share our views and it is one of my tasks to keep in touch with the countries with which we have common views on issues.  We have common views with all of the different member states on different issues.  It is one of my tasks to maintain contact and to try to pursue in common the position that we hold.  I have already had contacts with a number of Foreign Ministers who on this issue share our views and hope to have further discussions in the days and weeks immediately ahead so that those of us who are concerned with this matter will be acting jointly and pursuing the same path and therefore, more likely to succeed in our efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We might get support on other issues from some people who would not support us on that one, say, France, who would not necessarily support us on that one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson raises a very good point that this country has a number of interests to pursue and, very satisfactorily, in pursuing them we find ourselves aligned with different countries at different times.  This is a good thing.  It is a good thing that we are not in a position of finding ourselves permanently aligned with one country or group of countries which could in some way ultimately be an impediment to our independence of action.  The fact is that our economic interests, especially in the sphere of agriculture, are very close <Col N="1386" /> to those of France and we work very closely with France in that area.</P>
      <P>When we come to democratisation of institutions, the Benelux countries have views close to ours.  In other matters we find ourselves close to the United Kingdom because of the similarity of our institutions here.  This puts us in the position of having similar interests, for example, in changes in the laws affecting the professions.  We maintain an independent position pursuing our interests in alliance with any country or group which share our views at a particular time.  The fact that we are in that position enables us to gain more respect than if we seemed to be a permanent satellite of any country or group.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDonald made reference to the Irish Commissioner, Dr. Hillery, and to the assistance and co-operation which he and other Members of the European Parliament have had.  I would also like to pay tribute to Dr. Hillery and to the courtesy I personally have had from him and to his helpfulness.  Dr. Hillery is rightly concerned to maintain the independence of his position as a member of the Commission.  That is his function.  He is not there as Irish representative. He is there as an independent member of the Commission but, in accordance with normal practice in the Community, when something comes up which may effect our interests he may well be in a position to explain to the Commission a particular Irish problem and I am sure&mdash;I have no great knowledge of it &mdash;that he will always wish to do so. Certainly in the contacts that I have had with him I have found him extremely helpful.  It is fortunate that we have somebody of his calibre there and that we are in a position to work closely with him on many matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised about teleprinters and executive jets.  I cannot pursue them at length here as I gather they are outside the framework of this debate.  As far as the teleprinter side is concerned and the need for European Parliament Members to keep in touch with what is happening at home.  I must say I have the greatest sympathy here.  I find when I am <Col N="1387" /> abroad that it is very important indeed, that I should know what is happening at home, what the Irish papers are saying and what the news is from home because it can affect what one has to say and do at a particular meeting.  I will certainly be sympathetic to the needs of the European Parliament members in this respect and we will see what we can do.</P>
    <P>I am frankly less sympathetic about the executive jet which always seemed to me to be a misconceived idea.  It did not seem the right size. It did not seem to meet our particular needs.  Personally, and I can only speak for myself on this, I have found no inconvenience whatever in its absence.  There has only been the one occasion when I needed to get somewhere and other forms of transport were not suitable and that problem was easily resolved.</P>

      <P>It was on my first day in office.  I found myself, within 24 hours of being appointed a Miniser, having to make a journey which I could not have planned in advance because of the 24-hour notice.  On that occasion I was fortunate to have the opportunity of flying with the British Foreign Secretary and having the opportunity of talking to him and discussing many common problems. Apart from that particular occasion, I have experienced no difficulty. There will, however, be an occasion on Monday when a number of delegations will be flying together from Copenhagen to Brussels.  A meeting of the political committee is taking place early in the day in Copenhagen and a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels.  We will be going together and on that occasion also I will be having the opportunity of having discussions with some of my colleagues en route.  In general, this poses no problem as far as I am aware.  I think that is the position with European Parliament members.  If there are transport problems of that kind we will certainly look at them and see how they can be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> Deputy Nolan was kind enough to comply that the work involved in being Minister for Foreign Affairs at pesent in dealing with the EEC is too much for one person.  I will admit it is a heavy burden.  Deputy Nolan is right. Most other countries have two or three ministers to handle these different problems but different countries have different ways of dividing up the work between them.  However, this is something which we can consider in due course.  So far I think I have managed to cope.  I am concerned though, to ensure that there is adequate attention at ministerial level to the details of the EEC work and this can be difficult at times owing to the pressure of other work involved in this ministry.  I appreciate Deputy Nolan's point.</P>
    <P>Those are most of the general points raised unless any Deputy would like to remind me of something I have overlooked.  I referred to direct elections and stated our position here.  I can assure Deputies that the Government are very conscious of the fact that any Deputy who, under our very democratic electoral system under which Deputies of the same party compete in the same constituency, undertakes the responsibility of membership of the European Parliament places himself at a disadvantage and that the Government are sympathetic to this and would wish to help the Deputies concerned to ensure that they are not permanently disadvantaged by this situation.  We recognise that it is an act of patriotism for any Deputy to take on this burden.  Apart from the actual volume of work, the strain of travelling is itself a very heavy burden. The dual mandate between this House and the European Parliament is something that is very difficult to undertake and Deputies who undertake that are entitled to the consideration of the Government and, indeed, of the people generally so that their burden may be lightened.  Again, it is up to the European Parliament members to propose any assistance they may think they need to the Government and I personally hope it will be considered sympathetically.</P>

In our particular circumstances&mdash;quite apart from the general political grounds for, favouring direct election that those concerned will then draw their authority direct from the peoples of Europe and be able to speak with much more authority&mdash; there is also this special domestic problem we have because of our electoral system.  We are very conscious of that and I can assure the House that every effort will be made by this Government to secure direct election at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Herbert's intervention reminds me of the last point I wanted to make.  He suggested that I had at a recent function referred slightingly to the European Progressive Democrats. I should like to assure him publicly, as I assured him privately, <Col N="1390" /> that such was not my intention.  I made a humorous remark, I thought, on the political groupings to which we are all aligned and the new context that this creates.  I certainly intended no offence to any particular grouping and was distressed to find that what I had said had been ministerpreted. I welcome the fact that the Opposition have aligned themselves in this way with a grouping in the European Parliament because the ability of the Opposition to work effectively for this country does depend to some degree on having an alignment of this kind.  If they had remained non-aligned it might have been more difficult for them to do the work which I know they want to do for this country.  The fact that now the three parties here are aligned with different groups in the European Parliament means that the Irish viewpoint is being heard through a number of different channels simultaneously when our interests are at stake.  This is valuable.  I am very sorry if anything I said suggested that I was reflecting on a particular group.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Lynch about the recall of the Dáil and the ability of one-third of the Members of either House to recall the Dáil, and the inherent weakness of this provision which, as has been said, was included in the 1972 Act, I take it the Minister does not feel the necessity to change it, obviously, since it was included again, nor does he fear any abuse of the weakness inherent in it?  Is that the Minister's general position on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that we do not fear any abuse and we do not see the need to change the provision. While it would be technically possible under this for the Opposition to claim the recall of the Dáil using this provision but trying to use it for another purpose altogether, that would be frustrated by the ability of the Government to order the business.  Of course, if this were persisted in the Government could introduce legislation to change this.  It is highly improbable under our democratic system that any Opposition would frivolously abuse any power in that way.  It does seem necessary to us to give to the Opposition the power to recall the Dáil to discuss a regulation which has been found by the committee to be in some way objectionable.  If the democratic system is to work that power should be there.  We do not believe it will be abused and there are safeguards if it is abused, including the safeguard of repealing the legislation if that should prove necessary.</P>

      <P>There was consultation on the matter and I indicated the view of the Government as to the proportion of representation between the parties which seemed appropriate, which is giving one of ours to the Opposition to increase their membership, and then asked that on that basis the parties would state how many they would wish from the Seanad and how many from the Dáil.  When I received that information that gave us the figure which is in the Bill.  I am not suggesting that I have received agreement <Col N="1396" /> to the party composition.  I do not know whether there is still disagreement on that, but I have not been informed of agreement on that point. The composition between Dáil and Seanad takes into account the proportions which parties would wish for on the basis of party composition, proposed by the Government.

      <P>Is it not the practice with other committees of the House that there would be parity between the Government parties and the Opposition?  It seems to suggest that it was rather petty reaching for a majority decision on the part of the Government party on this most important of all committees, a pettiness that ought not to be there.  It will militate against the co-operation of the different members of the committee. In sub-committees of the House it is customary to give equal representation to the Government and the Opposition and the chairmanship to the Opposition. That used to be the procedure in order to ensure the proper cohesion of the committee.  If there is a petty reaching out for a majority position on the part of the Government party, this cohesion would not be achieved.</P>

However, as that would have given a majority to the Government, which seemed inappropriate, I proposed that one of the Fine Gael members should be allocated to Fianna Fáil, so that the Government had eight members and the Opposition and Independents had eight members.  I do not know how else it can be done unless it is suggested that Independents should be permanently excluded from the committees of this House, which in this particular instance would be unfortunate in view of the experience and knowledge of some Independents on this subject.  I think that in conceding an additional member to ensure that the Government would not have a majority, the Government are going very far indeed.</P>

      <P>No, it does not. The motion does not.  It is a matter for subsequent discussion, but I want to make it clear to the House, lest there be any confusion, what the Government's view is.  It does marginally affect the relative proportion of Dáil and Seanad, and the membership proposed between the two reflects the views of the parties as to what they would wish on the basis of the Government's proposition.  For example, if the Government's proposition were not accepted and if the Opposition's view were taken, the ratio would then become nine/seven rather than ten/ six.  Of course, there is no obligation to divide between Dáil and Seanad in order to enable each party to appoint particularly whom it wants.  That is a courtesy I thought I should afford within the limits of the Government's proposals for the composition of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, to move to a committee of 17 would create something of a precedent.  The normal thing is for the committee to be of even numbers and evenly divided.  On the question of the chairmanship, I would have an <Col N="1398" /> open mind on that.  I do not think the Government parties would be seeking the chairmanship should the Opposition and Independent representatives feel that the chairmanship should come from them.  In view of the nature of this committee as a watchdog committee, it would seem to me appropriate that the chairman should come from the Opposition, and that is not something we intend to challenge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the altered situation in regard to exports of dairy produce following the application of the EEC agricultural arrangements here on 1st February last.  I should like to make it clear at the start that there is nothing in the EEC regulations to prevent us from continuing to have a statutory Bord Bainne.  Some of the board's former activities and functions would, however, be inconsistent with EEC regulations, and this is what gives rise to difficulty.  In particular, the monopoly export position of the board could not be continued.  Under EEC regulations we could not prohibit other persons from exporting dairy products, and so the fundamental basis of operation of the statutory board, that is their export monopoly, has had to be abandoned.  In these circumstances, the dairy industry was encouraged both by my predecessor and by myself to come together and provide for continuing on a co-operative basis the functions previously carried on by the statutory board with the support of compulsory powers.  I am glad to say that the industry has responded to this encouragement, and that the vast bulk of the creameries and processing firms are already participating in the new co-operative body &mdash;An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a few instances there has not been complete acceptance of the new board, but I am confident that the <Col N="1399" /> efforts being made to overcome the difficulties arising in these instances will be successful.  I would point out to the interests concerned that international trading today is based on large-scale units.  Only such units have the necessary volume of sales and command the necessary expertise in marketing and promotion to make a real success of international trading. I do not deny that for a short time individual exporting may be more successful than operating through a centralised exporting body, but over a period the advantages are certainly with the large centralised units.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade an Bord Bainne have developed a high reputation as the export marketing body for Irish dairy produce.  Their Kerrygold brand has gained an acceptance abroad which few, if any, Irish products have ever secured before.  It would clearly be a retrograde step if we were now to throw away all the success that has been achieved and return to the situation where a large number of creameries would be exporting small quantities of butter and be entirely at the mercy of large foreign purchasers.  I do not think there can be any doubt whatsoever about this.</P>
    <P>Also, at the present time it is necessary to diversify production and get away from a narrow range of products. In recent years we have, of course, reduced greatly our traditional dependence on butter.  Production and export of Irish cheese has increased spectacularly. Chocolate crumb, whole milk powder, skim-milk powder, milk-based animal feeds, casein, as well as canned milk and cream and fresh cream, have all accounted for substantial quantities of milk.  But much more remains to be done.  We must get into the more sophisticated milk lines.  Of course, our dairy industry could sit back and sell its milk in the form of butter and skim powder to intervention.  But this would not give Irish farmers the level of return which could be obtained from selling on export markets a wide range of processed dairy products.  It is essential that we in Ireland should not let slip the opportunities that are now open to us in this sector.  Again here, a large <Col N="1400" /> centralised exporting body is obviously in a position to arrange for the development and production of new products, and to carry on the considerable promotional and marketing work that is needed to get new products established on the market and build up a worthwhile trade in them.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the Bill itself.  Section 3 provides for the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the statutory Bord Bainne to the new co-operative society or board.  These assets were financed by the former levy on milk supplied to creameries, and so they are really the property of Irish creamery milk suppliers generally. Until the accounts of the statutory board have been finalised and the board are being dissolved, it is not possible to indicate precisely the net value of the assets being transferred. The final figure, however, is expected to be of the order of at least £2½ million.  This would be represented mainly by investments in a British subsidiary, by an office block in Dublin and by some cash.</P>
    <P>It is provided in section 4 that the assets transferred shall be used for the orderly marketing and distribution of dairy products for the benefit of the dairy industry.  These assets, as I have said, have been derived from a levy on milk producers and so it is appropriate that they should be used to benefit producers as a whole.  If the new society wish to dispose of or use these assets for purposes other than those specified in this section of the Bill, my consent must be obtained.  This provision, however, is merely intended as the final safeguard for the producers' interests.</P>
    <P>In section 5 provision is made for the dissolution of the statutory board. At the moment it is not possible to give a precise date for this as it will depend on when all matters such as the finalising and auditing of the boards accounts have been settled.  I might refer here also to section 8 of the Bill which provides that 1973 shall not be a nomination year for the purposes of the Dairy Produce Marketing Act, 1961, under which Bord Bainne was originally established.  The reason for this is that the term of office of the <Col N="1401" /> existing members of the board expires on 30th September next but in view of the impending dissolution of the board it is clearly undesirable to go through the elaborate procedure of nominating and electing new board members for what is likely to be a very short time indeed.  Accordingly, section 8, in effect, prolongs the term of office of the existing members until the board is dissolved.</P>
    <P>The operations of An Board Bainne have involved the borrowing of very large sums to finance the purchase of dairy products from creameries and processing firms.  These borrowings have in the past amounted to nearly £40 million at peak.  Because of the higher value of dairy products under EEC conditions and in view of the substantial increase in milk production, the borrowing requirements of the new society are likely to be even greater than those of the statutory board. Under the 1961 Act a guarantee in respect of borrowings of up to £5 million by the statutory board could be given by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The new co-operative society, while largely the old board under a new guise, has to build up the same reputation, confidence and borrowing power which the old board had, and to assist it in this the Government have decided to guarantee borrowings by it up to a total of £20 million.  The State guarantee under section 6 of the Bill will be available up to the end of 1977, by which time I would expect the new society to be able to stand on its own feet in the matter of borrowing. Moneys borrowed by the society under a State guarantee can be used only for the acquisition of dairy products in the ordinary course of business, and a statement giving particulars of any guarantees given by me will have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas each year.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 9 provide for the interests of the staff of the statutory board.  In effect, the staff are transferred to the new society on the same terms that previously applied to them, and detailed provision is being made for preserving their superannuation rights.  I may say that the society <Col N="1402" /> and the staff have agreed to the transfer.</P>
    <P>The 1961 Act provides that in any financial year the amount of the Exchequer grant to An Bord Bainne under that Act shall be limited to not more than two-thirds of the board's export losses and subsidies, the other one-third being met out of the proceeds of the levy on creamery milk suppliers.  At the end of 1971 with a view to gearing ourselves for entry into the EEC the milk price support arrangements were re-structured, and the former multi-tiered milk price allowance and the quality allowance were incorporated into the higher support prices payable by An Bord Bainne for dairy products.</P>
    <P>The resulting substantial increase in the Board's export losses and subsidies, which merely reflected the change in the method of paying Exchequer support, consequently fell to be met entirely by the Exchequer which had previously been bearing the full cost of the milk price and quality allowances paid direct to the creameries.  The small amounts arising in the period between December, 1971, and 31st March, 1972, were dealt with on the former two-thirds/one-third basis but for the period from April, 1972, onwards it is necessary to remove the statutory two-thirds limit on the proportion of the board's losses and subsidies which may be met by the Exchequer.  This is provided for in section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to emphasise to the House the importance of the dairy industry and the vital position it holds in the agricultural sector, and, indeed, in the economy as a whole.  In the past the industry was never able to develop its full potential because of difficulties on export markets either in the form of quantitive restrictions of one sort or another or in the form of very poor prices.  Now, with Ireland's accession to the EEC all this has been changed, and the industry is in a position to develop and expand on the basis of the considerable natural advantages which Ireland has for the production of milk.  Our producers are already responding to the new opportunities available to them, and it is <Col N="1403" /> important that the marketing side of the industry should also gear itself rapidly to make the most of the openings that are now available.  In this Bill the Government are demonstrating their confidence in the new marketing arrangements which have been drawn up by the dairying industry itself, and I trust that the House will readily approve of its terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view about this Bill is that it is a necessary piece of legislation that arises not only out of our entry into the European Community but out of the rapid growth of the dairy industry.  Gone are the days when the Irish dairy industry was a type of mendicant industry dependent on poor markets in Britain and elsewhere and poor prices which, as the Minister has just said, tended to depress the industry chronically and prevent it from ever reaching its real potential.</P>
      <P>We have all seen in the last couple of years the rapid strides which have been made by the industry now that the traditional restraints which hindered the industry in the past have been removed.  The very establishment of Bord Bainne was a measure adopted by the Irish Government of the time in order to tackle the marketing of our products in the best possible way within the constraints we found ourselves in at that time.  It is realistic to say that the dairy industry is a big boy now and that it does not need, to the same extent at any rate, to rely on the assistance of a semi-State organisation to do its business for it.  That is why I concur with the Minister's expectation that after a few years the industry will be well able to stand on its own feet.  If we continue to make the progress we have been making in the last two or three years the Minister's expectation will come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, a unified selling organisation is necessary.  The effectiveness of the old Bord Bainne demonstrated this sufficiently.  I do not suggest that was an organisation without blemish but it certainly did a very good job. They demonstrated that if the Irish <Col N="1404" /> dairy industry gets down to organising the marketing of its produce it can market and sell it as effectively as anybody else can do it.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister referring to the necessity for diversification within the industry.  We know of the traditional reliance on butter and, to some extent, dried, skimmed powdered milk, chocolate crumb and other items.  In the European context now especially in view of recent statements by Commissioner Lardinois and influential people like Mr. Schmidt, the Finance Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany, on the production of surpluses and in particular on the production of surplus butter the dairy industry has need to seek alternative products which it could manufacture and sell with more effect than the unchanged reliance on butter manufacture.  This will be a problem for the new board.  I realise it is not an easy problem, that the butter fat must be sold in one form or another and, whatever M. Lardinois says, the contribution of the Irish dairy industry will remain a relatively small quantity in the EEC context.  Nevertheless, it would be to our own advantage that every possible alternative use should be sought for our milk products.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister maintained for himself the position of final custodian of the safety of the industry. He retained this right when, for example, he kept the right to dissolve the board if necessary.  I realise it is a power that almost certainly will not be used but it is well that the Irish Minister for Agriculture is the final guardian of the interests of the milk producers so that he may intervene if these interests are lost sight of by a future board.  This is especially the case because the Irish Minister in the future, as always, will be responsible to the House.  Bord Bainne in a unique way will be ultimately responsible to the public representatives elected by the people.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of workers' security in the dairy industry.  We have had occasion in recent times to discuss the possible arrangements that might be made with <Col N="1405" /> regard to the organisation of milk supply and manufacture in the Limerick-Clare area.  As the Minister and the House know, this involves the security and the future of many hundreds of workers and their families. We have spoken about the final custodianship of the Minister; he should think about the workers in the industry and his responsibility to them. He should make it clear to the new board that it is simply not on to discard totally in the interests of coldblooded, but possibly misguided, economics the future and the wellbeing of the workers.  If that is done, the industry will hit heavy weather and will rue the day it lost sight of this vital element in our future prosperity.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to discourse a little on the type of cohesion he envisages between the new Bord Bainne and the IAOS, especially with regard to the integration of the industry.  It is vital that there be unanimity between these bodies and also between them and the Department on the finalisation of the organisation of the industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, perhaps the Minister could tell us if all the big boys in the industry have indicated their agreement to participate in the new Bord Bainne. He should tell us if those big concerns&mdash;I am talking about Avonmore, Waterford, Mitchelstown, Ballyclough and Golden Vale&mdash;have indicated their readiness to participate in a unified Bord Bainne.  I hope they have and I would certainly recommend to them that they should.  However big or powerful any federation or unit of creameries may think they are in this country, when we enter the big league we require each other's assistance and strength.  We require unity in our own industry.  I should like the Minister in his reply to enlighten us in this matter.</P>

Personally, I think a shorter term might have been more appropriate because it is very important that the new board should continue to perform their work in a positive and dynamic way. It is important to ensure that, if expansion is necessary, it is done in the transition period <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to compliment Mr. McGough and his staff and the outgoing Bord Bainne on the success they achieved over the years, and especially in recent times.  It is fair comment to say that Bord Bainne have been more successful in selling butter, which is not an easy commodity to move in these times, than the European Commission were.  They have had difficulty in giving it away.  It is a problem.  The new Bord Bainne should be guided by, and should take note of the fact that the negative attitude and negative proposals which were adopted over the years by the European Commission have not achieved success. Therefore, now more than ever, if our dairy industry is to get a fair chance, and if our farmers are to benefit from the guaranteed price as long as their CAP lasts, we must not just rely on the intervention price but get out and sell in the highest market, whether it be inside or outside our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain the significance of section 7 (2) (b).  I do not know if it is very important, but there is a date there.  Deputy Gibbons touched on this and on the fact that, not only in Bord Bainne, but in the entire industry, post-amalgamation, we find small categories of workers whose future seems doubtful. Over the past years, carters have provided an excellent service in many rural areas and especially in the nontraditional creamery area.  They canvassed active support from the farmers and enabled them to send their milk to the creamery.  Some of them suffered the rigours of the law for setting up that kind of service in some <Col N="1407" /> areas.  They now find that their future is doubtful.  Amalgamation was bad enough, but when rationalisation sets in, in the not too distant future, perhaps, their livelihood will become more precarious with the introduction of the new modern tanker system.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Gibbons speaking about the IAOS. This is an opportunity, perhaps, to strengthen the role which this organisation with tremendous experience can play in agriculture in the future.  Our co-operative movement is very firmly founded.  We have many co-operative enterprises which are large and well organised, especially the general purposes co-operatives, which most of our co-operatives are, and they should be given an impetus.  Through co-operation we should be able to compete in a very dynamic way.  There is still room for improvement and for the introduction of new co-operative techniques for Irish agriculture.  Our farmers must be encouraged to continue to develop their lines of milk production and to ensure that Bord Bainne will always have top quality produce to dispose of and sell.</P>
    <P>An interesting figure in the vexed milk question is that in the Community &mdash;I read this somewhere&mdash;we have 26 million cows and only 2 million are employed solely on beef production. The beef conversion scheme need only attract 4 million cows from the total to leave the Community with 6 million cows on suckling and strike a balance of production in the Community.  This should not be a difficult problem.  I look forward to the Minister announcing the regulations to encourage Irish farmers to transfer.  The European Commission scheme was not successful over there and I doubt if it will attract sufficient numbers of Irish farmers to change over, even though in the Community there is a shortfall in the supply of beef.  The fact that the Community is general is becoming more affluent and that people are using more beef, is adding to our problems.</P>
    <P>I hope our Minister will avail of every opportunity to defend and fight for the continuance of the CAP.  The <Col N="1408" /> mistake made in the past was that the Community employed mainly negative measures such as slaughtering cows to solve this problem.  We must be more dynamic and the proposals we would welcome would be progressive and would encourage people, by financial inducements, to change their line of production from milk to beef.  If the new conversion scheme is attractive to Irish farmers the Minister can rely on the wholehearted co-operation of the people in that section of the community. I hope that there will be as little disturbance as possible in Bord Bainne and that the staff who were successful will be retained.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that an air of co-operation is developing between Irish bodies in Brussels.  The COPA people, ICMSA and associated bodies, Bord Bainne, and the IAOS, have their European headquarters in the same office block and to an extent share the same facilities.  This is a most desirable development.  The Minister should encourage this development.  He should also avail of the first opportunity to introduce legislation which will strengthen the IAOS as a co-ordinating body of the co-operatives because I think it is on co-operation that the success of our efforts in the agricultural field will depend in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>This organisation has been underfinanced over the past years.  They must be given the opportunity and the finance to continue to provide, through the spirit of co-operation, the kind of atmosphere and outlets we in the agricultural community require if we are to compete with the larger and more powerful nations.  The Minister has given us a very concise resumé of the Bill in his Second Reading Speech and for this I am deeply grateful to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>From listening to the Minister I understand that this is a kind of musical chairs Bill.  In other words, we are moving, because we have to move under EEC regulations, from Bord Bainne, with a monopoly export <Col N="1409" /> position, to a new co-operative.  The Minister obviously desires that the new co-operative will perform voluntarily functions as near as possible to those performed by Bord Bainne under statute.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is important, particularly in order to obtain quality control of export profits. This was the achievement of Bord Bainne.  I come from an area where the dairy co-operative movement was started many years ago.  I often wondered why they emphasied production and paid little attention to marketing. The marketing of Kerrygold butter reflects credit on all concerned. It is of little use to produce if one is not able to sell in the modern mode.</P>
      <P>During the last two weeks I had a question down to the Minister.  He did not take too well to it.  He was a bit sharp when he was replying.  I was suggesting the possibility of paying for butter on protein content. Some research has been done, as the Minister was aware; he referred to it in his reply.  Butter came under fire from modern marketing techniques. People were shown the kind of figures that I have here and told that they must not eat butter, that there are alternative products.  The emphasis on protein content of butter could be achieved by the producer being paid for protein content.  This would help in marketing.  A great deal more research must be carried out.  It might be difficult to arrive at a unit of measurement.  Apart from payment on protein content, the protein content could be emphasised in advertising and selling butter.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that some people, groups, companies and co-operatives, have not as yet agreed to participate in the new co-operative. I should be pleased if he would indicate the total production covered by the groups that have not as yet agreed to participate.  The figure could be based on volume or value.  I am sure the Minister is using his considerable resources and persuasive powers to get them all in.  I hope he succeeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the assets of Bord Bainne and said that these <Col N="1410" /> assets were financed by the former levy on milk supplied to creameries. The House would be interested in knowing whether these assets were exclusively generated by the levy on milk supplied or if there is an element of State subsidy in them.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the position of the employees has been covered and their superannuation rights have been guaranteed.  Also, the Minister has very wisely decided to guarantee borrowings up to £20 million for a period ending in 1977 when he thinks, showing his confidence in the new board, the board will have established itself as a creditworthy co-operative.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very conscious of our position in the EEC.  He has talked about diversification.  The efforts being made in this regard are laudable.  One thing we all owe to him and to the country, if we are to be regarded as having any word at all, is 100 per cent support for the common agricultural policy.  The Minister referred to it.  In various ways and by various devious methods the common agricultural policy is under attack.  There are countries whose interests are not well served by this policy.  For that reason the Minister will have to be more eloquent, not merely in Ireland but in other countries also, to see that people who traditionally have had an interest in maintaining food at low prices do not do so at the expense of our producers as they did for a long period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  It is only fitting that I should say a few words on it because I spent my life in the co-operative movement and in trying to get the movement going in my area where it had a bad taste years ago.  I am delighted that the co-operative movement is undertaking marketing.  As Deputy Wilson said, we always produced but never took the product from the field to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I should like to add my words of congratulations to Bord Bainne on doing an excellent job.  The producers were not in a position to do it at that time.  They are now in a position to do it.  That is an excellent thing because nobody knows more <Col N="1411" /> about marketing than the producer. It is the producers who are being asked to do the marketing now.  They have come together voluntarily.  I am sorry that all the producers have not indicated their willingness to participate. Everybody is needed in the co-operative movement.  I would ask the Minister to do his best in this regard.  I always said, when speaking to small farmers, that their only hope of survival was in co-operation.  In the present competitive world co-operation is needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also said that, if anything goes wrong, he will have the power to dissolve the board.  I congratulate him on that because we would need to be careful that when co-operatives like this are appointed they do not make rules which would mean that nobody could put them out. In my early days there was a problem about getting into co-operatives.  They were run mainly by families and in the early days of Macra na Feirme we were trying to get in and we found that only a certain number of members retired each year so that one would be an old age pensioner before one got in.  After that we made it very democratic and in many of the co-operatives of which I have been a member all the members retired each year.  If they were good they were reelected and if not they were told to go home.  I should like the Minister to keep an eye on this.  When co-operatives come together to form a big marketing co-operative, they are inclined to rule that only a certain number retire each year.  The Minister should make sure that co-operatives are completely democratic and that they do not become republics.  The Minister and each Member of this House must go to the country and give an account of his stewardship.  I have great respect for the IAOS.  I have been associated with it for years.  It did an excellent job.  The co-operative movement had an uphill battle but it is well-established now.  I should like to see it remain democratic so that the ordinary shareholder would have the say he has had down the years.  We brought about that democracy.  There is a tendency to diminish democracy <Col N="1412" /> in the interests of efficiency and streamlining such organisations by having only a few retire each year.  In that way it would take a long time to remove a committee and this would be bad for the co-operative movement. The workers should be, and they are, looked after.</P>
    <P>I am very proud indeed after about 30 years trying to get the co-operative movement on its feet&mdash;I am a member of a number of them&mdash;to see the Minister handing over the marketing of our dairy produce to a co-operative. I always said that anybody who produces anything should have a say in the marketing.  Nobody knows better how to market his produce than the producer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the Bill and on his performance generally in the House.  He has shown great vision since he took office.  I should like to compliment Bord Báinne on their performance in the past.  They have done a very good job.  They have shown vision when vision was needed, not that it is not needed now, but they took on things that a more conservative group would have fought shy of. I was involved in one small project, taking on frozen cream.  At the time some people said it was lunacy but it was done and from a small market of 100 tons they have now brought it up to something in the region of 1,500 to 2,000 tons.  This is significant at a time when there is a problem about selling butter and other dairy products.</P>
      <P>I have no worry at all about handing over to a co-operative.  We have an outstanding example of a co-operative in IMP Cork Marts.  I have no worry about what farming people will do and how the body will operate.  I am sure they are sufficiently business conscious to do what is right for themselves and I am delighted they will have an opportunity of doing it.  I would not be too concerned about rules either.  I think they will make the right rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be an opportune time for the Minister to look at the marketing of all our agricultural produce. Perhaps it would be possible to <Col N="1413" /> tie in the marketing of our butter and dairy produce with other agricultural produce such as meat and processed vegetables.  We have a really good brand name abroad in Kerrygold and this could be used for all our products. We are a small country with a limited number of top-class personnel to do the selling for us and it might not be a bad idea to co-ordinate our marketing team abroad to do the whole job. There would be the added advantage that, if one product was having a rough time, we could use the better products to sell the weaker one.</P>
    <P>We know there is a protein scarcity at present.  The Minister is conscious of this.  I should like to see something done through the new Bord Bainne with regard to the use of whey as a source of protein.  The Americans have developed this to a fine art.  It is comparatively cheap protein as compared with soya and other things.  Perhaps the new board would encourage somebody to start a new plant for the manufacture of protein from whey.</P>
    <P>I wish the new board well.  I am not too worried about diversification.  We will need a lot of dairy products at all times and mountains of butter have a habit of disappearing overnight.  We are one of the best, if not the best, country in Europe for the production of butter and milk.  We should continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Members of the House for their very constructive contributions.  This, of course, is not a controversial measure. Obviously, it is a measure that is agreed by all Members of the House and one that is regarded as being very desirable.  It is obvious, also, that the Members generally appreciate the importance of the milk industry to the economy as a whole.  Many Members have stressed the importance of the economy as a whole.  Many Members have stressed the importance of the maximum amount of co-operation in the whole field of production, processing and marketing.  Most speakers, too, paid a well-deserved tribute to the work done to date by the statutory Bord Bainne.  I wish to add my tribute in this regard.  Bord Bainne have introduced our milk products to almost <Col N="1414" /> every part of the world and they have set up a marketing and promotional organisation that has been very valuable and which will be even more valuable in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I was asked by a Deputy what percentage of production would be represented by those who are not prepared to co-operate with the new Bord Bainne.  I would not wish to put a figure on that but would say that the proportion is very small.  It would be my hope that it is a proportion that will not only diminish but will disappear entirely.  The atmosphere has improved very much recently and it is my belief that those who are considering this matter in the short-term regarding any advantages that might accrue to them by reason of selling a product at a given time will realise very soon that the scale of operation is very important and that centralised marketing on the biggest scale possible is the right course to follow.</P>
      <P>We are discussing an extremely important industry and it might be no harm to put on the record what is the extent of that industry now.  The total supply of milk at present is 565 million gallons, the number of creamery milk suppliers is 90,000 and the total amount paid by creameries to milk suppliers is £68 million.  These are 1972 figures.  The total value of exports of various products amounts to £53 million. Of this, butter accounted for £18 million, cheese for £12 million and chocolate crumb and milk powder for £9 million each.  Therefore, the industry is a very large one and we must do everything possible to assist it.  What we are doing today is an important move and that is why I am glad that it has received the general support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be some confusion in one area.  Deputy J. Gibbons and some other speakers also referred to the retention of the power to dissolve the board.  The power to dissolve relates to the statutory board and not to the new board which is purely a co-operative that will be controlled by the milk producers.  My wish is that the producers will increasingly take control and responsibility for their own business. For far too long there were other <Col N="1415" /> people conducting their business, but the producers have now reached the point where they can organise their own business and conduct it.  I would not wish to retain the power to dissolve the new organisation, which I believe will take over this job on a co-operative basis and will carry it out very successfully.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Gibbons expressed concern about developments in the Limerick area in respect of Lansdowne and of my publicly expressed intention to transfer as soon as possible the work of the Dairy Disposal Company to the co-operative societies.  I think that the Deputy, too, is in favour of this sort of development.  I know that when he was in office he decided to deal with the Limerick situation in a certain way. At this point I am not prepared to say that that was a wrong decision but I am endeavouring to see whether, in the one move, we could achieve what the previous Minister was trying to achieve and, at the same time, pass this responsibility to the co-operative societies.  If that should not prove possible, I intend to continue along the lines which the Minister had arranged. The Government should get out of this type of production as soon as possible.  Perhaps Deputy J. Gibbons would agree with me on that.  I assure the House again, as I have done on previous occasions, that the position of the staff both at Lansdowne and the Dairy Disposal Company will be protected, that nobody will lose his employment as a result of any decisions we may make.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy McDonald who raised the question of the signifiance of subsection (2) (b).  This provision is intended to cover pensions of the board at the 1st February, 1973, as well as persons still employed on that date which, of course, was the date of the application of the EEC agricultural regulations when the board's export monopoly had to end.</P>
    <P>Most speakers mentioned the need for diversification and for a search for new products that would command a greater price for milk.  That is a matter on which we must all agree. A couple of weeks ago an excellent <Col N="1416" /> article appeared in <i>The Farmers Journal</i> about the importance of investment in product research and marketing.  As a result of the prices secured for milk in the EEC, our producers are now getting very good prices for milk.  Of course, there have been substantial increases in milk prices in the past couple of years. Farmers must realise that investment in research is very important, research not only in a new range of products that would guarantee them a higher price for milk but in marketing and related matters which would, in the last analysis, affect the overall prices they would receive for milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Wilson spoke of payment for milk on the basis of protein rather than fat content. He said that, when he raised this matter by way of parliamentary question, my reply seemed to be rather sharp.  Perhaps the Deputy got this impression from my manner of speaking, but I can assure him that I did not intend the reply to be in any way a sharp or a smart-alecky one. What I said was that, if there was a demand from the industry for a change to milk being paid for on the basis of protein rather than fat content, I would go along with that demand; but that demand has not come from the industry.  Nowhere that I know of has this been done. I see the importance of trying to change over to a system which would give us less butter and more proteincontent food.  Somebody said that the CAP was being threatened.  If anything is seriously threatening CAP it is surpluses of the type referred to &mdash;we have too much butter.  I certainly would not resist any approach from the industry in relation to a change&mdash;to selling on the basis of protein rather than fat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Gibbons who said that the Irish production represents a very small proportion of total EEC production.  Of course, I agree with him.  One speaker at least, I think it was Deputy McDonald, spoke about the importance of inducing farmers to accept the conversion schemes put up <Col N="1417" /> by the EEC.  I am afraid I have to disagree with my colleague on this. There is no farming enterprise, no grass enterprise in this country, paying anything like the dividends that milk is paying.  I do not think that is a good scheme at all and I would be very loath to recommend it to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The best possible way for farmers to pull themselves up by their shoestrings at the present time is by milk.  Indeed, I have been quite surprised at the number of applications from farmers, former milk producers, for the beef scheme.  It may be that some of the farmers at this level of production see no prospect of becoming economic producers and have given up the ghost. I think it would be far better if more of them had more confidence and showed more confidence and tried to get their dairy herds up to the level of viability in milk.  That is the source that will give them greater income.  If I went on in this vein I might be ruled out of order, but if there is any Member who feels I have not dealt with any point he has raised perhaps we can come back to it at some later time.</P>

The purpose of the section is to enable this amendment or correction to the charge to be made because, apparently, that cannot be made at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the section as it stands that this should be brought to the notice of the accused person or that he should be given some reasonable notice of it.  The Minister will probably inform me that the normal practice would be to tell this to the accused.  However, I believe that in a matter of this kind we should write into the legislation a requirement of this type.  I think that it is particularly necessary in this section because this section applies not just to ordinary sending forward for trial on a plea of not guilty but also the cases where a man pleads guilty in the District Court but is sent forward for sentence.</P>
    <P>The section, as it stands, provides that, if he pleads guilty to a particular charge in the District Court and is sent forward for sentence on that charge, the charge can be corrected, or amended, in or before the Circuit Court hearing and that his plea of guilty to the original charge would be taken as a plea of guilty to the corrected, or amended, charge.  A man might plead guilty to a particular charge or a charge expressed in a particular way in the District Court but might not be anxious to plead guilty to the amendment of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that he can change his plea but he may not have the change drawn to his attention. I know that the Attorney General's representatives, in the normal <Col N="1421" /> way, will bring any such change or amendment to the notice of an accused person; but what I am endeavouring to do is to have it written into the legislation that they have an obligation to inform the accused of any such change or amendment.  If, for example, the Attorney General's representatives forget, quite genuinely, to inform the accused of the amendment that man's rights, with the amendment I have proposed, would be protected.  Under the section at present if the Attorney General's representatives forgot to inform the accused of any change or amendment that man's sentence or conviction could not be upset due to the fact that they forgot to inform him.  My amendment is to ensure that an accused person has full protection.</P>
      <P>The House will have to bear in mind that many accused persons are not the most intelligent people.  It is a well-known fact that the average IQ of persons in prison on conviction for criminal offences is significantly lower than the IQ of citizens generally. I feel that it is incumbent on any Legislature to spell out clearly, as this amendment does, the rights of an accused person and that, where a change in a charge against him to which he has pleaded guilty is made, that change, amendment or correction is brought to the attention of the accused so that he is fully conversant with it.</P>
      <P>It is not an answer to say that the police, the State Solicitor or the barrister appearing for the Attorney General will normally do this.  I know that they normally do this but if they overlooked this, something which is always possible, an accused person can be at a disadvantage.  It is to protect the rights of the accused that I have put down this amendment which I hope the Minister will be able to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment.  If, as the Deputy says, a defect comes to be corrected, this defect is corrected, not by prosecuting counsel but by the court at the request of the prosecuting counsel and in the presence of the accused <Col N="1422" /> and provided that the court is satisfied that no injustice results.  I am in sympathy with the Deputy's purpose in moving this amendment.  My reason for not accepting it is that the amendment is not necessary in order to carry out the purpose it seeks to achieve.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley's purpose is to ensure that the accused will not be prejudiced or taken by surprise when he appears before the higher court if any change is made in the charge against him.  It would be wrong if he suffered by reason of any disadvantage coming to him in this regard but there are two cases here. The first is where he waives his right to a preliminary hearing and goes forward for trial on a plea of not guilty.  In this case there is an indictment. All that section 2 does is to allow the prosecution, when stating the charge on the indictment, to correct any defect on the charge which was before the District Court.</P>
      <P>It is not the prosecution who corrects the indictment, it is the court who is responsible for the correction of it on the application of the prosecution. The court will refuse that application if an injustice is being done to the accused.  Likewise, it would be impossible for this change to take place without the accused knowing.  It is possible, if the accused was not legally represented, that he would not know the import or perhaps the significance of it, but the court is present and the court is constrained to hold the balance between the parties, and it does so.  The court would only permit the defect to be remedied provided there was no injustice to the accused.  This is written into the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is parallel to the situation where there has been a preliminary examination and a return is being made in accordance with section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  A return under that section permits, not merely the curing of a defect in the charge, but actually permits the substitution of counts for existing counts or the insertion of totally new counts.  This is a much stronger provision which is already in this particular legislation and has not worked <Col N="1423" /> any hardship to an accused person.</P>
    <P>Where a person pleads guilty in the District Court and has been sent forward for sentence, in this case there is no indictment.  The charge before the Circuit Court is the charge which was before the District Court.  If there is a defect in it, bearing in mind that many of these charges are drafted by persons without legal training, drafted by the police, in order to do justice to both parties before the court, to the State and to the accused, it will be necessary to cure this defect.</P>
    <P>However, the overriding safeguard is there that the defect is cured by the court on the application of the prosecution or the defence.  It could work both ways, but the court must be of the opinion that no injustice results.  I am satisfied that the amendment is unnecessary and that it would be inappropriate to have any statutory requirement of notice of the proposed correction.  The power given is only power to correct a defect in the charge, not to change it, add to it or take from it, purely a technical defect.</P>
    <P>Where there is a plea of guilty to the original charge if the accused so wishes he is entitled to withdraw this and enter a plea of not guilty, and he cannot be criticised for doing this.  There is no inhibition whatever in doing that. Another consequence of this Bill is that legal aid is now provided at the deposition stage and at the Circuit Court stage on a plea of guilty so that it is unlikely that persons will not be represented at that stage.  They will have the benefit of legal advice to advise them where an application has been made to correct a charge.</P>
    <P>The court already has its own inherent power to ensure that the correction does not adversely affect the accused.  I am satisfied that there is no danger to the rights of the accused person.  I sympathise with the Deputy's motives in bringing forward this amendment but I cannot accept it because I am satisfied that it is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister refuses to accept the amendment. I do not think his argument against it is a valid one.  What he says is, I take it, a correct statement of the law and of the position.  Nonetheless he does not seek to justify a situation where some reasonable notice on the lines of an amendment of this kind would not be given to an accused person.  I do not think this is putting any great onus in practice on the prosecution because it is the sort of thing that would be done anyway. A great many accused persons are not represented.  An accused person notified by the judge, immediately he is asked to plead, that some amendment has been made is frequently in a nervous, agitated or frightened state and, if he is notified solemnly by the judge at that particular point of time, it is very likely he will not he able to take in the import of the situation.  He is asked to make up his mind on the spot.  He is told: &ldquo;You have already pleaded guilty in the District Court to a certain charge and the following changes and amendments have been made in that charge and, unless you want to change your plea, your plea of &lsquo;guilty&rsquo; in the District Court will be taken as a plea of &lsquo;guilty&rsquo; here in the Circuit Court.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When I use the word &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; I am using the word that appears in the side heading of the Bill.  I know it does not form part of the actual text of the Bill itself, but it is an indication, and usually an <Col N="1425" /> accurate one, of the contents and the purpose of the section.  The very first words are &ldquo;Amendment of charge&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>It is curious that the words &ldquo;Amendment of charge&rdquo; are used in the description of the section and, in the index on the front of the Bill, under the heading &ldquo;Arrangement of Sections&rdquo;, where each section is described, the words &ldquo;Amendment of charge&rdquo; also appear.  This amendment merely seeks to give an assurance to an accused person that he <Col N="1426" /> cannot or will not be taken by surprise in any such amendment or correction.  I do not think it adds any great onus to the prosecution because I think it is a matter of practice, to say nothing of a matter of courtesy, to notify an accused person or his solicitor some reasonable time beforehand of any intention either to amend or correct.  I do not think it would make any difficulty for the prosecution and it would be only fair to the accused.  One must remember that this procedure of a man signing a plea in the District Court is comparatively new.  It has been there only since the parent Act of 1967, some six years ago.  The rights of an accused person should be guaranteed as fully as this House can guarantee them. As I say, this amendment does not put an undue onus on the prosecution. This is something that would normally be done anyway, but I want the House to spell out that this in fact will be the duty of the prosecution.</P>

      <P>I can follow that. Is there not a deficiency in section 4 inasmuch as this is an amendment of the Act of 1967, which uses the terminology of the Act of 1967? There should be a joint citation of the two Acts that they be read as one.  Otherwise, it would be necessary in this Bill to re-define all the terms.  It is the normal procedure in a Bill where there is an amendment of a Principal Act to provide that the two will be cited together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I do not think that it is necessary to have a collective citation in this case. What has been amended are very specific sections of the 1967 Act.  In reading this Act, there cannot be any doubt or difficulty as to what it refers. There would be no question of this Act being read on its own, except in regard to section 3 in respect of legal aid.  That also applies to the amendment of the 1967 Act.  The 1967 Act and this Act clearly have to be read together.  The fact that they are not cited as one does not make any difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that they clearly have to be read together.  That surely is the point, that if they have to be read together it should be stated here that they are collectively cited, if that is the correct phrase.  The purpose of doing that&mdash;and it is done, as the Minister knows, in nearly every amending Act&mdash;is to avoid the rather laborious necessity of re-defining all the terms.  There are many definitions in the 1967 Act.  There are meanings given to words in that Act.  They are the same meanings, as the Minister says, as are given here.  Section 4 seems to have a defect inasmuch as it omits the normal thing which would be a subsection (2) in section 4 to say that &ldquo;this Act and the principal Act shall be cited together as the Criminal Procedure Acts, 1967 and 1973&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Is it not usual to cite amending Acts for reference purposes, even if only for convenience of reference?  Is it not usual to put in a citation, as Deputy O'Malley suggests? What possible objection is there <Col N="1429" /> to putting in such a normal citation clause?  I can understand it being overlooked, but why should the Minister object to including a citation clause?  To say that it is unnecessary is not sufficient when it is practically universal practice.  Maybe I am wrong in that, but that is the impression I have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is the universal practice.  The Deputy has much more experience than I have in this.  We get the collective citation where we are involved in legislation going back perhaps 30 years. One example I can readily think of is the Housing Acts, and the Housing Loans and Grants Acts and other Acts in relation to houses.  In certain cases these are to be cited and read together. Different titles are used over 30 years.  For ease of interpretation, the collective citation makes very clear that they are all to be read as one.  In this case we are amending just one particular Act.  There should be no difficulty whatever on the part of a person reading this Act to know that it refers only to the Act of 1967.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement that the only Act that this Bill amends is the 1967 Act is not right.  Section 3 amends specifically in two places the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962.  It would appear that there should be a citation separately for that.  One frequently sees that where two different sets of Acts are amended the different parts of the Bill are cited separately.  I will give an instance of this, although I have not got it here.  The Bill which is next on the Order Paper today is the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendments) Bill, 1973.  If the Minister looks at that he <Col N="1430" /> will see that Part II of the Bill, which relates to Oireachtas allowances, is separatedly cited collectively with the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Acts, and Part III which relates to the salaries of Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and so on, is separately cited collectively with the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts.  That is as clear an example as I can give of the practice hitherto, and of the necessity for that practice. Otherwise, two whole separate series of Acts would conflict with one another.  The definitions in one set of Acts might not necessarily be the same as the definitions in another.</P>
      <P>The situation in this Bill is not simply, as the Minister says, that the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is being amended.  There is a significant amendment to the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962.  These matters should be rectified and clarified before the Bill leaves this House because otherwise people afterwards who are endeavouring to put these two separate sets of provisions into practice may find themselves in a lot of difficulties that were not intended by the Minister or by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not amend the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act.  It extends that Act to cover proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, by amending the 1967 Act.  If the Deputy reads section 3 again, he will see that the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, is not amended.  The 1967 Act is amended by permitting proceedings under it to have the benefit of the provisions already in force in the legislation providing for legal aid.</P>
      <P>The whole point of a citation is that it is a formal end section and it is to ensure that persons reading a statute will not become confused and there will not be any difficulty as between one statute and another.  This is a short three-section Bill referring to the amendment of one Act, the 1967 Act. There is no point in wasting the time of the House any longer.  If the Deputy gives us the wording we can put in another subsection there.  It does not mean a damn thing.</P>

As the Dáil will not be sitting after next week, it will not be possible <Col N="1432" /> to bring the Bill back to the Dáil.  As the Deputy knows this is an urgent Bill to cure a serious defect in the criminal procedure.  Would the Deputy agree to this wording?  &ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1973&rdquo; and then a further heading: &ldquo;This Act may be cited as one with the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing private and local authority housing facilities are available to such persons in the same way as they are to other persons in this part of the country.</P>
      <P>The private housing facilities include State and supplementary grants, rates remission and house purchase loans. Local authority housing is provided directly by the local authority concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where residency requirements are included by the local authority in their approved statutory scheme of letting priorities and in their supplementary grant scheme they apply equally to all applicants.  It is my policy to encourage housing authorities to modify these clauses progressively where they exist, and to work towards criteria based solely on housing needs.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the decision whether to do so, and when, <Col N="1435" /> must be left to the authorities themselves. In allocating houses it is open to the authorities, where they are satisfied that such a step is warranted in a particular case, to operate the emergency housing clause which is included in most of the schemes of letting priorities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate also that it would be difficult for a housing authority to justify any general decision which would discriminate in favour of any class of applicant, on the basis of their origin.</P>

Most approved schemes of letting priorities include a special waiver or clause in respect of emergency cases.  Where applicants, including those from Northern Ireland, are experiencing genuine hardship by being left homeless through no fault of their own, housing authorities may at their own discretion apply the emergency rehousing clause in favour of such applicants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that building societies are not, in general, accepting loan applications at present.  I fully appreciate the problems that this situation entails for house purchasers, particularly those who have placed deposits on houses or who have had recourse to bridging finance and, indeed, for the house building industry generally.  I have, therefore, had the situation under continuous review. To improve the flow of funds to the societies, the Government introduced on the 22nd May, 1973, a temporary subvention to enable them to offer a higher rate of interest on investment without increasing their mortgage rates.  The Government also increased temporarily the existing limit on investment for composite tax purposes from £5,000 to £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returns forwarded to me by the principal societies indicate that the subvention has been effective in enabling them to attract additional funds.  In the circumstances, I have <Col N="1439" /> asked them to consider urgently the possibility of an early resumption of loan approvals.  I hope that they will respond favourably to this request and that the loans situation will, as a result, improve in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the increases in the maximum loan and income limits applicable to local authority house purchase loans which I announced on the 25th May last.  The maximum loan which local authorities may advance has been increased from £3,800 and £3,400 to £4,500 in all areas.  The qualifying yearly income limit for house purchase loans has been increased from £1,800 to £2,000.</P>

      <P>In the quarter ended 30/6/72 the net increase in shares and deposits was £10.8 million. On 30th September, 1972, it was £8.9 million.  On 31st December, 1972, it was £7.4 million.  On 31st March, 1973, it was £6.9 million.  Loan applications on hand: £30 million for the first quarter mentioned: £33 million for the second; £37 million for the third; and £35 million for the fourth. Those were the approved loan applications on hand.</P>
      <P>The unapproved ones not dealt with were, in each quarter, £5 million, £3 million, £4 million and £4 million. The grand total is the total of the two.  The weekly returns supplied by the societies since the introduction of the subsidy arrangement which the Government provided suggest that it has halted the fall of investment in the societies.  The net investment in March, 1973, was £1.4 million; in April, 1973, £1.5 million; in May, £2.3 million; and in June, £3.5 million. In view of the improving situation the societies were asked on 17th July, 1973, urgently to consider the question of approving new loans and to furnish a reply as soon as possible, so things are not so bad.</P>

The Government have nailed their colours to the mast and they will provide the money one way or another.</P>

In May, 1973, representations were made to the Minister by the Doneraile Fianna Fáil cumann concerning a proposal for a group scheme to serve 13 houses in this area, application for which was said to have been made four months previously.  Having no record of such a proposal, the Department checked with the supervising inspector for the area who confirmed that nothing had been received in the Cork office.  I would advise the Deputy to get on to the Doneraile Fianna Fáil cumann and ask them to be a little more efficient.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Blaney on 19th June last, I explained the general problem in processing group water schemes in County Donegal and the proposals made to deal with it.  I may say that, despite this difficulty, my Department have arranged the payment of two further grants in respect of the Ochtore/ Kerrykeel scheme leaving only one of the 11 grants allocated for the scheme unpaid.  The last grant will be paid as soon as the group promoter furnishes receipts and details of expenditure required for the preparation of the final account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, despite the difficulties as outlined in his reply, what action he is taking in this case which seems to have been scandalously treated?  I say that deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy supplementary information which seems to be rather satisfactory or, at any rate, reasonable.  On 22nd January, 1973, the promoter reported that the scheme was complete.  An acknowledgment was issued and the file was referred to the supervising inspector for a report.  Due to pressure of work on house price control and the housing stock survey, the supervising inspector was unable to inspect the scheme.  He recently arranged for inspection to be carried out by the assistant county engineer who reported last month that he asked the group promoter to forward receipts and details of expenditure to enable the preparation of the final account to be made.  On 12th July, 1973, the assistant county engineer further reported that he had visited the area and that the work appeared to have been satisfactorily completed.  Arrangements have been made to pay a further two grants.  A building inspector currently engaged on housing work will do the plumbing inspections as soon as humanly possible.</P>

      <P>This question was the subject of a detailed examination by a technical committee set up under the aegis of my Department some years ago.  It was then concluded that the contribution of the maximum possible quantity of sewage sludge to soil fertility would be quite insignificant and that it would be completely uneconomic to dispose of sewage in this way.  While there has been no detailed examination of the subject recently, it is considered that the conclusions set out above are, in general, still valid.</P>

      <P>An assessment of the state of pollution or otherwise of the waters into which sewage from our larger towns was being discharged is set out in the Report of the InterDepartmental Working Group on Water Pollution.  As I already told the House the report was published without commitment to afford an opportunity to public and private interests and the general public to comment on its recommendations.  However, pending the decisions on the report, on-going action to combat pollution is being taken, including the expansion of the sanitary services programme which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for local authority schemes for the treatment and disposal of sewage.  I may mention that the capital provision for this service for the current year is £12.95 million compared with £8.25 million actually expended in 1972-73.</P>

      <Col N="1459" /> (a)  The ordinary fixed screen which arrests the grosser solids.</P>
    <P>(b)  The comminutor which breaks up the larger solids with a series of knife actions and,</P>

    <P>These units are generally giving satisfactory service.  New types are put on the market from time to time and often exaggerated claims for their performance are made.  It is policy to wait until such units have proved themselves before encouraging their use here.</P>
    <P>The Department's engineering advisers keep in touch with developments elsewhere through the technical journals and through their contacts with consulting engineers who, if they are interested in a particular new development or in a particular piece of new equipment, generally inspect them in operation in Britain or the Continent before advising their introduction here.

      <P>In so far as my Department are concerned there are a number of provisions aimed at the abatement of nuisance from noise. Section 51 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, provides with some exceptions that it is an offence for any person to make noise, in a public place or in premises, which is such as to give reasonable cause for annoyance.  The planning authority have a general power to prosecute offences under the Act, but any person with grounds for prosecution under section 51 may undertake it.  If the source of noise is a private premises, proceedings may not take place unless the noise continues after a warning notice signed by at least three residents or business people in the area has been served.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, provide that vehicles should be fitted with silencers, make it an offence to use a vehicle in such a way as to cause excessive noise, and control the use of audible warning devices.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities have powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 to ensure that development likely to be a source of excessive noise is located so as not to injure residential amenities and that buildings are so constructed as to prevent noise nuisance.</P>

    <P>Directive 71/304 requires the abolition by each member State of any restrictive or discriminatory practices which might prevent contractors from all member State from participating in public works contracts on equal terms.  It came into force here on the 1st January, 1973.  Directive 71/305 <Col N="1475" /> which provides for co-ordinated procedures and criteria in the selection of tenders and the award of contracts came into force here on 1st July, 1973. A consequential Directive, 72/277, which prescribes the format of the notice to be given in the Official Journal also came into force here on 1st July, 1973.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Irish construction industry to avail of the opportunities now open to it in the other countries of the Community.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot forecast how soon or to what extent they will succeed in doing so.</P>

The further information on this subject which I have informs me that, if it appears to the planning authority that it is expedient in the interest of <Col N="1483" /> amenity to make provision for the preservation of any tree, trees, group of trees or woodlands, they may make an order specifying that the tree, trees, group or woodlands to which it applies prohibit the cutting down, topping, lopping or wilful destruction of them except with the consent of the planning authority who may impose a fine of £200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 73 to 76, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, it is the responsibility of the sanitary authority to make reasonable provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in its district.  The provision of fire stations or of fire-fighting equipment is therefore primarily a matter for the sanitary authority concerned&mdash;in this case the Corporation of Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are 11 fire stations serving the Dublin area, two of which were opened in the past year&mdash;Finglas and Kilbarrack.  I understand that Ballyfermot is served by the station at Dolphin's Barn and that the distance from the latter fire station to the furthest point in Ballyfermot is approximately 4½ miles.  I also understand that the existing stations are regarded as providing a satisfactory service for the city and county.</P>
      <P>I have no current proposals for the provision of any additional fire stations. I am informed, however, that a programme for replacement and construction of fire stations is planned for the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>For the year ended 31st March, 1973, the number of fires attended by the brigades in the Dublin area was 5,983 and the estimated fire loss was £1,448 million.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 95 and 96 together.  Since the one-for-one parity of the Irish pound with sterling is being maintained and there has been little change in the rate of exchange with the US dollar, the bulk of our trade is not directly affected by the exchange rate changes which have taken place.</P>
      <P>The depreciation of the pound against a number of Continental currencies increases the competitiveness of Irish goods and services.  This should lead to an increase in our exports to these countries and tend to reduce our imports from them.  The increase in the cost of imports due to the German revaluation will depend on the pricing policy adopted by German exporters.</P>
      <P>The overall effect on the cost of living of the depreciation to date of sterling and the Irish pound against EEC currencies is not likely to be significant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>By how much was the pound sterling devalued since July, 1972?  Are there any figures on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall depreciation of the pound since the floating commenced in June, 1972, taken in <Col N="1499" /> combination with the pattern of external trade, would be about 4½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a surcharge of 5 per cent has been put on the contracts of people going abroad on holiday travel?  If the depreciation is only as the Minister says, does he not think that this 5 per cent increase is unwarranted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between 4½ per cent and 5 per cent is not so very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in the last three or four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation varies greatly from one country to another. For instance, the depreciation against EEC currency varies from 1 per cent in the case of Italy to 25 per cent in the case of Germany, and 15 per cent to 20 per cent in the case of other countries in the EEC.  When it is considered that the principal factor in our external trade is our trade with Britain, where we have parity with the pound sterling, it will be seen that the overall consequences are of the order of 4½ per cent.  Where a person might be going on holiday to a country which has revalued considerably as against our own currency, the factor could be of the order of 5 per cent or in some cases a good deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The depreciation was after the pound was floated in June, 1972.  Has there been any significant increase in the extent of depreciation of the pound sterling in recent weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some deterioration in the position of the pound sterling in recent weeks and some improvement.  As the Deputy knows, there was a revaluation of the German mark which significantly increased the cost of holidays in Germany.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The receipts from VAT in the period from its introduction on 1st November, 1972, to 31st May, 1973, were £54,977,218.  The receipts from turnover tax and wholesale tax for the corresponding period in 1971-72 were £43,145,980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of that and also in the light of the fact that there probably is increased buoyancy, would the Minister not consider it desirable to round off the VAT figures to proper figures like 5 per cent or <Col N="1501" /> 6 per cent and to cut out the decimal because of the fact that the idea of the decimal in the 6.75 per cent was to substitute accurately for the wholesale tax?  In view of the fact that there is such a significant increase, which has not been accounted for completely by increased buoyancy, would the Minister consider rounding off the figures in the interests of traders and others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These increases have been taken into account in this year's budgetary figures.  The rounding off suggested by the Deputy would have considerable monetary consequences. The lower the rate of VAT the greater is the significance of any reduction or increase.  The .75 reduction on the 6.75 per cent proposed would mean a loss in revenue of about £2½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the decimal in 5.26 per cent was to compensate for the turnover tax and the wholesale tax.  The turnover tax was 5 per cent which worked out in fact at 5.26 per cent.  It was to bring about the necessary adjustment that the decimal was used, to make sure that the same revenue would accrue.  In this case the revenue has exceeded expectations, even allowing for increased buoyancy, which would now warrant consideration of rounding off this figure which has created headaches.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta that the Carlow food processing factory has incurred very heavy continuing losses and unfortunately there does not appear to be any prospect of an improvement in this position.  While no plans have been made so far, the company proposes to phase out production at the factory.  At my request, the company's objective is to ensure that any phasing out of production will not result in redundancy of full time employees.  As a solution to the problem, the company has been endeavouring to attract alternative industry to the Carlow factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What success has attended the efforts the Minister mentioned in attracting alternative industry to Carlow?  I asked the question because I seem to recall that there was a Government undertaking to the workers in Erin Foods at Carlow that if the running-down of their factory became inevitable it would be replaced by another factory with equal employment.</P>

      <P>I think it would be inappropriate to indicate discussions which are at present taking place regarding <Col N="1506" /> alternative employment, but we are satisfied that the alternative employment which will be made available in the Carlow area will absorb any people who may find themselves laid off by reason of the phasing out of the food-processing activities in the foreseeable future.  The board of the Sugar Company, whom Deputies will appreciate are the people responsible&mdash;not the Minister for Finance&mdash;have assured me that they would respect the request which I have already made to them to ensure that there is no reduction in the employment opportunities pending the introduction of alternative opportunities of employment.</P>

      <P>Because of temporary over-supply problems on the UK market for cheese, the price of manufacturing milk in County Donegal, the great bulk of which is channelled into cheese production, may be running a little below the level which producers in the county might otherwise expect to receive.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 128 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is at present a world shortage of soya beans and other protein feeds. <Col N="1534" /> It is, accordingly, a matter for the manufacturers of animal feeding-stuffs to use available supplies to the best advantage.  The prices payable for these commodities are based on world prices and are not subject to control by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said is factual but is he not aware that because of the extraordinary increase in the price of vegetable protein there will be an inevitable rapid increase in the price of animal rations and that, consequently, the possibility of pig feeding and poultry feeding will drop disastrously?  There will also be the inevitability of further increases in prices to the consumer.  Is the Minister aware that a very urgent situation arises out of the extraordinary and unprecedented increase in the price of pig and poultry rations and that it may have the effect of putting producers out of business?  What steps are contemplated by the Minister in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing I can do except to ask the provender people to use the available supplies of protein to the best possible advantage. As the Deputy is aware, supplies are not cut off altogether.  We produce meat, bone and fishmeal here but I cannot prevent the export of these within the EEC.  There are no sources of supply open to me.  I should be glad to hear if there were.  Skimmed milk powder is very competitive at present prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not peculiar to Ireland.  As the Deputy is aware, a similar situation prevails on the Continent where the same concern is shared.  We had talks the other day at the Council of Ministers in this context and I understand that the US position is that they have increased their production of soya by 24 per cent, that they expect a very good harvest and that therefore, the difficulty is only temporary.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 132, 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The recent discussions between French Government officials and officers of my Department and officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs arose from my earlier discussions with the French Minister for Agriculture on the question of improved access for Irish lamb on the French market. Deputy Gibbons will recollect that I informed him in reply to his question of 21st June of my talks with the French Minister and of the proposals I put to him for reduction of the import levy to the January level and for continuing access to the French market on the understanding that we would respect a minimum price.</P>
      <P>The Minister was unable to agree to my proposals but he proposed the meeting of officials, which took place in the first week of July, to work out an arrangement whereby the objective in mind would be achieved in a different way.  Regrettably the talks did not produce a solution to our problem.</P>
      <P>In brief, while we stressed our claims as members of the EEC for favourable treatment in trade with fellow members, the impropriety of increasing import charges having regard to the provisions of the Treaties and our willingness to accept restraints on our exports of carcase lamb to France, the French officials took the view that they could not recommend any modification of their import regime which adversely could affect the interests of their sheep producers and that the solution to our problem lay in the earliest possible introduction, which both sides favour, of a common organisation of the market for sheep and lamb.  They did offer to negotiate with us an import quota for store sheep but this did not appear to us to be a solution to our difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to the French Minister in the last few days about this matter.  He is at present considering the report of the meeting referred to above.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if, in view of the decision of the EEC Council of Ministers to restore full duties should there be, as is imminent, a drop in the wholesale price of cattle, he will immediately seek exemption from duties for Irish cattle entering Europe.</P>

      <P>The Council of Ministers this week discussed a proposal by France that the scarcity regulation, which suspends levies and compensatory amounts and halves import duties, should be terminated because the Community market price had fallen below 106 per cent of the Community guide price.  The Council decided that should the Community market price fall below 103 per cent of the guide price in any week prior to the expiry date of the scarcity regulation&mdash;that is, 16th September&mdash;that regulation would be automatically terminated.</P>
      <P>I advocated that in the case of Ireland the provisions of the scarcity regulation should continue to apply even until 16th September but this proposal was not acceptable to other member countries.  Accordingly, if the Community market price should fall below the trigger point of 103 per cent of the guide price the transitional import charges against Ireland which are provided for in the Treaty of Accession will become operative.</P>
      <P>The termination of the scarcity regulation will restrict the large supplies of frozen beef which have been coming into the Community from third countries and the consequent strengthening of Community market prices should help to counterbalance the increased charges on imports from Ireland.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not realise that this country is being unfairly treated as a member, in view of the fact that a special arrangement has been arrived at between the EEC and Yugoslavia which will enable the importation to Italy of young feeder cattle free of duty while at the same time we, a member country, will be obliged possibly to pay the full 16 per <Col N="1542" /> cent duty on imports in Europe?  As another undesirable by-product of this decision, as Mr. Godber said recently in Westminster, the useful contacts and markets that we have been opening in the Continent may have to be abandoned because of the existence of this.  Does the Minister therefore not consider that, as a matter of urgency, he should take up the unfair treatment of this country, as a member country <i>vis-à-vis</i> the treatment of Yugoslavia?</P>
