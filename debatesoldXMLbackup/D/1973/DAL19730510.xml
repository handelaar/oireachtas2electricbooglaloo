    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £54,086,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment <Col N="856" /> during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This Estimate was prepared under my predecessor.  In my remarks on the main part of the Estimate I shall confine myself, this year, to the necessary explanatory comments.  In the second part of my remarks, dealing with broadcasting, I shall also discuss the present stage in policy-formation, and some proposals for the future.</P>
    <P>I have followed the practice in recent years of having notes in relation to the Estimate circulated to Deputies. As these notes contain a good deal of valuable information in well-presented form, I have arranged for them this year to be circulated also to the press. I hope Deputies will find the statistical and other information in the notes useful in their consideration of the Estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>The net Estimate of £54,086,000 shown in this year's Estimates volume represents an increase of £6,581,000 on the corresponding figure for 1972/73, including a Supplementary Estimate and an amount transferred from the Vote for Increases in Pensions and Allowances.  The increase is made up of extra provisions totalling £9,180,000 under nine subheads, offset by reductions totalling £486,000 under three subheads, and higher receipts amounting to £2,113,000 under Appropriations in Aid.</P>
    <P>The biggest increase is in subhead A where an extra £6,004,000 is needed.  About £4,800,000 of this amount is for the extra cost of pay increases under the second phase of the 13th round and the first phase of the 14th round.  I should, perhaps, explain that the second phase of the 13th round came into operation on 1st January, 1973, and it is, therefore, necessary to provide for these extra costs for 12 months in 1973-74 as against three months in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the 14th round is due to take effect from 1st June, 1973, and provision has, therefore. <Col N="857" /> been made for these further increases for a period of ten months.  Additional staff for the telephone and postal services is responsible for most of the balance of the increase, £1,204,000 in this subhead.</P>
    <P>The following comments are offered on the other subheads which show substantial variations from last year's provisions: Under subhead C an additional £500,000 is required mainly to meet higher expenditure on new sites and buildings, the cost of additional leased accommodation and higher charges for maintenance, electricity and fuel.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £116,000 under subhead D is mainly due to the incidence of presentation and clearance of accounts for air mail conveyance.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £246,000 under subhead E arises mainly because of a reduced provision for purchase of postal and general stores.</P>
    <P>Under subhead F £327,000 more is provided to cover the cost of engineering stores and equipment and contract works, arising from expansion of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Subhead G provides for telephone capital repayments and it increases each year because of the continuing investment of capital in the telephone service.  The extra amount required in the current year is £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>The increase of £512,000 under subhead J is needed mainly to meet the cost of higher pensions and gratuities following increased rates of pay.</P>
    <P>Subhead L.1 provides for an increase of £162,000 in the ordinary grant to Radio Telefís Éireann because net receipts from licence fees are expected to go up by this amount as a result of an increase in the number of television licences.</P>
    <P>There is a decrease of £124,000 under subhead L.2 in respect of the grant for capital expenditure on Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made under a new subhead L.3 for a grant-in-aid of £155,000 to Radio Telefís Éireann as a contribution towards the capital <Col N="858" /> expenditure on a new high-powered radio transmitter.</P>
    <P>On the receipts side, the increase of £2,113,000 shown under subhead T arises mainly because an extra £1,770,000 making £19 million in all, is being provided this year for telephone development.  Expenditure on telephone development is first charged to the ordinary subheads&mdash;principally subheads F and A and to a lesser extent subheads C and B&mdash;but the cost is subsequently recouped from telephone capital funds and brought in as an Appropriation in Aid.</P>
    <P>In 1972 letter traffic was at virtually the same level as in the previous year but parcel traffic increased by nearly 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Sixty-four new motorised rural delivery services were introduced during the year and there are now 580 motorised services in operation, covering nearly 40 per cent of the total mileage travelled on postal delivery.  The motorisation programme is helping to keep down delivery costs without adversely affecting the standard of service.</P>
    <P>Last December, the 50th anniversary of the first Irish postage stamp was commemorated.  The 1973 programme provides for the issue of six special and commemorative stamps.  The first of these was issued on the 1st January, to mark Ireland's entry into the European Communities.  The programme also includes the Europa stamp, a stamp in the Contemporary Irish Art series, stamps to mark the centenary of the World Meteorological Organisation and the holding of the World Ploughing Championships in County Wexford and, finally, the Christmas stamp.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work of the committee, under the chairmanship of Father Donal O'Sullivan, who advise on stamp design.</P>
    <P>The savings services had a successful year in 1972.  Details regarding new investments, repayments and totals remaining invested for the savings media with which my Department are directly concerned are contained in the notes circulated to Deputies.  The notes <Col N="859" /> also give particulars of the growth of trustee savings bank business.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the excellent work done by the National Savings Committee in the cultivation of the savings habit particularly through their promotion of group savings schemes.</P>
    <P>The value of money orders issued in 1972 was £55.2 million or about the same as in the previous year.  The value of postal orders issued in 1972 was £14.4 million which was about 9 per cent higher than in 1971.</P>
    <P>Agency service payments made by the Post Office, mainly on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, increased from £92.7 million in 1971 to £103 million in 1972.  Post offices took part as usual in the sales of prize bonds, handling about 27 per cent of the total collected in 1972.</P>
    <P>The Department are going ahead with the provision of new post office buildings and the extension and improvement of existing buildings.  A new district sorting office has recently been completed at Glenageary, County Dublin, and improvements have been carried out to the post offices at Roscommon and Bandon.  Works in progress or contracted for include new post offices at Nenagh, Dungarvan and Listowel and improvements to Blackrock, County Dublin post office.  Plans are well advanced for the erection of new post offices at Donegal, Shannon, Longford and Mullingar and for improvements to the post offices at Ballyhaunis, Castlebar, Kilmallock and Boyle.  Since the last debate on the Estimate new automatic telephone exchange buildings were completed at Shelbourne Road and Tallaght in Dublin; extensions were also completed to the telephone buildings at Roscommon, Malahide and Merrion Street, Dublin. Work on 24 new exchange buildings or extensions to existing exchanges is at present in progress.</P>
    <P>Demand for telephones rose by an unprecedented one-third over the figures for the previous year.  Some 27,000 new lines were connected as compared with 21,000 in 1971-72 but the increased connection rate was not <Col N="860" /> sufficient to meet the higher demand and the waiting list grew by 9,500 to 32,000.  This figure is a cause of concern to me.  As the telephone is no longer a luxury, but an essential for many purposes, including business and economic development, a major expansion is required to meet the projected demands.</P>
    <P>The telephone service makes an extremely heavy demand on capital. In the current year the approved allocation is £19 million.  It is certain that massive further investment will be required in the coming years.  For this purpose I shall be coming to the House later in the year with a new Telephone Capital Bill that will provide an appropriate opportunity for a full debate on the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Particulars of additional trunk lines, new exchanges, exchange extensions, <i>et cetera,</i> provided during the year are shown in the notes circulated to Deputies and I do not propose, therefore, to repeat them here.  Altogether 1,600 extra trunk lines giving about 80,000 miles of additional circuits were brought into service and 199 telephone kiosks were erected, mostly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Major works at present in progress include the conversion of Clonmel, Cavan, Dungarvan and Fermoy exchanges to automatic working; new Dublin exchanges at Rathmines, Beggars' Bush (Ballsbridge) and Tallaght and the International Exchange at Marlborough Street; extensions of existing exchanges at Phibsboro, Ship Street, Merrion and Dundrum; and at numerous provincial exchanges.  Installation work at new exchanges in the central city and Santry is due to begin shortly.</P>
    <P>An extensive programme of local underground cabling works and of new coaxial cable and microwave trunk schemes is under way.  The acquisition of sites for new exchanges and planning and erection of telephone buildings throughout the country is being pressed ahead with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>In the past few years special attention has been given to improving the services with the Continent and abroad. There is however quite legitimate criticism <Col N="861" /> of the inadequacy of the service to some EEC countries.  This matter is receiving attention.</P>
    <P>Direct routes have been established between Dublin and a number of the largest Continental cities.  A route to Amsterdam was opened recently and arrangements are being made for a direct route to Switzerland.  Early next year the new international exchange, at present being installed, is expected to be brought into operation with numerous extra circuits.  We have recently got extra submarine and cable circuits to America and we have signed an agreement a week ago with 15 other European administrations and the major USA telecommunication carrier companies to secure circuits in a new 4,000 circuit transatlantic cable which is due to be completed in 1976.</P>
    <P>Our immediate problems, however, are the difficulties affecting the telephone service at home and the mounting demand for connections to a system which is in many areas overloaded. Lack of sufficient capacity in the Dublin exchanges is a major cause of the difficulties generally.  Because so much of provincially originated call traffic is for Dublin numbers or is switched at Dublin, trouble there affects the service in provincial centres also.  Many Deputies are very familiar with this problem and have frequently addressed and are frequently addressing representations to me, representations I consider as rapidly as I can and on which I get as much action as I can, but there are certain technical limitations here.</P>
    <P>This situation did not, of course, develop recently but it will have to be remedied without avoidable delay.  As the considerable quantities of plant and equipment at present being installed and on order are brought into operation the situation should gradually improve.  I am afraid there has to be a certain emphasis on &ldquo;gradually&rdquo;. The cost of such orders at a recent date amounted to over £20 million.</P>
    <P>The telex service continued its rapid growth and the number of subscribers increased by over 24 per cent to 1,756 on 31st March last.  A new telex exchange of the most modern kind costing <Col N="862" /> close on £1 million is expected to be brought into service early next year. It will provide welcome relief for the existing exchange which is carrying an increasingly heavy load.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Department publish commercial accounts which present their position as a trading concern.  It is largely on the basis of these accounts that financial policy, including the fixing of charges, has been determined.</P>
    <P>Appendix C to the Estimate provides a summary of the commercial account results for the four years 1967-68 to 1970-71 and provisional figures for 1971-72.  It will be seen that there was an overall deficit of £1,707,000 approximately in 1970-71.  The provisional accounts for 1971-72 show an overall deficit of £1,447,000 made up of deficits of £86,000 on the postal service, £367,000 on the telegraph service and £994,000 on the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Reliable figures for the different services for 1972-73 will not be available for some considerable time, but present indications are that there will be an overall deficit of the order of £3½ million in that year.  A further deterioration is expected in 1973-74.</P>
    <P>These figures have been determined after charging interest on the entire net capital investment in the Post Office and after charging depreciation on a replacement basis.  Many uneconomic services are provided by the Department on social grounds, and a case can be made for the payment of a subsidy from the Exchequer in respect of such services.  There must, however, be some limit to the extent to which certain Post Office services are subsidised by the taxpayers and an adjustment of Post Office charges cannot be indefinitely postponed.</P>
    <P>Turning to staff matters, I would like first to express my appreciation to the staff of the Department for the manner in which they are serving the public.  There is a traditionally high spirit of service in the Department and it will be my aim to see that this spirit is fostered and developed.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provides for 22,621 posts for the current financial year, an increase of 841 over the corresponding <Col N="863" /> provision for last year.  The vast majority of the additional posts are required for the telecommunications services.  About 100 extra postman posts are, however, included for deliveries to new housing estates, <i>et cetera,</i> in urban areas, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Staff training and development are obviously very important in a staff organisation of the size of the Post Office.  The Department's training schemes are kept under review to ensure that they meet present-day requirements, and to take advantage of developments in training methods in recent years.  One innovation this year will be the introduction on a pilot basis, of programmed-learning in the training of telephone operating staff.</P>
    <P>The staff in the various grades in the Department have benefited from the various rounds of national pay increases.  The second phase of the 13th round which came into operation on the 1st January, 1973, provided for a 4 per cent increase in pay plus a cost of living supplement of 63p per week.  This added a total of approximately £2.36 million a year to the Department's wages bill.  The first phase of the 14th round will become due for payment on 1st June next, and this will add a further £3.66 million a year to the wages bill.</P>
    <P>Increases in expenditure of this order cannot, of course, be met by growth of business or increased efficiency. These pay increases are largely responsible for the Department's deteriorating financial position to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The computer which my predecessor mentioned last year is being installed at present and it is expected that it will be in operation quite soon. Some work is at present being processed for the Department on other computers.  This work will be taken on by the Department when their own computer is ready.  Preparatory work necessary for the processing of a number of other activities in the Department is in hands and it is expected that over the next few years much of the main blocks of clerical work in <Col N="864" /> the Department will be done by computer.</P>
    <P>In connection with broadcasting I wish to refer first to certain developments which have already taken place. I shall then go on to consider the present stage of policy-making, and some ideas of future policy.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1973, which was passed before the Easter recess provides statutory authority for continuing to pay RTE a grant equivalent to the net receipts from licence fees for a further two years ending on 31st March, 1974.  Accordingly, the grant of £3,625,000 provided under subhead L.1 of this Estimate has been calculated in the usual way.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen the RTE Report and Annual Accounts for 1971-72 which was published a few months ago.  There was a small surplus of £9,231 in that year.  Present indications are that there will be a surplus of over £200,000 in 1972-73.  I am advised that the improvement in RTE's financial position is attributable primarily to the buoyancy of advertising revenue in the latter half of the year. However, RTE have claimed that a significant increase in licence fee revenue will be needed in 1973-74 because of higher current expenses and so that a reasonable proportion of development works can be financed from internal sources instead of by loans which involve heavy interest payments. This matter is being examined at present.</P>
    <P>Efforts to maximise receipts from licence fees are being continued.  The provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1972, which concern television dealers are being implemented with effect from 1st March, 1973, and it is expected that this will make a major contribution in combating evasion of payment of licence fees.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, it is estimated that in 1972-73 RTE spent a total of £820,000 which was financed mainly by the Exchequer.  A grant of £180,000 was made for Radio na Gaeltachta, and £500,000 was made available by way of repayable advances for general broadcasting works, including the new <Col N="865" /> Radio Centre at Donnybrook.  Details of RTE's capital programme for 1973-74 have not been finally settled yet but it is certain that further advances from the Exchequer will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Work on extending the Radio na Gaeltachta service to the eastern portion of the country by a link-up with two new VHF transmitters at Kippure and Mount Leinster is nearly completed. Radio na Gaeltachta will then have country wide coverage on VHF. I shall be opening that service on 18th May.  Capital expenditure on Radio na Gaeltachta is being borne entirely by the Exchequer.  The special grant of £56,000 under subhead L.2 of the Estimate represents the balance of the capital cost of this project.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Radio na Gaeltachta, tá bliain slánaithe ag an tseirbhís sin agus ní fada go mbeidh deis ag lucht éisteachta na tíre ar fad éisteacht leis nuair a leathanófar ar an gcóras craolta.  Seirbhís réigiúnach é atá ann d'aon ghnó chun freastal ar phobal limistéir gurb í a ngnáth-theanga labhartha an Ghaeilge.  Pobal cúng go maith iad, agus nílim go iomlán sásta gur féidir leo maireachtaint ar a bhfuil acu féin amháin.  Tuigim dóibh, áfach, nuair a deirid ná fuil cabhair &ldquo;Ghaeil Bhleá Cliath&rdquo; ag teastáil uathu, ach caithfear aghaidh a thabhairt ar an bhfadhb so luath nó mall.</P>
    <P>Tá sé i gceist agam éisteacht le craolta Radio na Gaeltachta nuair a bheidh an deis sin againn.  Tá leis i gceist agam labhairt le muintir na Gaeltachta agus gan amhras lena n-ionadaithe san Dáil, ach go háirithe an tAire Gaeltachta Tomás Ó Dómhnaill.</P>
    <P>Plans for the new high powered transmitter to replace the Athlone radio transmitter are also proceeding satisfactorily.  A site has been obtained by RTE and the equipment is on order.  It is expected that the new transmitter will be in service by the end of the next financial year. It has been agreed that RTE will bear the cost of the new transmitter site and one-third of the other costs and that the balance will be provided <Col N="866" /> by way of a non-repayable Exchequer grant.  The total cost is expected to amount to close to £700,000.  The provision of £155,000 under subhead L.3 of the Estimate represents that part of the expenditure likely to arise in 1973-74 which is proper to be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In recent years television has tended to become synonymous in some cases with broadcasting and, indeed, much of what Deputies have had to say about broadcasting has concerned television only.</P>
    <P>It is, however, worth pointing out that the expenditures to which I have referred above, on the new Radio Centre, on the nationwide availability of the Radio na Gaeltachta network, and on the new high-powered medium wave transmitter, offer the opportunity for important new developments in the radio field.  I am sure that the Broadcasting Review Committee will have much to say on these matters.  At this moment, I would merely say that I intend to review the present limits on transmission hours, to see if greater choice can be offered to the listener without excessive cost to the licence holder.</P>
    <P>In the history of broadcasting in this country, the present is a transitional period.  The term of office of the existing authority ends on 31st May.  I have thanked the chairman of the existing authority and all its members for the valuable services which they rendered to RTE in a difficult period.  I have notified them of my intention in present circumstances to nominate an entirely new authority.</P>
    <P>In the Press this morning it is reported that I have dismissed the existing authority.  This is not the case. The existing authority remains in office for its period of office which concludes on 31st of this month.  What I have done is to thank them for their services and to notify them that I am nominating a new authority.  That is quite a different matter, as Deputies will appreciate, from dismissing an authority and in fairness to the people concerned, and to myself also.  I wish the distinction to be made.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity <Col N="867" /> of making the first announcement to the Dáil itself of the names of the new authority.  Their names are:</P>
    <P>Chairman: Mr. Donal Ó Moráin</P>
    <P>The remaining members in alphabetical order are:</P>
    <P>Mrs. Sheila Conroy</P>
    <P>Mr. William Finlay</P>
    <P>Hilary Heron</P>
    <P>Mr. Charles McCarthy</P>
    <P>Mr. Seán Mac Réamoinn</P>
    <P>Mr. James McGuire</P>
    <P>Mr. Patrick O'Keeffe</P>
    <P>Mr. John Robb.</P>
    <P>These names will be familiar to many Members of the House.  Without going into detail here I want to say a brief word about each.  Mr. Donal Ó Moráin was, of course, the chairman of the authority which was removed on 24th November, 1972.  In renominating him I should like to pay a tribute to the members of the authority which he led.  In difficult circumstances and confronted with delicate choices, he and they may have made some mistakes, as all of us must do, but they showed a consistent sense of their responsibilities and an integrity beyond praise.</P>

      <P>Mr. Ó Moráin's experience and high capacities are well known to the public and it gives me great pleasure to renominate him as chairman of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority dating from 1st June, 1973.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Sheila Conroy is well-known among all those concerned with the struggle for women's rights, as well as in the trade union movement.  She was a member of the Commission on the Status of Women, whose report has just been received and which the Government are acting on, and is a member of many voluntary bodies. She is an active member of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, of which her late husband, Mr. John Conroy, was general president.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Mr. William Finlay, S.C., is Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ireland and actively interested in social problems.</P>
    <P>Hilary Heron (Mrs. D.W. Greene) is internationally known as a sculptor. Her works are in public and private collections in many countries.</P>
    <P>Mr. Charles McCarthy was general secretary of the Vocational Teachers' Organisation, a past president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and chairman of the Human Sciences Committee.</P>
    <P>Mr. Seán Mac Réamoinn is well-known as a professional broadcaster and for his cultural activities in many fields.  He is a member of the Workers' Union of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The nomination of a member of the staff of RTE to the authority is an innovation which will, I believe, help to inform and enrich the deliberations of the authority.</P>
    <P>Mr. James McGuire is managing editor of the <i>Western People</i> and has been president of the West of Ireland Branch of the National Union of Journalists.</P>
    <P>Mr. Patrick O'Keeffe is editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal,</i> chairman of the Farm Business Development CoOperative and a member of the Irish Council of the European Movement.</P>
    <P>Mr. John Robb is the well-known surgeon, formerly of Belfast, and now of Ballymoney, County Antrim.  He is well-known for his humanitarian actions and interventions in the Northern Ireland crisis and for his concern for reconciliation between the two communities in this island.</P>
    <P>One main reason why I wished to take this Estimate early was to end speculation about this matter.  I think speculation inevitably occurs when changes of this kind are known to be about to take place and the speculations may be, to some small extent, damaging, above all in that the names of individuals are mentioned, individuals who may or may not turn out to be on the list of the authority.  I should like to say here that there are a number of individuals whom I would have liked to have on this authority but who were not available for one reason or <Col N="869" /> another, either because they were not themselves willing to serve or because the need to produce a balanced authority, balancing competences in various fields, different types of people, made it impossible to select certain individuals whose high qualities would have made a valuable contribution to the authority.  The maximum membership of the authority is nine.  To that I was confined and within that I had to produce both a balance and a certain diversity.</P>
    <P>In choosing the authority the main criterion I had in mind was that of competence: that is to say, that the group selected should possess the ability to handle with good judgment, firmness and delicacy a very varied complex and sensitive field.  I also had in mind the criterion of confidence, that is to say, that the members of the authority, collectively and individually, should command the confidence of the public generally, and also be sufficiently diverse in interests and background to command the confidence of important groups and interests within the community.  In an authority made up of a limited number of people this last criterion can never be fully met and there will always be interests and regions which feel they are not adequately represented and which may have some grounds for that feeling. For example, I am very conscious that one gap in this authority is that I have nobody who can be regarded as representative of music.  I would have liked to fill that but with the other concerns that had to be met it was not possible within the nine member authority.  I know, however, that the interests of music are not by any means likely to be left out of the count in RTE.</P>
    <P>The authority is selected, not primarily for the purpose of representing regions and interests, but in order to be a body capable of adequately discharging certain important responsibilities. I believe that those I have named, working together and possessing a considerable range of capacities and experience which complement one another, is a body in which the House and the country and those professionally concerned in this matter can have full confidence.  I should like here to <Col N="870" /> thank the men and women who have agreed to undertake this service, and to wish them a successful tenure, productive of valuable developments in broadcasting in this country.</P>
    <P>There are a few people whom I should have liked to nominate but who for one reason or another were not available.  One of these was Professor T.W. Moody of Trinity College, a member of the former RTE Authority and a man who has rendered long and distinguished service to this country, as a scholar, as a teacher, and as a citizen. Professor Moody, because of his commitments to the completion of some very important historical projects, felt unable to accept my offer to nominate him to the new authority.  I respect the reasons for his refusal, but, in view of past events, I think it right to record here that the offer was made.  Naturally I shall wish to have the views of the new authority before taking any fundamental decisions in the area of broadcasting and television.</P>
    <P>I am also awaiting the final report of the Broadcasting Review Committee. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Justice Murnaghan, has told me that the report is not to be expected before the end of the present year.  I appreciate that this delay is due to the very painstaking way in which that committee has been setting about its duties, and I want to record here publicly the thanks which I have already expressed to them for their devotion to their task.</P>
    <P>The interim report of the committee, which was submitted to my predecessor just before the change of Government, recommends that no action be taken about the present restriction of 500 homes per masthead for wired television systems until the final report of the committee is received.  I felt some concern about this because of the dissatisfaction about this situation which I am aware exists not only in the present single channel area&mdash;notably Limerick, Cork and Waterford&mdash;but also in parts of the multi-channel area, including central Dublin.  I also felt that to accept so prolonged a deferment of the examination of the question would be a violation of the relevant part of the joint Statement of Intent of the <Col N="871" /> Coalition Parties which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The review of the television and broadcasting services will be speeded up and a special examination made as a matter of urgency of such matters as a second TV channel, local radio and the provision of piped television and the relationship of the RTE Authority with the Government.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of principle with this Government to keep the promises in the joint Statement of Intent and the implementation of this particular promise falls on me.  I, therefore, asked the chairman of the Broadcasting Review Committee to let me have a further interim report at an early date on the development of cable television.  The committee is kindly complying with this request and I expect to have its second interim report shortly.</P>
    <P>In view of the situation I have outlined as regards the Broadcasting Review Committee and the RTE Authority large areas remain open as regards future developments in broadcasting and television.  I should say that while I and, I am sure, the new authority will study the future reports of the Broadcasting Review Committee with the care that is due to the thought and study that will have gone into them, I cannot, of course, commit myself, and still less the authority, in advance to acceptance of the proposals of the Committee.  I think it right however, to give the House some indications, even if necessarily, for the reasons I have explained, somewhat tentative at the present time, of my general approach to this question.</P>
    <P>I would hope in doing so to stimulate a debate which would serve a constructive purpose, especially at this fluid stage in the decision-making process.  In a democracy, after all, one of the most vital questions about radio and television is &ldquo;what do the people actually want?&rdquo; There is no body in the country which has better authority, or, indeed, a stronger incentive, to try to express what the people want, than this House has.  That aspect of this House, its broadly representative <Col N="872" /> character, is, of course, often obscured by the factor of party competition, which is also an unescapable and essential part of democracy, but I am encouraged to hope, having sat through previous Estimate debates on this subject, that in this debate also the broadly representative aspect of the House will be uppermost and that we will be hearing from many Deputies, both in multi-channel and single channel areas, expressions of what they believe their constituents want.</P>
    <P>This is not an empty matter because decisions are now being shaped and I would like to see free and open discussion in this House helping to shape these decisions as part of the democratic process.  I assure the House that I will pay equal attention to what is being said by Deputies on all sides of the House because it is through Deputies that the wishes of the people in this matter should be finding expression.  I hope this aspect of the discussion on the Estimate will transcend what might be called the adversary side of our proceedings though that, no doubt, will also be in evidence from time to time.  It is healthy that it should.</P>
    <P>It is never, of course, only a question of what the people want.  It would also be helpful to have some indication of what they might be prepared to pay and whether, for example, people would be prepared to pay higher licence fees to ensure conditions of better reception, better programming and an extra channel or channels.  Some very difficult choices are involved here.  There is always an attraction in pushing ahead in development and applying new technical possibilities.  The cost, however, has also to be reckoned, no less in the area of broadcasting than in other fields.</P>
    <P>In cable television, for instance, development means a fall in viewing to RTE with consequent implications for advertising revenue.  That in its turn implies either a deterioration in programmes or a rise in licence fees for those without cable television, as well as those with it.</P>
    <P>Colour television is another example <Col N="873" /> where unrestricted development could not only lead to the high cost of colour programme-making being borne by viewers with black and white sets, but also an upsurge in the purchase of colour receivers could have implications perhaps for the balance of Ireland's international payments which could be held to jeopardise general economic policy.  I think the latter consideration is of somewhat less weight in the circumstances than the first.</P>
    <P>Extended broadcasting hours would serve relatively small audiences but the cost of making programmes to fill them could raise the licence fee for everybody.</P>
    <P>Up to now the approach in dealing with these problems has seemed to be somewhat restrictive.  It might perhaps be desirable to think about a shift in emphasis towards charging new developments with the costs they create, rather than imposing restrictions which in some cases are not wholly effective.</P>
    <P>I am at present considering various ideas in this connection and I should be grateful for any suggestions members of both sides of the House may care to offer in this area.</P>
    <P>In principle, I favour providing the public with the widest variety of choice that is practicable, both in relation to domestic and foreign programmes. In that context, I have read with interest the Broadcasting Review Committee's proposal for a second channel which is at present under study in my Department.  I also have some sympathy, however, with those who say the second channel does not meet the needs of those in the single channel area and who would like to enjoy the same variety of choice as is now available, accidentally, to people in the multi-channel area.  Ideally I would like to see a much more widely effective freedom of the airwaves over this island.  I would like, for example, not only to have RTE programmes fully available in Northern Ireland, but also to have programmes broadcast in Northern Ireland fully available throughout the Republic.  I have discussed this with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who believes as I do, that such a development <Col N="874" /> would serve to promote better mutual comprehension and thereby serve the cause of peace and reconciliation. The question is a highly complex one however&mdash;and one which would require the co-operation of a number of authorities and the overcoming of various technical, legal, financial and commercial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would like to apologise at this stage to Deputies and to others who have received copies of this brief because certain elements are transposed here in the mineographed copy of my speech and, subsequently, the order will be somewhat different from that which they have been given although it will not be different in substance.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain feeling that the exposure of a part of our public to television originating outside the State boundaries is in some way a bad thing and that it would be wrong to permit it to reach areas which it does not now reach.  That is not, I believe, the feeling of most people in this country&mdash;though Members in this House can correct me, in relation to those whom they represent, if I am wrong.  In any case, I believe that to open windows rather than to close them is the more natural function of broadcasting and television and also the one of which our national culture, generously interpreted, stands the more in need.</P>
    <P>As national culture is an element which comes into this not only by the nature of things but by Statute, I should like to refer here to section 17 of the Broadcasting Act of 1960 which declares:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions, the authority shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>  Here, as in some other areas, the responsibilities placed on the authority are too vague to be satisfactory.  What exactly is our &ldquo;national culture&rdquo;. Does it include the diversity of traditions which exist in this island, including the Orange and Unionist tradition <Col N="875" /> ditions of a majority in Northern Ireland, or are there&mdash;in the mimeographed copy of the speech the spelling is &ldquo;there&rdquo;; it is rather important that here it is &ldquo;their&rdquo;&mdash;distinct political allegiances and other characteristics to be thought of as setting them outside the national culture?  Does the national culture consist mainly of Gaelic heritage and does it centre on the Irish language, as the language of the section seems to imply, without actually saying so, or does it include also the forms of the language which most of us speak most of the time and that literature in the English language to which so many of our writers have imparted a touch of our accent?  Does our national culture consist only of those elements which are exclusively and idiosyncratically our own, or should it be taken as including also those numerous and important characteristics which our culture shares with so many of our neighbours in this archipelago and, in a more diffused sense, in Europe and North America.</P>
    <P>I put these questions but no one, I think can answer them decisively.  I suspect more Irish people today would lean on the whole, to the various broad rather than to the various narrow interpretations of these words than would have been the case when the Broadcasting Authority Act was framed 13 years ago but I suspect that the intention of the framers was fairly narrow on this.  I think the wording of the section, and in particular the use of the word &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; have tended understandably to produce a rather defensive psychology in connection with the discharge of broadcasting responsibilities under the Act.</P>
    <P>The question of making all Ireland an open broadcasting area is, of course, pre-eminently one of which a Council of Ireland, ought to be seized.  If, as we all hope will happen, the Council of Ireland comes into effective being, we may find that certain major decisions affecting broadcasting which might fall within the council's purview should be deferred until the council have the opportunity to consider the issues, that is if it looks likely that the council are about to come into being and about to <Col N="876" /> get down to business.  As the British authorities are necessarily involved in decisions affecting the mutual availability of broadcasting services for both parts of Ireland, with the agreement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I have arranged to meet the British Minister for Posts and Telecommunications at an early date for a discussion of these matters.</P>
    <P>Now that the British authorities have recognised the &ldquo;Irish dimension&rdquo;&mdash;as they did in the Green Paper&mdash;and that the Taoiseach has spoken of the &ldquo;British dimension&rdquo; to the problem, the climate would appear to be suitable for moving as fast as cost, technical and other considerations may permit in the direction of a two-dimensional open broadcasting area.</P>
    <P>The question of the relationship between the Government and the broadcasting authority is one which has given concern in many countries besides our own.  Most people, and almost everyone who works for the media, would agree that the position in, say, Britain, where the autonomy of public service broadcasting is respected is preferable to, say, the position that prevailed in France under General de Gaulle, where the Government could exercise whenever they wished a decisive influence over the control of programmes.</P>
    <P>In theory, in Britain too, the Government can invoke very drastic powers over the BBC and ITA.  In practice no British Government as far as we can foresee appear likely to exercise such powers; the position of the governors of the BBC is protected in effect by unwritten conventions and if reports of certain conversations between the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the former Taoiseach are true, while the Government there might be tempted to move in that direction they feel they cannot.  The reason they feel they cannot is not because of positive legislation but because of conventions and public opinion.</P>
    <P>Such conventions have proved less stable here.  Without at this point entering into recriminations over past dramatic events, what is necessary now is to rebuild confidence in the integrity and autonomy of public service broadcasting <Col N="877" /> in this country.  Given the proven fragility of unwritten convention in our conditions, it is important that our legislation should give the greatest possible protection to these values.  I am afraid legislation is an inadequate substitute for convention, but we have to use what means we can and perhaps in moving towards such legislation and in the discussion for the need for it we may be helping to build up the kind of convention, the kind of public opinion which is needed for the full protection of the integrity and autonomy of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I shall, therefore, bring before the Oireachtas at an appropriate time certain amendments to the Broadcasting Acts.  As the final report of the Broadcasting Review Committee and my decisions on it may point the way to other legislative changes, I have decided to defer the introduction of legislation until next year.  In order to dispel any doubts there may be in the public mind&mdash;this matter has been rather widely, understandably and rightly debated in the press and the media&mdash;I think it is proper for me to say even at this early stage what I have in mind in general terms.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I should like to see the responsibilities of the authority more explicitly defined by law and the authority then left to discharge their responsibilities without any interference&mdash;or, indeed, potential interference &mdash;of any kind by the Government in programming.  This would mean, of course, that section 31 subsection (1) of the Broadcasting Act, 1960, would go. Section 6 of the same Act would also be amended&mdash;that is the section which gives the Government power to remove the authority at any time.  Similar but not identical powers exist in relation to other bodies but it is necessary to give some special protection to the body responsible for broadcasting because of the extreme sensitivity of this area, because of the constant temptation to Government to step across certain lines, and because of the dangers inherent therein.</P>
    <P>I should like to meet that by rather strong changes.  One way of doing it might be to provide that the authority, <Col N="878" /> during a given period of office, could only be removed by decision of both Houses of the Oireachtas when the Government had shown that the authority had gravely derogated from the responsibilities assigned to them by statute.</P>
    <P>The autonomy I have in mind for the authority is not anything anarchic or arbitrary but a freedom defined and limited by clearly specified law.  Instead of the incalculable and unpredictable varieties of possible responsibility placed on an authority by the existing section 31 subsection (1), the new legislation would provide explicit definition of the responsibilities of the authority.  I am in consultation with the Attorney General as to how best the responsibilities of the authority can be defined in relation to, for example, the activities of illegal organisations, in such a way as to protect the legitimate functions of RTE in relation to news gathering, analysis and discussion&mdash;all very important functions&mdash;while protecting the paramount interest of the community in peace and the observation of law.</P>
    <P>I am aware that journalistic staffs working for RTE, as well as for comparable broadcasting organisations in other countries, sometimes complain that more restrictions are placed on their activities than are placed on the activities of their colleagues working for newspapers.  This is an understandable complaint, and up to a point a healthy one since it reflects a professional eagerness for untrammeled investigation and publication.</P>
    <P>People in broadcasting who feel they want more of a free hand may well dislike the setting of explicit statutory limits almost as much as they dislike the potential arbitrary intervention which lurks in, and on at least one occasion has leaped out from the present section 31.  They would like no restrictions at all.  Yet some restrictions are inevitable, and some are salutary, even under the greatest possible freedom of expression available in any civilised country.  The freedom of RTE should not be less than that of any good newspaper.  It should not be less but it has to be different, differently formulated, differently limited and <Col N="879" /> differently safeguarded.  The freedom of the press is expressed in diversity.  Any newspaper has the right to advocate the most extreme opinions, and to select its news accordingly.  It should be noted, however, that as happens in other areas of life also, this freedom-in-diversity which exists in the press has its own coercive side.  Many journalists in all countries have to work for papers whose editorial policies they do not like and they may well find their professional activities restricted in ways which are more drastic than any restrictions they may find in public service broadcasting in a democratic country.</P>
    <P>In some countries, and most notably in the United States, broadcasting has been given an economic base similar to that of the press and resulting&mdash;in theory at least&mdash;in a similar freedom-in-diversity.  Unfortunately that freedom has expressed itself in unbridled commercialisation &mdash;unbridled, debased and debasing commercialisation.  I do not think anyone who knows what American television is like&mdash;and I have watched it off and on for four years&mdash;would wish to see that particular kind of freedom introduced here.  In this country we have chosen, and I believe rightly chosen, an alternative model, that of public service broadcasting. RTE were set up by the State and hold a monopoly of the broadcasting channels to which the State is entitled.  In these conditions they cannot enjoy the full range of freedom open, in principle, to an individual newspaper.  They cannot throw their weight&mdash;which in these circumstances is a tremendous weight&mdash;in favour of any party or set of policies.</P>
    <P>Above all, it must be more careful than any single newspaper is required to be in its treatment of activities designed to overthrow the State which set it up and all activities which are contrary to the laws of that State. These restrictions must remain at least as long as RTE retains a monopoly of broadcasting.  Nor would I favour a substitution for that monopoly of the kind of freedom-in-diversity based on commercialisation <Col N="880" /> of the airwaves.  Certain restrictions on RTE's activities are, therefore, inevitable. What is important is that they should be honestly and explicitly set out in our laws, and not left open to the possibility of arbitrary intervention by individuals in power.</P>
    <P>I regret that, for reasons which I have sufficiently indicated, it is not possible to provide such a legislative framework at an early date, and the new authority will have to function, for at least the remainder of this year under the existing law including section 31 subsection (1).</P>
    <P>I considered whether to rescind the directive issued by my predecessor under section 31 subsection (1) in October, 1971.  I decided to leave it operative until the new legislation to which I have referred will end both it and the Minister's power to make any further such directives.  The objections which I and the other members of the Opposition voiced in relation to that directive concerned not its declared objective, which was essentially preventing the glamorisation of the IRA, buts its vagueness, and the then Minister's failure, as it appeared to us to be&mdash;he is here in the House&mdash;either to clarify it or to indicate whether or not he approved of the interpretations which the then authority, which he later dismissed, placed on the directive. These particular objections do not apply to the present situation.  I have seen the internal guidelines which RTE are using in implementation of the directive and I regard the operation of these guidelines as constituting compliance with the legitimate purposes of the directive as above described.  Such guidelines were set up under the former authority and modified under the present one.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no longer any vagueness about what the directive now means, nor does the dangerous possibility any longer exist that the Minister and RTE may be interpreting the directive in different ways.  I am, therefore, satisfied to leave that situation as it is until new legislation can establish a sounder foundation for the operations of RTE.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see that new legislation introduced as soon as may be <Col N="881" /> appropriate and as soon as the report of the Broadcasting Review Committee has been received and studied both by my Department and RTE and the necessary decisions made.  I shall then move for the introduction of the legislation I regard as necessary.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should refer although it is not part of my statutory responsibility as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is relevant to this Estimate, only so far as the Minister's salary is paid out of this Estimate and therefore it is appropriate that the Minister should report here on any special duties assigned to him.  The Government have asked me to assume certain responsibilities in relation to the Government Information Bureau.  It is the wish of the Government that the public should be more fully informed, and in greater depth, about Government policy and activities than has generally been the case in the past.  We believe that it is very important to the effective working of a democracy that the public should have adequate information about what is going on.</P>
    <P>The object is not to protect the Government from criticism but to ensure that the criticism is as well informed as possible, and thereby helpful not only to the public interest, but also to a Government which are prepared to take informed criticism into account.  With these ends in view the Government, being aware of the high professional capability of Mr. Muiris Mac Conghail, appointed him head of information services.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognise that, for the fully effective discharge of his duties the head of information services would need to be in close contact with a member of the Cabinet to whom he could have access at all times.  The Government Information Bureau is attached to the Department of the Taoiseach but it is obvious that the manifold duties of that high office preclude the Taoiseach personally from giving much day-to-day attention to the bureau.  In these conditions the Government, on the instance of the Taoiseach, assigned this particular responsibility to me, and I am accordingly involved at present in <Col N="882" /> discussions on the reorganisation of Government information services generally.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one other matter which on a strictly technical view hardly comes at present within the ambit of this Estimate but which nonetheless it may be useful to refer to here.  This is the question of whether to broadcast Oireachtas proceedings and if so how this should be arranged. These, of course, are matters for the Oireachtas itself to decide.  For that very reason, however, it is appropriate that Deputies should have an opportunity to discuss the matter and the consideration of the present Estimate, under which traditionally we discuss, among other things, the wider aspects of radio and television, seems to offer an appropriate opportunity for Deputies to express their views on this matter also.</P>
    <P>If I may offer my own view by way of opening a discussion on the matter, it is that the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings is a logical application of democratic principle in the particular technological conditions in which we live today.  Indeed, the fact that parliamentary proceedings can be published in full through the printed word but cannot be broadcast direct at all would be hard to defend in principle, and is, I think something of an anachronism.  That, at least, is my personal opinion.  I am not, in this part of my remarks speaking for the Government at this stage.  The legal aspects of this question are under study by the Attorney General who is looking into law and practices in other comparable democratic countries in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of the right to report parliamentary proceedings is an important part of the history not only of the press, but of democratic institutions generally.  In the 18th century the Westminster Parliament treated any attempt at reporting parliamentary proceedings as a most serious offence, and a number of persons were, in fact, convicted and imprisoned for this.  If all these laws were still in force all these gentlemen in the Press Gallery would be removed by the police.  I do not wish <Col N="883" /> to be reported as advocating this.</P>
    <P>This may seem to us in retrospect absurd, but it was at least defensible on the assumptions current under the oligarchical arrangements of that time. There was nothing democratic about an 18th-century parliament.  They would scoff at such ideas.  It is possible that our own contemporary prohibition of direct broadcasting of parliament may seem no less absurd to later generations, and it can be argued that we, as a democratic assembly, who recognise the full right of the people to scrutinise our proceedings, have less right to prevent those proceedings from being broadcast than that parliament of long ago had to prevent the publication of its proceedings through the written word.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that there are limitations and that if the Oireachtas should, in their wisdom, decide to move in that direction, they may well not wish to move very far all at once. Certainly, I do not think anyone will seriously suggest that all the proceedings of the Dáil should be televised. Taken in its present stage of development, television is distracting with lights and cameras, and so on, and possibly some of us might be upset or otherwise over-stimulated by the presence of those devices.</P>

      <P>The introduction of sound broadcasting, which can be done very unobtrusively, would not have that effect and I would think we could move a good way in that direction. I should be very interested to hear the views of Deputies on this matter.  I am sure that, if there is a consensus in the House generally favouring a move in this direction, a suitable framework for its operation could be established and that RTE would co-operate to the full with the House in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I sit down I should like to <Col N="884" /> mention one other matter with regret. My predecessor, Deputy G. Collins, asked to have this debate put off to a later time.  I was able to meet his wishes only to the extent that I had intended to open this debate yesterday and I am now opening it today for reasons which I felt to be strong and particularly in view of the need to end speculation about the new RTE Authority.  I genuinely regret this because I know that Deputy Collins, when Minister, was in the habit of extending a similar courtesy to Opposition spokesmen.  In normal circumstances I should like to be able to extend a similar courtesy.</P>

      <P>Speakers from all sides of the House found these notes very valuable for many reasons, primarily because of the amount of detail which was dealt with in those notes.  It was also reasonably easy to acquire an overall picture of what was going on in the Department.  Since the present Minister was so anxious to make his introductory speech, it is a great pity that seemingly he forgot to circulate those notes to speakers in the normal way.  I should like to think that this was an oversight on his part and that, if he is there this time next year introducing the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the same thing will not happen.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister with the Estimate for this Department. I suppose I can say that I could have predicted a very large percentage of the introductory statement due to the fact that I lived with the situation until very recently.  The House is aware that very shortly before Christmas we had a full and comprehensive debate on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  As this debate which was continued for four or five weeks was held only a couple of months ago, I fear that there is every possibility of a lot of repetition at this stage.  I might add that there is <Col N="886" /> no danger of any repetition on the part of the present Minister because, during that debate before Christmas, he confined his remarks wholly and solely to the broadcasting part of the discussion.  Seemingly he was unaware then of the existence of the many other aspects of the Department.  I am sure he has been enlightened in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I can say without fear of contradiction that tremendous progress was made during my tenure of office with regard to telephone development.  At this stage, for the record, I should like to state the position as it was at the end of my term of office.  I see from the Minister's statement that 27,000 new telephone lines were connected as compared with 21,000 in 1971-72.  As marvellous an increase as this was in the rate of connection, it is disturbing to note that the waiting list still grew by about 10,000 to the figure of 32,000 applicants waiting for telephones. Like the present Minister, the size of the waiting list is also a matter of concern to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the huge increase in the number of telephones and also the demand for the installation of more telephones.  I believe that the demand for telephones will mushroom.  I believe his technicians will have a tremendous task to face in meeting these demands.  I know quite well that meeting these applications for telephones creates an extremely heavy demand on capital.  The Minister can see that there have been quite large increases in the total capital expenditure over the last few years.  In 1970-71 the figure was £9.4 million, in 1971-72, £11.1 million and the figure for 1972-73 was £15 million. I sincerely hope that the Minister on examination of those three sets of figures I have just mentioned will see that the previous Government were quite serious with regard to the demand for telephones.  I hope the Minister will continue the percentage increase in money to be got from the Government for telephone capital expenditure.  I suggest he uses his powers of persuasion on his colleagues in Government to see to it that such moneys are made available to his <Col N="887" /> Department to maintain the standard of telephone service we have.</P>
    <P>I might add for the Minister's information that despite the amount of money which has been spent on telephones it is commonly believed that our telephone service is not anything as good as it should be.  We know that the demand for telephones is completely outrunning the supply.  No effort should be spared with regard to the recruitment and training of extra staff.  Measures taken to eliminate congestion on telephone lines due to overloading and bottlenecks which exist in the service resulted in orders being placed amounting to about £16 million.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will face up to his responsibilities in a far better way than did his predecessor in a previous Coalition Government.  I am afraid at that time the orders of the day from the Coalition Government were not how to expand the service, or how to meet the demands which were there at the time from the people but how to cut down expenditure.  It was as a result of the bad management and stewardship of the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, a member of the Coalition Government, that for many years after they were brought to their knees in 1957 difficulties were experienced in the telephone service because of the starvation of capital by the Government of that time.</P>
    <P>I should like at this very early stage in the Minister's career as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to say that we will be watching very closely and that we will not tolerate the same sort of practice used in the period 1954 to 1957.  The Minister will probably earn a reputation for himself that is not really justified because at the moment he has a waiting list of telephone applicants of about 32,000.  This is the highest figure we ever had for telephones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that one of the top priorities of his Ministry will be to see to it that sufficient money is made available for telephone development.  This is a very important item and I hope the Minister thinks likewise.  I must confess I have certain doubts because it did not appear on the 14-point national coalition plan but let that not hide the Minister's very grave responsibility in this matter.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of dissatisfaction is expressed by telephone applicants because of the delay in providing a telephone service.  In fairness to the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs it can be said that about 25 per cent of applications are met within a period of about three months.  Up to the end of the year which has just gone almost half of the orders received were being attended to.  I hope this practice will continue.  I should like the Minister when replying to let us know whether or not he proposes to increase the charges for telephone calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been a scheme in operation whereby telephone kiosks were provided in rural areas where telephone facilities are of vital importance to the people.  In 1969 the Department provided about 70 new kiosks and I think it was intended in the present year to erect about 200 more.  I suggest that the Minister would be doing a worthwhile job if he stepped up this figure considerably.  He will have seen in the past&mdash; and this can be confirmed from the Official Report&mdash; the number of Deputies making representations regarding telephone kiosks. Much has been done and I know the difficulties involved but, if at all possible, I think the figure should be increased considerably.  Unfortunately, there are areas&mdash;one in particular of which I am thinking&mdash;which urgently need telephones and I ask the officials of the Department, through their Minister, to continue trying to provide a telephone service for those who live in the Black Valley outside Killarney. <Col N="889" /> I know the technical difficulties involved and the efforts that have been made to remove these difficulties and I hope that the near future will see a satisfactory end to this problem which we have had for some time.</P>
    <P>It has been, and I am sure still is, the practice of the Department to provide telephone kiosks in rural areas outside small sub-post offices only in areas where it is believed these kiosks will be economically viable.  In an effort to help isolated rural communities the Department agreed to accept local county councils as guarantors for kiosks in rural areas.  Sufficient use is not being made of local authorities in regard to the provision of kiosks in isolated areas and I suggest that consideration be given to having a member of the Post Office staff designated to pursue this matter actively with county councils.  From my knowledge of local authorities, I know they would be quite willing to help out communities in isolated areas.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy for Post Office officials in regard to vandalism on telephone kiosks.  It has been, is and should be the practice that we do not publicise the efforts of the Department to counteract vandalism but I suggest greater efforts are needed if we are to succeed against those who want to destroy public telephone boxes.  The Minister should consider doubling or trebling the staff at present repairing kiosks and ensuring that telephones are in working condition.  In a sense it is a sad reflection on our principal public thoroughfare, O'Connell Street, that almost every evening one finds a large percentage of public telephone kiosks out of order.  This causes certain frustration and anxiety to customers.  We should seriously consider doubling or trebling the maintenance staff on this job.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that the telex service continued its rapid growth and that the number of subscribers increased repidly in the year just ended. It is no harm to state for the benefit of telex subscribers that a telex exchange on the most modern lines, costing almost £1 million, is expected to come into service very early next year.  I am sure this will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> Before leaving the telephone side of the Department, it is no harm to say that an investment of approximately £96 million was made in telephones between 1957 and 1973.  Prior to that, I gather, the total investment was about £17 million and I am quite sincere when I say that I hope the Minister will resist all the many pressures which will be put on him at some stage, perhaps in the near future, by his Government colleagues when they, as a Government, will be taking up the tabs, if they propose to fulfil the many promises they made the electorate last February.</P>
    <P>With regard to the postal side of the Department's operations, I am quite satisfied that the quality of the postal service is generally regarded as satisfactory.  It is certainly superior to that of most countries in Europe and, indeed, throughout the world.  I am satisfied, too, that every effort is being made to streamline the service and make it even more efficient.  In saying that, I should now like to pay tribute to the many, many workers involved in the postal operation and in the telephone operation; they are doing an excellent job.  In particular, I hope that on the postal side of the operation they will continue to give the excellent service they have been giving.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows, I am sure, that postmen in Dublin are now working a five-day week.  Efforts are being made to introduce a five-day week for postmen throughout the country.  I urge that this scheme be brought into operation as quickly as possible because we are, I think, all agreed that in this day and age a five-day week is a very desirable thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when replying, might be kind enough to let the House know whether or not he has studied the report on the Survey of Management Procedures and Telecommunications Organisation presented in December, 1972, and, if so, would he be good enough to give us his views on it?</P>
    <P>With regard to the section of the Minister's opening statement dealing with broadcasting, I must say, in <Col N="891" /> fairness to him, that his contribution certainly gives food for thought and serious discussion.  One could note a certain impatience, particularly with regard to the Broadcasting Review Committee.  The Minister has expressed his views and has asked many questions, questions he did not offer to answer.  He hopes to introduce amending legislation at an early stage to right what he considers to be things that are wrong.  I do not propose to try to answer the Minister's questions. It was because I, too, had many questions which I could not satisfactorily answer that I proposed to the previous Government that a review committee should be set up to consider in very great depth the many problems which would have to be faced with regard to broadcasting.  I took the stand&mdash;rightly, I think&mdash;that I, having set up the committee, ought not to engage in public discussion on the matters involved because I felt that whatever I might have to say might have some effect on the thinking of the review committee.  The committee, under the very able chairmanship of Mr. Justice Murnaghan, meet very, very frequently and, from what I can gather in a general way, they are doing a tremendous job. Evidence of this can be seen in the interim report which was presented by them at the end of February.  Anybody and everybody who had anything to say was given an opportunity of letting this review committee know what they had to offer.  I must say that when I was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I did not maintain any contact whatever with this body having set them up, because I believed that if they were to present the best report, which everybody wanted, then certainly they should have as free a hand as possible.</P>
    <P>In that report which dealt only with cable television and the choice of programmes important recommendations were made.  These recommendations were available for two-and-a-half months approximately and I had hoped that the present Minister might have had something to say to us in regard <Col N="892" /> to them because of portion of the policy document and the 14-point plan of the Coalition which was produced just before the election.  It is no harm to say here that the section of that document which appeared in our daily newspapers on Thursday, 8th February, which dealt with broadcasting said:</P>

      <P>We will take that part of it first.  Certainly there is no sign of speed here when we have an interval of two-and-a-half months in which there has been no word on it so far.  It goes on to say that a special examination, as a matter of urgency, of such matters as a second TV channel, local radio, the provision of piped television and the relationship of the RTE Authority with the Government would be made.  I admit that there was haste in the preparation of this 14-point plan.  I admit that the framers of it were as anxious as anybody to give, in broadcasting terms, blanket coverage to as many of the electorate as possible.  I would suggest that this sense of urgency which the framers of this little policy programme had should spur the present Minister and Government to make some announcement in the near future with regard to the provision of this second channel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that as the debate goes on.  The Minister read for over an hour from a very carefully prepared brief.  I listened to him and did not interrupt him.  I would have hoped that this courtesy which is normally shown in the House could have been extended to me.  It appears that the present Minister is not terribly anxious, if he is anxious at all, to facilitate Opposition Members of the House.  I am sure that the Minister need have no fear whatever.  By the time I am finished making my contribution on this Estimate there will be very little, if anything, I will have left out.</P>
      <P>In connection with the interim report from the Murnaghan Committee I would suggest that the Minister and the Government are long overdue in making some statement on the provision of a choice of television viewing in the single channel area.  I can assure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that they were not slow prior to the general election polling day in talking rather loudly about it at every opportunity.  It is only fair at this stage to ask them to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his statement mentioned the limit of 500 homes on the mastheads for piped television.  I hope to deal with that point at a later stage. The Minister mentioned that he was in touch with the Broadcasting Review Committee asking them to speed up matters.  It is fair to say that this body are working extremely efficiently and for a voluntary body the fact that they are meeting once a week for many hours discussing this very delicate problem is something for which we, the elected representatives of the people, and the people should be very grateful. They have recommended that a second channel should be provided in the <Col N="894" /> single channel area.  They recommended that this channel should be run by RTE.  That is a very sound recommendation.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister this morning declaring his interest in dealing with speculative rumours in the newspapers I would have thought that if he were as serious as he says he is he would have somebody on his behalf contradict the rumours in the article which appeared in some of our papers some time ago to the effect that if and when the second channel was set up it would be run by people other than RTE.  I hope that the Minister will have a statement to make on this matter very soon and that we can discuss it further then.</P>
    <P>There was also a minority report by one of the members of the Murnaghan Committee, who said that a second RTE service while it would be a good thing would not meet the needs of many of the people in the single channel areas.  He went on to say that he hoped that other stations like BBC would be piped into areas like Cork city, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and places like that.  I think he said to all towns of over 1,000 homes or so.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that and I hope he will come to a decision as quickly as possible with regard to whatever recommendations he is to make to the Government.</P>
    <P>The House is aware from the annual report of RTE for 1971-72 that RTE had a very small surplus of between £9,000 and £10,000.  I was glad to hear from the Minister that things are much better now, that present indications are that there will be a surplus of over £200,000.  I know that is a very small surplus.  The Minister went on to say that RTE have claimed that a significant increase in licence fee revenue will be needed in the present year.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether an application for an increase in fees has been made by RTE and, if so, when it is likely that a decision will be taken on this application.  I had hoped that the Minister might have been in a position to have the decision on that application for his opening contribution to this debate.  I am aware that every <Col N="895" /> effort was made and is being made to collect all the moneys due from licence fees for RTE by the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. In an effort to help them in this task we found it necessary to introduce the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1972.  I know the staff of the Department had certain difficulties with regard to the implementation of that Act.  I hope the Minister will tell us later what progress has been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>In regard to Radio na Gaeltachta, I am pleased that the arrangements for giving service to the eastern part of the country are nearly complete.  This was the thinking behind planning in this field a couple of years ago.  I know that people who are lucky enough to live in areas where it is received and have the time to listen to Radio na Gaeltachta regard it as a success.  Like all new services it had its teething problems but I have no doubt it will go from strength to strength.  I wish it every success.  The Minister might let us know whether at this stage&mdash;it may be too early&mdash;the broadcasting hours might be extended.  There are a couple of hours of broadcasting each evening. In the evening radio has a serious competitor in television.  Those who are responsible for the day to day running of Radio na Gaeltachta, in particular Comhairle Radio na Gaeltachta, might consider the possibility of letting those who are in a position to do so hear it during the midday period.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that plans for the provision of a new higher powered transmitter to replace the existing transmitter at Athlone were proceeding satisfactorily.  We all know that the equipment is on order and that the site has been obtained.  It would be the wish of everybody in this House and those whom they represent that this new transmitter should be in service by the end of the next financial year, that would be by the end of March, 1975.  I would urge that this matter be speeded up if possible and that every step be taken to endeavour to have the transmitter in operation before 1975.</P>
    <P>We are all very anxious that our radio programmes would be heard <Col N="896" /> not only throughout the Twenty-Six Counties but throughout the entire country.  On a number of occasions Members of the House have spelled out the importance of having our radio programmes heard in the Six Counties.  We would go further and hope that, if possible, Radio Éireann would be heard by many of our emigrants in England.  I was distressed recently to read that as a result of the setting up of a local station in London on a band which is very near that of Radio Éireann people who, in the past, were able to receive our station, are now having difficulty in this regard.  This is an unfortunate situation. I hope that when the Minister meets his opposite number in the British Conservative Government, he will raise this aspect of broadcasting.</P>

It has been said that radio is the poor relation in terms of modern day broadcasting but I would not go along with that idea because radio is very important and will become even more important in the future.  If in any way we can use our radio broadcasting service towards the creation of a better and a healthier atmosphere both north and south of the Border, we should endeavour to do so.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that this question of radio reception is on the agenda for discussion with his counterpart in the British Conservative Government.  I wish the Minister luck in that regard. During the course of these discussions, too, perhaps the Minister might use his powers of persuasion with regard to any objection there may be regarding the siting of a television mast in County Louth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably be aware from the documentation that is available to him in his Department that much of the groundwork in this field had been done by the previous Government.  I know there are obstacles involved and that it would not be right for me to spell these out in the course of the debate. I may disagree with the Minister in many respects, but on a matter of creating an atmosphere of goodwill in this country on the basis of a 32-county country we can forget our differences.  I would wish for a situation in which more than the present 14 per cent of television viewers in the Six Counties would be able to receive our programmes.  Any such extension would be a step towards the creation of harmony.  The present situation in the Twenty-six Counties in relation to television is that almost half of our people can avail freely of BBC and ITV programmes.  I would welcome a situation in which the remainder of the people also could avail of these stations.  I am aware that there are difficulties in this respect but I am satisfied that those people who are living in the multichannel areas have come to no harm whatever as a result of watching these other stations.  There is no need for worry in that respect.  It is desirable that more people in this part of the country be able to avail of UTV.  Perhaps there are some who would be loud in their condemnation of the programmes from this station but I would hope that that would not be the case.</P>
      <P>In connection with the projection of our signal in the Six County area, perhaps the Minister would let us know whether he will continue, or have his officials continue, negotiations with the, shall I say, caretakers of the international agreement on broadcasting.  I can understand and accept the reason for these international agreements but, at the same time, there are very special circumstances obtaining in this country which, possibly, do not exist in any other country that is a signatory to that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to appoint a <Col N="898" /> new RTE Authority to take office on 1st June next.  Can he tell us what is to be their period of appointment?</P>

      <P>I wish this authority well.  Some of the members are known to me personally.  I know them to be very fine people and I am sure the same goes for those others whom I do not know quite so well.  The Minister said he notified the present authority of his intention to nominate an entirely new authority and he referred to the new authority.  However, he also stated that naturally he wished to have the views of the new authority before making any fundamental decisions in the area of broadcasting and television. He stated that he is awaiting the final report of the Broadcasting Review Committee but I suggest to him that he might curb his impatience with regard to making any fundamental decisions in this area until he has the final report of the committee.</P>
      <P>I shall be anxious to study in detail the recommendations of the Minister in relation to the present restriction of 500 homes per masthead for the wired television system.  The Minister has stated he has asked the Murnaghan Committee for a further report at an early date on the development of piped television.  Perhaps we should leave aside a detailed debate on this matter until we know what recommendations the Minister wishes to make.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked the question: what do the people want on radio and on television?  I agree with the Minister that no one in the country has a stronger incentive to try to express what the people want than Members of this House.  I hope that the views of Members expressed during the course of this Estimate debate will be carefully considered by the RTE Authority &mdash;I have frequently expressed this hope in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is natural that Deputies will have a personal preference with regard to programmes.  In the last three or four years I have listened to Deputies on all sides express their likes or dislikes for certain programmes.  This is quite natural and, like the Minister, I would <Col N="899" /> encourage Members to express not only their personal feelings but also to try as far as possible to convey the considered opinion of the people they represent.  I should like to inform the Minister that in the single-channel areas there is a demand of considerable proportions for alternative viewing. When the Minister is concluding I hope he will say something about this topic.</P>
    <P>In connection with cabled television, it is fair to say there is dissatisfaction with regard to the piped television system in operation in Dublin city.  There is delay in the provision of the system, possibly delays resulting from the competitive nature of the business.  I know that complaints have been made in this House and in the newspapers that communities in certain areas have to wait for periods of 18 months or more for connections to the system.  We all know what is the problem&mdash;it is a question of money.</P>

    <Col N="900" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This is a short technical Bill.  The background to it is that in their 14-point plan announced before the recent General Election the Government stated their intention to reduce local rates by transferring on a phased basis from local to central taxation the burden of health charges on local authorities and the cost to them of local authority housing subsidies.</P>
      <P>On 30th March, the Government announced that in the present financial year, 1973-74, the rate to be levied by each local authority for health services and local authority housing subsidies could be reduced by 25 per cent as compared with the rates levied for these purposes in 1972-73, this being the first phase in the total transfer of costs to the Exchequer over a four-year period.  At that stage, however, 11 county councils and three urban district councils had already adopted estimates of expenditure and determined rates in the pound for 1973-74.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, there is no way in which a local authority can reduce a rate which has been determined in accordance with the statutory procedure laid down.  In order that the ratepayers in those areas where rates had already been determined might be enabled to benefit from the reductions announced by the Government it was necessary that a legislative provision be made enabling the relevant local authorities to levy an amended rate.  The Bill which I have introduced is, as I have already said, a technical measure designed solely to validate any modified rates in the pound adopted by the small number of relevant local authorities subsubsequent to the announcement of the Government's decision.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to ask a question.  Although naturally I welcome the Bill, would the Minister inform us if there is any possible way <Col N="901" /> of restricting the health charge remission to residential houses only?  As the Bill stands, huge industrial concerns will benefit as well as the ordinary ratepayer and I do not think this would be desirable.  I hope the Minister can devise some means by which large industrial concerns will be excluded from this benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy asking a question or making a speech?  If he is about to make a speech I should prefer to allow him to finish it rather than to be intervening periodically to answer questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be as well if the Minister answered this question. We are all anxious that this Bill should get a speedy passage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that at the present time it would not be possible technically to do what Deputy Moore has suggested, nor do I think it would be desirable because in such a situation some of the hardest hit would be small business people whose businesses could not be classified as residential.  Those small businesses are already badly hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the large industrial concerns.  They will now benefit from the remission of the health charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be done. The rate is a common one which applies to an entire building and it would not be possible at this stage to do what the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The health charge is a special charge on the rates chart and surely it would be possible to exclude it from the chart of a residential ratepayer and not exclude it from that of big industrial concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, the situation, as everybody in the House knows, is that the rate is levied on the entire building.  It is a common rate. What Deputy Moore is suggesting is <Col N="902" /> that, where premises are being used for business, this element of the rate, not only for health but for housing subsidies, should not be excluded.  This would be an impossible task at the present time.  As I said earlier, neither would it be desirable to do it in a general way because, as we all know, there are many businesses whose premises are part-residential and on which a common rate is levied.  To do what Deputy Moore suggests would mean that all small businesses&mdash;small shops and guesthouses, for instance&mdash; would lose the benefit of this remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases it might be desirable to adopt the Deputy's suggestion but what is desirable and possible are two entirely different matters at this stage.  I can refer it to the Department of Finance and the Government and if they so desire it might be possible to devise ways in which this matter can be dealt with.  However, I can assure Deputy Moore that, even if we desired to do it this year, it would not be possible to do it this year.</P>

I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that while the number of pupils in secondary schools increased by about 64 per cent in the period 1962/63 to 1971/72 the increase in the number of science graduates teaching in these schools amounted to about 100 per cent during the same period.

      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the purpose of granting or equating one honour in Irish with two for the purpose of higher educational grants is a subsidy for the Gaeltacht areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a subsidy but an incentive, because, as the Deputy well knows, the percentage in all-Irish schools is, from memory, 48 point something per cent.  It could be argued, for example, that in his own area, in Ballymun, an all-Irish school would give it a geographical or other advantage here.  I think all sides of the House would agree that it has been the policy over the years to give some advantage in terms of bonus marks, for example, in certificates to those who deal with the Irish language and I do not think we should cease at this point.</P>

      <P>I am at present giving active consideration, in consultation with the other interests involved, to extending the use of school buses, on a hireage basis, to meet the travel requirements of pupils and teachers participating in school games and school-related physical education events.</P>
      <P>However, I should point out that these buses are utilitarian-type vehicles, specially designed for school work only.  They were not built with ordinary transport work in mind.  Moreover, the present taxation and licensing arrangements for these vehicles are such as to preclude their use for any purpose other than the conveyance of children to and from school.</P>

I am not aware that there are many restrictions inherent in it which militate against its full efficacy.  The only one I am aware of is that, in its interpretation by some courts, it does not apply where there are pleas of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo;.  This is a matter at which I am having a look.</P>

    <P>I would regard it as improper for me to give any details in regard to the health of any prisoner without his consent or to say, in relation to a person who had been taking drugs, whether or not he was regarded by the prison medical officer as an addict.  The position <Col N="928" /> is that all prisoners have free access to the prison medical officer, who decides what treatment, if any, a prisoner who comes to him is in need of.  If the medical officer considers that the person is in need of treatment at an institution outside the prison, such as the drug clinics, the necessary arrangements are made.  It will be clear that I could not agree to discuss in any way the medical decision of a doctor in relation to a particular identifiable person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this question was tabled because of representations made to me by the parents?  They also made representations to the prison authorities.  I made representations to the Eastern Health Board psychiatrist about the treatment and was told this could not be undertaken without the permission of the doctor in the prison, who refused permission. In the circumstances and remembering the facts that the parents and this particular individual himself could not make representations, would the Minister not look at the question in the light of the information I have now given him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I have to reject the Deputy's suggestion that the prison doctor refused treatment.  That is not accurate.  The request to the Deputy came from the parents of the person, who was under the impression that he was not getting treatment whereas, in fact, he was getting treatment from the prison medical officer. As the Deputy knows, the service provided in the prison is, in the first instance, at GP level and, as in any GP medical service, the doctor has to make an assessment as to whether specialist treatment is necessary or whether he himself is competent to give it.  I am perfectly satisfied that the correct decision was made in this case because this particular person, on his release, was absolutely free of any symptoms of addiction.  There was a breakdown subsequent to his release, but that had nothing to do with the quality of the treatment he received in prison.  It would appear to have been a matter of his own motivation to give <Col N="929" /> up the habit.  I am satisfied that, while in prison, the correct decision was made and the treatment was adequate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>The number of prisoners who served sentences in Mountjoy Prison in the three years ending 28th February, 1973, for offences connected with the unlawful possession of drugs was five, four and 11 respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition, it may be taken that there were prisoners sentenced for other offences who had been either abusing or dependent on drugs.</P>
      <P>Any prisoner committed to Mountjoy Prison who is either convicted of drug offences, or who is known to have a problem related to the abuse of drugs, is accommodated in the medical wing of the prison for observation and appropriate treatment by the medical officer, whose patient he is.</P>
      <P>A close liaison is maintained with the Eastern Health Board, whose specialist services are regularly availed of on the basis of out-patient or inpatient attendances, whenever the doctor decides that this is likely to be beneficial.</P>

The figures I have given relate to persons convicted of offences connected with the unlawful possession of drugs. It does not follow that they were drug addicts or that other people who were convicted of other offences were not drug addicts.  There is no offence as such in being a drug addict.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the consistent policy of successive Governments down the years to decline to say whether or not postal or telephone warrants have been issued in particular cases.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, speaking here on the night of 8th-9th May, 1970, Vol. 246, col. 1332, re-stated and explained in some detail the necessity for this policy but said that, in the circumstances that had then arisen, he would, as an exceptional measure limited to that occasion only, confirm that no warrant was in force in respect of any member of the Oireachtas. My predecessor, Deputy O'Malley, adopted the same policy in a reply to a number of questions on 17th February, 1972, while formally repeating the assurance on that occasion, Vol. 258, col. 2138.</P>
      <P>For the reasons detailed by the former Taoiseach as to why assurances about these warrants should not be given in particular cases, I could not agree to initiate a policy of giving such assurances periodically, even in relation to Members of the Oireachtas.  However, as this is the first time the matter has been raised since such an assurance was, even though exceptional, given by my predecessor, I must have regard to the possibility of misunderstanding if I leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, to avoid that risk, I <Col N="941" /> am prepared just on this occasion to confirm that there has, in fact, been no change in the position as outlined by my predecessor and to say, furthermore, that I see no reason whatsoever to envisage any change in that position in the future.  I am giving this assurance on the basis that, as far as I am concerned, it is intended to be the final one and not to be repeated on any future occasion.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, it is in accordance with practice and precedent that, if a request is made by a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary for the allocation to him of a particular driver the request is acceded to where possible.  In that sense, the allocation of the drivers has never been regarded as being a matter exclusively for the Garda authorities. There has been no departure from established procedure since the present Government took office.  It has never been the practice to ask for reasons for a request for the assignment of a particular driver.</P>

      <P>Would I be right in thinking that during the past few years these meetings have been infrequent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would be right in that in 1972 there were two meetings while there was one meeting in 1971.  The Act which provides for the calling of these meetings provides also that the frequency of such meetings be not more than twice in one year but that frequency, limited as it is, has not been met except for last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the primary purpose of these meetings as set out in the subsection, namely, an effort to ensure that there would be uniformity of penalties throughout the country, does not seem to have been achieved?  Is he aware that there is public disquiet as a result of a considerable lack of uniformity in relation to penalties in different parts of the country for the same or for similar type offences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Deputy is aware that the sentence or punishment applicable in any particular case depends on the circumstances of that case.  It depends on the seriousness of the matter and on whether it is a mitigation. It can depend also on the standard of advocacy adduced by the defendant in his defence.  Once these variations are built into the system it is <Col N="944" /> impossible to have utter uniformity.  I share the Deputy's concern in cases where there would appear to be a large divergence in respect of what we might call routine offences.  I would like to see a uniform standard prevail as much as possible but I do not know whether this can be achieved to any absolute degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Jervis Street Hospital, in co-operation with the Eastern Health Board, operates an out-patient clinic and advisory service at the hospital.  Approval has also been given to the provision of an in-patient unit at the hospital to deal with emergencies, mainly cases of overdosage.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board provide services on an out-patient basis at Ushers Island and plan to provide 11 beds in hostel type accommodation. The board also provide services on a residential basis in a unit in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum.

      <P>The situation in summary is that, until the new administrative bodies in the health field have reviewed how the basic considerations in the FitzGerald Report might be applied in detail in particular areas, it would be premature to make decisions regarding individual hospitals.</P>

      <P>The application of the means test in the granting of the medical cards is a matter for the chief executive officer of each health board. <Col N="951" /> However, as I indicated in my reply to Deputy O'Connell on 28th March, 1973, a substantial degree of uniformity in the guidelines governing eligibility exists throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary received complaints from people in the various health board areas regarding a lack of uniformity in this matter?  The human element, the assessment of means, is left to the home assistance officers.  In view of this, would the Parliamentary Secretary devise some method whereby his Department would give some guidelines that would eliminate some of the things that are happening?  For instance, in some areas the ownership of a car means that a medical card is not issued to a person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why questions Nos. 16 (b) and 22 are included in Part 2 of the application form for a deserted wife's allowance; and if it is proposed to amend the form of questions and in particular to amend the provision whereby the answers to these questions must be confirmed by a home assistance officer, a garda or a minister of religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory regulations made under the Social Welfare Acts require that a woman, to qualify for a deserted wife's allowance, apart from satisfying other conditions, must make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to trace her husband and to prevail upon him to resume living with her or to contribute to the support and maintenance of herself and her children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of Question No. 16 (b) on the application form is to ascertain if the applicant has made any attempt, where she is aware of her husband's whereabouts, to prevail on him to resume living with her.  Question No. 22 seeks an explanation from an applicant who has made no efforts to comply with the requirements of the regulations. To establish that the statutory provisions are satisfied it is necessary to ask for replies to specific questions pertaining to those provisions and it is normal practice to have such replies confirmed by persons of standing.  The list of such persons is not, of course, confined to those mentioned in the question.  As I mentioned in reply to a recent question, I am having the scheme for deserted wife's allowances <Col N="954" /> reviewed.  The matters raised in the question, as well as all other pertinent matters, will be taken into consideration in the course of the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's statement in regard to a review of this matter.  Would he accept that there is need for a more liberal interpretation of questions Nos. 16 (b) and 22, particularly in respect of the statutory regulations which seem very harsh?  The deserted wife virtually has to prove that she attempted reconciliation and she must get it proved in writing, whereas in fact the husband has deserted her.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree there is need for a more liberal interpretation?</P>

I should like to direct his attention to the fact that the guide to the social services issued by his Department is a little vague in regard to this means test.</P>

Following consulation with the Attorney General in the matter I am now happy to say that it appears that such deserted wives may be entitled to an allowance subject, of course, to the fulfilment in each such case of the prescribed conditions normally applicable. Accordingly, all disallowed claims in which the question of divorce has been an issue are being re-examined as a matter of urgency with a view to re-determining eligibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that Deputy Cunningham must be aware that in County Donegal there is a peculiar situation where representations on behalf of applicants appear to be delayed.  It appears that time is lost in obtaining reports from relevant officers of the health board and the county council on the circumstances of the applicants.  These officers are required to make economic journeys which means they will call to an applicant only when they have other business in the area.  Perhaps Deputy Cunningham might use his good offices with Donegal County Council in an effort to have this changed.  In the Department we are doing what we can to help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the position regarding Knockane, Castlemartyr group water scheme, County Cork; and when it will be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the approval by my Department and Cork County Council of a design for a group water supply scheme to serve 12 houses in the area, difficulties arose in connection with the proposed source.  Cork County Council recently suggested that the Knockane scheme might be served from the Castlemartyr mains after the erection of a proposed new high level reservoir to serve Castlemartyr.  This suggestion is at present being investigated. I cannot comment on the likely progress of the scheme, pending the outcome of this investigation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather deal with it publicly.  The scheme was initially received in July, 1970, and the design of the pressure scheme was approved by the Department and the county council in July-August, 1971, subject to use of increased pipe sizes as requested by the county council.  The quotations and tenders came to hand in January, 1972, and the additional cost of the increased pipe sizes was calculated at £1,470.  Up to March, 1973, the reservoir site had not been acquired.  It was evident that acquisition would be difficult as the owner sought an undertaking from the group that the reservoir would be closed down if the site was developed as a quarry at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAhern" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In mid-March, 1973, the liaison officer between Cork County Council and the Department proposed that the Knockane area might now be served from Castlemartyr mains after a proposed new high level reservoir to serve Castlemartyr was erected.  This would obviate the need for pump and reservoir but it would entail a 1,000 yard extension on the Cork/Waterford national primary road and would result in a very high cost scheme&mdash;approximately £6,400 or £530 per house for 12 houses now in the group scheme.</P>

Contract documents for the scheme, at an estimated cost of £57,850 were received in the Department on 26th January, 1973, and are under technical examination.  Some adjustments are to be discussed by the Department's engineering inspector with the consulting engineer for the scheme during the week, subject to which the proposals can then be cleared technically.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state (a) the total cost to the Exchequer for the year 1973-74 of the rates remission relating to health charges and housing subsidies and (b) the amount by which the private household section of the community will benefit from this remission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost to the Exchequer in 1973-74 arising from the recent announcement of the transfer of certain health charges and local authority housing subsidies to central taxation is approximately £17 million.  Of this sum, an estimated £10.8 million relates to the reduction of 25 per cent in the rates in the £ required to be levied for these services in 1973-74 compared with the corresponding rates in 1972-73. The balance of £6.2 million refers to the increase in the cost of these services in 1973-74 compared with 1972-73, which would otherwise fall to be met from local rates.  There is of course an offsetting factor to some extent in the <Col N="967" /> agricultural grant which is related to the rates levied on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>No precise figures are available as to the amount of rates paid in respect of private dwellings.  Householders comprise the great majority of all rate-payers and it is understood that they account for over 50 per cent of the total amount of rates paid.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the whole area of scientific and technological policy, including policy for scientific and technical information, is at present under review.  With the coming to an end in the near future of the term of office, already twice extended, of the National Science Council and with the progressively increasing importance, accepted in all developed countries, of the contribution which science and technology can make to economic and social development, a new framework for elaborating policy is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision in principle has been taken to set up a statutory body for science and technology.  Active consideration is being given to its precise role and functions.  The implementation of this decision is in train and, with the completion in the near future of the OECD reviews of our policy for science and technology generally and scientific and technical information in particular, the way will be clear for definitive decisions in this connection.  With regard to emphasis, <Col N="969" /> I would hope that the new body when set up would think and act rather in terms of an overall national policy than of one constrained by sectoral considerations.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a question in regard to a particular case and I will give the Minister the particulars of the individual concerned afterwards if he wants them.  Some years ago an individual was nominated by an outside nominating body to contest the Seanad election and he was found to be ineligible to so contest because he was described as a Civil Servant.  On the other hand, when he was given an appointment by me in the Office of Public Works he was found not to be a civil servant when I left office.  Can we reconcile the two things?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he intends to proceed with the previous Government's plans to bring about equal pay within the Civil Service; and, if so, if he will explain why a different rate of pay as between men and women was offered in a recent advertisement for a post of information assistant in the Government Information Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind equal pay for work of equal value.  Such a scheme is being introduced on a phased basis for the Civil Service in line with employment generally.  The first steps in this direction are being taken under the provisions of the National Agreement, 1972.  The particular type of salary differentiation referred to in the question will be eliminated in the move towards equal pay.</P>
      <P>To have offered equal rates of pay in the advertisement to which the Deputy refers would have exceeded the National Agreement as regards the timing and amount of equal pay awards.  The Government have undertaken to respect Employer/Labour Conference recommendations in this field.  The terms of employment offered in the advertisement conformed with those recommendations.</P>

      <P>This proposal for coast protection works at Enniscrone was received from Sligo County Council on 18th February, 1969.  It was investigated by the Office of Public Works engineers and found to have special aspects not only from the point of view of the protection works but also because it was necessary to relate the work to Enniscrone as a popular seaside resort.  Proposals were eventually agreed with the local authority.  The <Col N="976" /> cost of the proposed scheme would be something like £85,000.  Sligo County Council agreed to contribute half this sum and a decision from the Minister for Finance to contribute the other half is awaited.  A feature of the scheme will be the provision of promenades and terracing in the tourist interest.  I feel certain the road in question will be adequately buttressed and fortified against erosion.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>As a result of the arrangements negotiated by me in Luxembourg last week, the support prices for butter and skim milk powder to apply here from Monday next, 14th May, will represent between 2p and 2½p per gallon of creamery milk more than those currently in operation.  When this improvement is combined with the effects of the introduction of the EEC system here and the arrangements for dealing with international monetary changes, the overall result for Irish creamery suppliers will be a return this year of about 4½ per gallon more for their milk than they obtained last year.</P>
      <P>As regards the effect on the price of butter to consumers, additional funds are being provided by the Government in order to ensure that, taking account of the EEC subsidy to be financed from FEOGA, the consumer price of butter following the removal of VAT will not be higher than at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appreciate it.  It is difficult to comment on a contribution which has not been disclosed. What happens is, I think, that Ministers tell their own Parliaments what they have said and other Ministers then comment on that and put their own point of view and their gloss on the situation, especially if they feel that the interests of their country have not been served by the comments made by other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that if a practice were to grow whereby Irish Ministers were to disclose in public the comments made by members of other governments in the EEC Council of Ministers, consequently the same thing would happen with regard to our Minister's contributions? Further, does the Minister not agree that not alone would this be a breach of the Luns Protocol to which the Minister has referred but it would not be in the national interest? That being so, would he explain to the House why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on an RTE news programme on Wednesday, 4th April, disclosed contributions by other Ministers in the EEC?  I might add this question was put down to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>The question put to me asks a general guidance on the matter.  The guidance has to be given here in a somewhat general form because this is a grey area and practice varies a good deal.  At the recent meeting of the Ministers of Agriculture some remarkable things were said by Ministers about each other and were reported by them to the press, including in one case the opinion that a Minister seemed to be a bit off his head in what he said.  There is a grey <Col N="986" /> area here because the practice of disclosure varies a good deal.  If there is a particular complaint the Deputy has about a particular Minister it would be better if he addressed it to him. The question does not say anything about the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  All I can say is what the practice and guidelines are and these are adhered to by members of this Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the policy of the Government in regard to the use by members of the Government of travel facilities on planes used by foreign Governments for their own members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal practice of members of the Government when travelling abroad is to use ordinary &mdash;and, where possible, Irish&mdash;commercial transport.  Courtesy requires that, on a formal official or State visit, travel facilities offered in the host country by its Government be accepted.  Moreover, should a Minister happen to be invited to accompany a foreign colleague on a journey in a plane belonging to the latter's State, I can see value in this course if it enables the Minister to make use of travel time to have further exchanges of view, which are not necessarily less valuable for taking place in an aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it appropriate that an Irish Minister should travel in a plane reserved by a foreign Government for their own use and, in particular, does he consider it appropriate that an Irish Minister should travel in an RAF jet reserved for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice is well established.  In 1966 Mr. Aiken, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, travelled in a Canadian Government jet with Ambassador Cremin, Mr. B.T. Nolan, as well as Canadian officials, from New York to Ottawa <Col N="987" /> and back.  On 7th August, 1968, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, accompanied by the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and their wives travelled from New Delhi to Agra, Taj Mahal, in an Indian Government aircraft.  In June, 1971, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, travelled from Luxembourg to Paris in a French Government aircraft at the invitation of the then French Foreign Minister, Mr. Schumann; both were accompanied by senior officials of their respective Ministries.  They were returning from an EEC ministerial meeting in Luxembourg and Mr. Schumann offered a lift to Dr. Hillery.  I am not prepared to condemn Deputy Lynch, Dr. Hillery or Mr. Aiken for what seems to me sensible actions on their part, enabling them to have useful consultations with the Ministers concerned.  I should add that on 15th March, 1973, I travelled from London to Brussels on a British Government aircraft at the invitation of the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas Home, to attend a meeting in Brussels of the Council of Ministers.  This enabled me to have a useful discussion with Sir Alec which would not have been possible otherwise at the time because we had only a brief time at Downing Street with the Prime Minister.  I think all of this has been wise and useful practices and that Messrs.  Aiken, Lynch, Hillery and FitzGerald behaved quite properly.</P>
