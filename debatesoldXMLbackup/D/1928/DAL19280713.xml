      <P>I was wondering if it would be possible to reach agreement whereby we would finish this stage to-day. It might, perhaps, be agreed, for instance, that I might be allowed to reply at 11.30, as it would be desirable not to split this particular Stage into three parts.</P>

      <P>We are agreeable to that proposal.  When speaking on this Bill last night I pointed out that an examination of the Exchequer returns for the quarter, and the comparison of these returns with the total annual yield over a period of four or five years back, indicated that this year the Estimate of the Minister for Finance, as contained in his Budget statement, was likely to prove altogether false.  It seems to us that it would result in the necessity of using borrowed money to meet ordinary current expenditure.  We heard a good deal about balancing the Budget in the past.  Some of us, of course, understand how that is done, namely, when the Minister for Finance is in difficulties he can take a particular section and say, &ldquo;This is not normal expenditure.  It is completely abnormal. It is not likely to occur again.&rdquo; In that particular way he tries to make the balance work out.  He indicated, however, very clearly, I think, in his statement that he himself was getting anxious about the position.  He admitted that it would require great <Col N="482" /> and sustained effort to obtain economies to make it unnecessary to impose new taxation next year.</P>
      <P>It is in the light of that statement that I say we ought to examine these returns and see what we are heading towards.  The only thing towards which I see we are heading definitely is that for this year current expenditure will have to be met with borrowed money and that next year we will again have to face the necessity of increasing taxation, as was done this year, because the devices adopted this year were admittedly such as would only bring in revenue for one year.  The Minister for Finance himself admitted that.  If you examine the devices you will realise what is being done.  You are bringing in largely into this year's account revenue which would come in next year. As one of our Deputies put it, the Minister this year is living on his seed potatoes.  That being the position, I think we ought to be much more careful about the question of economy in administration. That led me to speak about the general national policy of the administration, and I pointed out that when we talk about economies, salaries, and so forth we are talking of them in the light of the general national programme. What I find is that our fundamental philosophy, if I might put it in that way, in respect to the country in general, is different from that of those on the opposite benches.  Some of us, at any rate, when the Treaty was passed, felt that it was not merely that the national purpose for which we had been working for years was frustrated. I am talking now about the political independence of our country.</P>
      <P>As regards matters fundamental and in regard to the whole question of the social and economic life of the country, I say that our whole idea of what the social and economic life of this country should be was, so to speak, destroyed, or, at all events, the possibility of achieving it in a reasonable time was destroyed.  What we find is that the Ministers opposite are moving along a line which means that the country is going to get neither the fruits of the policy which a majority of us had been standing for from 1919 to 1921 nor the fruits of the alternative policy put forward now by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> They are drifting, drifting along, letting things slide.  The policy of laisser faire mentioned here may be all very well if things are going well.  If things are going well it is not a bad maxim to let very well alone.  It may not be a very heroic attitude but it sometimes is a wise one, unless you are certain by your interference that you are going to mend matters.  Surely there is no excuse for raising that maxim to a dogma when things are going badly, for, if you do, it only means that you are letting things get worse.  You must actively interfere.  We hold, unlike Ministers opposite, that active interference is necessary by the Ministry if we are going to get the country out of the rut in which it is at present.  There is, for instance, the attitude of mind displayed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who says that it is not our business to see that there is no unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture says: &ldquo;Let the other fellow go to the devil; we will help those who help themselves.&rdquo; That attitude of mind is, we think, a wrong one, and it is not going to work out to the general prosperity of the country.  We ought to see some strategic objective, if I might use a military term, before the Ministry.  We cannot see it.  We can see the objective that the Minister for Agriculture has for the moment.  We can see that well enough.  We see that it aims at trying to secure a larger share of the British market.  Very good; we understand that.  We may differ with him occasionally as to the methods by which he tries to secure that objective, but that is on the tactical question, if I may again use a military term, of how they are going to work.  That is all right. That is a matter where there is an ordinary difference of opinion.  That is very natural, and we understand that attitude, but we say it is not enough.  We say it is all right that we should have the best organisation, that our butter should be the best in the English market, or that our creameries should be organised so as to be as effective as possible, but is our objective to be that this country is to be run simply in order to supply food to the British?  We hold that that should not be the strategic <Col N="484" /> objective, if I may say so, of the Agricultural Department.</P>
    <P>We come again to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and we examine what they are aiming at.  We see the Shannon scheme.  We know what that is for, and we must approve of the general idea.  That is to supply the country with the power that is necessary to run our own industries and to make us independent of foreign sources of power, such as coal, etc.  Everybody on this side understands that, and so far as that objective is concerned, everybody must agree with it, and we do agree with it, but we are doubtful on this point: whether in the circumstances of the moment it was wise to start that big scheme with the possibility of having a greater amount of power than we could use for a number of years, and, therefore, having national capital sunk in a way in which it was not going to be reproductive for a long period, with the results shown here on our balance sheet every year, bearing portion of the debt. sinking fund and interest on that sum, and, therefore, increasing our taxation. While we agree with the general objective of it, we say that it was not done in the way that we would have done it, in any case.  We think that it would have been far more economic to start with the Liffey scheme and work it where you are going to have an immediate demand for the supply, and link it up afterwards.  However, that is a matter upon which people may differ. They may say &ldquo;Very well, the people who are doing it in the other way have the responsibility for it, and we are not going to hamper them in the carrying out of that work.  They have taken a certain step; it cannot be undone, and, therefore, our duty should be to make it a success now that that step has been taken.&rdquo;  That is common sense, and that is the attitude we take towards an enterprise of that kind, the ultimate purpose of which we can see. In other directions, however, we fail to see any systematic following up of that particular purpose.  For instance, if we are going to have the power by which to run our industries, surely we ought to start out with a definite plan to restore our industries.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to stand idly by and <Col N="485" /> to see the flour mills closing down, which we will want if we are going to start any programme of work to supply our own needs.  The Minister for Finance will perhaps say: &ldquo;Some of them should be closed down; they are not run efficiently or economically, and therefore let them go to the wall.&rdquo; That again is the policy of the survival of the fittest.  The policy of the survival of the fittest as applied to the human side of view is not a very wise one to-day.  What does it mean?  It does not mean that those who survive, if we take it on general terms, are the people who should survive.  From the point of view of what is best, these are not the people who survive.  In the case of the material side, the same thing happens. What happens is that those who survive are those who in the environment of the contest are best able to do it.  If we take the ultimate values of a concern and these views as to those who should survive, I say it is the big mills, such as those at the Dublin port, which are established long enough, that would ultimately be able to stand up against competition.  These are not the only mills that we want to survive.  The same applies to the big breweries.  If we carry that on to a logical conclusion. if we are to be self-supporting and get all these things that we want for ourselves, what is going to happen?</P>
    <P>It means the elimination of all sorts of waste.  It means doing things by machinery where human beings would be eliminated as far as possible, and therefore it means ultimately a lot of unemployment unless we are able to compete in the world markets.  Now, what are the chances of our competing at present in the world markets except in the special line of food producing? Is there any hope, with the terrible handicap upon us at the present time, of developing our industries so that we would be able to compete with Germany, America, England and so on in the field of manufacturing enterprise and commerce?  I do not think there is, and what we ought, therefore, at the moment concentrate upon is to get for our own people here the necessities of life and to try to maintain our population. We cannot do that if we persist in following international standards.  I <Col N="486" /> do not talk now of international standards of living.</P>
    <P>If you take international standards you may have a lower standard of living, whereas if you take a more rational standard you may have a higher standard of living.  For instance, there are special patent flours and so on that may be regarded by some as a higher standard of living. But the medical profession and others who have studied the problem scientifically believe that from a food point of view straight-run flour would be better.  It might mean education before we would be able to be content with that straight-run flour.  In the same way there is the question of clothing.  These are the things that can only be tackled if we are tackling them as a whole with a definite determination on the part of the Ministry to work for that objective so that every part of their work should fit in with that scheme.  That is what I say that they lack on the opposite benches. There is no general purpose before them which would appear to be rational and which would enable us year by year to progress.  That is a topic which represents our fundamental attitude. I could talk for a considerable length of time upon it, but I do not want to do anything more at this particular stage in connection with this Bill than to indicate what our objective is and what ought to be the objective of any national Ministry in this country.  That objective should be not to take international values, but to take the conditions of our country and see what we are able to produce, what are the needs of our population, try to supply these needs at home and forget, as far as we can, what are the standards prevalent in countries outside this.  We will, unfortunately, not be able to cut ourselves completely off. I have said time after time that if we want to approach this problem a good way to approach it would be to approach it as if this country were surrounded by a wall.  That is the same sort of thing that a pure mathematician will do if dealing with certain physical problems.  When talking of rigid bodies he knows very well that these rigid bodies do not exist in Nature as he would have them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> In the same way, when speaking of other things, he talks of flexible strings.  He knows that they are not flexible strings.  What happens next? Immediately that the fundamental question, without the embarrassment of the difficult details, is envisaged an engineer comes along and tackles the actual problem.  When I speak of tackling this problem as if the country were surrounded by a wall, what I mean is how we could maintain our population if by any chance we were cut off.  If we tackled that problem and considered it in all its details I am satisfied that we could here, now, in this country, maintain a population two or three times the size of our present population.  I say that because of the fact that we have the food that is necessary here and that we can produce the clothing that is needed.  Why should we be getting boots from outside and giving employment abroad?  The raw material is here.  It can be tanned here.  The wall will not prevent us from getting from outside the ideas that we actually need.  We can get all the ideas, the up-to-date machinery can be got from outside, and we can set out to manufacture here for ourselves; we can manufacture the clothing, shelter and so on that we want.  But the things that we cannot produce here and which it would be quite uneconomic to produce here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Latest fashions! If the wall were around the country you would have to have your own fashions.  Your own latest fashions might be just as good, and the possibility is that they would be much more appropriate to us in the climate and conditions that we have.  I think that you will admit that down in West Cork, if you have materials got from outside and you go along a muddy road, that the materials from outside are not nearly as suitable as those which can be produced in this country.  If we did not get things from outside&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>By all means educate the people into it, but you will not educate the people into it if you hold out the idea that the whole purpose of this country is to supply foodstuffs to the English markets; that our whole salvation and our whole purpose is to produce food for England.  That will not educate the people.  That was the big loss I saw in 1921, when you introduced into the country the spirit of cynicism which we see now in these benches opposite.  It is that cynicism, that callous sort of effort which is withering up everything&mdash;you can see it here in the Dáil.  Sneers follow any attempt to build up in a really constructive way.  When any suggestion in that direction is mentioned you get the withering sarcasm of the people who call themselves realists.  The fact is that they are only narrow materialists and they are not good materialists at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Fundamentally they are only so-called realists.  Any Cabinet in which a mind of that kind dominates cannot do good work.  Good work cannot be done in it.  That mind is withering in its consequences, and it requires a great deal of moral courage on the part of those who have good idealism left in them to stand up against that.  That thing is operating right through the country, and if there is one thing more than another that is hindering the national advance in the last five years it is because the people have become cynical.  They have seen people who had been talking idealism suddenly reversing engines, and they are now not capable of proceeding in a sustained way in what would be regarded as a course of idealism rather than a course of the most material imperialism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>If you had no means here in this country of producing any other form of clothing but Irish kilts then I would say go back to them.  When we were producing what <Col N="489" /> we needed ourselves, good men, men as good as on those benches, lived in Irish kilts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we want to proceed along native lines which will take stock of our own particular conditions, and we will not go blindly, because such and such a thing is done somewhere else.  Even if there are maxims in the books of economists these maxims are sometimes falsehoods, and a lot of these are maxims of economists which were passed about from mouth to mouth as if they were inspired sayings, and were used by the economists and passed for real thinking.  I happened to be going down last night and I met the same sort of attitude and heard the same sort of expression obvious now from Deputy Carey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdmondCarey" hpid="Mr. CAREY Mr. CAREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CAREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not an unfriendly one, surely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>No, neither was the remark I heard unfriendly.  It was &ldquo;taking in our own washing.&rdquo; How often have we seen this thing before? How often have we heard that that was our policy&mdash;&ldquo;taking in our own washing&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>What is the world doing, taking the world as a unit?  What does it exist on?  One section of the community supplying the needs of another section.  It is a sort of a division of labour.  Some one section of the community is supplying the wants of another section.  Do not be using parrot phrases of that kind, using them to damn real efforts to try to get the country out of its present position.  This field is a wide one.  It is one on which we could talk for quite a long period, and probably talk more profitably than on any other subject.  But I do not want to go into detail further than to indicate what our attitude is and what we find lacking in the opposite benches as far as their policy is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to come down to a narrower subject.  Before I pass from what I have been referring to, however, I would like to say that I recognise&mdash;we here recognise, as well as Deputies of other Parties, as well as any of you realists, any of you who come along and <Col N="490" /> sneer at proposals of a general kind that do not happen to fall in with the current fashions&mdash;the difficulties there are in carrying out a programme such as we indicate.  We know it, and we know, too, that an Executive that has every day to attend to things from a needle to an anchor, whose Ministers have to contend with such matters, has not the leisure or the opportunity to work these problems out in detail.  We know that any Executive that tries to put such a programme into operation wants, working with them, a body such as a Development Commission, a body that will work out all the details.</P>
    <P>The question of policy can well be left to the Ministry&mdash;the big question of policy.  They can come along and say: &ldquo;Shall we do this or shall we do that?&rdquo; There are to be considered, no doubt. questions touching on the balance of disadvantage, and questions of expediency will be cropping up.  All these questions are for the Ministry. But let them have assisting them a body of people who will have nothing else to do, people who will be experts and who will thoroughly appreciate the difficulties there are, who will be able to make plans so as to avoid the rocks that undoubtedly there are in a course of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little spoke about the big question of credit.  That is a very difficult and a very complicated question. Talking about idealism and realism, we had an example in the case of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He stated that before he went in there he had certain opinions about banking machinery, and when he went in he changed those opinions very considerably. The banking machinery and the plausibility were too much for him, and he lost much of what he was able to see when he was outside the wood, but now that he is in the trees he is not able to see the wood for the trees.  That is fundamental undoubtedly in questions dealing with an economic programme or a general economic policy such as I have indicated.  It has to be examined pretty closely, and the way I see it is this: We know the part money plays, we know its history and how it has operated, and we know the extent to which, from being an absolute servant, it has become a master in industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> There are times when theories and certain solutions have to be revised. It is found they do not fit in with the facts, and you have an occasion generally for a re-examination of the problem down to the very foundation.  As far as we here in this country are concerned we should examine these things down to the very foundations, cutting ourselves adrift from the theories and fashions that have become current.  If we ask ourselves how are we going to get on, is it not obvious that the things we can produce here we should produce here and the things we cannot produce here we should get from outside? We have, of course, to send some of our material across in order to buy what we get in from outside. We have to send goods in exchange for other goods.  The goods we exchange are naturally the goods we can produce best.  I do agree with the statement made by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  If we confine it simply to goods that we have to export, as far as the goods we have to export are concerned, by all means let these things be the ones we can produce to the best advantage.  The moment we begin to export we are undoubtedly competing in an international market, and we will have to be prepared to meet outside competition. But we can shelter ourselves in the things we produce at home from that form of competition, and the only way it would enter is indirectly on account of the standard we set up by the goods that we export.  As long as we can produce to suit our own people and produce a surplus of the things we are best able to produce in order to buy the other things that we want from outside, we are in a good sound economic position, and we ought to be able to maintain our population.</P>
    <P>Now, as to economies.  I would not be too anxious about economies in this sense if I saw the Executive on a general course, the objective of which I could see.  But I see them letting things go on; I see them hanging on, following a system which they have inherited from outside.  The more you work that system, the more you have <Col N="492" /> to work within it.  If they are going to maintain that, they will have to cut down their expenditure in order to make it possible for the community to carry on at all.  Probably the big difference that the Labour Party has with us would be that the ultimate results of our policy will tend to cut down social services.  If they look ahead they will see that that is what we are hitting for.  The time will come when, if we are to ask the Minister for Finance to do something to establish a certain social service that may be necessary, we will be met here with the reply: &ldquo;Look at our Budget. Can we afford to tax our people more? Can our industries stand it?&rdquo;  And we will come to a stage when there will be a standstill, and that stage is being rapidly brought about by the fact that the producing sections of our people are relatively smaller here than in any other country.  They are being depleted mainly through emigration. They are narrowing down. Young people are coming along.  Only a proportion of the population is much greater than it should be for a stable community.</P>
    <P>The central body is coming round, and while, so to speak, all the time the proportion is maintained, absolutely they are diminishing.  The proportion between the young and the old and the intermediate producing section is decreasing.  Though the whole country is actually going down in all classes, if you take the proportions it is bound to be diminished, and, therefore, a time will come when any hopes of the Labour Party&mdash;and I share their hopes and desires as far as having the most adequate possible social services are concerned&mdash;that they are going to have social services possible in the future will not be realised unless under changed conditions.  They must realise that we cannot do it under the system which we are now adopting.</P>
    <P>This deficit which we are facing this year is going to mean a further contraction. What happens?  When the Minister for Finance wants to get £200,000, where does he go for it?  He goes to the sugar tax, because if you were to go elsewhere you would have to establish more efficiency and you would not get the tax as easily.  If he <Col N="493" /> wants to cut off something, it will be cut off the old age pensions.  Why? Because it gives a fairly big return. You will find in all these cases wherever there is a question of deficits of any kind, these social services will suffer.  If the members of the Labour Party look ahead and ask themselves where they are going, they will agree with us that the time has come when we ought to try to force a different attitude from the Ministry.</P>
    <P>I tried to express my own view by saying that we cannot have it both ways.  We cannot have the furniture that we might have in a lord's mansion. If we want our liberty, and to get away from the kicks in the lord's mansion, we will have to be content with the plain furniture that we have in a cottage. I have no hesitation in saying&mdash; and very few on these benches, and on the opposite benches for that matter, if the Deputies there have not completely lost any views they had in the past&mdash;that we are prepared to face the alternative and take the plain furniture of the cottage.  To my mind, you can do that, and the standard of living really need not come down.  I am not referring to the international standard set up outside, but to the standard of real living, living so as to have the most perfect human lives it is possible for us to have.</P>
    <P>The matter of salaries is there.  What part does the question of salaries play in that whole scheme?  We have been talking, for instance, about the Governor-General's salary.  There is nobody on the opposite benches who knows better than we do that £20,000 will not save the nation, that it will not be the economic salvation of this country.  We know that.  But we are against the spending of that £20,000 because we believe that there ought not to be a penny more than absolutely necessary spent on any administration that is not reproductive.  That is our objection. We are told because of the policy of having accepted the Treaty that we are to accept this.  We say that they are maintaining a standard which is not necessary by the Treaty.</P>
    <P>We believe that from £10,000 to £15,000 can quite easily be saved on that establishment.  Do we want it at all?  We say we do not.  We think that <Col N="494" /> it is ridiculous that this small country should be spending so much on two figureheads, taking them in any sense, apart altogether from any implications about our international relations and think of it from our own point of view. There are two figureheads, one in the North of the country and one in the South.  Between them they have a personal salary of £18,000, £3,000 more than the President of the United States gets.  The United States have about 117,000,000 of the richest people in the world.  Their head is not a figurehead. He is an active President and does his work as actively as an active Prime Minister would do it, and he is only getting from that huge population £15,000.  Look at this country, with less than 4¼ millions of people, where we are paying two figureheads the sum of £18,000.  I say it is wrong.  It does not induce the ordinary taxpayer to pay taxes.  I put this to the Labour Party. They will admit, if they want social services carried out, it will depend on the willingness of the average taxpayer to pay his taxes to the State. Do they think it is going to make for willingness in that respect for them to see £3,000 more than is paid to the President of the United States paid to figureheads?  I say it does not. If I were an extensive taxpayer I would say: &ldquo;If you want social services and want me to contribute to them and I am prepared to do it, you are not going to waste my money on these affairs.  Do without the social services of carrying on an expensive concern and give me value, or cut these down and let me feel, at any rate, that every penny I give is being used for the general advantage of the community.&rdquo; We say the same about the Ministers' salaries.  We are told here that they are worth their money.  To my mind, what you are worth depends altogether on what your effectiveness to the community is and what is being done in the general interests of the community.  That is not the standard we ought to take.</P>
    <P>I take it that we are here from the point of view of public duty and not from the point of view of earning our living.  If we are here from that point of view pure and simple it is not the ideal that most of <Col N="495" /> us on these benches anyhow stand for.  We have stood for the payment of Deputies.  Why?  Because we realise that if men are to devote themselves to this particular work they ought to be relieved from what would be their other work, and of the necessity of earning their living during the hours that they are employed here.  We know that Labour members could not act if there were not payment of Deputies, and we know ultimately that the representation of the people would be with the richer classes.  Therefore we say that a sum should be given which would enable them to devote themselves to the public interest, but we say as that is the case the numbers ought to be the smallest that would be effective. Why should we have 150 who have got to be paid if 100 could do the work?  To my mind, 100 would do, and when we see the Minister for Local Government coming along and suggesting that a deliberative body in Cork should be cut down to 15 and no excuse given for it, when there is no payment there, we ask ourselves whether they would not apply to themselves in this House the things that they apply to others.  Would we not be better off? In my point of view a smaller number would do the nation's work.  100 would do it as well as 150.  Instead of having a large number here we are often addressing our talk to empty benches.  Someone else will, perhaps, come in in half an hour afterwards and repeat the same thing, because he was not here when the previous speaker had spoken.  We are expecting decisions on matters from people who are out in the Lobby when they are being discussed here.</P>
    <P>All that sort of thing is waste to my mind.  It is on that question I am talking, and trying to illustrate it.  I asked our representatives on the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to get an hour off here for tea.  Why?  Because I considered that it was an excuse getting out of the House at tea time for people to neglect their work.  I say the representatives of the people have to be paid.  We know Ministers have to be paid.  The question then is: what is the sum on which they can devote themselves to the public work and do <Col N="496" /> it reasonably?  We have come to the conclusion, and feel we have good grounds for it that a Minister here could do the work, if animated with a proper public spirit, that is required from him, with £1,000 a year.  Money is not a reward.  I hope any public servant is worth more to the country than what he gets in actual cash.  He ought not to enter the public service if he expects that his only reward is the cash value.  We were asked about civil servants and engineers, and what our views on these were.  My idea of the salaries is that we ought to cut out ruthlessly at the top everything that we look upon as waste.  We will have to do it here.  The allowances given to Ministers and Deputies ought to be clearly understood to be allowances to enable them to devote themselves to the public service without the distractions that they would have otherwise. We do know that they have to live.  We recognise that.  We believe the present standard afforded by the taxpayer should not be more than £1,000.</P>
    <P>They tell us we will not get a good man.  I deny it.  I do not think the best public service is going to be got by the attractions of salaries.  We are told we must have a high standard of pay to attract young men into the service. I do not believe it.  It is my view that there is something innate in us in this country to look for an occupation sheltered from the noise, so to speak.  We find the same thing in America.  A large number of our people there, instead of going into business, go into public offices and become public servants. I was talking in Boston to an observant and able Irishman of American birth, not long ago, and he gave me examples and pointed out how the Irish people over there had lost on account of the fact that they were content to go into offices and take more or less minor employment because of what appeared to be their lack of enterprise in facing the difficulties and dangers of business.  Now, that is strongly here. There have been no openings in the past for our young people, with the result that the professions and Civil Service were the only openings for all the young people.  I do not think we ought to offer any unnecessary attractions in that particular direction.  I <Col N="497" /> think we ought, as far as possible, try to provide, if we are working to build industries, that we will have people getting into the industries and managing them, and our objective, so far as we look on it from a material point of view, ought to have that as its main purpose.</P>
    <P>With the salaries then, if we start at the top, we should recognise that people can live on £1,000 and can comfortably educate their families on £1,000.  We have seen it done, and know it is done.  We say this: the top hats may have to be cut off and done without.  Very well.  We will be none the less respectable, if that is our purpose, by doing without the silk hats. We can do without them, and we are not going to suffer rationally for doing without them.  It will be a good example for the general run of the country.  As to the intermediate salaries, there is a point under which a person cannot live.  These are the salaries I want brought up to the mark. In Donegal, I think it was, one of the Labour Deputies talked of a man getting 26/- a week.  We have one man with nothing to do getting £10,000 a year, and another man is not able to get 26/- a week.  It is absolutely wrong, and, as far as we are concerned, we do not stand for it.  We believe there ought to be available for every single man in the country employment which will bring him in enough recompense to enable him to maintain his family, and the whole organisation of the State ought to be to that end.</P>
    <P>When a young man takes up a career in the Civil Service, what does he want? He wants to get the amount that is necessary to maintain himself independent of his parents.  That sum can be estimated, and a scale can be fixed for him.  He wants, if he gets married, to be in a position to maintain a family, and he wants, when he comes to an age between 30 and 40 years, to be in the position in which he can have his children educated.  These scales under our own conditions can be determined, and I think if we are going to work matters out at all reasonably we ought to sit down and get these scales and not inherit any scales from abroad and have them calculated and worked out.  I forget which Deputy spoke about a <Col N="498" /> married man getting a larger salary than a single man.  He said that in some cases a single man might have dependents. These things, in the long run, will work themselves out.  You cannot possibly arrange for all these cases.  If we are to work out a scheme, we ought to work it out so that the young man, coming into the Civil Service, will be able to get a salary that will enable him to maintain himself independent of his parents, and that a married man will get a salary that will enable him to maintain a family and that he will be able to feel that sufficient provision is made for him in his old age, so that he will not be dependent upon anybody. I hope what I have said will make clear what our attitude on salaries anyhow is, and what our economic purposes are.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this Bill, not merely because we think it is wrong to bring in a second Vote on Account in this particular way, but we are against it because we are dissatisfied with the general policy of the Executive.  We are dissatisfied with their letting things slide.  They could have saved twenty or thirty thousand pounds if the principle which they are applying to Cork was applied to the Seanad.  What is the meaning of having 60 Senators here? We see ourselves faced with the necessity of imposing next year a further burden on industry, or doing what is worse from our point of view, cutting off the social services.  They will not economise, and they will not set up a Committee that will be representative of all parties that would go properly into all these things and deal with them on broad lines.  They will not even set it up from the point of view of the general industrial rehabilitation of the country&mdash;a body of people to carry out the policy after telling us definitely what it is.  We are opposing this Bill, but in any honest effort that will be made by the members on the opposite side&mdash;no matter how we may differ with them fundamentally in certain things&mdash; to try to put this country in a condition in which we hope to be able to retain the best of our people, they will get our help.  If they do, at any time, bring forward a measure of that kind, we will do our best, as far as we are concerned, to try to make the <Col N="499" /> best of it.  We have tried to do it in any of the economic measures that have been brought before us&mdash;on the Creamery Bill, for instance.  There is a certain amount of unpopularity attaching to certain things, but we took our share and tried to do our share.  We will continue to do that provided there will be root interests. We will work for the country as a whole, and deal with its problems on the understanding of what is the capacity of this country to meet the expenditure that is required.</P>

      <P>I think Deputies who have listened to Deputy de Valera will agree that the general policy which he outlined has not been worked out in any detail, or does not appear to have been worked out in any detail by him or his Party, because when he came down to particular instances the only instances he had were instances that would be quite as useful and as likely to be used if he had no policy at all, the sort of instance that one could use to appeal particularly to those sections of the electors who know least about the difficulties of carrying on government and of getting a suitable and efficient personnel.  I do not want to deal particularly with those points of detail which he has raised and that have been raised many a time already.  There is no use in hoping that you are going to get your public services filled by people in ordinary times who are making a conscious personal sacrifice to do it. You are not going to get your Ministries filled by any people possessing capital or anything of that sort who would suffer substantial losses by becoming Ministers.  Every person is perfectly aware that unless one has become used to it for a considerable time, the personal attacks, the violent criticism and all that sort of thing that a Minister has necessarily to endure are the things that would constitute for the person who had to make say a financial sacrifice something in the nature of an additional one.  You could easily, by cutting say ministerial salaries, injure the country and the public service very severely.  You could very seriously restrict the choice of people who would be available for <Col N="500" /> ministerial offices.  I think it has been stated in the Dáil that we already have had experience of people refusing, on two or three occasions, to enter the Ministry because they could not face the loss, either immediate or prospective, which it would involve.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is so.  Your government should be run by fairly normal people, and I think there is nothing that could be more dangerous than to have people who, say, had a fanatical devotion to some idea and were prepared to throw over their own concerns, regardless of their own interests, their families' interests and all the normal considerations that influence people, in order to pursue that fanatical idea.  It may be all right for people to do so in times of great national crisis, but your arrangements should be for the ordinary working of your machine, and you should expect on the whole that it would be worked by normal and typical people.  I have already said on many occasions all that I would wish to say about the Civil Service, but Deputy de Valera makes it more difficult for me to take his general argument seriously when I find him only coming down to instances that are the kind of thing that would be effective on an electioneering platform, the things that would make a certain appeal, and that would make their greatest appeal to the people who have least thought about the problems of government, people whose own experience was limited practically to their own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy on the opposite side seemed to indicate that Ministers advocated divergent policies.  The fact is that different Ministers, in charge of different Departments, necessarily look at problems from different angles. But it is wrong for Deputies on the opposite side to conclude that, because different Ministers lay emphasis on different aspects of problems and policies, they are not agreed on the general policy of the Government.  It has been said that there is no general policy.  Deputy de Valera has indicated in general terms a certain policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, and it seems <Col N="501" /> to me that his argument amounts to this, that because the Government's policy is not identical with his, the Government has no policy.  I do not want to misrepresent him or to seize in a debating way on any particular point, but his policy&mdash;and it is a policy which he expresses as subject to modifications&mdash;is the policy of the stone wall, or, to put it in another way, the policy of aiming at making the country absolutely self-contained, subject to the inevitable necessity of bringing in certain goods.  It is a policy of making great sacrifices for the mere purpose of being self-contained.  I think that is his policy.  He has suggested that, so far as the Government may have a policy, it is simply one of growing food for England.  We do not accept Deputy de Valera's policy of striving too much at making the country self-contained and self-sufficing.  We recognise that you cannot ignore standards outside.  You may talk about standards for the country, but you have got to remember that there is the case of the individual, and it seems to me that while we may have different standards in a sense, different practices and different habits, taking things generally it is not right for us to accept any policy that we think would involve a lower standard than people outside have, or that would deny to our people things that all other people over the world have.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Deputy's policy will cure that evil at all.  I think it was a mere question of maintaining a large population here.  I do not say that the Deputy wants that, but he has talked about the necessity for trying to have the population increased.  We also believe that the population ought to be increased, but we believe that it ought to be increased without lowering the general standard of living, such as it is, that it ought to be increased with an improvement in the standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> If we were aiming merely at an increase in the population and had no regard to the standard of living, I think that the way in which that could almost certainly be brought about would be by stopping expenditure on education, and a few services like that &mdash;particularly education&mdash;and perhaps using the money that we would save in that way to relieve people on the land from certain direct taxation.  The lack of education would tend to close the doors to emigration, and the absence of direct taxation would make some sort of existence on the land possible to greater numbers.  But nobody would contemplate that we should simply try to get a population by degrading the general level, and in those portions of the country where there is some comfort, bringing the level down to that of the barest existence.</P>
    <P>When I said that the land could support no more people, I naturally did not mean that the land could support no more people if we had no regard to the standard of living.  I did not even mean that the land could support no more people if we had the lowest standard everywhere amongst the agricultural population.  Obviously there are places where the standard is a little higher than other places.  If you lowered that to the lowest level you could increase the agricultural population.  What I meant&mdash;and I think it was clear from the context&mdash;when I said that the land could support no more people was, having in mind the need for some reasonable standard of living, that no more people could be supported by the industry of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with wheat-growing. Deputy Flinn asked what was the need for all this expenditure on agriculture, what was the need for the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, if we believed that no more people could be supported on the land.  The need for it is to make agriculture more remunerative, to improve the standard of living of those who are employed in agriculture, and <Col N="503" /> that, it seems to me, must go along with any attempt at industrial improvement. One of the reasons why I am very anxious to go slow and to go carefully in the matter of tariffs is because agriculture is in such a depressed condition. If agriculturalists generally were fairly prosperous, then I would say that, for the sake of the community as a whole, for the sake of the future of the country, in order more speedily to obtain means of employment for the young people of the country who cannot now live in it, sacrifices should be demanded of them.  I believe, and I think that it really cannot be seriously disputed, that any policy of promoting industry by tariffs or in any other way&mdash;but I take tariffs for the moment&mdash;in the first instance would result in an additional burden being thrown on existing producers. I have admitted in this House that in certain cases tariffs have been imposed and, owing to peculiar circumstances, that there was no increase in cost of the articles supplied, or that it was only an increase for a very short time, and that consequently we did get an increase in production and a new industry without any burden falling on the general community.  But there were other instances where a burden has fallen on the general community.  The result of any general policy of tariffs, or the result of any extension of the policy of tariffs, must be that, for a time, and in certain instances permanently, an additional burden will be thrown on the existing producers.  Deputy Moore asked why so-and-so was imported.  We could go about keeping all these things out, and we could do that speedily, but the result would be that an additional burden would fall on existing producers, and in the main that burden would fall on the agriculturalists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop my point.  There is a very great difficulty in protecting agriculture in this country. Perhaps it is because of the vicious circle again, largely because there is such a small urban population in the country.  But the burden of rapidly increased manufacturing industry must fall on the agriculturalists.  It is all <Col N="504" /> very well to say that the agriculturalist himself would get benefit from that. Undoubtedly he would.  Any increase in industrial production would help the agriculturalist.  It is a thing that would reduce railway freights, increase the population, and is one of the things that might relieve the general taxpayer from having to pay £400,000 a year towards the upkeep of the Post Office.  Ultimately great benefits would follow to agriculturalists from an increase in manufacturing industry.  Ultimately, if there was a sufficient increase in manufacturing industry, it might make it possible, or easier, to help the agriculturalist himself by protection.  But the difficulty is that immediately the burden is thrown on agriculture&mdash;this is a matter that might be the subject of a separate debate&mdash;and it does seem to me that any sharp increase in the cost of living, any sharp increase in the agriculturalists' burden, while it would give some more population in the towns, might drive people out of employment on the land much more rapidly, and the whole country would lose rather than benefit.  It is for these reasons that we have hesitated to plunge into a policy, regardless of the cost, of aiming at increasing the amount of manufacturing industry.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister allow me to ask him one question?  I do not want to interrupt, because I think we are all interested in the efforts he is making to deal with this matter.  He said that in certain industries with a tariff there had been an increase in cost due to tariffs, and that in certain industries there had not been an increase. He is speaking as a result of experience. Would the Minister tell the House in what industries there have been increases in the cost to the consumer from tariffs, and in what industries there have not been increases in cost to the consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take an instance. Take cigarettes.  For a short time there was a good deal of revenue collected on the importation of cigarettes, and that went into the Exchequer. At present, as far as I know &mdash;I am not very familiar with the cigarette question&mdash;leaving out certain differences that might be due to tobacco <Col N="505" /> duties, there has been an increase in the cigarette industry without any increase in cost to the general community.  On the other side, take boots.  The cost of boots is higher than it would be here if there was no tariff.  So far as boots imported are concerned, there is no burden on the community, because the revenue goes into the Exchequer, and some other tax has been remitted. Deputy de Valera may smile at this, but if he examines it he will find that I am perfectly right.  So far as boots made in the country are concerned, the people who buy them have to pay more. I do not know what is the exact amount, but they pay more than they would have to pay for boots if there was no tariff.  That additional money goes to the manufacturer to keep the industry going, and it is a contribution levied off the general taxpayers in the interests of that industry.  When we put on the boot tariff we estimated that we would get £250,000 yearly, and we remitted a certain duty on tea, which also gave us about £250,000 per annum. If this boot industry developed to a certain point, when it could just supply or almost supply the home demand, and that you had keen competition amongst the boot manufacturers here, that would drive prices down to, shall we say, the English level, then the position would be that the home demand would be practically supplied.  It would undoubtedly be supplied at a price that was just sufficient to prevent competing boots coming in over the tariff.  It would mean that therefore no revenue would come into the Exchequer, and that the population buying boots would pay roughly £250,000 yearly more than they would pay if there was no tariff. Consequently it would mean, when you had reached that point, and until you had gone beyond that point, that the general population was paying a contribution of £250,000 yearly for maintaining the boot industry in this country.  Deputies can work it out.</P>

      <P>The general policy is that the manufacturer, whether he gets the whole amount of the tariff or not, will always, until you reach the point where internal competition drives him down, get pretty near it.  There may be exceptions to that just as there are exceptions to many other things, but there is no use talking about tariffs without recognising things like that, and that in general, as a matter of fact, sometimes the manufacturer needs a tariff because he has to labour under disadvantages. He might be getting fifteen per cent. extra for his boots, and not make a single penny, and he may be giving his whole time and energy to building up the industry.  I am not accusing the manufacturers of profiteering, but, if a tariff is needed, one of the reasons why it is needed, especially in a new industry, is that only a tariff would enable it to overcome the disadvantages. Labour may not be so skilled, or it may be difficult to get it. You may have transport difficulties, or selling difficulties may be greater.  But whatever the reason the public is going to pay, in general, something near the amount of the tariff.  I would assert to members of the House, without any fear, that the general proposition is that, and that is one of the reasons why we must be careful about going too rapidly.</P>

      <P>Deputies must allow me to continue.  There is another reason against trying to go excessively rapidly with this matter, and that is that if you give a very high rate of protection you are liable to have your industries hastily organised, and ill-organised factories set up on uneconomic sites.  Generally, you would have a number of industries started on such a basis&mdash;industries that could never be economic apart from the tariff.  During the European War there were many industries set up which collapsed afterwards.  There were even some industries set up which the Government took a hand in saving, and which it would have been wiser to let die out, because they were ill-situated, ill-laid down, and generally were such that they could never be as economic as they might have been.  A tariff that would enable anybody to start to manufacture a particular article simply means that people are going to come in when they see a sure prospect of a profit.  Factories would be started in workhouses, and buildings of that sort, which may be ready to hand but which are utterly unsuitable and, perhaps, ill-situated.  Machinery of a wrong sort is going to be got in, and the whole industry is going to be built up by a slipshod method, with the result that for a very long time the people are going to be paying more than they ought to be asked to pay for a particular article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difference that I see between the policy outlined by Deputy de Valera and the policy of <Col N="508" /> the Government is this: that Deputy de Valera wants to have everything produced in the country that could be produced in it.  He wants to set out to cut off imports, so far as imports car possibly be cut out, and he looks upon the stone wall as the ideal, the impossible ideal, and the thing that we are to come as near as possible to achieving. We look upon the thing in a different way.  We see that, for strength and development&mdash;every kind of development, cultural and otherwise&mdash;the population of the country should be increased.  We see that the population cannot be increased merely by getting increased agricultural efficiency.  We see, therefore, that industry must be built up.  We believe, however, that in the beginning, industry can only be built up by throwing an additional burthen on agriculture.  We are trying to increase the prosperity of agriculture. We are going slowly with our tariff policies because we believe that at the present stage there are other policies as well as tariff policies, such, for instance, as industrial policy.  Because we believe that at the present time agriculture cannot bear an increased burthen our aim in industry is not to produce everything that the country might produce, and not to try to get as near the stone wall policy as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Simply to build up industries for which the country is not suitable does not provide a means of supporting an additional population so as to give variety to the economic life of the country, variety in employment and variety of outlook, and get the conditions of industrial development.  We are aiming, so far as possible, to have industry conducted on an efficient basis, and if there are any things that could get a world market, then we would prefer those things to some other things, because we can do these things at less cost to the people.  I believe if we were to attempt the stone-wall policy it would simply mean throwing back the wheels of progress to a certain extent.  It would mean depriving the people of the country of things that they will want, the things that the peoples of other countries have, and it is not going in the long run to be a <Col N="509" /> lasting policy.  You cannot in the modern world, with modern means of travel and communication, set up some sort of peculiar people here.  We must take it that the people of this country will march in step with the peoples of the rest of the world, and any attempt to have entirely different standards here will not, I think, be successful. Someone, I think, talked about the revival of the kilt.  In my opinion, some of the things that it has been suggested that we might do would be just as preposterous as reviving the kilt.  There are things that you simply cannot do, and you will not, I think, induce the people to make such a futile attempt. It is quite a different thing to try to have, for instance, distinctive habits of living and, to some extent, distinctive habits as regards dress, cookery and food.  Most countries have those peculiarities, and by means of those special ways we can avoid some economic evils at the present time.</P>
    <P>There were many other matters mentioned that I have no opportunity of dealing with now.  We cannot come to the Dáil and announce half-baked policies that we have not thought out. But we have not had to wait for the Deputy's suggestion to begin thinking out.  On a great many lines, we have done things before they came here, and we will not be deterred by their presence from doing many other things. We have many things in preparation. As regards insurance, some Deputy pointed out that the position in regard to it was not satisfactory.  We recognise that, and have had committees sitting on that question.  An investigation of that has been going on for the past three years.  One of the reasons why we waited until some months ago to introduce the Mutual Insurance Bill was because we hoped that we might soon have a more comprehensive scheme. We cannot come down and lay our difficulties before the Dáil.  The Dáil would really not be able to help us in our difficulties.  The Dáil might criticise our scheme, but as regards hammering out the scheme we must do that ourselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish asked about housing, and I indicated that where any costs have been incurred a subsidy at the old rate will certainly have to be paid. I said there might be cases where, if no costs were incurred, and perhaps no work done before the new Bill comes before this House, in such cases they would have to receive the new rate of subsidy, whatever it might be.  There may be cases where practically all the steps have been taken and where it will mean the loss of a summer, and of a definite and specific scheme being postponed if some definite statement cannot be given to the Department. If the body Deputy Corish represents has a scheme and lays the facts in regard to it before the Minister for Local Government, and if that Department thinks it is a case where in all circumstances the full subsidy should be given, we would undertake to recommend to the Dáil that the provision should be such as to enable the full subsidy to be given.  I have no doubt in relation to work of that sort that the Dáil would agree to that.  In cases of that kind we can meet them. I am not in a position to make a definite statement that would cover every case, but we are not going to take any steps that would cause housing schemes to be held up.  Deputy Corish will be in a position to get definite information from the Department that would enable him to go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Connell, as I consider that it will serve a better purpose than the Bill presented by Deputy de Valera.  No matter what the Government may say, there is a feeling in the country that the Local Appointments Commissioners are not doing things in a straightforward manner.  I have not sufficient information to enable me to accept that view.  I do not believe that there is any kind of corruption, so far as the Commissioners are concerned, but with a case on record, such as was mentioned by Deputy Ryan, which happened in County Wexford, there is certainly reason for people to entertain such a suspicion.  It is no harm to cite that case again.  It was a case of a young <Col N="516" /> man in Wexford who was appointed by the Board of Health in May, 1926. From that time he had attended a thousand eye cases and there has been no complaint of his work, either from the Board of Health or the Local Government Department.  He performed any eye operations that were necessary, and there was no fault found with anything he did.  His qualifications, so far as one can see, are everything that could be desired.  He had been six months in the Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin; two months in an eye hospital in London; and three months in the School of Anatomy in Paris.  The man who was appointed in his place, I understand, has been barely two years qualified.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated here the other night that certain things were taken into consideration by the Commission when they were examining candidates.  One of them was the question of experience, and the other, local knowledge.  I submit that this young man had both.  He is fortified in his experience by reason of the fact that his father has been dispensary doctor in Wexford for practically forty years.  His father comes in contact with the poor every day, and therefore was in a position to advise his son, who held this position for two years, as to what attention was necessary for the different patients under his control.  As I said no objection was made either by the Local Government Department or the Board of Health to his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that the Government were prepared, in a limited way, to accept Deputy O'Connell's amendment to deal with the functions of the Local Appointments Commission in the future, but that they would not agree, under any circumstances, with documents in the possession of the Commissioners being presented to that Committee for perusal.  He stated that the reason for that was that it might damage the reputation of any person who had been before them, and who had not, according to the Commissioners, been qualified for certain positions.  I think that what the Commissioners have done in this case in Wexford has been far more <Col N="517" /> damaging than anything that could be done by the presentation to the Committee of the documents of the Commission. If a man is employed for two years in a certain position and is thrown out at the end of that time, I think it would be only reasonable for anybody to think that his qualifications were not what they should be.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce also stated that there were no cases mentioned other than vague and general suggestions.  I submit that that is a very definite case and that nobody on the Government side has made any attempt to deal with it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce merely played with it, and then turned away from it.  A case of that kind certainly sets people thinking, and gives some justification for the suspicion in their minds.  The President mentioned the other night that it was impossible to obtain a man for the Selection Board other than the man that was Chairman. I do think that he will agree that if an assistant of his&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <P>Not impossible, but that he was the best selection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are entitled to draw that inference from what the President said&mdash;that it was impossible. If the Chairman was the man with whom this particular person who was appointed qualified, people are inclined to think that there is some semblance of corruption.  I do not suggest for a moment that it was corruption.  But, in view of the fact that there is this suspicion going around since the Appointments Commission were set up, the Government should endeavour to get somebody to sit on the Selection Boards who would be above suspicion. I know very well that the President will say that this particular gentleman is above suspicion.  That may be, but the ordinary man in the street does not accept that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, as I said, that the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Connell will serve a better purpose than the Bill, because I have no doubt, whatever, that if the Government were to accept the Bill, <Col N="518" /> and if three names were sent down, the same objection would be raised to the three as to the one, because, as everyone knows, the ambition of the local boards all over the country is to get local men appointed.  There is no use hiding that fact.  We would all like to see the local man appointed, provided he is qualified, and that is what the local boards want.  I do not think if three names were sent down that that position would be reached either.  I would suggest to Deputy de Valera and the Fianna Fáil Party that they should fall in with this amendment. I do not see why the Government should insist that the Bill should be withdrawn or defeated altogether before they agree to amendment. Surely the Government would be in the same position when that Committee meets and deliberates as they are to-day.  I do think that it is rather drastic, and not meeting the situation in the spirit in which it should be met, to insist on the Bill being withdrawn before they accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce dealt with this amendment only in a very vague way.  He has not given any definite indication as to what the intentions of the Government were in accepting the amendment.  I think we are entitled to some clearer statement from the Government as to their intention and as to the spirit in which they will accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>There is a complaint from midwives about the fees that are being charged by the Commission.  I know it is included in the Act that certain fees should be charged, but I am of opinion that some of the fees should be returned to the midwives.  If a midwife has to go up two or three times before the Board in a year she has to pay on each occasion a fee of 7/6 or 10/-.  That is rather too much.  Some effort should be made to relieve them of these fees.  We all know that midwives' salaries are comparatively small and they are not in a position to pay these fees time after time.</P>

I say that in fairness to all concerned.  But, of course, the Republican doctor had qualifications that the Free State doctor had not.  I shudder to think what must have been the fate of the poor during Deputy Daly's period of guardianship; during the time when, as he told us, he was neither dry nor hungry when appointing good, bad or indifferent doctors.</P>

      <P>I suppose they were the best.  At any rate the Deputy was neither dry nor hungry during that time.  That is his own statement.  But I shudder to think what must have been the fate of the poor in that area, though Deputy Daly himself does not seem to have suffered from any ill effects at the hands of those doctors, and I am glad to know that.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if a definite case was put to him what would he say&mdash;if the other candidates who went before the Local Appointments Commission are prepared to come out into the open and lay their cards on the table in order to have the qualifications of all parties examined by an independent Board.  I believe that in the definite case I have in mind it could be definitely proved that there was unfair treatment.  That was the case of the appointment of a dispensary doctor in Kerry.  There were three candidates for the position.  One was a doctor with the highest degrees, with seven years' local experience.  The candidate who got the position had no local experience.  He was an Army doctor. He had Army practice, but had no outside experience.  He got the position. From the certificate it was found out that he served for two years in a special department at the Curragh Hospital. We, however, had definite information that six months of the two years were spent in Cork.  We had further information that he spent three months in the Curragh Hospital.  The Chairman of the Selection Board, who was his O.C., should have known that he did not <Col N="520" /> spend two years there.  That was a special case, and it is one that should be inquired into.  It can be proved that one individual got the position because he was an Army doctor and because his O.C. was Chairman of the Selection Board.</P>

      <P>Ballylongford Dispensary District, County Kerry.  When we are asked to look on the Appointments Commission as being absolutely fair we have to judge it by our own experience. We have been told by Ministers on the Front Bench that preferential treatment, even for the breaking of stones on the roads, is given to ex-National Army men.  We are told that in the Post Office the same preference is given. Now, when we see these two cases to which I have referred, what is to prevent the suspicion that the same preferential treatment is being given by the Commission?  We can only judge it by what we see.  When two individuals look for a job on the roads, one an ex-National Army man and the other a man who was not in the Army, and when we see a definite order from the Minister for Local Government that preference must be given to the ex-National Army man, what are we to think?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am showing why we have our suspicions of the Commissioners. They can only fall in line with the Executive Council who have decided that preferential treatment must be given to individuals of one definite army.  We naturally expect that the same system is carried out by the Appointments Commissioners.  Deputy Jasper Wolfe referred to a case of a rate collector which I mentioned, but when I denied that, Deputy Wolfe had not the decency to withdraw his statement. It is, I believe, the common practice here that when a Deputy makes a statement and when it is definitely denied the Deputy who makes it withdraws. If Deputy Wolfe wants any <Col N="521" /> proof of my denial he can get it from the Minister for Local Government. We must not, of course, judge Deputy Wolfe by the ordinary standards by which we judge other Deputies.  I have judged him long ago.  As I say, when we see this position of affairs we can only judge the Appointments Commissioners by what we see happening.  It is the definite settled policy of the Government, which has appointed the Appointments Commissioners, that preferential treatment must be given to one special class in the country.</P>
      <P>I believe that the old policy was not a very good one but it was far preferable to the present policy.  If there was corruption on the old boards, if a man was appointed who should not have been appointed, the appointment had to be sanctioned by the Local Government Department and there was always, at least, pluck enough left in public boards to have the matter put fully before the Minister before he gave his decision.  We had, at least, the matter exposed.  It was brought out into the light of day and the dread of having such matters exposed was, in most cases, sufficient to prevent jobbery and corruption. I maintain that the old system by which local bodies elected their own doctors and other officers was far preferable to the present system.  During the four years which I have been on public boards in Cork I can, at least, say that we put in certain clauses about competitive examinations and we found that that system worked very successfully. I consider that this plan of having three men, whom nobody knows, making these appointments creates suspicion throughout the country.  There is a great outcry against it, and, so long as we have the definite settled policy of the Executive Council whereby preference is given to one particular class, we cannot expect to have anything else.</P>

      <P>Whether one agrees with the details of the measure put forward, some time ago now, by the leader of the Opposition, I think we must all admit that the fact of his bringing it forward has led to good results. We have an amendment on the Order Paper from Deputy O'Connell, which, so far as I can gather, has in substance been accepted by the Government. I am not going at this late stage to flog a dead horse, but, in fact, I do not think that it is a question of flogging, as I think that the Bill, as introduced by Deputy de Valera, is practically dead.  It is dead, because the Fianna Fáil Party, as announced by their leader, seems to be willing to accept Deputy O'Connell's amendment, and the Government also are willing to come a long way in that direction.  In fact, if we were to continue discussing this Bill much longer we might all be in agreement on it, and on the course to be adopted in regard to it.  What I would like to hear from the Government, if any Minister intends to speak again, is the nature of the Committee, and, if possible, the terms of reference to that Committee which they have suggested should be set up.  I do not know whether it is to be a Committee of this House or not.  Would it not be possible for the Government to table an amendment on the lines of that which we have before us to this Bill, giving us the terms of reference to the Committee and indicating the nature of such Committee?  Before we are asked to vote upon this Bill, or upon the amendment, I think either we should have the alternative proposed by the Government in black and white before us, or we should have some definite undertaking concerning the lines along which they intend to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire, in company with other Deputies, some independent Deputies, and, I think, one, at least, a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;I refer to Deputy Bennett&mdash;to protest against the more or less general onslaught that has been made upon the integrity of Irish public boards.  I remember very well, when in my place in <Col N="523" /> the British House of Commons, hearing the constant taunt from the Tory Benches that we were not fit for national self-government, neither were we fit for administering local government. Our answer to that on many occasions was to produce examples of corruption and bribery that occurred constantly elsewhere throughout England, Scotland and Wales.  I do not say that our public representatives in the past have been perfect; neither have they been perfect elsewhere, but I do say that they do not deserve that a general stigma should be cast upon them by way of condemnation for the manner in which they have carried out the duties that were suddenly thrown upon them by the Local Government Act of 1898.  The Local Government Act of 1898 was as bitterly opposed by those who sought to decry the name of this country as was any previous or subsequent measure of Home Rule, and entirely upon the same grounds, but I do think it ill befits us, as Irish national representatives, to cast an undue slur upon the work that has been done during those years by the people elected by the public to serve upon these public boards.</P>
    <P>As regards the action of the Commissioners themselves, like Deputy Corish I do not for a moment doubt their integrity, or even the means at their disposal to make the best appointment they consider fit, but at the same time there is no use blinking the fact that there is abroad a considerable amount of distrust of the appointments that have been made, and the manner in which these appointments have been made.  There is no use in endeavouring to get away from that suspicion, because there it is, and therefore I welcome the suggestion put forward by the Government that they are willing to set up some form of investigation into the working of this Act.  I think it would be well if, instead of being called upon definitely to reject this Bill, not knowing what is to take place subsequently, the Government would now, at the close of the debate, give us something more tangible, something more definite, to go upon as to what form of committee they intend to set up and what its terms of reference would <Col N="524" /> be.  I believe there is a necessity for some form of investigation.  I believe that it will serve a useful purpose, and I hope that that will be the result of the measure introduced by Deputy de Valera.</P>

      <P>I have already spoken in this debate, but I want to clear up a certain amount of confusion which has arisen in connection with Deputy Corish's speech.  He stated that one of the candidates for a position in Wexford was an assistant to, or was in some way connected with, the Chairman of the Commission.  Now, there is the Chairman of the Appointments Commission and there is a Chairman, I take it, of the Selection Board.  It is a mistake for us to mix up these two persons.  The President was to answer certain questions of mine, and I would like also to have information as to whether the Chairman of the Appointments Commission is present at all during the work of the Selection Board, or whether any member of the Appointments Commission is present, and whether they take any part in the deliberations.  I think that would clear up a good deal of the confusion that exists in the minds of certain people. At all events, I want to correct Deputy Corish's statement in regard to the Chairman of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chairman of the Appointments Commission was not present at the Selection Board, nor has he anything to do with the Selection Board.  In reply to Deputy Sir James Craig's remarks, I may say that the function of Selection Boards is to advise the Commissioners upon the relative technical or professional qualifications of the applicants.  The Commissioners must, in the last instance, take the responsibility for the recommendations made by them, and they must, even in these matters, reserve the right to satisfy themselves that no injustice has been done inadvertently or otherwise. But I may say that it is the Commissioners' invariable practice to adopt the report of the Selection Board if they are satisfied that no error or miscarriage of justice has taken place. <Col N="525" /> In the course of the operations of the Act no case has yet occurred where the Commissioners have not adopted the Board's reports on the relative professional merits of candidates.  The order of merit in which candidates are placed by a Selection Board may be disturbed by three considerations, namely, a preference for knowledge of the Irish language, a preference, of a very small degree, given for local knowledge or experience when candidates are almost of equal merit, and by the disqualification of the No. 1 candidate on grounds of age, health or character.  These are the only cases in which the candidate placed No. 1 on a report adopted by the Commissioners is not automatically recommended for appointment.</P>

      <P>My object in putting down this amendment was to endeavour to arrive at a position where, as I stated in my opening speech, a Committee of this kind would have the unanimous approval of all Parties.  In putting down the amendment we aimed at that.  I think, in principle, there is practically no difference between the attitude adopted by the Government and that of Fianna Fáil, because they agreed there should be a Commission.  Deputy Corry voiced a sentiment which is abroad when he said that the idea of three unknown men making appointments creates a lot of suspicion in the country.  I believe that is true, but Deputy de Valera's Bill accepts the principle that is in the present Act and nobody suggested that we should get away from it.  The way to remove that suspicion, in my opinion, is to have a scheme which will have the approval of all Parties and which all Parties in the country will defend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> If that is done, the suspicion will be removed, and that was the object I had in putting down the amendment to reach a position of that kind.  There were two points made by the spokesman from the front Government benches with regard to my amendment. The amendment was framed in the usual form of words: &ldquo;power to send for persons, papers and records.&rdquo;  It is said that this will mean that confidential papers must be disclosed.  It was certainly not my intention that confidential papers should be disclosed. But will the Minister say, or will be indicate the form of words that would secure the attendance of persons and would secure the production of papers which were intended to be confidential and records which were intended to be confidential?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy leaves out &ldquo;empowered to send for persons, papers and records&rdquo; it would make the position different. If it should transpire that the Committee is dissatisfied with what it can get, they can report back to us and we can consider it.  If those things are in, any limitation of them will probably be found to be imperfect. It does not look well to put in any limitation there.  The inquiry can go on and if it is found they have not sufficient power or that they are not getting what they want then they can report.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that once they are there that will arise.  Document A is asked for; then Document B is asked for, and both are confidential.

      <P>The amendment aims at power to examine certain types of documents and records which would not be regarded as of a confidential nature, disclosing matters of confidence in regard to which promises of confidence were given.  I do not want the Government to break any seal of confidence given on these matters, nor do I want the Committee to do so, but I am quite sure that there are many other documents and records useful to a Committee of this kind that would come into the other category.  I do not know how that is to be secured.  With regard to the other points the Government are insisting on making it a condition that this Bill must be got out of the way, I must say that I do not see any grave reason for making that a condition.  I think we could very well agree to leave it over, and if we are prepared to reach agreement, it would be well worth while for the Government to give way on that matter for the sake of agreement on the other matter.</P>
      <P>My position in the matter is this, that if there is general agreement, or if general agreement can be reached as to the setting up of the Committee, then I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.  I cannot say that I have had any definite statement yet from the Fianna Fáil Benches as to their attitude towards my amendment except the rather vague statement that was made at the beginning of the debate, but my position is that if general agreement can be reached as to the nature of the Committee, then I am prepared to withdraw the amendment. If general agreement cannot be reached then I will let my amendment go to the House.</P>

      <P>I regret that I have to speak at a distance from some of the criticisms that have been levelled against this Bill.  It would have been much easier to stand up after one of the Ministers had spoken than to try now to bring to the mind of the House those criticisms.  They are dead now, and resurrecting them at this particular stage would not serve any useful purpose. They illustrated for the most <Col N="528" /> part, as far as I could see, what one of the Ministers called their technique. They started off by saying the Bill was bad and a mess, and not once did they point out a defect, or where there was anything really bad in the Bill or a mess in it.  They did not point it out, not once.  They started about the draughtsmanship.  Everybody in this House knows that when a Bill is brought in here from one of the Parties in opposition that the Bill is not likely to be drafted with the same care as it will be drafted by the official draughtsman. We heard the other day about a school of draughtsmanship.  We all know it is a technical business.  When one of the Opposition Parties brings in a Bill it is not expected that it will be in every detail as perfect a piece of draughtsmanship as would a Bill brought in by the Government Party.</P>
      <P>There is a very easy remedy for that. One of the ways I have indicated already would be to provide for any private member who was bringing in a Bill, or when one of the Opposition Parties was bringing in a Bill, the services of one of the expert draughtsmen.  That is one way.  The other way is that when a Bill comes to the Committee Stage that any amendments that are necessary from the legal or technical point of view will be remedied.  I suggest that the faults in this Bill are not the faults of draughtsmanship or anything of that kind.  As far as the members opposite are concerned, their difficulty about the Bill was that it was very definitely going to provide a system which was going to give much more public satisfaction than their own Bill, and because their own Bill, by comparison, was in a certain amount of danger, they want to damn this Bill by mere expression.  I have spoken about the draughtsmanship, and I am not at all convinced even yet that these statements about draughtsmanship could be proved to the hilt.  I say that it is likely on general principles that any Bill brought in by any of the Opposition Parties will not be as perfect a piece of draughtsmanship or would not work in as well with the existing Principal Act as will a piece of work drawn up by the men responsible for the Principal Act themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> The next thing stated was that we did not know ourselves what we were aiming at; that we had no definite principles in our minds, that we had not made up our minds as to what we wanted.  I think anybody who attempts at all to read the Bill in conjunction with the Principal Act will say that there are very clear principles in the Bill which differentiates it from the Principal Act and that there is no difficulty whatever in seeing what the principles of the Bill are and what the Bill was to embody.  So I say that there is no justification for that.  So far as I can see the attacks made by the Ministers were attacks mainly on vague matters of that kind. The draughtsmanship, they said, was bad, and we did not know our minds.  I believe that there was one other criticism of a similar character, and it was that the Bill was an attempt to meet the differences of opinion in our own Party.  I want to be quite frank.  There are members of our Party who, voicing the popular dissatisfaction, voicing the views as between a continuation of the present system and going back to the old, would choose going back to the old.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait now.  I say quite frankly that there are.  But they are quite prepared, every one of them, to take the amendment as it is in this Bill.  They believe that the public dissatisfaction is common, as pointed out by Deputy Corish&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;there is no use in blinding ourselves to that fact, there is public dissatisfaction, and remember that, as a rule, there is no smoke without some fire.  The members of our Party, therefore, are quite satisfied to take this.  But again, just as we were quite satisfied to take election of the Seanad by the Dáil, yet if we had to choose having the election in the form in which it is now we would prefer the old system of election direct by the people.  So, too, it is in this; if they were to choose between the present system and the old they would prefer going back to the old <Col N="530" /> system of making appointments.  They were aware of the dangers of the old. These were known to everybody.  It was done in the open, and these things could be publicly known and strong public opinion could rectify them.</P>
      <P>They are opposed, and very rightly opposed, to this whole idea of centralisation. It would seem as if the people in Dublin were perfect and the people in the country were quite of the opposite kind.  We do not believe in overcentralisation. We believe that the Executive here and the Central Commission in Dublin have quite enough to do if they do their own proper work, and the country would be better off if, as much as possible, local matters were left to the local people.  The President said we are contributing and we have a right to a voice in the appointments of local officers.  Certainly we have a right to see that these appointments are properly made, and that the right is properly preserved in the old and in the new systems we maintain is the case, because the Minister for Local Government has the right to refuse the sanction in any appointment which he considers has not been properly made. If that right were properly exercised he could see that the appointment of local officers was properly made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that it is the general interest of the community to see that local government is properly carried out, leaving administration, as far as possible, to the local people who know the local conditions.  Reference has been made to the merits of the old system as against the new system.  Most of the criticism against our amending Bill was directed against going back to the old system.  Personally, I think we should not go back to the old system without adding to it the safeguards that will be got by having a central examining body.  It is because the Civil Service Commission stands in the public mind for a central examining body that I prefer to have the Civil Service Commission carrying on examinations and seeing that the examinations are conducted by them; in the public mind that would be understood very much better than having examinations by a Commission called the Local Appointments Commission.  In one case it gives the idea not of examination, but of appointment, <Col N="531" /> and appointment at central headquarters gives to the public mind largely the idea that the central body, having exhausted all their powers of patronage, having filled up the Army and the Civie Guards, have a lot of other discontented followers to be satisfied, and they use this other means of getting jobs for their friends.</P>
    <P>I do not want that opinion to go abroad.  I want to see machinery set up to remove that discontent.  That discontent is there and we approach this Bill for the purpose of trying to allay suspicion.  I said at the very start that I was in no position to give details.  I had heard people speaking on occasions of corruption, using it in a very broad sense.  Statements were made to me by outsiders and members of our own Party and having heard them, I simply said that probably in the course of the debate those who had been talking and had these views would give expression to them.  I made no further promise, and the statements that were made by Deputies who dealt with particular cases were in line with what I had in mind.</P>
    <P>I think there is a good deal of truth in some of the remarks made by the Labour Deputies, and that is that there is some sort of underlying principle more or less the same in the amending Bill and the original Act.  They differ in two respects, mainly as far as principle is concerned.  The first difference is that the appointments will be made locally.  The other point in which they differ is that the examination, whatever kind it be, will be conducted by a certain Commission that will be responsible for examinations for the whole of the country.  That is common, and the only difference is that to have the examination in the hands of the Civil Service Commission would be understood better locally, and it would be accepted more readily.  That was apparently in the minds of the Executive Council when they brought in the original Act, because the excuse given for not having the Civil Service Commission made the Appointments Commission was that they had a difficulty about the personnel.</P>
    <P>I hold we ought not to be making our machinery absolutely to suit the personnel. <Col N="532" /> We ought to have the machinery we require, and get the suitable machinery to fill these posts.  The Ministers talk as if everybody should be satisfied that there will be no such question as any unfair or improper influence taking place here in the appointments made.  That will not satisfy us.  The Ministry and the Dáil, the Ministry in particular, have divested themselves of powers of patronage.  That is only narrowly true; it is not generally true.  The Executive Council have the selection of the Civil Service Commission.  The Commission personnel have the selection of the Local Appointments Board.  Naturally if they are able to select a personnel they will select one in which they have confidence.  I do not suggest they would select a personnel that will carry out their will and make appointments that will suit their particular Party or anything of that kind, but, putting it on a more general basis, they will have confidence in that body, because they appointed the personnel.  They believe the personnel will be what they want as far as the general administration is concerned, but they are not going to expect that others who had nothing to do with the appointment of these individuals will have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They can promote? We will come to that.  That is another point.  The local bodies have not the same confidence, and we, on these benches, have not the same confidence in that body.  It was said our Bill was going to bring back local &ldquo;pull&rdquo; and local influence.  As far as we are concerned, we prefer facing the disadvantages and the evils that are attendant on that system, where we can see the thing operating and check the open evil, than to have all the secret influences and the secret pull of one form of secret society or another.  The people of the country have a naturally right instinct in this matter.  They feel that while local people might have an influence in the appointment of doctors, up here the select few can do it in roundabout ways.  There is only one fault in our Bill, and if anybody could remove that it would make me very <Col N="533" /> happy.  I do not see any way of removing it.  The fault is that, ultimately, if three names are sent down there will be a certain amount of local canvassing. I am afraid that is inevitable.  I do not see any way out of it, but, of the two, I say that canvassing cannot result in having foisted on the community a non-qualified or a bad appointment.  I would prefer to face that as an evil that can be corrected than take the alternative, in which we will have the people who are in the know going about and using all sorts of influences in private.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned I do not mind.  In fact, if I were choosing for myself, what I would say would be that the names should be sent down with the qualifications of the first three, so that there would be a standard of comparison.  The value of sending down three names ought not to be pushed aside.  It is of great value from the point of view of public confidence. If you get three names and see that certain standards have been reached, and that certain qualifications are possessed, that they have been examined and &ldquo;placed,&rdquo; so to speak, a layman on the board who would not have any technical knowledge which would enable him to distinguish between the relative merits of certain candidates, if he gets them in a definite order of award and the examiners stand by it, I would accept that.  If I were a member of the board I would be prepared to make an appointment in that case, and I would not hesitate, if my common sense told me that there were other considerations which were greater, to take the amount of responsibility that would be involved in saying that while No. 1, from the expert point of view, might be the best, for the particular purpose required and in view of local conditions other marks should be added which would justify me in selecting another candidate. What do the Selection Boards do? They see that a man is paraded before them; they look at his qualifications. They put down roughly so many marks for apperance, address, parlour manners, and all the rest.  I would admit <Col N="534" /> that it is a very important thing that a doctor should have proper address in order to inspire confidence in his patients.</P>

      <P>So far as we are concerned, we believe that in sending down three names, if there is agreement that they should be marked 1, 2 and 3, the finding of the Selection Board should be attached, so that the local board, if they want to depart from it, will have to give good reason to their people for doing so.  I would be quite prepared to accept that myself, but I do not know whether every member of the Party would be agreeable to it.  I put myself in the position of a member of a local board who is anxious to make an honest appointment.  It would be a help to him certainly.  I would not like to get one name alone.  I would have nothing to compare it with.  I want something to show that if A is first what B and C were like.  I should like to have some idea which would enable me to judge of the merit of this particular man, and, for that reason, I would like to have other names as well. There is a point in this amending Bill that has not been adverted to at all.  If the local body wish to have only one name sent down&mdash;if I were a member of the local body I would stand over the views I have expressed and would rather get down three names than one &mdash;if it were held by the body as a whole that there might be some undue influence which would prevent a fair appointment being made, then it is permissible under this Bill to ask them to send only one name.  You have a chance there of saying to yourself: &ldquo;Of the two choices, which am I going to have?  Can I depend upon this appointment being made properly, and can I say that no undue influence will go towards the making of the appointment? If I thought there would not, I would prefer the three names, because it would enable me to arrive at a better judgement.  On the other hand, if there was likely to be canvassing or anything of that sort, then the local body could do what this Dáil has done, and I would depend upon them to do it.&rdquo; They would say: &ldquo;This power of <Col N="536" /> patronage will not be exercised properly in a particular case.  It is possible that that is much better for us because there may be two candidates between whom we might not feel ourselves competent to judge. Very well, let the central examining body send us down in this case only one name and then we can be satisfied.&rdquo; It does not exclude the idea of the local bodies of their own choice asking only for one name.  That provision has not been adverted to at all.  The only defect I can see in the Bill is that there will be a certain amount of canvassing between the three.  What are we aiming at there?  Is it the inconvenience which will be caused to the local councils&mdash;that they will be pestered with friends of the applicants?  Surely we ought to let them protect themselves against that.  We need not be very much concerned about them here.  They can very well protect themselves.  No man who lets it be clearly understood that he is not going to be affected by canvassing of any kind will be canvassed. That depends on the individual himself and on the body.  There is no difficulty about it.  I know a chairman of a county council who is known also to a number of members on the opposite benches.  That chairman let it be generally understood that he would not be canvassed by anybody.  And he has not been.  He is a popular man in his area and was elected, time after time, as chairman of the county council.  He was not canvassed, because he said, &ldquo;I am not going to be influenced in my decision by canvassing of any kind.  I will make my inquiries myself.  I will take the intiative in trying to get the information that will be necessary to enable me to judge as to the relative merits of the candidates.&rdquo;  We need not concern ourselves here with protecting the individual councillors from any inconvenience which may be caused by the fact that they permit themselves to be canvassed.  What evil is in this course of sending three names?  The only evil that can be suggested is that possibly the third person would be appointed instead of the first.  I will admit that if there was any infallible way by which we could arrive at the first, second and third, that argument would be sound.  But there is no infallible <Col N="537" /> way by which we can say &ldquo;Here are a number of applicants; this is the best.&rdquo; No body of men can say that.  Time after time, they are wrong in their judgements.  We would be saved a great deal of trouble if there was any way by which we could get the square man for the square hole and the round man for the round hole.</P>

He knows very well that he could not stand over that remark anywhere.  It is part of the parliamentary technique, and I wish to goodness that a lot of this parliamentary technique was put aside and we sat down to discuss matters on their merits and not be making statements for the Press.  What the President stated is not and was not the main consideration of this Bill.  I would not suggest as against anybody on the opposite benches that their main consideration was to get a bad appointment. I do not think that anybody here would believe that any responsible people would go out for the deliberate purpose of trying to set up a scheme not merely to secure that the best person should not be appointed, but the main consideration of which <Col N="538" /> was that some person other than the best qualified should be appointed.</P>

      <P>There are three principles.  There is the principle of the Principal Act, in which the appointments are made at headquarters, because the only name sent down is to be appointed.  They might on a rare occasion say: &ldquo;Very well, we will send down three.&rdquo;  If they send down three, you do not avoid canvassing.  There is the second method, by which the local body is responsible altogether for the appointment, and there is the method outlined in this Bill.  The arguments I listened to from the opposite benches were very curious.  They nullified one another, as a matter of fact.  I am leaving out the extraordinary argument of the President&mdash;but I had forgotten Deputy Gorey.  Deputy Gorey said that our purpose was to get all the disgruntled bodies in the country on our side, and that we wanted to use them for political purposes as the elections were pending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>That was answered very effectively by some other people, who said that the purpose of <Col N="539" /> the Bill was quite the opposite; that the Bill would not satisfy the local people at all, as it was worse than the original Bill.  We had the two arguments&mdash;that the Bill was intended to give back power to the local bodies in order to get all the disgruntled people on our side, and, on the other hand, the argument that it was not going to satisfy local people at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a better solution offered by the general reserve, Deputy Cooper.  The general reserve came into action immediately he saw the obvious contradiction between the two things.  His argument was that we were not even trying to make the best of both worlds, but that we were trying to make the worst of both worlds &mdash;that the Bill has the evils of both systems and the advantages of none. I would suggest to Deputy Gorey that that is better than sticking to his own explanation.  It is a beautiful way of trying to have it both ways.  Deputy Gorey is only trying to have it one way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of trying to get out of the situation, I would suggest that Deputy Cooper's is far the better way.  We had people talking about examinations. One Deputy told us that we were sweeping aside examinations, that we did not want examinations, that instead, as we used to say long ago, of letting the best horse leap the ditch, we were introducing a corrupt system.  It was rather interesting to notice the people who were against competitive examination. Deputy Sir James Craig said that that was not an infallible method, and the Minister for Education and the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that we need not pin our faith to competitive examinations too much.  Of course, everybody who has had experience of competitive examinations knows full well that they do not always get the best results.  But they have been accepted generally.  Why?  Because we cannot do this thing the President seems to suggest can be done; we are <Col N="540" /> not able to determine by any general process who is the best qualified candidate. It is an open question.  We can easily test the opposite.  We can very often tell when a person is unsuitable.</P>
      <P>There are various things you know are necessary, the absence of which would make the candidate unsuitable. For instance, if a person was not qualified in medicine at all we would know he would be unsuitable.  There are various defects of character which are best known to the local people.  These defects of various kinds would make it obvious that the person would not be the proper person to appoint.  But in the long run we must admit that there is no infallible way of getting the best candidate.  All we can do is to set up the best machinery by which we can get the nearest to it and try to make mistakes as seldom as possible.  There may be differences of opinion on what would be the results of the machinery, but surely we ought to face the thing. We ought not to face it, as the President did, with the statement that there is some political motive at the back of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, as well as I remember.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>You said more than that.  We all know perfectly well that once the majority Party in the House take up a certain attitude with respect to a Bill there is very little use in trying to give any arguments whatever for it.  The decision is taken and, therefore, any efforts to put the Bill through are going to fail.  We recognise that fact, but we believe that the Government is very unwise in doing that, that if they persist in that attitude and if the dissatisfaction which is common spreads then we will be forced to go back to the other alternative.  My view in the matter was that, by having the methods of appointment made clear, by making it obvious to everyone that there was no favouritism, and that the best attempt possible was being made to get the most suitable candidate it would save us from being driven to, perhaps, a line of action which may not by any means be the best.  If you have sensible means, very often you will avoid driving <Col N="541" /> people to certain extremes.  I say that the whole policy of the Executive in these matters of centralisation is a wrong policy, that it dissatisfies people because it betokens unnecessary and wrongful distrust of the people.  No attempt has been made by the Executive to take into account the differences of opinions that there are likely to be on matters of this kind, and to enable local people to have their way as much as it is possible.  One cannot be very enthusiastic in arguments in favour of a particular thing when one knows that the result will be that you might as well have been talking to a stone wall.</P>

      <P>I believe that when you go out for something you ought to try to win it.  I do not believe in giving up before I have to.  But in this particular case I hold it is a very important matter.  I would point out something to the President, something that will show him how this statement that &ldquo;We have divested ourselves of patronage,&rdquo; and so on, does not cut any ice, to use a common expression of the people in the country.  Look at the Chairman of this Commission, who is a member of the Civil Service Commission. The fact that I am introducing personalities in this shows the fact that we are using the Civil Service Commission.  Did the Executive Council, when they were divesting themselves of patronage, go, for example, to some non-political people, as we might call them?  Did they go, for instance, to the University? They wanted to get people in whom, from their own point of view, they thought they would have confidence. But I say that they cannot expect that the average person would have the same confidence in them.  They took the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission. They did not take some people in the University or some people who were non-political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Very near&rdquo; is different from putting one of their closest colleagues on it.  Look at the Chairman, for example.  We are not saying anything against the Chairman, and I hope that nobody will take it that we are, but I say that he does not inspire confidence, and he does not inspire it in me, and I believe that in matters of this kind, I am as fair as most people are.  Knowing the difficulties, and knowing that at some time or other such a Commission had to be appointed by the Executive Council, I realise some of the difficulties of the <Col N="543" /> case.  But I say that if the Executive Council wanted to get real confidence in their Commissioners they should not have taken immediate colleagues of their own and put them into this position.  When they did that they can no longer say that they have divested themselves of patronage.  They cannot have it both ways.  If they want to do it they will have to do it boldly and say that there may have been things done out of ignorance by people who were not associated with the Executive Council.  I am using the word &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo; in its fundamental and proper meaning.  I have often looked for excuses for their actions. Unfortunately it is a failing of mine that, instead of trying to do what, I think, Morley said, that nobody in a debate should do when he hears an argument from the opposite side&mdash;that is, ask himself how much truth there is in it&mdash;he should ask himself how it can be answered, my attitude as a rule has been to see what truth there is in the statements made by the other side. Even when our political opponents have set up this machinery, I have asked myself if there is any good reason for it, and I could only find one for that particular type of appointment, and the only one I could discover was that in this case they knew the general policy of the Government and so they might be useful and proper instruments for the carrying out of that policy.  But if that is so do not say that you have divested yourselves of political patronage, because you have not.  If you were to put people there who would not make the mistakes that outsiders might make, through ignorance of the general trend of policy, if the Executive Council wanted to get confidence they would have done far better, in making appointments for this purpose, to set up a board that could not be associated directly with them in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I have not attempted to go through all the arguments in detail.  The Bill would do a number of things.  It would give extended power of promotion to the local bodies.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the local people would have to say whether they were <Col N="544" /> to take the initiative of doing without competitive examination.  Suppose they had to do so, do you not think that a local board ought to be competent to decide for itself whether appointments ought to be by competitive examination, or whether, in view of what was required, it would be necessary to have the examination in another form?  They could not do it themselves; they would have to do this dispensing in conjunction with the Minister, so that at every stage the Minister would have an opportunity of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>There seems to be agreement about the setting up of this Committee.  We are prepared to support that amendment, because we believe that if there is an inquiry, and if it is not a whitewashing inquiry, there will be sufficient material to show that the system as it exists is not a good one, and that sufficient material would come from its deliberations to show that it would be wise to send down to a local body, not one name but three.  As far as I am concerned, I want it to be quite clearly understood that even if the Committee showed that nothing wrong was done, as a general system I would prefer the system in this Bill.  I see only one evil in it, that is, that there might be a certain amount of canvassing under it, but the avoidance of that evil would be easy.  As long as it cannot do any harm to the community by foisting somebody on to the people who is incompetent, it is a matter of protecting members of councils from individual annoyance by means of canvassing, and they can very well protect themselves from that point of view.  We are prepared to support the amendment on the understanding that we get a report from the Committee, and that then the whole question concerning this Bill can be considered.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that would not do.  I saw one of those files in connection with certain suggestions that were made when some of the boards were set up, and there were candid comments by some persons who would not wish to have those comments disclosed.  In that case I do not think they ever anticipated that they would be disclosed.  I do not think it would be fair to do so.  I do not know if anyone would learn anything from those comments, except to have remarks passed about them.</P>

      <P>There is nothing of that sort.  As far as the Selection Board is concerned there would be nothing of that sort, but there are other remarks which, though not made in a confidential way, they assumed were given in confidence.  There is no attempt to burke anything, but I would like to make sure that, even in a certain case where it was accepted that they were made in confidence, that would be respected, I am not claiming any general dispensation in respect of documents at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell's amendment gives power to send for persons, papers and records.  Papers and records are only useful in so far as they concern business.  If there was general agreement to drop the words &ldquo;papers and records,&rdquo; and to let the Committee send for persons who have been influenced by these papers and records, perhaps that would do.  I know that there has been considerable talk outside about people who have been members of Selection Boards since appointments were made.  I think it is only right to give them an opportunity of being brought before the Committee and of giving evidence.  After all, if the persons are available, papers and records are not an advantage.</P>

      <P>Might I ask what does the President expect would come from such a Committee?  Is it not obvious that if we were to inquire into the working of that Act we can find out without any inquiry?  Is it not obvious that if we are not to inquire into particular appointments that were made in the past you will not get a proper inquiry?  Is not the whole question that there is public dissatisfaction because of the feeling that certain appointments in the past have not been properly made?  Surely you will not dispel that suspicion unless the Committee is able to examine into these appointments, and say if, in fact, they believe they <Col N="547" /> have been properly made?  The best way to dispel suspicion in the public mind is for a Committee representative of all parties to bring in a report stating that they have examined into the appointments, and that they are satisfied that they have been made without any question of undue influence, as far as human beings could arrive at the best results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the President.  After every examination in Trinity College I suppose there are from twelve to twenty of the students who have to seek appointments elsewhere than in Ireland. Some of them are seeking assistantships or are trying to get into the Army and Navy.  They usually give my name as a reference.  I receive documents marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; asking me to state certain things and saying that under no circumstances will my statement be revealed.  I give an honest opinion, and I would consider it a very serious breach of confidence if the contents of a document that I signed was revealed.  I do not see how the President could give way there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get agreement.  Some candidates, after the Selection Boards have reported, have written to the Local Appointments Commissioners expressing satisfaction with whatever investigation or examination there was, but they asked that their marks should not be published. Deputies have put questions to me here in connection with this matter, and I find it difficult to think of what precautions I must take to ensure that a certain amount of respect is paid to the confidence reposed in us.  Other than that, I see no objection to the normal inquiry proceeding until there is either satisfaction expressed at the course of its work, or they report back saying that it is not possible to go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the President's difficulty, and I quite appreciate the views expressed by Deputy Sir James Craig, that if information of a confidential character is given no Executive has any right to reveal it.  I quite understand that.  I think it would be altogether wrong to do so.  We do not ask for that, but surely in regard <Col N="548" /> to the marks, for example, that an examining board sends into the Central Commission there ought to be no question of confidence or secrecy about them.</P>

      <P>I think it is wrong that the Executive should hold that the marks should be regarded as confidential.  I mean that the Executive ought to draw the line in certain cases.  We can understand a private statement with regard to character, as mentioned by Deputy Craig, being got and accepted under the strict seal of confidence and secrecy.  But I see no reason why the Board of Examiners should not put down their marks in black and white.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine that as far as a regulation of that kind in connection with the Local Appointments Commissioners is concerned there should be a clear understanding between the Local Appointments Commissioners and the Executive.  The Executive Council are answerable to the members of the House for various Executive functions, and they are answerable to the House, for instance, in the case of an inquiry of this kind, and in order that such an inquiry would protect the Executive they ought to make arrangements that marks, except where it is held they are absolutely confidential, should be available.</P>

I understand that from the President, and I would be prepared to leave out the part of the amendment that I have mentioned until the Committee found, as they might, that they could not make any progress without such papers.  Then they could report back to the House.  If there is general agreement, I suggest to Deputy de Valera that the amendment should stand as it is with the omission of the words &ldquo;empowered to send for persons, papers and records.&rdquo;  Meanwhile the Bill is there still.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he will make available for reference and future guidance in a single volume, an account of the experiments in tobacco-growing conducted over a period of twenty-five years by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, in view of the fact that such information as is now available must be sought for in more than thirty volumes of the Journal, and is nowhere to be found in a complete and readily intelligible form.</P>

      <P>As the Government have decided definitely not to carry out any further experiments in <Col N="480" /> tobacco-growing I consider that the labour and expense involved in publishing in one volume all the reports up to the present issued in connection with the tobacco experiments would scarcely be justified.  I will, however, give the matter further consideration when all the necessary material for a final report has been received by my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries whether his attention has been called to a report of the proceedings in the Carrick-on-Shannon Circuit Court, in the case of the Irish Land Commission v. Messrs.  John Hunt and Michael McGrath, for rent of lands bordering the Shannon, alleged to be flooded; whether he is aware that the costs in connection with the half-yearly rent of £10 10s. 0d. in the case of Mr. John Hunt are £7 14s. 0d., and in that of Mr. Michael McGrath £7 14s. 6d., on a half-yearly rent of £12 7s. 4d.; whether, in view of the serious losses suffered by these and other farmers, whose lands adjoin the Shannon and are subject to flooding, he proposes to take steps to have their grievances remedied by a revision of the valuation of these lands for rating purposes and a reduction of the rents; and whether the Minister will consider the advisability of having remitted, or allowing for, the costs in the rents payable by the above-mentioned tenants.</P>

      <P>The persons referred to are tenant purchasers, and as they did not pay the instalments due on 1st December, 1927, the Land Commission instructed the State Solicitor to take proceedings for their recovery.  Decrees in both cases were granted at the last District Court held at Carrick-on-Shannon, and notice of appeal was lodged by the purchasers.  The Land Commission have no power to make any reductions in the Land Purchase Annuities payable by tenant purchasers.  The poor law valuation of the lands is a matter over which the Land Commission have no control.</P>
