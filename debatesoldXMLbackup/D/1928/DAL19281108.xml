      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been directed to the proposal of the Great Southern Railways Company to single the railway connection between Limerick and Limerick Junction; and whether, in view of the fact that it is the opinion of the Limerick Borough Council that such step would be a retrograde one and would not be in the best interests of the commercial life of the City and County of Limerick, he will make representations to the Great Southern Railways Company with a view to insuring that this proposal is not put into effect.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he proposes to introduce proposals for legislation to carry out the recommendation contained in paragraph 270 of the Report of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor, referring to the control of boarded-out children, and, if so, whether he can state when these proposals will be laid before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>This matter is under consideration, along with others, arising out of the Report of the Commission. Meanwhile, under existing law, Section 1 of the Children Act, 1908, requires persons who undertake the nursing of one or more children under the age of seven years to give notice in writing to the local authority within forty-eight hours from the reception of such infant.  The penalty for non-compliance is imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding £25.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is a question of great urgency; that the Committee appointed by his own Department found that Part I. of the Children Act, 1908, provided very defective machinery, and that actually out of every three illegitimate children dealt with under this, one dies in the first year of its life? Will the Minister realise that this is a matter not merely of Departmental reorganisation, but one affecting the lives of innocent children, and will he give special consideration to this section of the Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister also satisfied that the Act to which he has referred has been properly administered? Will the Minister take steps to see that, pending the taking of action on the Report of the Commission, the present law is properly administered and that these abuses which undoubtedly do exist will be remedied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the matter is a very important one, <Col N="1681" /> and for a long time past the Department has recognised it as such.  In January, 1926, and again in January, 1927, special circulars were sent from the Department to the authorities which have responsibility for looking after this matter urging better administration of their work in connection with this Act.  In so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, where the problem is rather large, the Union Commissioners have been giving the greatest possible attention to this matter, and in so far as it is possible for the Department to impress greater activity on other local authorities, that is being done.  The proposal in the Report is that a person who takes in an illegitimate child, either with reward or without reward, ought to be licensed before doing so.  The situation to be dealt with is a very delicate one, and it requires very great consideration as to whether persons who take in these children without fee, say, ought to be licensed before doing so.  But the matter is recognised by the Department as being important, and everything that under the present law can be done is being done.  The present law is reasonably strict for dealing with cases of non-compliance with it.  That does not mean that we are delaying unnecessarily in considering the recommendations of the Commission, or in taking any steps which we may decide to take after that consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister seen the resolution passed by the Rathdown Board of Guardians representing that their powers are inadequate to control this matter, and pointing out that over 300 children have been boarded out in their area within the last two years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether any efforts have been made by the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1682" /> to find markets for surplus barley in countries outside Saorstát Eireann; and, if so, whether any success has attended such efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have had the situation in markets for barley, both in and outside the Free State, closely under observation since the crop was harvested, and I am satisfied, from the information at my disposal, that between the combined purchases of the maltsters, millers and the exporting grain merchants, the bulk of the crop is in process of being cleared.  In regard to any of the crop not thus disposed of, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question from Deputy Aird on 11th ultimo, in which I stated that barley growers would be well advised to take advantage of the alternative outlet afforded them by utilising barley for the feeding of pigs and other farm stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I not have some direct reply as to whether any markets have been found through the Department of Agriculture outside Saorstát Eireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply I have given the Deputy is that the information which I have, especially during the last week, is that practically all the barley in the country will be disposed of, either in Ireland or in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are shipping it every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any information about a market for barley in Continental countries?  I understand that a considerable export is going on from South Wexford, and that that market has been found by a humble co-operative society.  It seems rather curious that the Department of Agriculture cannot do, with the immense resources at its disposal, what a very humble co-operative society can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know any humble co-operative society in this <Col N="1683" /> country.  But take Wexford: there are a number of merchants in Wexford who are able to ship and handle barley pretty effectively.  The Deputy can take it from me that if they can get a return of one shilling net more from the Continent, it is very natural that they will send it to the Continent.  To be candid, I cannot say if certain firms in Wexford are shipping to the Continent; but, if so, it is because they are getting a better price.  If they are getting a better price on the Continent, they are giving a better price to the farmers.  It is only a question of price, and you can take it from me that the shippers will go to the market where the price is highest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately there are other people concerned as well as the shippers.  I know that this situation exists, and while barley is being exported at a middling price from Wexford to the Continent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>About 15/- a barrel&mdash; in another barley-growing district the barley growers are going to very big pig-feeders and begging of them to take the barley off their hands at 10/- and 11/-.  That is rather an awkward and a bad situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>A few points were raised on this Vote yesterday by Deputy MacEntee as to the prices charged for official publications.  We have succeeded and the Deputy has given us credit for it in making considerable reductions in the prices of these publications.  Of course, it is understood that the actual prices charged bear no relation to the actual cost.  The prices are much lower than the actual cost prices, but the Stationery Office realises that the publications are primarily required for the Oireachtas and for the use of officials, and they are compiled with a view to giving the necessary information.  Sale copies are then printed, and they are priced at a figure which we believe will attract public sale.  As a matter of fact, the present sále price of these publications is much lower than the price of similar publications and similar articles <Col N="1688" /> anywhere else.  Of course, they bear no relation at all to the ordinary commercial prices.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee raised another point with regard to supplying public libraries with certain official documents. We have had that matter under consideration, and we would be prepared to do that at a nominal price; it would suit our purpose better to make a small charge.  I think the Deputy also adverted to the fact that printing paper is not available in this country.  That is not our fault.  This is no place in which to discuss the Tariff Commission or a tariff on paper.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony, I think, referred to the point connected with the fair wages clause.  All contracts entered into by the Stationery Office must comply with the fair wages clause.  In any case that is brought to our notice in which the fair wages clause is not complied with, we are prepared to take action.  A few cases have been brought to our notice where this clause has not been fully complied with, and we have taken action in these cases.</P>
      <P>With regard to providing a pocket telephone directory for Deputies, I have to say that this might run to considerable expense and, in any case, it is not a matter primarily for the Stationery Office, but for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised a point with regard to the indexing of certain publications. The ordinary Dáil debates are very well indexed.  With regard to the other publications, the Departments concerned, I take it, will see to this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cassidy raised a point about the printing of the Electoral Lists and the Registers of Electors locally.  It is our practice and our policy where possible to have these lists printed in the district to which they pertain.  But in some cases we find that a very excessive price is charged locally for these, and in those cases we, naturally, insist on having our lists printed elsewhere. Wherever the local printers are ready to do the work at a reasonable charge we are prepared to give them the preference.</P>

      <P>The District Court Vote for the year is £49,000.  That is to pay the salaries and expenses of the District Court Clerks and the expenses of the Headquarters Office which controls these clerks, travelling and subsistence expenses to the District Justices and the expenses of the Deputy Justice.  In short, this Vote is intended to cover the whole costs of the District Court, both judicial and clerical, except the salaries of the regular Justices.  These salaries are charged upon the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will notice that the amount asked for last year under this Vote was only £15,000, so that there is an <Col N="1690" /> apparent increase from £15,000 to £49,000.  In fact, however, there is not any real increase.  What happened was this:&mdash; The Salaries and expenses of the Headquarters staff of the District Court Clerks outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area are now being provided for, for the first time, out of voted moneys.  These salaries and expenses were formerly paid out of a separate fund, known as the Petty Sessions Clerks Fund, and later as the District Court Clerks Fund.  This Fund was made up of three separate items: (1) Fines, (2) Court Fees, and (3) the produce of the sale of licences for keeping dogs.  The dog duty is now collected as an ordinary tax, the proceeds being paid directly into the Exchequer.  It was provided by Section 49 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, that after a date to be appointed the whole fund should be wound up and transferred to the Exchequer and thereafter these salaries which were formerly charged on the Fund should be defrayed out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.  The appointed day was the 31st March last. The Fund has, accordingly, been wound up.  Provision has been made in this Estimate for the salaries of the Headquarters staff and of the clerks who were formerly paid out of the Fund.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that although the jurisdiction of the District Courts is far greater than the jurisdiction of the old Petty Sessions Courts, and the office business consequently much heavier, the cost of running the system has been reduced rather than increased, apart from the fall in the bonus.  It will be observed that the total salaries of the District Court Clerks outside of the Dublin Metropolitan Area amount at present to £30,269.  This covers 158 District Court Clerks, with an average salary of about £4 a week.  This is an inclusive figure, there being no separate cost of living bonus in these cases.  The actual salaries of the individual clerks vary, of course, very much.  There are one or two who have a net salary of £7 to £8 a week after paying expenses. These are whole-time clerks serving half-a-dozen Courts or serving a very important town, say Limerick City.  At <Col N="1691" /> the other end of the scale there are Clerks at £1 a week serving small courts in remote country places but who need not devote more than one day a week, or perhaps less than one day a week, to the performance of their duties.  Under Section 62 of the Court Officers' Act, 1926, there is power to establish as pensionable Civil Servants such of these Clerks as are whole-time officers.  But up to the present this has been done in only one case.  Such other Clerks as are whole-time and are giving satisfaction will be established in due course.</P>
    <P>There is another item to which I would like to draw attention.  That is, a sum of £3,735 which is provided for Deputy Justices.  This figure may be sub-divided into £2,735 for Vacation Justices and £1,000 for Deputy Justices in cases of illness.  Each ordinary Justice gets six weeks' holidays each year and the Deputy Justice gets paid two guineas a day.  The amount required for covering cases of illness cannot be accurately forecasted, but it has worked out up to the present at £1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The Courts of Justice Act, 1928, the provisions of which, I am sure, are familiar to all Deputies in this House, provides for the appointment of four permanent Assistant Justices at a salary of £800 per year each to do the work at present done by temporary Vacation Justices, and it also provides that the salary of the new Justices shall be charged on the Central Fund.  The bulk of this item will therfore disappear from future Votes.  It will not altogether disappear, because it will be always necessary to provide deputies in case of illness.  It would obviously be impossible to attempt to provide for cases of illness by making a permanent appointment.  As to the value of permanent appointments, I expressed my views already before the House and the House agreed.  The new appointments will be made early in the year 1929. It is too late this year to make the arrangements contemplated in the case of the four permanent assistants, because in order that those assistants should be working whole-time it is necessary that the other District Justices should arrange the times of their <Col N="1692" /> vacations.  I have nothing further to add to what I have already said in regard to that estimate.</P>
    <P>The next estimate is the estimate of the Supreme Court and the High Court of Justice.  This estimate shows the sum of £58,432 as the total sum required for the payment of salaries, including the cost of living bonus, of all the officers of the courts at present functioning in the Castle and in the District Probate Registry.  The sum of £6,000 may be appropriated to the officers attached to the Chief Lunacy Department, a sum slightly less than £2,000 being appropriated to the officers of the Supreme Court, the great bulk of the estimate being appropriated to the officers of the High Court who are divided in this estimate into groups corresponding to the several offices set up by the Court Officers Act, 1926. Deputies will notice there is provision made for three taxing masters in this estimate.  As a matter of fact, there are only two at the present moment.  One of the taxing masters died some time ago, and it is not intended to fill up the vacancy.  It is felt that two taxing masters will be able to do the entire work.  In some instances it may be noticed that the salaries are rather higher than the salaries which the office properly carries with it.  The reason is that these were existing officers who had existing salaries, and it was found cheaper to carry them on at their present existing salaries than to pay them pensions and appoint successors at a lower rate of salary.</P>
    <P>This estimate shows a very considerable decrease as compared with the case of the Supreme Court staff under the old régime.  We are asking £60,000 now.  The cost in 1921 was £140,000. Of this relatively enormous decrease a large amount is due to the fall in the cost of living bonus; but even taking basic salaries and ignoring bonuses altogether the cost in 1921 was £76,000, and the cost now is less than £40,000. This latter cost includes £3,000 or £4,000, the cost of the Lunacy Office, which did not appear in the 1921 estimate, and which now appears as part of the cost of the office of the Registrar to the Chief Justice.  The 1921 estimate was an estimate for all Ireland, but setting up the <Col N="1693" /> High Court in Belfast did not, in point of fact, reduce the cost of the Dublin courts to anything like the extent that one might anticipate.  It is a fallacy to say that if the former courts cost £76,000 the present courts, considering the present territory, should cost one-third less, or £50,000, and therefore the reduction to something under £40,000 does not seem very striking.  I think, however, Deputies will agree that an argument like that would be very fallacious, because it is much cheaper to run one High Court for an entire country than to run two High Courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD - KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing like a proportionate part of the reduction in this case has come directly from the fact of the Six Counties being taken out of the jurisdiction. The reduction has been effected by a continuous campaign of economy which has been none the less effective because it has not been advertised in the newspapers or on the hoardings. Officers who were past their work were invited to retire; officers of ability who could be spared were transferred to other departments, where their services have been highly appreciated.  An unsatisfactory system of copying by hand has been discarded in favour of typewriting, and in the unromantic region of cleaners, sweepers, porters, and housekeepers very surprising savings have been effected.  In the same way great care was exercised as regards the appointment of new officers. The former practice of importing patronage nominees into the high positions has absolutely ceased.  Appointments have been made only when absolutely necessary, and then only by promotion, and in the case of every such promotion the scale of salary formerly paid for the higher post has been revised. For example, when the post of accountant became vacant it was filled by promotion, but the salary was reduced from £1,000 a year to a scale of from £700 to £800 a vear.  This process will continue according as the existing officers die or retire.  When this process has been entirely completed numbers of salaries of £1,000&mdash;recently, in 1925, the number was fifteen and the <Col N="1694" /> number now is ten&mdash;will be further reduced to something less than half a dozen.  Except for this gradual reduction, I think there is very little, if any, further economy to be looked for now. In fact, one or two of the offices, particularly the Examiner's Office staff, will probably have to be strengthened if the work is to be done as quickly and as satisfactorily as is desired.</P>
      <P>I should draw attention to a small item on page 130, sub-head M.  That is a new item appearing on the estimate. We are asking for a sum of £452 to cover certain specified expenses. The explanation is that these expenses were formerly defrayed out of certain fees or percentages collected by the Chief Justice from the estates of the persons under his charge.  It is now thought more conformable with modern practice to vote these moneys in the same way as the travelling expenses of public officials generally, and the corresponding fees are now paid directly into the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The next item is the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  There are two offices here and they are under the same chief officer&mdash;the Registrar of Titles.  The estimates for both offices were, until recently, included in the estimate for the High Courts of Justice, to which they were nominally attached, an arrangement which made it necessary for an inquirer to go to a great deal of trouble, and to do a good deal of addition, subtraction and division, before he could see how much the Supreme Court itself costs and how much was to be attributed to the other two offices.  Now we show the two figures separately. It will be observed that there is a decrease of about £2,000 in the total cost&mdash;about £52,000 last year and about £50,000 this year.  This has been caused largely by a reduction in the cost of staff of the Registry of Deeds, into which, as vacancies occur, a more economical type of staff has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might say a few words upon these two particular offices.  The Registry of Deeds is much an older office than the other.  It is a very old office, dating back to the year 1708, and it was maintained out of its own fee <Col N="1695" /> fund up to the year 1864.  The object of this Registry is described in one of the Statutes to be a well-indexed record of all deeds, conveyances, and wills which shall be made of any honours, manors, lands, tenements or hereditaments. The scale of fees charged is laid down by two Acts, II. and III. William IV., and the XI. and XII. Victoria, but some of these were increased in 1916 by Treasury order. About 20,000 deeds are registered every year, and it is estimated that the fees charged will reach about £14,000, that is to say, about 75 per cent. of the total cost of the office.  In addition to fees, it should be borne in mind that this registry does certain work for public departments without charging any fee; for instance, searches ordered by the Land Commission and the registration of deeds of charge under the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, when it is certified by the Board of Works that the registration of these charges is necessary for the public service.</P>
    <P>The other office is the Land Registry, and this is the central office for the registration of titles to lands under the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act, 1891.  There is also a local office in each county, but the cost of these local offices appears in another Vote, as part of the Circuit Court organisation, as they are, except in three cases, under the care of the Circuit Court officer of the county, that is the County Registrar.  I fancy that most Deputies know something about the working of this office.  It is to maintain a well-ordered, well-indexed and well-managed record of the ownership of lands.  It is compulsory in the case of lands bought out under the Land Acts, subject to a Land Commission annuity, and it is voluntary in other cases.  It is gradually superseding the older Registry of Deeds.  More and more land is being bought out under the Land Purchase Acts; consequently, more and more deeds that used to be registered in the Registry of Deeds are now registered in the local Registration of Title Office.  The main object of the Registry is to produce in one simple folio a complete and authentic record of the title to <Col N="1696" /> each farm in the country, of the exact extent and boundaries of each farm, illustrated by a map.  So that in selling or mortgaging a farm the labour in connection with proof of title and proof of freedom from charge or incumbrance is reduced to the very smallest possible extent. Fees are charged for the registration of such transactions and for the supplying of folios but fees are not charged for the compulsory first registration of land bought under the Land Acts.  The first registration is done automatically.  When the landlord is bought out, the Land Commission passes the papers on to the Land Registry for that purpose.  The fees for the present financial year are estimated to produce £16,600&mdash;less than 50 per cent. of the cost.  If it were thought desirable that the fees should cover a greater proportion of the cost, that end would probably be best achieved by charging a fee on the first registration, and that is a matter to which we are giving consideration, turning the matter over in our own minds.</P>
    <P>There has always been a considerable amount of doubt and discussion as to the extent to which the work of local registration should be done&mdash;as to how far it should be done in the central registry that is the subject of this Vote, or how far it should be done in the local registry.  Neither practising solicitors nor experienced officials have been able to agree upon this question.  The actual practice is that the local registry does very little except duplicate folios and the really serious legal work is done in the central office.</P>
    <P>Now, persons whose opinion is supposed to count in legal matters have held that it was not the intention of the Act of 1891 that the central office should assume the powers and be developed to the size and importance that it has now reached, and that the local registries should have sunk down to be of very little importance.  On the other hand, people whose opinion is justifiably valued have come to the opposite conclusion, and think the existing practice is the correct practice, and they maintain that it is <Col N="1697" /> the only practical practice if the records are to be kept in proper order and the work to be done fully and efficiently.  I think if it is tolerably clear that at the present moment there is a certain amount of overlapping between the central registry and the local registry owing to this and the confusion caused by the disappearance of the judicial head of the office, because the land judge used to be the judicial head of the Local Registration of Titles Office, it is clear that the position of the Land Registry will some time or other have to be cleared up by legislation. I do not think there are any further remarks that could be usefully made to the House upon that particular subject.</P>
    <P>The next head I want to deal with is the Circuit Court.  Here we are asking for a gross sum of £76,000, less £16,000, Appropriation-in-Aid; that is a net sum of £60,000 to cover all the expenses of carrying on the office business of the Circuit Courts and certain other expenses, such as the judges' travelling expenses, which will be found on page 136, item B 1.  These are really connected with the judges rather than with the office, but they are not charged upon the Central Fund, and that is the reason why they must be provided for here.  I want to point out that under the Court Officers Act, 1926, the old office of Clerk of Crown and Peace was abolished and a new office of the County Registrar was substituted therefor. The difference between these two offices is that the County Registrar is a civil servant and must retire on reaching the age of seventy.  He is paid a fixed salary, and he surrenders to the Exchequer the fees received by him, whereas the Clerk of the Crown and Peace held office for life; he received in addition to salary certain fees, principally in connection with electoral work.  The former Clerks of the Crown and Peace, all but six or seven, have voluntarily declined re-employment as County Registrars, so that the great majority of the County Registrars are new appointees, and their salaries are considerably lower than the salaries paid to their predecessors.  I do not know any class of men in the public <Col N="1698" /> service who really have given more satisfaction than the new County Registrars.</P>
    <P>After the salaries of the County Registrars the next most important item is the salary of their staffs. Deputies will find this as item A 12, page 136.  Prior to the Court Officers Act, 1926, these staffs were the private employees of the Clerk of the Crown and Peace.  They made their own bargain with their own clerks, increased or decreased the staff, or their salaries, and engaged them or dismissed them as they wished.  The State paid the Clerks of the Crown and Peace clerical allowance towards the cost of the staffs but this allowance was not intended to, and did not in fact, cover the entire costs of the staff, nor was the State interested in seeing how the clerical allowance was distributed amongst the staff, but since the Court Officers Act came into operation in September, 1926, the State assumed direct liability for the salaries of these staffs, the salaries paid by the State being the same as formerly paid. That is to say, the State ascertained the actual salary formerly paid to each man whether it came from clerical allowance or fees or out of the Clerk of the Crown and Peace's own pocket, but as a matter of fact the fees the Clerks of the Crown and Peace received over and above salary were always more than sufficient to make up the difference between the sums they paid their own staffs and the amount of clerical allowance.  The total amount was fixed&mdash;the sum a man was getting was provisionally fixed as being his proper salary.  Here and there we came upon cases of hardship where the salaries formerly paid were really impossible salaries, where a clerk was giving full time service for a figure something like £40 a year and therefore special concessions were occasionally made. The result is that the cost to the State of these clerks has risen considerably, firstly, because the clerical allowance formerly paid by the State was not sufficient to pay the salaries actually paid by the Clerks of the Crown and Peace and, secondly, because the salaries were so inadequate that even <Col N="1699" /> the Minister for Finance thought it necessary to increase them.</P>
    <P>But against this increase we have benefited in most counties by a reduction of the salary at the head of the office and by the surrender to the Exchequer of fees formerly retained by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace. The cost to the State under the old régime of the entire office system of the county courts was about £63,000, a figure somewhat in excess of what is now asked for.  Deputies must remember in this connection that the present Circuit Courts have taken over a considerable amount of business formerly transacted in the High Court and that there is an item of £3,300 for stenography. That is an entirely new charge not incurred under the former system.  I draw attention to the fact that last year that figure was £5,500, so that we have succeeded in saving a sum of £2,200 which has been gained by paying these stenographers a fixed salary instead of piece-work by which they were previously paid.</P>
    <P>I think the only other item to which I will call attention is item A 33&mdash;Summons Service, page 135.  They are paid a retaining fee of £20 a year, but there are a great number of them&mdash;500 altogether. In the same item Deputies will observe that of court messengers mentioned. Most of the messengers are private employees of the under-sheriff and draw no salaries from the State, but there are two classes that do receive salaries from the State.  First, if a court messenger happens to be also a summons server he is paid an additional retaining fee of £20 a year. There are comparatively few of these&mdash; 22 of them altogether&mdash;and the arrangement is a continuation of an arrangement which was in operation under the former régime.</P>
    <P>In counties where the under-sheriff has died or retired, and where in consequence the County Registrar is now responsible for the execution of court orders under Section 54 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, we are now employing and paying out of State funds whole-time court messengers.  The counties in which this applies are Waterford, Wexford and Offaly.  The <Col N="1700" /> rate of pay is £3 per week without bonus.  Deputies will notice that we anticipate an income of £1,000 in this connection.  If Deputies look at page 137, item F, they will see that that will about cover our expenses.  In the same item F it will be noticed we anticipate an income of £13,000 by the surrender of fees paid to the County Registrars in connection with the preparation and revision of Jurors' Lists and the Register of Votes.</P>
    <P>As I explained, the sum of £13,000 under a former rule would have gone into the pockets of the County Registrars. As Deputies know, the County Registrar&mdash;I mentioned it on the last Estimate&mdash;in addition to his other duties, is the Registrar of Title under the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891. That is not so in three counties.  There the registrar is a solicitor specially appointed for that purpose many years ago because the then Lord Chancellor was of opinion that the Clerk of the Crown and Peace was not in a position to do the work.  The counties I allude to are Monaghan, Leix and Waterford. In item A 5, page 126, provision is made for the salary of those separate officers.  I am not sure it is quite correct to charge the sum of £1,000 against the Vote for the Circuit Court Staff. It might be more properly put on the Land Registry Vote.  It is the custom to do so for many years, and it still appears on the County Court Vote. There is no other item to which I wish to draw the attention of the House on this Vote.  Shall I take the Public Record Vote?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RUTTLEDGE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult in dealing with an estimate like this for any person who has not an opportunity of going into those departments and ascertaining whether there has been overlapping or too much of a staff employed in certain departments to state whether the work might be carried on as efficiently and effectively by a smaller staff.  With regard to the District Court, travelling and subsistence allowance is the first item where an increase is shown, which would appear to be very high, if I would not <Col N="1701" /> say excessive.  I have raised the matter, I think, on the discussion on the appointment of District Justices.  I have raised the question about appointing temporary justices, and notwithstanding the fact that under an Act power was given to the Minister to appoint those Assistant District Justices, apparently still the Department in the coming year consider it necessary that they should have an allowance made for Temporary Justices during the vacation period.  At that time I urged on the Minister as against the appointment of those Assistant Justices &mdash;I am not criticising that now, it being a statute, but in support of the question I am raising&mdash;that the work that would arise while the District Justices are on holidays could be done by adjoining District Justices.  The Minister apparently, when bringing forward that Act, was satisfied that it was not so, and the House decided to appoint the Assistant District Justices.  Having authority under the Act to appoint Assistant Justices, it would seem unreasonable to ask that provision would be made now for appointing what might be called Vacation Justices.  I think it is a bad principle.</P>
      <P>Apart from the amount of money involved, I feel it is a wrong principle that there should be temporary judges or temporary justices.  We have had examples of it many times.  Under what is referred to as the old régime, it was a very common thing to have assizes and other courts used as platforms to give out certain views as to the terrible condition of the country. I feel, if the same practice may not be followed, at any rate it will be invited by having gentlemen put into the position of temporary justices of any sort. Where they find the position is not permanent, they are looking for the spoils of office, and, rightly or wrongly, in their view they will be saying something to please what they consider the Government in office.  I think it is a bad principle, and does not make for the impartial administration of justice; but, apart from that, with the increased number of justices which the Minister has power to appoint under that Act, I do not see any necessity for making provision during the vacation of justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> As I said before when that Bill was being discussed, it would be quite easy to arrange for these justices to take their holidays at different times and arrange that justices in adjoining districts would administer any urgent matter that would arise at the time. It has been said that the districts are so large that it would be difficult to get a district justice convenient to some parts, but the only matter of urgency that arises is that of criminal business.  When urgent criminal cases arise it would be easy to arrange&mdash;I think any of these court districts are not more than twenty miles apart&mdash; that the adjoining district justice could do that business.</P>
    <P>One hundred and fifty-eight district court clerks seem to be an excessive number in the country.  I admit in certain parts of the country you have district court clerks who have fairly large districts to look after; but, on the other hand, you will find districts where there seems to be a surplus of district court clerks.  I know one district court clerk who has three district court areas to look after.  They are rather important and he is able to do each.  I find in every seven miles of an area there is a district court clerk to deal with that area, but there is only one district court in each and the court only meets once a month.  Take a district I know in North Mayo.  The district court clerk has to deal with a district where there is a summary court held every fortnight.</P>

It does not seem to be necessary to have a clerk in every little place where a court is held once a month.</P>

      <P>Another matter.  When the assistant court clerks were appointed originally they were appointed in a majority of cases without any examination.  It may be that a great number of them have given satisfaction and are efficient, but there are a considerable number of instances where they are not satisfactory. Clerks were appointed without any technical or expert knowledge whatever of their work in the court.  As the Minister is well aware, assuming it is the duty of the clerk to be able to perform the work efficiently, he should have a knowledge of the various matters with which he has to deal, and should be a guide to the clients who need legal assistance as to the proper course they have to adopt with regard to proceedings to be started.  Numerous examples have come to my notice where litigants have been landed into considerable difficulties and costs as the result of that, their proceedings being started in a way in which they should not be started.  Whether you call it inefficiency or lack of knowledge, where they did not secure or obtain legal assistance and relied on some of those clerks, those exceptions I referred to, they found they were put to considerable cost.  What I urge on the Minister is this, if those courts are to be effective there must be in some way an overhaul of the system where clerks were appointed without, what I submit at any rate, a proper examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examinations are being held now, but it is unreasonable, where you have men in technical positions operating in districts where the people are often far removed from legal assistance and often unable to pay for it, to have District Court Clerks who are unable to guide the people and give them proper directions as to instituting proceedings.  I suggest that the time has come for tightening up all that, and for ensuring that no person will become a District Court Clerk unless he is properly equipped for his work.  As I say, 158 District Court Clerks seem to be an excessive number.  Travelling and subsistence allowances for Deputy Justices <Col N="1704" /> have increased from £920 to £2,000.  I did not gather from the Minister whether that is a result of the provision that has been made enabling him to appoint Assistant Justices.  Otherwise, it seems to be an increase that is not warranted, and no indication has been given by the Minister that there has been a considerable increase in litigation or that an amount of extra work has been imposed on the Justices. Moreover, it has not been stated that District Court work has got into considerable arrear.</P>
    <P>The same difficulty is experienced in dealing with the High Court which, though perhaps to a minor extent, exists in regard to the District Courts. The Supreme Court is made up of a large number of departments and offices and, in a general way, people are informed from time to time that those places are over-staffed.  I cannot say that they are over-staffed for the reason that I have not, and I do not think other Deputies have, got definite information. They may have got information from officials or in some inconcrete way that some of the offices are over-staffed.  I know, and I agree with the Minister, that the Examiner's Office is hopelessly under-staffed.  I know from experience that that is one of the offices which should have been first looked after to see that it would work quickly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>There are a number of heavy cases held up there, and the Examiner is unable to deal with them.  I and others have cases there but we appreciate and understand the fact that these cases are held up as a result of the staff not being increased.  The Minister mentioned that particular office some time ago in a debate here as being under-staffed.  I want to know why that matter has not been seen to before now.  As the Minister is well aware, the cases dealt with by the Examiner are important and heavy ones, involving a considerable amount of property, so that it is a serious matter to have them held up.  A certain Chancery case is being held up there and in that case a substantial mortgage is held by the bank so that the interest on it is increasing to an alarming extent.  In fact, at the present <Col N="1705" /> rate of delay, it would mean that when the property is realised by the court and sold in the open market the interest will be greater than the debt itself.  At times, when property becomes vacant you can get a better price than when a tenant is in occupation, but you often find that you have to leave the property vacant because you have to proceed in a certain red tape fashion.  I am not complaining of red tape so far as that Department is concerned, but as a result of that Department not being properly staffed for the last nine or twelve months, these cases are held up.  I hope that that state of affairs will not last much longer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other departments it is difficult to say whether they have been over-staffed or not.  It is only the officials who are in those departments and who are acquainted with their work who are in a position to say that.  In view of statements made from time to time I would be inclined to say that these offices are over-staffed.  From a cursory examination I would agree, though I cannot say it definitely as I have not the means of proving it, that they are over-staffed.  I would urge the Minister to consider at a very early date whether there should not be some committee of experts set up which would consider the whole question of the administration of the law and see how and what economies could be effected in those various departments.  It is a huge task to try and go through all the departments, but perhaps an examination such as that might give a return which would be well worth trying to obtain.  As I say a Deputy in this House is not in a position to criticise those departments and see whether those statements are true. We all hear rumours and reports from people who regard themselves as experts and who say that these departments are over-staffed.  I agree, however, with the Minister in saying that one particular department is not over-staffed. I believe that such a committee, as I have indicated and have urged the Minister to set up, would give some results.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that only two <Col N="1706" /> taxing masters instead of three will be appointed in future, so that that means that a sum of £1,000 will be excluded from the Estimates.  In regard to the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds similar remarks can be made to those made in connection with the other departments.  It is difficult to criticise them, but there have been complaints regarding the delay in registering deeds.  I do not know whether such complaints are general or not, but some of them have been brought to my notice from time to time, especially in regard to delays in registering deeds. After all, the people who have to have their deeds registered are the people who pay.  The solicitor pays in the first instance, but his client pays in the end, so that the people are entitled to have that work done with expedition and satisfaction.  I would imagine that having the work done in a central office would result in its being done more economically than by having it spread over the country in an overlapping and dual position.  At the present time you give a certain amount of work to the local registry office and a certain amount of other work to the central office.  Apart from the economies that might be effected, I think it would be much more satisfactory if you had all the work done in the central office. The Minister says that he has heard various views on that.  He said that one body of opinion indicates one line and that another body of opinion, to be regarded just as strongly as the other, took another line.  I think that the proper thing for the Minister to do is to appoint some people to inquire into the whole system and report to this House.  It has been advocated for a considerable time that it would be much more satisfactory, and I believe would certainly result in some economy and a reduction in expense, if the work was done in the central office and not have it done in this way&mdash;having it spread over the country, while at the same time one has to go to the central office for certain other work.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am entitled on this Vote for the Circuit Court to raise any question with regard to two appointments made to the Circuit Courts recently.  I think, however, that I would be entitled to criticise the administration <Col N="1707" /> of the whole Department when dealing with the Circuit Court Vote.  What I want to call attention to is the appointment of a second Circuit Court judge.  As to the first appointment, anybody acquainted with the qualifications of the gentleman appointed, even from the outside point of view, is quite satisfied that the appointment was a good one.  As to the second appointment that was made, I for one would be very anxious to know on what grounds it was made.  One would have imagined, if what has been described from the other side of the House as keeping up the prestige of the courts were borne in mind, that the Minister or the responsible authority appointing a particular judge would look to see that a man prominent at the Bar and who had advanced on his qualifications as a lawyer, before being a politician, would have been considered.  In regard to the appointment that I am referring to, no one in touch with the legal aspect of matters can see any reason, from the legal point of view at any rate, why this judge was appointed. One would have thought that people had got to prove themselves in some way in their own profession, by obtaining some prominence in it not as politicians but as lawyers, before they would seem worthy of a position such as that.  As far as I can gather, and taking the appointment on the only ground on which I assume it can be justified, on the ground of being a political appointment, even on that ground, it would seem as if it would fall a good way short of what might have been required even from the Government in power at the time being.  It is true that he may have been very active in 1916 in a way in which some members of this House would not approve of perhaps, and that kind of thing.  He may have been, at a later stage, very active in courts-martial, particularly in one court-martial that we know of, where a man fell among the propaganda that he was a damned Englishman or something of that sort, but I think that is the only qualification that the other side of the House could put forward for this appointment.</P>
    <P>That is not the sort of thing that is <Col N="1708" /> going to get respect for the law or the courts in this country.  Political appointments of that sort are not going to fill people with the awe that they are supposed to have for the fair administration of law in the country. It is bringing respect for the law at any rate, to a very low standard, and it is arousing in the country again the memory of things that it might be better for the country if they were allowed to be forgotten.  To make an appointment like that looks like ripping open what might have been healing sores.  It is opening and holding up before the people of the country things that, perhaps, in the interests of the country we might have been anxious to forgive if not possibly to forget.  I do not know whether the Minister has in mind making any further appointments. I hope that when appointments of this kind are being made that that kind of thing will be forgotten, and that the Minister will look rather to men who he knows quite well have made their name at the Irish Bar, men who are prominent at the Bar and have got on on their merits, no matter what their political beliefs are.  Of one of the appointments that the Minister has made that can be said, but the other selection is the one that I am commenting on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to make a comparison between the cost of the administration of law in this country with what it is now and what it was in 1920 and 1921.  Of course, it is obvious that as two Governments cost a lot more money than one, even though they are spread over the same area as the one may have been, so also two sets of courts cost a very different amount of money from what one would cost.  It is obvious to anyone that no favourable comparison can or should be made on that basis.  If you add up the total cost of all those votes which the Minister is asking for, you will get a great total, and this total will show to the people what the cost of the administration of the law is in this country.  It brings us forcibly back to the position when it was strongly advocated that this country was being robbed in the way of taxation arising through the administration of the law and the policing of the country.  I suggest to the Minister <Col N="1709" /> that the way to deal with that is to have some sort of a committee to make inquiries and see what economies can be effected.  It is no use for anyone getting up here and trying to criticise the Department when that Department is made up of experts in their particular work.  I have not attempted to do that, even though I might have certain data in my possession as being the opinions of people perhaps who have been to some extent connected with this Department&mdash;that in certain departments they are overstaffed, while, as I have said, in one or two departments, they are not.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  What arrangements, if any, have been made with the Six County Government to deal, for instance, with judgments got against people who reside in the Six County area?  A certain case was brought to my notice the other day of a bus driver who operates in the Sligo area.  He knocked down an unfortunate lady there and she got a decree for, I think, something like £1,400. That defendant holds a contract from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Inquiries were made from the Secretary of Posts and Telegraphs to ascertain if any particulars would be given as to what name was registered as the contractor, whether it was the defendant himself or his wife.  The Secretary has refused to give those particulars, so far as I am aware.  I am not complaining about that, but what I want to ascertain is whether, if necessary, some legislation could not be introduced so that when a party who goes through the Free State but is residing in the Six County area is sued in the courts of the Free State there should be some arrangement whereby his property in the Six Counties should be liable for the levying of a decree.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would draw the attention of the Minister is that with regard to the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Conventions have been arranged between England, France and other countries, and no convention, so far as I am aware, has been made between the Free State and England.  The result of this is to cause particular hardship in the West of Ireland. <Col N="1710" /> Hundreds of people, as the Minister is aware, emigrate to England or Scotland.  If they meet with an accident in those countries they are allowed compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act while there, but if they return to this country they can get nothing.  They are not allowed any compensation until they go back again to England or Scotland or wherever they have been working.  I think representations were made to the Department of Justice two years ago on that particular matter, urging on the Department that something should be done.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a matter in connection with the Vote for the Circuit Courts.  I am sorry I did not hear the Minister's opening statement. The question which I want to raise was raised by me some time ago in the form of a question, and afterwards I had some correspondence with the Minister on the subject.  It is regarding the arrangements for the Circuit Courts in Cork County.  The position is that all the criminal business for the county is transacted in Cork City. and that in addition a great portion of the civil business is also transacted in the city.  The present arrangements have created what is a genuine hardship for a good number of people in the western portion of the county.  The courts that were formerly held in Bandon are now held in Cork City. That involves very great hardship for the people generally who are concerned with legal business, and particular hardship as regards the people who are <Col N="1711" /> called upon for jury service in the western portions of the county.  I looked over the reports in the papers recently of the Circuit Court cases in Cork, and I noticed that a number of jurors had to be excused on various grounds.  In one case a Guard explained that when he served the summons on a man for jury service the man informed him that he would not be able to go, for he had not got suitable clothes.  That was typical of a good many cases of hardship.</P>
      <P>If the Circuit Court were restored, as we are advocating, in Bandon, there would still be a certain amount of hardship, but its extent would be greatly minimised.  I can anticipate the answer the Minister will give to this will be the same as he has previously given&mdash; that, as we know, the Circuit Courts cater for a wider range of business than did the Quarter Sessions Courts, but I submit it is a great hardship that people should have to travel 47 miles to do business in the courts.  The courthouse which has been reconstructed in Bandon is a suitable court in every way.  It would be a convenience to litigants, legal men and jurors if that court were availed of.  I ask the Minister to give some indication as to what the position is.  At the time the Rules of the Circuit Court were referred to a Committee of the House, I intended to raise the matter in Committee.  Subsequently the Rules collapsed, I think for the reason that they were not approved of in the Seanad.  I am not clear as to the position at the moment.  In the absence of a satisfactory explanation in the matter, in justice to the people I represent, I will be compelled to vote against this Estimate.</P>

      <P>There is a small matter I would like to raise under this Vote, and that is, what is the position of the official assignee in Cork?  The official who held that position died early in July, and no appointment has been made since.  That has caused a great deal of inconvenience. I hope the Minister will consider the making of an appointment to the position in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some astonishment to the remarks of Deputy Ruttledge on the recent appointment of a Circuit Court judge.  I say I listened with some astonishment, because Deputy Ruttledge is a member of the legal profession himself, and ought to know better than to say the things he said.  He did not profess to express the views of his own profession as to this appointment.  I can perhaps express the views of my profession regarding the appointment.  The Bar, so far as it is concerned with the appointment, is concerned with one point of view only, and that is whether the man appointed was a competent workman or not, because if not it reflects discredit on the Bar when the work is done badly.  The view of the Bar is that not only the two previous appointments, but the last appointment, are excellent appointments. The appointees are all known to have been qualified workmen in their profession. The Circuit Judge whom Deputy Ruttledge attacked in this wholly unjustifiable way was to my knowledge a working barrister in good practice for a number of years, and he had the respect both of the solicitors' profession he came in touch with and the Bar, who saw that he did his work always competently.  He was tried as a judge previously in another capacity, and he acted to the satisfaction both of the professions and the public as judge in the Dáil Winding-Up Court.  I am astonished to see that a Deputy like Deputy Ruttledge who has experience of this matter should bring forward political considerations and suggest that the appointment in his case was made for any reason other than that he was a suitable person for the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rice has rather anticipated me by his reference to the very unfair criticism by Deputy Ruttledge of a recent legal appointment. I have nothing to do with the law; I have no interest in appointments, nor do I ever seek to get a job for anybody, but I say it was the most disrespectful statement, from the point of view of the carrying out of the law, that I ever heard here from an official <Col N="1713" /> of the courts, that appointments like this are likely to bring the law into disrepute. It is statements in this House reflecting on men who are qualified for positions that are much more likely to bring the law into disrepute than the appointment that has been made.  I would not have intervened in the debate were it not for the fact that the Judge referred to has been allocated to County Cavan, which I represent.  I have taken particular care since his appointment to inquire amongst the Bar of the County Cavan as to how his appointment was regarded by them and what they thought of him since he filled the vacancy.  He has followed one of the best Judges that was ever in the County Cavan, and I can assure you that he is giving the utmost satisfaction. It was very surprising to hear a lawyer make the statement that that man had no qualifications for the position and was likely to bring the law into disrepute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CAREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interfere in this controversy, but I want to draw the attention of the Minister to a very important matter with regard to the attendance of jurors at the Cork <Col N="1714" /> Circuit Court.  Jurors from East Cork who attend that court have to travel about fifty miles to the city, have to leave their homes at about seven o'clock in the morning, and do not get back until about eight in the evening.  If that situation is to continue, I suggest that it would be well to include in next year's estimate money for the payment of these jurors, whether they are called on a jury or not.  Thousands of pounds have been spent on the Midleton Courthouse, and it is fit for any judge to sit in.  It is heated, well-ventilated, and has all the necessary equipment to enable it to be used as a courthouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the greatest hardship that can be inflicted on jurors at present is to summon about 150 of them to Cork City and then to have none of them called on any of the juries that are sworn.  A way out of the difficulty could be got by summoning and paying a certain number of them for one circuit court and another number for the next circuit court.  That would meet the case.  But I believe that the time will come when jurors&mdash;I will not say will refuse intentionally&mdash;but will find it very hard to attend the Cork Circuit Court unless their expenses are paid. Something must be done in that direction. For years back as far as I can remember the quarter sessions were always held in the town of Midleton, and what the idea behind the change was I do not know.  It may be that it is to centralise everything in the cities. If that is so it is a bad thing, and jurors will have to be paid for attending these courts.  At present business people in the towns and the farmers especially have their own work to perform, and they cannot go to Cork without losing a certain amount of money.  They have to pay their expenses and get their dinner and tea, and I need not tell you that all this forms an expensive item for the farmers of East Cork, and for those of West Cork also, because I agree with the case for Bantry that Deputy Tadhg Murphy has put before the Minister, and I say that the same thing applies to Midleton and East Cork.  I would particularly ask the Minister to consider the question of the payment of jurors, if he does not intend to restore the old <Col N="1715" /> procedure with regard to the holding of courts in Midleton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rice was at some pains to attack Deputy Ruttledge because of the way in which he referred to a recent judicial appointment.  The important aspect of that which must be brought out is that, whilst there were men of greater experience who had given greater evidence of ability to act as Judges, these men were passed over in preference to one whose services to this country had been as odious to a very large section in Ireland as services could possibly be.  Anybody who was associated with the court-martial that condemned Erskine Childers to death was not a man to be appointed to a judicial position in this country.  One would imagine that the Government, looking to appoint a man who would command the respect of the whole community, would not appoint such a man to a judicial position.  I do not know whether Deputy Rice considered that he himself, if he were appointed to some position, would not come under criticism&mdash;I will not say similar criticism&mdash;but criticism of the same character.  His advancement in public life appears to be in accordance with his power of changing his coat in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But turning to a less-contentious part of this discussion, I would like to refer to one matter, and that is to the complaint, both of practitioners and others, of a lack of expert knowledge in certain departments.  For instance, I have heard complaints about the Registry of Deeds&mdash;that where formerly sales were carried out in three weeks, they are held up now for anything from six to ten weeks.  I do not want to say anything unfair about any officials or individuals, but I think that special regard should be had to these complaints, that a consultation of some sort should take place amongst the officials, so that those who show sufficient ability could get an opportunity of studying so as to be brought up to the requisite standard of expertness.  They should get that opportunity, and the others <Col N="1716" /> should be moved into some other department. Instead of working on the principle that any civil servant can do any work in any office, men should be put in their place who would have the very expert knowledge required for these offices.  Criticism of a lack of expert knowledge applies, I know, to various offices, and I do not wish to specify them, because I do not wish to say anything invidious about any office, where I am sure these officials are doing the best they can.  But the absence of real expert knowledge is of such a nature as to militate against the proper dealing with legal business.</P>

      <P>There is a small matter to which I would like to direct the attention of the Minister for Justice. It is in connection with court messengers.  Is there any specific charge to be made by these men for their services?  Complaints are often made to me that they charge in a rather extortionate way for what are rather questionable services sometimes. I have in mind a case of a decree for a Land Commission annuity for a comparatively small amount.  The man paid the amount before the decree was executed.  Before he got a receipt the court messengers came on the scene and demanded £1 expenses, although they had done no work whatsoever. They made no seizure because the man was able to prove that he had actually paid, but they demanded a pound and they got it.  That is only one case, and I have got several other cases of a like nature.  It would be advisable to afford some protection to the unfortunate people who are mulcted in this way.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate, I would like to refer to a matter that has been already dealt with by Deputy Ruttledge in connection with the District Court clerks.  I understand that some of these appointments were made without examination, and I also understand that some appointments have recently been made as a result of a qualifying examination.  The point I want to make is, as Deputy Ruttledge stated, that litigants have often been put to very considerable expense and inconvenience owing to the want of <Col N="1717" /> legal knowledge on the part of certain District Court clerks.  That is not to be wondered at, because it is my experience that the rules governing these appointments are not of such a nature as would guarantee efficiency.

      <P>I think that the same provision should be made as is made in the Legal Practitioners Bill governing appointments&mdash;five years from now. The only other thing I wish to refer to is the recent appointment of a judge in the Circuit Court.  I do not know why Deputy Ruttledge referred to this appointment.  All I do know is that objection is, perhaps, being taken, owing to the fact that the person appointed did not take a part in the fight for freedom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more or less in the same position.  I certainly took no part so far as securing the freedom of this country is concerned, but that does not mean that I am against Ireland being free.  I held certain specific views at that time, and in the light of recent events I think I was not far wrong in following up those views, even to the present day.  If the Judge in question had the same views I do not think that should be a reason why his appointment to a Judgeship should be criticised, provided he has all the other accomplishments necessary for the position of a Judge.  I would say the same as far as the appointment of a Judge is concerned, even if a member of the Opposition Party were appointed, that all other things being equal, political tests should not be applied to appointments now nor at any time in the future.  I think it would be well if we could get away from criticism of that nature, and let us all come down to hard facts, and remember that though we have disagreed in the past yet we are all imbued with the same spirit, to make Ireland prosperous and contented and, if possible, to restore her unity.  I think that it is not wise to introduce matters of this sort when Estimates of this nature are being presented in the House.  I think it would be as well in the interests of the peace of the country, and in the interests of the preservation of law and order, that references of <Col N="1719" /> such a nature should not be made in the House or outside it.  I prefer to let the past bury the past, and to work in harmony with any section of my fellow-countrymen who are out to secure the best possible freedom for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter on which I desire to say a few words, and that is the matter referred to by Deputy Rice and Deputy Coburn.  It should be quite clear to all Deputies who heard my colleague, Deputy Ruttledge, speaking that he did not say that the person appointed as a Circuit Court Judge was not qualified for the position.  Deputy Rice has spoken, apparently with authority, for the Bar. I should like him to state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. RICE Mr. RICE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I did not make any such statement&mdash;that I spoke with authority for the Bar.  I expressed what I knew or believed to be the view of the Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note of the exact words used by the Deputy&mdash;that he could speak with some authority as to what were the precise views of the Bar.  I think these were the Deputy's precise words.  I should like to know if there were not men senior to the barrister who was appointed a Circuit Court Judge who, at least, had attained equal distinction, if not greater distinction, than he had, without any political pull, and against whom nothing whatever would be said by any Deputy in this House if they were appointed.  Two appointments were made and neither of the gentlemen appointed agreed with this Party politically.  To one we take no exception. There are men at the Bar known to Deputy Rice, of greater legal attainments, longer practice and greater standing, who might be Unionists, ex-British Army men or anything they like politically, against whom not one word would be said.  But as we like Deputy Coburn, would like to bury the past, and try to get contentment in the country, we think it was inadvisable to appoint a man against whom there are bitter feelings in this country, in preference to men better qualified, against whom there were no such feelings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate which, on the whole, was very admirably conducted, was most unfortunately marred by the subject Deputy Ruttledge introduced.  He introduced an attack upon a gentleman, a distinguished member of the Irish Bar, who has recently received promotion and is now one of our Circuit Judges. That gentleman has practised for a great number of years at the Irish Bar.  He has done an extremely good business. He was most highly thought of on his own circuit.  He held, as Deputy Rice said, a semi-judicial office when he was a member of the Dáil Eireann (Winding-up) Courts Commission.  He bears everywhere amongst his colleagues at the Irish Bar a high reputation, and I do not believe that there can be found one single member of the Irish Bar who would contradict me in saying that he was a man of great ability, a man of high standing at his profession, a skilful advocate and, above all things, a man of the most unimpeachable personal honour and personal integrity.  With these remarks I will pass away from that, just expressing my regret that Deputy Ruttledge should have spoken in a way that was utterly unworthy of Deputy Ruttledge in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I come now to deal with the ordinary criticism which has been passed by Deputy Ruttledge on these various Votes.  I wish to express my view that Deputy Ruttledge has done what I think should be done in a Vote of this kind.  He has criticised the Vote quietly, and, as far as lay in his power, he attempted to give help.  He made such suggestions as he should make.  Beginning with the District Court, he criticised the appointment of Assistant District Justices again, and said that they should work like the magistrates in the old times.  That is absolutely impossible.  The District Justices are an extremely hard-working body of men.  As a matter of fact, there are District Justices at present who are overworked, and to suggest that an overworked District Justice should do not only the work of his own district, but of another District Justice, during the latter's absence, is to ask <Col N="1721" /> him to do what would be absolutely impossible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge also talked about the salaries of the new Assistant District Justices, and why they should not appear upon the Estimates.  Deputy Ruttledge must know that these Estimates were prepared and printed before the Bill appointing the new Deputy District Justices was introduced and before it became law.  For that reason the item here opposite the temporary District Justices will in future go to Assistant District Justices.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which Deputy Ruttledge very properly drew the attention of the House, and that was the increase in the sum payable to the Assistant District Justices for travelling expenses.  No travelling expenses were given at one time to the Assistant District Justices.  They were paid a fee of two guineas, out of which they had to bear their own travelling expenses and their hotel expenses. That was considered inadequate.  Now they are given an extra sum for their hotel expenses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge spoke about the District Court clerks, and he said there were too many in the country.  He instanced Ballina and Ballycastle. Deputy Ruttledge, I think, rather unconsciously left the House under the impression that you could have five or three of these courts amalgamated, and that you would then have three done for the cost of one.  That is not so.  If you take, for instance, the salary of the District Court clerk of Ballina, you will find that he gets £275 a year.  If you take Ballycastle you will find that the clerk there gets £50 a year.  Then Ballycastle is too far away to amalgamate with Ballina, and if you appoint the one clerk to do the two the Ballina clerk will certainly earn his £50, and there would not be a saving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. RUTTLEDGE Mr. RUTTLEDGE">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballycastle is the name I got here.  I forget what the figure for Killala is.  Passing on to the High Court.  Deputy Ruttledge criticised the delay in the Examiner's Office.  I have already, on several <Col N="1722" /> occasions, admitted that there has been delay in the Examiner's Office.  But the Deputy knew perfectly well that the delay in the Examiner's Office is caused because of the fact that you cannot put in there any particular individual and say to him, &ldquo;Go in there and work the Examiner's Office.&rdquo;  The Examiner's Office is an office in which you must put in somebody who is a competent man and who knows something about the work.  The fact is that some well-trained officials left that office and went out on pension, and the difficulty has been to get somebody who is really competent to do that work expeditiously.  I say that because it is work that is highly technical.  Everything that can be done in that line is being done.  I have particular regard to that matter.  I know that the office is not satisfactory, and I also know that the Master who is looking after that is the chief officer in the court, and that he is doing what he can do to see that that state of affairs is put right.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ruttledge said that there was over-staffing in some Departments. That matter has been very thoroughly gone into again and again.  The work that every person in the court offices is doing has been very carefully examined. If there has been any mistake made anywhere, it is a mistake of under-staffing and not of over-staffing. I am satisfied that without doing an injury to the work the staff in the court could not be reduced by as much as one officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge talked about delay in registration.  That is in the Registration of Title Office, and he also suggested that the District Registrar should be done away with, and that the entire work should be carried out in the High Court Office.  A great deal could be said for that.  That is a matter that requires consideration, and it is a matter which is receiving our most careful consideration, weighing the pros and cons.  I know it will receive a great deal of opposition, because a great many country solicitors, especially solicitors who live near a town where a local office is situated, would have extra trouble put upon them communicating with Dublin.  We are weighing the advantages on both <Col N="1723" /> sides and setting the one against the other.  If time permits in the present year I hope to make some alterations in that particular system.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Deputy said anything about the Circuit Court.  I pointed out that this question of reciprocal arrangements between governments in which accommodation can be reached is a matter on which I wish an arrangement could be come to. It really does not arise on this Vote.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.X. Murphy asked me about the position of the Official Assignee in Cork.  There was a whole-time official in Cork, but he did not get a great deal of work.  In fact, he was in rather a pleasant position there.  He never had enough work to justify the salary which was being paid to him. A suggestion was made about appointing an assistant instead of a full-time registrar.  Well, the gentleman who will be appointed there will not be a whole-time man, and he will receive considerably smaller remuneration. That appointment will be made forthwith.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tadhg Murphy, Deputy Carey, and other Deputies, talked about the places in that county in which Circuit Courts might be held but are not held. Deputies might know that at present, owing to the absence of Circuit Court Rules, things are in a great state of confusion.  That is because the draft Rules were turned down by the Joint Committee which was set up by the Dáil and Seanad.  The result is that the Rules are in Limbo at the present moment.  That seems to be the only way in which I can describe the matter. The whole thing must be completely <Col N="1724" /> taken up, and the whole circuit system will have to be examined by somebody.  When these Rules have been examined and considered other things will have to be considered too, such as where the sittings of the court are to be.  That will also have to be considered.  Deputies, I think, should bear in mind that at every period a number of jurymen from Cork had to come into Cork city for the assizes. That would be true of other places.</P>

      <P>The total of this Vote is £5,762 for the purpose of keeping, maintaining and looking after the public records of the country.  It shows a decrease of £229 on last year.

      <P>This is a small Department, and the amount asked for is not considerable, but we find ourselves in the same position in reference to it as we did in reference to the courts.  A Deputy is not in a position to criticise it or say it is overstaffed. That is my difficulty in the matter. But the work that is to be done, I understand, varies very much from time to time, and sometimes the staff there would be practically idle.  I have been informed that the office could be run at considerably less expense.  Of course the amount involved is very small, but there might be more economies effected.  I do not know whether the Minister would think it well to consider it, but in introducing an Estimate like this some particulars as to the <Col N="1732" /> amount of work to be done should be given to the House&mdash;some idea of the work imposed on the officials.</P>

      <P>The total amount of the Vote in this case is £3,169, showing a net decrease of £49 upon last year.  Most Deputies are aware of what the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests are for&mdash;what their duties are, and what work they perform.  The Commissioners themselves are an unpaid body. They have very important duties to perform, the main one, of course, being to see that any money which has been left to charitable purposes shall not be misapplied by individuals and that the intentions of testators shall be properly carried out.</P>

    <P>The only substantial difference in the Vote this year as compared with last year is the increase of £2,550 in the provision for travelling expenses. Heretofore provision has been made in the Estimates for allowances to the full number of Deputies, so that there is no change in that respect, but allowance was not made heretofore for the travelling expenses that would be required in case all the Deputies took their seats.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister for Finance whether he would give an idea of the organisation of the administrative, clerical and subordinate staff and particularly the administrative and clerical staff, and to whom they are responsible?  I want, roughly, the main sub-division and who is the ultimate authority in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the staff of the Oireachtas are responsible to the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The Clerk of the Dáil is the Civil Service head of the Oireachtas staff.  The Clerk of the Seanad is, of course, responsible to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The staff below the Clerk, and the Assistant <Col N="1734" /> Clerk, of the Seanad, and the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk of the Dáil are a common Oireachtas staff working under the Clerk of the Dáil as Civil Service head, and the Clerk of the Dáil, of course, answers to the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>So that for all practical purposes the Clerk of the Dáil is head of the staff.  The Vote under this head falls into three main divisions.  There is a sum of close on £60,000, actually £59,800, for Teachtaí allowances and travelling expenses; £24,730 for Senators and their travelling expenses; a sum approximately of £30,000 for the administrative staff.  I understand we will not be permitted, here, to criticise the main items, in as-much as they are statutory, so that I will have to reserve what I would like to say on this as regards possible reductions, until the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill.  The points I wanted to refer to would be the possibility of reducing the main items by sums amounting to from £27,137, and considering that the sums involve about £116,000, I think when we do come to the Appropriation Bill that the members will be prepared to support the action we would suggest in that case.  We intend voting against this Estimate mainly because of the fact that we have here the Seanad body which it is the policy of the Government to maintain at its full strength of sixty.  As I said, it would be probably out of order to criticise in detail and indicate what our attitude is, so we will have to confine ourselves to voting against the Estimate.</P>

      <P>In 1925 an additional agricultural grant of the same amount as the old agricultural grant was provided.

      <P>I do not consider that the Government are acting fairly in this matter.  I do not think they are giving any attention whatsoever to the depression in agriculture at present, and I do not consider this amount by any means sufficient.  I think the Government are also guilty of absolute neglect in this matter inasmuch as they give the same proportion of this grant to the farmer with 200, 400 or 1,000 <Col N="1738" /> acres, and the farmer who has nothing on his land but bullocks gets the same relief as the farmer who does his duty by the country and tills his land.  Anyone who looks into the figures during the past four or five years will find that tillage has been reduced by something like 187,000 acres.  Over 167,000 people have left the land since 1922.  I think that shows the manner in which those grants are being divided is a wrong one.  I think they should be made applicable to the farmer who tills a percentage of his land.</P>

I consider that it is very unfair that an individual with a large amount of land who is not doing his duty in regard to it should get the same proportion of the grant as a tillage farmer who employs labour and tills his land.  Even though the old agricultural grant has been doubled, I consider that this is only very small relief to the agricultural holder.  The farmers in England are relieved from all rates on agricultural land, and the farmers in the North of Ireland are getting the same relief.</P>

That, however, I suppose, will come up for discussion with Deputy Corry's motion.  There is one matter upon which I would like to get information from the Minister.  In the Midlands there are a number of holdings from which people have been evicted, owing to debts that they owe, and they are in the hands of emergency men.  In some cases the land annuities are not being paid, and out of this agricultural grant the annuities that have not been paid in a particular county are being stopped.  I want to know from the Minister, in connection with these holdings from which people are being evicted, principally by the banks for debt, and which are now in the hands of emergency men, whether the banks are held liable for the annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with what has been said by previous Deputies in connection with this grant.  It will, I think, be admitted by Deputies in all parts of the House, that this is an agricultural country.  That being so, one would naturally come to the conclusion that a much larger Vote than this would <Col N="1740" /> have been asked for.  In regard to the industrial side of this country, we have been asked to vote large sums in the way of subsidies for the Shannon scheme and other undertakings.  It may be quite all right to endeavour to improve industry, but I think that the House should also set its mind to trying to improve agriculture in a greater way than has been done up to the present. Reference has been made to the fact that certain relief from rates is about being granted to farmers in England, Scotland.  Wales and the North of Ireland.  That is one thing that I think the Minister for Agriculture should have taken into consideration in regard to this particular Vote.  As far as the markets for agriculture are concerned, we are asked to compete against foreign competitors, such, for instance, as Denmark.  We find that as regards Irish agricultural produce the competition from Denmark is a very big thing.  It is probable that it will be bigger in the future.  Owing to the de-rating systems proposed for England, Scotland, Wales and the North of Ireland, it is also probable that we will be faced with competition from the farmers in these countries as soon as that scheme is put into operation.  That being the position, I think that the Vote which we are now asked to pass should be much larger than what it is. I should just like to refer for the moment to what Deputy Corry said in regard to grants in connection with tillage land.  I think that the proportion of this grant given to farmers who cultivate their land should be far bigger than what it is at present.  I think it is most unfair that the farmers in Louth, Meath and Kildare, who hold fertile land that is not cultivated, should be getting the same proportion of relief under this grant as the tillage farmers of the country.</P>

      <P>There is just one other matter that I would like to refer to, and that is the question of land annuities.  It may be that I am not in order in referring to this matter now, but the position at the present time is that in the Co. Donegal, the constituency that I represent, there are a great many of the farmers who, through force of economic circumstances and through poverty, are unable to pay their land annuities.  Consequently, we find the Department of Agriculture deducting a certain amount from the agricultural grant that ordinarily would go to the relief of the rates in that county.  The result of that is that farmers who can ill afford it have to pay more than they should be paying in rates.  That is a matter that I think the Minister for Agriculture should give more consideration to.  I agree with previous Deputies in expressing regret that the Minister for Agriculture did not ask the House for a larger sum than that mentioned in the Estimate.  I think myself that the sum asked for is altogether inadequate, that is, if we want to improve agriculture in the country and especially amongst the small farmers.</P>

This Vote was brought before the Dáil in February last at a time when not a word was being said about de-rating in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  I suppose that Deputy Cassidy expects the Minister for Agriculture to be a prophet as well as the Minister for that Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to get rid of this Vote first before a Supplementary Estimate can be introduced.  The question is: where is the money to come from?  Everyone would be glad to relieve the farmers from rates, but is it any good to relieve the farmers <Col N="1742" /> from the payment of rates by increasing taxation?  In practice, there is nothing very noble or exalted in inviting the farmers of the country to put money into one of their pockets and take it out of the other.  It has often been said in this House that at least 75 per cent. of the taxes of this country are paid by the farmers.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but if anyone wants to get at the income tax and super-tax payers he will find that the number of them who are not farmers is very small indeed.  About eighteen months ago the Minister for Finance told me, in reply to a question, that the number of super-tax payers in this State was less than 500, so that in practice the suggestion to make a more benevolent gesture to the farmers of the country in order to relieve them of the payment of their rates simply means relieving them of their rates and putting more on them in the way of taxes.  In the case of the man with the big family, that will mean a greater hardship.  Rates are oppressive in regard to the size of a man's holding. Men have to buy boots and sugar for their children, and probably a little bit of jam if they can afford it.  If you increase the taxes on such a man, then you are going to hit him very severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has not got the purse of Fortunatus.  He cannot produce money without taking it from somebody's pocket.  There is no place that I know of where the Minister for Finance can get barrels of gold which he can shovel out to anyone who wants it.  The position is that if you increase the agricultural grant you must increase taxation.  The agricultural grant is a big sum at present, amounting to £600,000.  If you increase it to any substantial degree&mdash;some Deputies have suggested that it should be doubled&mdash;it will mean a very serious increase in taxation.  There is no use in our coming here and just talking as if the sum of £600,000 can be easily raised.  It might be possible, but I think it would be extremely difficult, to raise it by making economies.  I think it would be impossible to raise it without resorting to additional taxation.  If, as I am sure Deputy Cassidy would wish, it should be raised by additional income tax and super-tax, you would, I think, be running <Col N="1743" /> a very great risk of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.  I do not say that all super-tax payers are geese, but the danger exists.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Cooper is not quite right in saying that the Minister for Agriculture has no responsibility for this Vote.  I am sure that the Executive Council considered these various Votes before putting them before the Dáil.  I suppose that in the Executive Council the Minister for Agriculture has an equal vote with the Minister for Finance, and if he wished he could at least have exerted his influence in the Executive Council to get the Vote increased.  I think that Deputy Cooper said, with a lot of truth, that if the agricultural grant were increased it is the farmers themselves who would have to contribute the increase. There is no doubt about that. But, if we pursue that argument to its logical conclusion, we are not doing the farmer any service by passing this present Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Cooper, in the interests of the farmers, is going to vote against this, but I think he should if he is going to pursue his argument to a logical conclusion.  There is no doubt the farmers will reap a certain amount of benefit if this Vote is increased. If it is true they would have to contribute 75 per cent. of that increase themselves they would benefit to the extent of the other 25 per cent. There is no doubt that the farmers are at a very obvious disadvantage in paying rates on their land at present, seeing that land is their only means of income. If you take the secretary of a county council, or the secretary of a government department, or a man with a fairly decent salary of from £700 or £800 upwards, he is paying very little rates locally compared with the farmer, who has to pay rates on the land out of which he makes his living, as well as on his dwelling.  The government servant or the county council secretary, or other such person, is not paying local rates out of the <Col N="1744" /> instrument by which he lives.  He is paying rates only on his dwelling.  I think that is where the injustice comes in&mdash;making the farmers to pay what are very high rates on their land. Even though the farmers have been relieved to a certain extent by this agricultural grant, the rates have gone up a very considerable amount.  Taking the rates on land all over the country, I think they have gone up about 100 per cent., even with this agricultural grant, during the last ten years, while the price of their produce has gone up only 30 per cent.  In the case of civil servants and others the cost of living is taken into consideration by way of a bonus.  I understand that one of the items taken into account when calculating the cost-of-living bonus is the rents and rates they have to pay on the average.  Taking all these things into consideration, I think the farmer is not being treated as well as other members of the community as regards relief of rates.</P>

      <P>To my mind, most of the debate on this Vote so far is out of order.  I do not want to enter into an elaborate discussion of the points that have been raised, but I wish to make clear certain opinions which I hold.  I call the attention of Deputy Ryan to the fact that the opinions voiced by him now have been voiced and emphasised in the past in the Dáil by members of the Farmers' Party.  We claim that this Vote is on the Estimates to-day largely because of the efforts of the Farmers' Party.

      <P>I would like to call Deputy Ryan's attention to a debate in the Dáil in July, 1924, on a motion which was put down by Deputy Wilson and seconded by me, in reference to incidence of rating on agricultural land.  I think it will be found that the views I expressed then are almost in agreement with these expressed by <Col N="1745" /> the Deputy here.  I hold almost the same views as Deputy Ryan in regard to rating on agricultural land.  I believe the incidence of rating on agricultural land has been, and is still, unfair, but it has been relieved by this £600,000 which has been granted. I am of opinion that the whole question of agricultural land rating will have to receive very serious consideration by this Dáil in the future, but it is a complex and difficult problem, because already the effect of increasing grants to the local bodies has been, to a certain extent, to take away responsibility from those bodies.  Those bodies have not the responsibility of finding the money which they have to spend.  The more we increase the grant from the national exchequer, the more we take away responsibility from those bodies.  They will have no responsibility with regard to the collection of the money they spend.  I find that the sense of responsibility in that connection getting less and less day after day, and I am driven to the belief that if agricultural rates are to be reduced, and rates in general are to be reduced, it will not be done by the efforts of local bodies.  I think the whole question of rates on agricultural land will have to be considered.  I hold the opinion, as opposed to the opinion of Deputy Cooper, that although in the final issue to a very large extent the farmers have to bear a great proportion of the taxation, or rating, I hold that if you de-rate the land and impose taxation on the general taxpayer, at least a portion of that will stick with him, and you will relieve agriculturists to a certain extent.  I do not want to elaborate these arguments at this stage, as I do not consider this is a right time to discuss the subject.  It is, however, a very important question and will have to be discussed by the Dáil on a later occasion and a decision taken upon it.</P>

      <P>I think it is mean of the Government that this grant for the farmers should be so small considering that the farmers contribute 75 per cent. of the taxation of the country. £600,000 is only a very small portion of the enormous sum raised in taxation and to which they contribute so heavily <Col N="1746" /> for the upkeep of this country.  Surely economies could be effected so as to enable a larger grant than that to be given?  It is absolutely nonsense to be talking about putting money in one of the pockets of the farmer and taking it out of another of his pockets.  In the case of the farmer, you will not find a second pocket in the few duds he has to be putting money in and taking out in the way suggested.</P>

      <P>I think the discussion that has taken place would, to a large extent, be more appropriate in discussing Budget proposals.  A discussion of that kind is too late now, and altogether out of place, as the question does not arise.  It is quite apparent that this is not a Vote for the improvement of agriculture, and it should be that if we were to have this discussion on it.  It is certainly a Vote for the relief of the agricultural community, but there is no question of improvement under the Vote.  The claims that have been made for farmers who till their land are the funniest that I have ever heard made.  These claims are based on the assumption, I suppose, that farmers till their farms in a certain way not for their own benefit, but from a philanthropic point of view and for the good of the nation, and because of that the nation should rush to their assistance, it is suggested, and give them grants.  It savours too much of the nursery altogether.  As I said, this is not a proper time for the sort of discussion that has taken place.</P>

I think in the very near future we will be faced with the idea, following the same course, and also in the near future the adoption of an alternative means for financing the State. Criticism has been made by Deputies and by people outside about the amount of rates, regardless of the fact that the whole local rate and its administration are attributable altogether <Col N="1747" /> to the local representatives.  If local rating is high nobody can be blamed except the local representatives, who began the down grade a great many years ago, and are giving continually increasing services.  I have never yet known a proposal to be defeated at any public board in the country, even for a rise of salary to a doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is largely governed by legislation.  The amount was fixed by statute and it was provided by statute that the allocation of this additional grant was to be made on the same basis as the original grant was allocated to the various counties, so that really I think nothing properly arises for discussion here except the contention that the sum ought to be larger.  I suppose that is in order.  It has been dealt with to some extent.  A very substantial proportion of any amount added to the agricultural grant must come out of the pockets of the farmers.  Furthermore, if it were raised, as it would have to be raised in total by additional taxation, there would be extra charges of collection, and extra charges would arise, particularly the extra cost to the community in the case of Customs duties, because if a Customs duty is levied for revenue purposes a certain sum is collected by the State.  It may be 2/- a lb. on some commodity.  That means that the commodity costs the retailer or wholesaler here 2/- a lb. more than it otherwise would have done.  The retailer or wholesaler takes his profit on the original price plus 2/- a lb., so that a substantial additional sum is taken from the public beyond what the Exchequer gets.  That is a matter that has to be taken into account.  Another factor must be taken into account in connection with any proposals for a large increase in the agricultural grant.  I do not want to discuss proposals such as de-rating proposals, because they are not before the House. but they have been mentioned, and I would just say this, that that would be a very different proposition here as <Col N="1748" /> compared with a neighbouring country.  The total proportion of agricultural land to the total valuation in England is less than 2½ per cent.  The proportion here is 65 per cent.  Proposals for de-rating of agricultural land here would mean that certain county councils, for instance, would derive about 90 per cent. of their revenue from the Exchequer, so that de-rating proposals such as were mentioned would practically involve in the Free State an entire recasting or complete abolition of local government.  It is a very big matter, and we cannot discuss it now, but I think it is one that will have to be dealt with by the Dáil, if the House desires to discuss it on some other occasion.  I would only say that, so far as this Vote is concerned, it has simply nothing to do with it.  It is presented in pursuance of the statute, and the grant will be distributed in the method laid down.  There is not a great deal of room to further discuss the matter in detail.</P>

But, beyond simply appointing a person, the Government has not intervened in any way in the work of the theatre.  It has not given any directions to its representative, and it does not require any report from him. He is there, and a report could be obtained if it were necessary.  But the Government had no desire to intervene in such questions as what plays should be put on or what plays should be rejected, what actors and actresses should be employed, or any matters of that kind.</P>

There is a great desire on the part of many schools to get special facilities for the admission of children on certain occasions and on certain days, and if in exchange for that grant from the State the Minister could see his way to get some facilities for the children of certain schools it would be a good thing.</P>

But I would not like to try to make it a condition of the grant, because there is no doubt that the Society labours under difficulties.  In the past they were able to interest people like officers in the British Army, who had the means of procuring them gifts of animals of various kinds from abroad. They have not got the same opportunities now.  Dublin is not a port to which overseas ships come as they come to other ports.  Whereas in Liverpool, if there is a zoo there, and certainly in London, animals can be obtained very cheaply.  Everything that the Dublin Zoo purchases has to be transported over.  They have a great many difficulties to contend with, and, while I would be ready to make representations to them, I would not like to make conditions.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to make any provision under this head for societies having a cultural object, and societies which give the results of their work to the public at considerable expense and which are at a loss from year to year?  I refer to such societies as the Cork Shakespearian Society, the Dramatic Society, and <Col N="1752" /> another very useful institution, the Operatic Society of Cork.  These are educational and cultural institutions.  I know these things are not very much appreciated by some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, but I know they are doing a good deal of educational work.  I suppose that not even Fianna Fáil Deputies will disagree with me when I say that there is much educational and much cultural benefit to be obtained from the works of Shakespeare.  These societies have been working under great difficulties for very many years.  They have produced some very fine plays and have staged some very fine operas, and they have done so at considerable loss to themselves.  They have aroused considerable interest in literary and cultural circles, and I would ask the Minister, when making up his next Estimate, to arrange to give them some assistance. I do not care whether these societies are located in Cork or in Dublin, but anything that will have a cultural effect on our people will have my full support, and I am sure it will have the support of a good many other Deputies.</P>
      <P>I think it is about time for us to devote a little of our national revenue to such institutions as I have indicated. I suppose nobody will disagree with me when I say that we have now perhaps left a good deal of the turmoil and political heat and trouble behind us, and if the Minister could see his way to arrange in his forthcoming Budget for a subsidy for these societies, even if it were only in the form of relief from the payment of tax, it would be very much appreciated by the societies that I have in view.  I do not care whether these societies are in Connemara, Cork, Dublin or Drimoleague.  It is all the same to me.  I think that much of this side of our social life has been steadily neglected.  I know that there were disturbing elements for many years that contributed to that state of affairs, but now these things have been left behind us, and we might have some indication under this head at least of some inclination to help the societies which I have mentioned.  As I said, they have done some very useful work, and I suggest that the Minister should consider them in his next Budget.</P>

      <P>The Academy has been receiving grants since 1800.  I could not undertake to go over its work for the Deputy in any sort of detail, because I am not sufficiently familiar with it.  But in the first place it is certainly the principal learned society in the country.  Papers on all sorts of scientific topics and scholarly questions are read before it and printed in its journals, and I believe it is the only way in which a scientific man or a scholar working in this country can readily get his work to the notice of students and scientists abroad.  It is a society which enjoys a high reputation in that respect.  It is at present doing very important work in connection with the Irish language.  A great dictionary of the Irish language is being prepared by the society, and a number of people have been working on the production of that dictionary for a considerable number of years.</P>

      <P>I know that a good deal of work has been done in recent years.  I happened to be in the Academy once, and I was shown evidence of a great deal of work done in recent years.  I think three competent people, with a very scholarly knowledge of Irish, have been working there constantly, under the direction of one of the greatest Irish scholars that we have.  That work is being done.  The society has lately undertaken the production and publication of photographic facsimiles of important Irish texts.  It is also now getting photographic facsimiles of important Irish texts that are not in this country.  Of course it has a priceless collection of Irish manuscripts.  There are in the Bodleian Library, the British Museum, <Col N="1754" /> and in libraries on the Continent other Irish texts, and photographic facsimiles of these are being obtained.  The Academy has now a scheme in operation to secure photographic facsimiles of all Irish manuscripts outside the country so that it will be possible for the students coming in there to have the whole treasury of Irish manuscripts available for study.  A good deal of money is being spent by the Academy on its library.  The present grant was fixed about two years ago or so.  Up to that, since the year 1800, the amount had been fixed at £1,600.  That grant was insufficient, with the necessary expenses of the society, to enable it to keep its library in condition.  Many thousands of volumes had become dilapidated and required rebinding. But the Society was unable to do anything in that way, owing to the smallness of the grant and to the fact that owing to the war this grant could not be increased.  The result was, what was a great national possession was being lost.  The whole of the money is being spent on that work just at the present time.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £115,500 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for payment of Subsidy in respect of Beet Sugar (No. 37 of 1925).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount of £274,000 provided in this year's estimate contains a sum of £8,399 required to discharge outstanding claims for the last year. The estimate is based on the assumption that the sugar production for the present year will amount to 17,500 tons. The amount of sugar produced last <Col N="1755" /> year was 18,071 tons.  The agreement with the factory provides that over a ten years' period a subsidy will be paid on a total of 125,000 tons.  No limit was placed on the amount on which a subsidy might be given during the first three years.  The reason was that it was feared that the factory might not be able to obtain any substantial acreage of beet in the first year and they wanted to allow them to make up the average by taking larger quantities in the next two years.  It turns out, however, that a very large acreage was grown in the first year.  However, the quantity of sugar for which a subsidy can be paid next year will be 10,000 tons.  Then in the remaining years it will have to be on such an amount or proportion of the 125,000 tons as remains.  The joint subsidy and remission of duty&mdash;I am including both&mdash; amount to 24/6 a cwt. for the first three years; 22/6 for the next five years, and 22/- for the last two years of the period.  The total amount of subsidy to be paid will be something greater by reason of the fact that a very large proportion of the total of 125,000 tons have not been spread evenly over the ten years, and that a greater proportion has been manufactured in the first three years and has received duty at the higher rate.</P>

I would be glad if the Minister would give us any explanation of that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think differently myself.  I think the accounting year ends on the 30th June.  The Act provides that within 90 days the accounts must be presented to the Minister and within one month after that to the Dáil. That expires on the 28th October or <Col N="1756" /> thereabouts.  The fact is, in any case, that in consequence of our not having access to these accounts we are not in a position to possess any information concerning the progress of the experiment. The only information we have got concerning it is that which appeared in the report which appeared in the daily Press a couple of months ago. That, on the face of it, appeared to be somewhat inaccurate.  We do know, however, that the total amount of the estimated subsidy this year is £274,000, payable upon the estimated output of 17,500 tons of sugar.  The amount produced last year, apparently, was considerably in excess of what it was originally estimated that it would be, because, as the Deputies will remember, the original estimate had to be increased by a supplementary estimate for a very considerable sum later in the financial year.  We are now informed that portion of this £274,000 represents the amount required to discharge liabilities in respect of last year's subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance sheet and profit and loss account of the Company for the year which ended in June, 1927, showed that since its inauguration to that date the Company made a profit of £114,000, after paying off all manufacturing and selling expenses.  That enabled them to clear of all the foundation expenses, allocating £40,000 to depreciation of plant and machinery, which originally cost, or is alleged to have cost, £382,000. I use the term &ldquo;alleged to have cost&rdquo; deliberately, because a gentleman of my acquaintance who was interested in this experiment thought that there was something peculiar about that figure, and he took the trouble to write to a number of firms on the Continent who specialised in the production of this class of machinery and he asked them to submit to him estimates for the production of a factory and plant with an annual output of 17,500 tons of sugar. He received seven or eight estimates, and the highest of them did not exceed £200,000.  It appears, therefore, that there is something peculiar about this item of £382,000 that is given there. However, that is only a side issue.  We know that in the year ended June, 1927, £40,000 was allocated to meet depreciation, in addition to a sum of <Col N="1757" /> £4,000 which was paid in salaries to the directors, and in addition to a dividend of 10 per cent. paid to the shareholders. We ascertain from a report appearing in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; on the 24th September last that the Company had even a much more prosperous year's trading than they had in the period ending June, 1927.  That period was for much longer than twelve months, and during that period the Company made a profit of £114,000.  In the last year that profit had increased to £117,000.  Taking credit for the subsidy and the charge on manufacture and selling expenses, including directors' remuneration and after providing for depreciation of premises and plant and making provision for income tax and corporation profits tax, they had £117,000.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say &ldquo;from which had been deducted outlay on premises and plant written off, £24,014; Reserve Fund, £25,000, leaving a balance of £68,096, to which a certain amount was brought forward from the previous year, £336, and it was recommended that that should be applied as follows, that is, the payment of a dividend of 15 per cent. free of income tax for the year.&rdquo;  There appears to be some inaccuracy in this report, and I was very anxious to check it with the balance sheet and the profit and loss account which is due for presentation to the Dáil.  It states that the £117,000 was arrived at after providing for depreciation of premises and plant.  The report says that there has been deducted from the £117,000 the cost of outlay on premises and plant written off.  I do not quite understand the distinction.  We can see, however, that the directors and shareholders of the company have benefited very considerably by their association with it during last year. They have already received a dividend of 10 per cent., and last year a dividend of 15 per cent., making a total of 25 per cent.  In addition they have written off nearly 20 per cent. of the original cost of the plant and machinery.  They have also added a considerable amount to the Reserve Fund.  It was obvious, of course, that this year a greater portion of the gross profit would go in dividends because <Col N="1758" /> the amount available for that purpose in the previous year was reduced by the discharge of the foundation costs.</P>
    <P>The facts available, however, do indicate that this whole experiment in the manufacture of sugar from sugar beet in this country has proved to be a very clear indication of the gullibility of the Executive Council.  They have provided a subsidy which in effect gives to that factory supplies of sugar beet free and in addition 15/- per ton of beet with which to manufacture it into sugar.  Their over-generosity in this matter has, I maintain, utterly destroyed the value of the whole scheme as an experiment.  After the expenditure of some £700,000 or £800,000 we are no wiser to-day than before the experiment started as to whether or not the manufacture of sugar in this country from beet grown in the country is a commercial proposition and should be encouraged.  If the Executive Council think that that statement is incorrect, that they have been able to learn from the experiment, we would be very glad if they would tell us what they have learned.  From a careful examination of the facts available we have been able to learn nothing. We have learned that the foreign owners of this factory who succeeded in inducing the Ministry to put up this subsidy have made a very good thing out of it and have no reason to regret their action in embarking on this undertaking.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is, I think, likely to result in a set-back rather than an advancement in the manufacture of sugar in this country.  We believe that a much smaller subsidy would have produced similar results and would have enabled the experiment to be proceeded with if necessary for a longer time or on a wider basis.  It is quite obvious, I think, that the result of the giving of a subsidy at this rate and in this manner to this company has made it practically impossible for the Government even to consider any proposition for the establishment of a similar factory in any other part of the country.  We know that this factory cannot produce more than one-seventh or one-eighth of the country's sugar requirements.  There is room, if sugar can be made economically, for six or seven similar factories <Col N="1759" /> here.  But if they are to cost us what this factory has cost us, it is out of the question, and the granting of the subsidy in this manner and in this size has created a situation in which it is extremely unlikely that anyone else would contemplate the starting of another factory here unless guaranteed a similar subsidy while this factory is in existence.  It does mean that for ten years the only sugar beet factory in this country will be the one at Carlow, and at the end of ten years it is extremely doubtful if that factory will continue. We will be in exactly the same position with regard to the manufacture of sugar as we were before the Carlow factory was started at all.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as maintaining that the experiment should never have been embarked upon.  It should.  We believe it is possible to grow beet and manufacture it into sugar in this country on a different basis to what is now being done, and to do it economically.  We believe it was the duty of the Government to have undertaken that experiment and to have provided the funds which would have been required to make that experiment possible.  I know that a number of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies who are not here now and who never attend when debates are taking place will be very glad to take advantage of our attitude in relation to this Vote and will represent us as being opposed to the establishment of the factory.  We are not, but we say that the whole business in regard to the Government's share of it has been badly mismanaged and badly bungled, and the farmers of the country who have become engaged in it, or any other person who has been connected with it other than the foreign owners of the factory, will realise that the Government did not act in their best interests, and the only people making a profit are the members of the firm who actually own the factory and who are receiving the subsidy. The country as a whole is not going to benefit, and because of that we think it our duty to oppose the Vote, and in that manner to give an indication of our disapproval of the whole proceeding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask <Col N="1760" /> the Minister whether the position with regard to the bye-products of the factory is the same as when the factory began to work, or if there has been any change.  I understand that at the beginning of the working of the factory a proportion of the bye-products did not find a ready market here and had to be exported.  Since then I believe there has been a change, that the people are beginning to realise that the pulp is a suitable feeding stuff and that it is being bought freely.  I understand also that when a certain amount of this feeding stuff was being exported a lower price was charged for the amount that was exported than was charged to the people in this country.  The view I take in the matter is that, on account of the heavy subsidy which the State gives to the undertaking it could reasonably be assumed that the bye-products used as feeding stuffs could also be classed as being to a certain extent subsidised. I was wondering if the Minister would say whether, if that were the case, that it would be more reasonable to subsidise the farmers at home rather than those abroad, who use it when it is exported, and that a definite retail price should be fixed for the consumers all over the country, so that when the demand increases, and there is an outlet for all the factory can produce, the factory will not be allowed to make an extra profit by getting a higher price for the feeding stuff from the farmers.  I cannot give any amount or percentages, but perhaps the Minister could give some information on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated that because of the subsidy the value of this experiment will be lost.  I cannot follow the reasoning of Deputy Lemass.  The experience of the growers cannot be lost.  The method of cultivation and all the rest cannot be lost.  The balance sheet may be questioned.  It is quite possible&mdash;Deputy Lemass knows more about it than I do&mdash;that no balance sheet discloses the actual position.  He is a business man and can tell us that. This balance sheet produced last year may be somewhat similar, but surely the balance sheet must be a guide as to whether beet can be grown in this country as an economic proposition.  It is only a question of figures.  You will <Col N="1761" /> have the figures with regard to the experiment and you will have the experience of the growers.</P>
      <P>There is a matter in connection with this which is of much more importance to me, and that is, that the contract between the growers and the factory, which was made for three years, expired this season, and that a new contract will have to be entered into in the coming season.  I do not want to interfere between one and the other, but I know that the growers are anxious to have the matter brought to a head before the ground and everything else is prepared for next year's crop, so that people may make up their minds what they are going to do.  The growers want to know where they are. I do not know what has taken place in the last four or five days, but up to that time nothing had been definitely settled.  In fact, I do not think the parties have met, although the growers are anxious to meet the factory representatives.</P>
      <P>With regard to the subsidy, I think, roughly, 10,000 tons, or something less, were grown the first year.  Last year 17,000 were grown, and this year it will be about the same, making in all about 44,000.  For the next two years that 17,000 is to be reduced to 10,000. That will work out at 64,000 for five years, leaving 61,000 out of the 125,000 for the remaining five years.  I know that some growers, and I think it is the opinion of the whole Association, think that the reduction from 17,000 last year and this year to 10,000 next year is too great.  Of course, there may be reasons for that from the other people's point of view, but we have not been able to find out.  However, that is the position, and we would like to have their point of view.  It may be that they can justify it, and it may be that the growers' point of view can be justified. At any rate, we think that a reduction from 17,000 to 10,000 is too much.  The remaining 61,000 is to be distributed over the following five years, which would give an average of a little over 12,000 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the feeding stuffs, the Minister can speak with authority, but I know that in the first season there was great difficulty in getting a home market for the pulp owing to the condition in <Col N="1762" /> which it was being sold.  Most of it was sold as wet pulp.  Last year a great improvement was made in the treatment of it, and instead of ordinary dry pulp we had sugar pulp for which a market was found at home.  This year I hope I am right in saying that the full supply of the factory is booked for home use.  In fact, I do not think they will be able to meet the demand for it, unless the question of price arises.  If it is sold at a reasonable price, the whole output of sugar pulp next year will be taken up at home.  The statement that the experiment has been lost is not true in any particular, and cannot be true, and the amount of the subsidy does not affect us one way or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what the pulp will be sold at this year.  An agent told me that it would be sold at £8 per ton as against £4 last year.  Seeing that the subsidy is to be the same, and that the other conditions are the same, and considering the profit that the firm is making, I do not think it is fair that they should raise the price of pulp from £4 to £8 on the farmers.  I do not know whether the Minister has any power to interfere, but I got that quotation from an agent yesterday.</P>

      <P>I understood that the price of sugar pulp this year was fixed at about £5 per ton&mdash;I did not hear it officially.  Last year the price was £4.  Of course the subsidy is a large one, but I think it has justified itself, inasmuch as in the area where beet is cultivated it has been a regular gold mine to the farmers to a certain extent for the last few years.  It has been the saving of quite a number of them.  Owing to the price which could be got for grain in the last few years, the beet crop was a great aid and assistance to them.  I know a good many farmers who have done very well out of it&mdash;in fact every one of them. Apart from that, I am sure Deputy <Col N="1763" /> Ryan will agree that the by-products from the beet are very valuable for feeding.  The pulp will certainly mean a great saving to the country in connection with the importation of concentrated foods, as the farmers will have the by-products to feed young stock.  They are also very good for milch cows.</P>
      <P>There are about ten tons to the statute acre of tops alone and these are very good manure.  Apart from that, when you cultivate for beet the land gets more manure and by the fact of having to plough deeper the sub-soil is manured and the corn crop which follows after the beet crop is increased by 35 per cent.  The hay crop is increased by 30 per cent. as a result of having put in beet the first year, corn the following year and hay the third year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think when we consider the amount paid in wages to the agricultural labourers, the amount of limestone that is quarried&mdash;5,000 or 6,000 tons&mdash;the amount paid to the railways in freights, the amount spent on sack manufacture and the six or seven hundred people employed during the season at the factory, it means quite a lot of money.  If we had not the sugar factory in that area there would be a different tale to tell.  Even though two million seems a big subsidy, and the factory is doing well out of it, I think we cannot grumble and I think we ought to be content.  Possibly, if we were starting another factory to-day we would not give such large subsidies.  I agree with Deputy Gorey that the factory has had a good innings in the past three years, and I think they should be fair to the growers now.  They should be content with their subsidy.  Of course, I do not want to interfere between the factory and the Government, but I think it is held by the growers that this year a fair price should be given for the beet. The first year beet was grown it was a very good crop.  I understand it was as good as any grown in Belgium, and that the sugar content was very high. The next year it was not so good and the sugar content fell, and a good many farmers dropped out of it altogether. If they reduced the price this year by any considerable figure a good many <Col N="1764" /> state they would not grow beet, and I desire to impress that point upon the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question that we on these benches are interested in, and upon which we would be glad to get some information from the Minister.  Reports have appeared in the papers that some research school in Oxford has discovered a method of drying the beet so that the industry could be made an all-the-year-round industry, and that the beet need not be used immediately that it is taken from the ground.  Obviously that is a very important matter, and I am sure the Government are watching it with great interest.  We will be glad to know if the Minister has any information as to whether that discovery has proved to be a success.</P>
      <P>One other point in connection with the use of the by-product.  I have heard complaints from beet growers that it seemed to be the policy of the company in Carlow to discourage the use of pulp by the growers.  Growers who applied for the pulp very rarely got what they called prompt attention, and I have heard some complaints somewhat like this: When the pulp was sent out the bags were invoiced at something like tenpence each, but when these bags were returned they were only allowed fourpence upon each.  Although the bag was uninjured in the transport of the pulp there was as much as sixpence charged for the use of it by the grower. However, I only mention that matter. If that be an indication that the factory does not want the growers to use the pulp it would be rather regrettable.  I know that a very big grower and a man who acted as agent for the company in his district was very much annoyed with the treatment he got when endeavouring to get pulp from the factory. He personally made that complaint as to little things like that being used to discourage him from using the pulp.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in support of what has been said from the Government Benches, and in support of the idea that the Government should endeavour to maintain as high an average as possible in the growing of beet.  The last time I spoke on this <Col N="1765" /> matter I went fully into the accounts. I suggested to the House that if the opportunity came the Government should endeavour to rearrange its contract with the Sugar Beet Company so as to enable the subsidy to be paid on a sliding scale.  At the present time the acreage is going to fall.  The beet growers, as I pointed out last year, have no prospect before them, and, at the same time, as Deputy Lemass has pointed out, the factory is piling up huge profits.  According to the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; report, their profit last year was something like £93,000 odd.  I do not know whether that is correct or not. In any case, it was undoubtedly much greater last year than for the opening period of the year and a half before. I think, therefore, something ought to be done by the Government to influence the directors of the factory to reduce their profits somewhat, and try and take a step forward themselves and not to be coming here asking the taxpayer to increase the subsidy, which I agree it would be very difficult to do, but to endeavour to reduce their profit or to seek some other outlet for their activities, such as perhaps the building of a sugar refinery.</P>
      <P>The Government, I am sure, are following the trend of events in England, and there is no doubt that when the period of the subsidy comes to an end the beet growers will be found to be in a very serious situation.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider the appeal made by Deputy Gorey and to endeavour to treat the growers as fairly as possible.  One of the things that makes me feel that the company are having too much of their own way in this matter is that I understand they have actually tried to decrease the wages of the workers of the factory. There is a high standard of wages paid in Carlow, and why not?  If, as Deputy Aird contends in somewhat exaggerated terms, the farmers have found a gold mine in the factory, there is no reason why the labourers should not be well paid also.  But if the company are looking round to reduce the workers' wages, or to reduce the acreage, as they are bound to do, we must only look to the Government and try to influence the company to keep up production as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I think the statement of Deputy Aird, that the farmers have found a gold mine, should not be allowed to go unchallenged.  It seemed as if he were speaking on behalf of the factory, trying to get the beet cheaper.  My experience is that the farmers have not found a gold mine in this factory within the last two or three years.  If the subsidy is reduced and the price reduced in the coming year there will be very few growers left at all.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Lemass himself will recognise that the type of speech he made is easy to make and is not helpful really in any way, because the position, as we look at it now, differs from the position as we had to look at it.  When we were trying to get the sugar beet factory started we sent people to the Continent to interview various firms and individuals interested in the manufacture of sugar from beet, to ask them would they consider undertaking the establishment of a sugar beet factory in Ireland.  Various people were interviewed.  Three large groups were interested.  One, a French group, sent representatives to the country, but finally refused to make any offer.  Two groups, a Dutch and a Belgian group, made an offer.  We had discussions with them, and finally a representative of the Belgian group with whom we were discussing the matter said: &ldquo;We are prepared to set up a factory here if the following rates of subsidy are paid.&rdquo;  His offer was more advantageous than the Dutch offer.  The Dutch firm which made the offer has a great many factories in England.  We had either to decide to have a factory at a subsidy which people who would start it would take, or decide to have no factory.  If we waited five years we might have been able to get the factory set up at a cheaper rate, or might not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we compare the rate of subsidy being paid for sugar produced in this factory with the rate paid for sugar beet in the two pioneer factories in England for the first ten-year period, we find the difference is only 6d. per hundredweight.  For the two first years <Col N="1767" /> of the ten years of the two pioneer factories the rate worked out at 22/6 per hundredweight.  For the pioneer factory in the Saorstát the rate worked out at 23/- per hundredweight.  If we leave out these two pioneer factories which, for two years, got a subsidy at a higher rate, and take the ordinary ten-years' scale, we find that the average rate works out at 19/9 in England, as compared with 23/- in the Saorstát. The people with whom we discussed this matter had reasons that seemed to be sound for holding out for a higher rate here than in England.  What difference would have been justified is a matter we cannot determine and, at any rate, it is immaterial now.  The real position was, we were offered the rate.  They agreed to set up a factory here at a rate of subsidy that was not substantially different from the rate that had to be paid by the ordinary factories in England, and that was not very widely different from the rate paid the first ten years for other factories in Great Britain.  The Belgian group that agreed to set up the factory, as a matter of fact, were full of doubts themselves, and at one stage had actually to be persuaded to go on.  We know that there had been stormy and disturbed conditions in the country. They were afraid of all sorts of organisations against them.  They were afraid that in various ways their task would be much more difficult than it was in Great Britain.  As I say there was a period of a month or two during which we were very much afraid that we should not have the factory set up at all.</P>
    <P>The difficulties these people anticipated did not materialise.  The difficulty people outside anticipated did not materialise.  Although no prospectus was issued and no public appeal made for capital here, a great many inquiries were made.  There was a great deal of private solicitation, and the result was that practically no capital was obtainable here.  It may be that there were people who would put up some small amount of capital if a prospectus were issued and a public appeal made, but, on the other hand, a great lot of people who would put up capital for any sort of enterprise normally <Col N="1768" /> were approached by private people. Money was not obtainable from amongst people whom one would expect to invest, as there was no great confidence in this great enterprise.  The enterprise has succeeded.  There have been no strikes and no ill-behaviour on the part of any section of the community. The farmers, instead of holding back growing beet for a year or so, have grown a big acreage for the first year and as big an acreage as the factory can cope with in the second year. The company is undoubtedly making very big profits, but there is no reason really why we should grudge them the profits.  They took the risk.  The fact that the profits are big in no way impairs the experiment.  We can deduce from the profits and other facts shown in the accounts what money there is in sugar beet.  We can deduce as well from the results of the operation here what can be done in future, and whether that industry can be carried on without a subsidy or with some reasonable subsidy as if the profits of the factory were not small.  Because the profit is big, the factories well-equipped and run on modern lines, we are better able to get at the facts as if we had a small factory, badly run, badly equipped, and making much smaller profits.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies said that if we were setting up another factory now we would not pay as large a subsidy.  Of course, we would not.  Apart from the difficulties which exist, because the revenue position has difficulties, we would not consider anything like the present rate of subsidy to a second factory, and the Deputy is entirely wrong in saying that no one else would set up a factory if he did not get the same rate of subsidy as the Carlow factory.  If the Carlow factory are making huge profits, there are some people prepared to put up with smaller profits who would be prepared, at a profitable rate of subsidy, to set up a factory.  As a matter of fact, the bigger profits are in Carlow the more likely it is that other people will be prepared to set up a sugar factory at a very much less subsidy. If the Carlow people mismanaged and made small profits, other people would say, &ldquo;We cannot carry on at a less rate of subsidy than Carlow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> The outlook which really grudges the profits made by the Carlow Company and which complains about them is not an attitude which helps the manufacture of sugar beet.  By the end of this year when we have the accounts for the factory we will have sufficient information about the matter to know what would be a reasonable subsidy to pay to a second, third, or fourth factory.  Having that information and knowing what the entire cost of the taxpayer will be, we will be in a position to determine whether, for the sake of having a second, third or fourth factory, it will be proper to add a particular sum to the Estimate or have taxation lowered and not have additional factories.  While we recognise that this experiment is very costly to the community we are entirely satisfied with it.  It will demonstrate to us whether sugar beet is really an industry which could be established here. I may be wrong, as we have very little information to go on, but I doubt whether the beet industry can ever be carried on entirely without a subsidy. I think, however, as there are so many benefits attaching to the existence of the industry, to some of which Deputy Aird referred, that it would be always a good thing to pay a certain moderate rate of subsidy.  I do not want to indicate a figure for what I would say is a moderate rate, but, after a year or two more, most of us will know more about the industry and be able to gather information, and would be able to say whether it is worth paying a permanent subsidy of 2/6, 5/-, 7/6 or 10/- a cwt., and thus we will be able to say that it is worth paying so much.</P>
    <P>Having arrived at the figure which it will be fair to take from the taxpayer for the sake of keeping the industry in existence, we will be able to go into the accounts of the company and will be able to ascertain whether a reasonable return on capital can be obtained from a sugar beet factory at that rate of subsidy while, at the same time, paying wages to the workers which would keep them in a reasonable state of contentment and also inducing farmers to grow a sufficient acreage of beet.  The experiment undertaken in Carlow will give us <Col N="1770" /> good grounds for determining what our future attitude is going to be in regard to this most valuable industry because, though we all may differ about the method by which it would be done, we all desire to keep up and increase, if possible, the tillage acreage in the country.  This is an industry which, if it can be established and more widely spread, will tend substantially in that direction.  It also has the advantage that it gives a not inconsiderable amount of employment at a time when employment is apt to be scarce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked about by-products. I understand that last year and certainly for the year on which we are entering, all or practically all the by-products will be used at home and that there will be no necessity to export any of them.  I could not give Deputy Doctor Ryan any information as to the price at which pulp is being sold.  I do not think it would be desirable that we should interfere in that matter.  The price of pulp will, and should, properly be regulated by the price of other foodstuffs, and the factory should be quite free to sell it at a price which it can obtain and at the price which it is worth to the farmer who buys it.  Deputy Moore asked about the Oxford method of extracting sugar from beet.  I do not know that it has yet been shown to be a commercial success, but if it is shown, and if it does what is claimed for it, undoubtedly we will face up to a new situation in regard to sugar-beet.  It may be that in those circumstances there would never be any question of having five or six factories and a new method of organisation would have to be adopted.  I do not think, however, that we have reached that stage yet.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies referred to the price paid to the farmers and to the possibility of decreasing the acreage, and it was suggested that the Government should ask the directors of the factory to take such steps as would maintain the acreage at the present level.  The growers of beet have an association.  I think most of them are members of it, and they have a committee and spokesmen to represent them, and, really, the business between <Col N="1771" /> the factory and the beet growers should be allowed to be conducted in the way that business is ordinarily conducted, so that the representatives of the beet growers should meet the representatives of the manufacturing company and make their bargain. Somebody said that the factory must decrease the area under beet and must decrease the quantity of beet which it would take.  That is not so.  It will only be paid a subsidy on 10,000 tons of sugar, but it may decide to make 20,000 tons, and it is a matter for the beet growers and the Company to thresh out when deciding the price.  The beet growers may say: &ldquo;We will accept such and such a price if you are going to manufacture 20,000 tons, but we will have another price if you are only going to manufacture 10,000 or 12,000 tons.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I stated in the beginning that we fixed a total limit of 125,000 tons as the quantity on which a subsidy would be paid, but that, so far as the first three years were concerned, no limit was to be fixed.  Consequently so far as these three years are concerned the factory was entitled under contract to be paid a subsidy on all sugar manufactured, and for that reason a Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister for Finance in what is really the complaint behind his defence, that it is very easy to be wise after the event, but the miscalculation has been so extreme&mdash;I am judging after the event&mdash;that it seems to me that those who had the making of this contract at the time ought to <Col N="1772" /> have had more knowledge and ought to have been capable of making a better estimation.  If, for instance, you were going to give a subsidy which amounted to somewhere about £3,000,000, and if, in order to do that, it was necessary for someone to put one-tenth of that amount, namely, £300,000, and if&mdash;this is a very big if&mdash;that money could not or some substantial portion of it could not, have been got by private subscriptions in the country, it does seem to me to be an obviously reasonable thing, unless they were inhibited in some way from doing it, that the Government themselves should have found some of the ordinary capital which they thought it was quite reasonable for the ordinary public to find.  That no real effective effort was made to get that capital, my own case is an illustration. I would have invested in that factory not to a very considerable extent.  The figure which was in my mind was £1,000.  I am not suggesting that it was a very large one, but the opinion that I expressed in relation to that concern when it came out, and when I, without that intimate knowledge which the Minister for Finance and his advisers would have had, was that it did seem to be a very good thing indeed for its shareholders, but I could not see it on the figures then put as a good thing for the community.  I suggest that that effort was not made.  For instance, I was personally acquainted with certain directors, and I did not even get an application or a suggestion to subscribe capital in that company.  It is pretty obvious that no real effort was made. If that is so I cannot understand, having regard to the fact that State money to the extent of about £3,000,000 was going to be involved in the payment of the subsidy, that the State itself should have hesitated to find, if it was allowed to do so, say, one-half of the ordinary capital of that company. If they had a half or more than a half of the ordinary capital of that company, the question of whether or not this scheme was sound or not would have been relatively unimportant, because if they were losing they were not going to lose so much, and if the fact that the subsidy which they had given was of such a character as to make it very, very difficult indeed to start side <Col N="1773" /> by side with it a company of another character, the Government themselves, as ordinary shareholders, would have been in a very influential position indeed to come to an arrangement, if it was a question of whether or not the actual amount that was being paid for the sugar beet was too small or too great: the fact that they had a considerable shareholding in it would have enabled them to have influence in the matter.</P>
      <P>The second thing that I never understood was why&mdash;I may be entirely wrong about this, but I am giving what I read in the debates in this House&mdash;when the actual capacity of the plant was increased over and above its originally contemplated size that there was a relative increase of the subsidy.  I speak with considerable sympathy for the Minister for Finance.  I believe that they are deserving of credit to the extent that they did show enterprise in this matter, but they do not seem to have shown any ordinary business foresight. I think, even before the event, having regard to what we know after the event, that a bargain better for the State could have been made by reasonably competent business people dealing with this as a proposition in which their own money was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter which Deputy Flinn has referred to was discussed, I think, in this Dáil at considerable length.  We were of opinion that it was better that the money of the people who were running the factory should be involved and that they should have every incentive to make the last penny profit that it was possible to make in order that they might put their backs into running the factory in the most efficient way and equipping it in the most efficient way. We believed that we would get better results for the community by having the factory in that position than we would by putting up a substantial portion of the capital and getting a small proportion of the subsidy per annum by way of dividends.  I am entirely satisfied that we were right in putting the whole prospects of profits, as well as the whole prospects of losses, on <Col N="1774" /> those who were running the factory, so as to give them the maximum incentive to make actual profits out of the factory.  It is very hard to discuss this when we have the actual factory and the actual owners there.  It would have been very much easier to discuss it when there was no person in question, but undoubtedly Deputies can see that if the capital was even largely governmental capital the people who are running the factory would have methods of obtaining the same profits in other ways than by taking dividends. Consequently, we did not regard it, and I am still satisfied that it was a good thing not to put any Government money into the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards getting money in the country from the ordinary public, I am quite prepared to admit that more might have been done, but it is very difficult for people to go around looking for money and risking it becoming public that they were unable to obtain it.  When they met with discouragement from those whom they had approached, it was only natural that they should come to the conclusion that no money is to be obtained in that direction and that they should seek elsewhere for it.  I am also satisfied that they showed no lack of care or foresight in connection with the matter. We had to pay attention to what was done in England, for this reason, that the people who were starting factories in England and who were engaged in this business in England could obtain rates of subsidy there, in the earlier years at any rate, which were as high as our rate of subsidy, and there was the possibility of difficulties here that were not encountered in England. Nobody who was prepared to engage in that industry would come here in preference to England to start a factory unless he got something extra for the risks, which were perhaps greater than was believed.  In discussing this subsidy the question is whether or not it is right for us to have started the factory. I am not sure, even if we had taken no steps until 1930, that we would be able to get a factory set up here any cheaper, and we would have lost a good deal of time.  I believe in these matters time is of value.  Where we need new things to be done, if we <Col N="1775" /> see the possibility of doing them as cheaply, or nearly as cheaply, as they can be done for other people, I do not think it is a good thing to let the years slip by without doing them.  There was no alternative before us but to make a bargain, when we decided to have a factory.  We are satisfied we did the right thing, and we do not begrudge the people who came in to do the work any success which came to them.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £37,500 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1929, chun Deontaisí i gCabhair do Chostaisí Fundúireachtaí Príomh-Scoile, maraon le Deontaisí fén Irish Universities Act, 1908, fén Acht Talmhan, 1923, agus fén Acht um Oideachas Phríomh-Scoile (Talmhaíocht agus Eolaíocht Déiríochta), 1926.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £37,500 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for Grants-in-Aid of the Expenses of University institutions, including grants under the Irish Universities Act, 1908, the Land Act, 1923, and the University Education (Agriculture and Dairy Science), Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>The amount provided in this Vote is the same as last year.  All the grants are statutory, with the exception of a sum shown under sub-head B, a grant of £16,000 to the University College, Galway.  When the increased grants were fixed for the other colleges, Dublin and Cork, a decision had not been come to in regard to Galway, and it was not included in the Act of 1926. A Bill is in course of preparation, and I think it will be introduced very shortly, which will add the £16,000 shown under sub-head B to the £12,000 shown under sub-head A.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to give us some information with regard to the progress of the dairying scheme in University College, Cork, and if he could say whether any arrangements have been made to give scholarships or grants in regard to research work to students; for example, students in agricultural schools throughout the Free State who would be inclined to go on for higher agricultural work.  What exactly is being done to enable the agricultural industry to have competent, highly-trained workers at its disposal?  I think that that is a very important matter. At present we know very little about what is actually being done, and if the Minister could let us know it would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Derrig wants to know what progress is being made in connection with the organisation of the faculty of Dairy Science in Cork. Considerable progress has been made. About two years ago, when we were instituting that faculty, we were in consultation with the people concerned in University College, Cork, and I think the sum of money that appeared on the Estimates was a sum that was agreed on at the time with these people as sufficient to cover all the capital expenses, which were very considerable, and also the actual expenditure for the purpose of paying professors and for the purpose of providing scholarships, and providing equipment for the institute.  Having voted that money, which was an agreed sum, it was then for University College, Cork, to proceed with the work, but they found unexpected difficulties.  That, of course, is nothing to their discredit.  It was a very big proposition.  It entailed the establishment of a creamery within easy reach of the College, and not only the establishment of a creamery but also the necessary laboratories, class halls, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they began to consider where they should establish the creamery, and where they should establish the laboratories, of course they had to keep in mind that these various buildings <Col N="1779" /> should be quite close to University College, because it would be necessary to take pupils from the College to the laboratories and from the laboratories to the College on the same day, and then within an hour's time to the creamery.  That presented legal difficulties. Certain people who owned house property near the University came to the conclusion that a creamery was not exactly the sort of thing that would appreciate the value of house property or the value of land in the neighbourhood, and there were certain legal complications; in fact, legal actions were threatened, and the whole thing had to be revised.  The University was not particularly anxious to get into litigation, especially on the question of what was or what was not a nuisance.  That is rather an abstruse question, and it would depend to a great extent on the aesthetic sense of the particular jurors who would hear the case.</P>
    <P>It was decided that they would change their plans and that they would endeavour to build a creamery within the college grounds.  That raised new difficulties.  University College, Cork, is one of the finest buildings of its kind in this country, or perhaps in England, Ireland and Scotland.  It is a very handsome building, and it is a very fine University from that point of view.  They put it to us, and quite rightly, that if these buildings had to be erected within the grounds of the University, they should be in keeping with its general architecture, and, strange to say, we agreed to that.  But it took some time before we agreed, because it meant considerably more money.  In any case, negotiations went on between ourselves and University College, Cork, and we altered the estimates, notwithstanding that we had agreed in the beginning with the sum that was agreed by the College as the amount that was necessary to cover all the expenses of establishing a dairy institute, of paying the capital expenditure for such an institute, and also paying the annual expenditure. Notwithstanding that that sum was agreed to by the College, we expressed our willingness to reconsider the question, and the College put up <Col N="1780" /> new estimates for new types of buildings, and finally some months ago&mdash;I forget how many; Deputy Anthony will probably be able to enlighten me on that point&mdash;we agreed as to the final figure, and the buildings are now going ahead.  Of course, the creamery has not been built, and the new class halls have not been built.  That is a matter entirely for the College.  They have got the money, they have a contract signed, the contractors are, I think, actually working, and there is nothing to prevent them, and in fact nothing is preventing them, from going ahead with the building.</P>
    <P>Meantime they have appointed three of four professors, I think, and when I say &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; I mean that I am not sure whether they have appointed three or four.  They have appointed a Professor of Bacteriology and some other professors, and they have facilities; they have a farm which they bought with the money which was voted, and they are, in fact, going ahead and providing lectures for the course in Dairy Science.  I think the Deputy was specially interested in the scholarships that are being given there. I am not in a position to say offhand what scholarships are being given. There is a number&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to get is a general idea as to how exactly the Minister proposes to recruit students, and what types the students will be. Will they be farmers' sons, or will they come from the agricultural schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that is a very big question.  It does not matter what idea I have on that matter, or what idea anyone in the Government has on that matter, because it is a matter entirely for University College, Cork, and there is, in my opinion, the sound point of view that the University should be self-governing.  But I do happen to know the intentions of the University.  Deputies will have to remember that this is a University institution. There is an agricultural faculty there, it is true, but the fact that it is merely an agricultural faculty should not lead any Deputy to the view that that faculty is any less dignified or any less important than <Col N="1781" /> any other faculty in University College, Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister how he interprets that from what I have said?  I did not suggest for a moment that the Minister should dictate to the University what their curricula should be; but it is well known that in regard to their scholarships county councils have had to have special examinations to enable scholars from the national schools to have a lower standard of examination for them to pass into the University.  That is a matter that the University may have to make special arrangements for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean for a moment that the Deputy suggested that the faculty should be any less dignified or any less important than any other faculty in the University, but undoubtedly the sort of question that the Deputy asked does contain that implication, because he asked what arrangements are being made to see that very special terms shall be made for agricultural students entering the University. That is what it comes to.  My first answer to that is that an agricultural student should not be allowed to go into the University on any easier terms than a medical student or a law student, and if he does it means that he enters with a poorer education.  If he does enter with a poorer education than the Arts, the medical or the law student, the faculty becomes a second or a third-rate faculty.  I merely say that in order to show that it is not quite easy to square two propositions&mdash;one an agricultural faculty, giving a first-class education to students, and the other catering for what the Deputy calls the small farmer's or the poor man's, son.  The agricultural student who enters Cork University must have as high a standard of education as the medical or any other student, and if he does not have that he should not be allowed to enter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The place for a boy who has left the national school and who has got no other education is Clonakilty, Athenry or Ballyhaise.  He will never have sufficient education to get a degree that is worth anything in agriculture, that is to say, unless he improves his education <Col N="1782" /> and brings it up to the matriculation standard.  But the boy who leaves a national school in the sixth or seventh class, or whatever the last class is, is not fit for a university; he is wasting his time in a university, and the university is wasting its time in trying to teach him.  He should go to Ballyhaise, or some of the other colleges. The man who goes to University College, Cork, with the intention of taking a degree in agriculture, should be up to the matriculation standard, and that is the point of view in University College. On the other hand, where you have boys up to that standard, they are provided with scholarships by the county councils to enable them to enter. We talk a great deal about education in this country; we profess to have a great respect for education, and set a great value on it.  I have not the exact figures before me, but I believe the various county councils have provided agricultural scholarships at the expense of the ratepayers, and they have not been able to get students to take them up.  I know for certain that county councils have provided scholarships to enable boys to go into Athenry or Clonakilty and they have not been able to get students to take them up.</P>
    <P>That is the position, and, of course, when you ask the reason why, you get a great many people to say: &ldquo;Well, people do not think much about the sort of agricultural education you get in these colleges.&rdquo;  That does not carry any conviction with me.  I do not believe that the parents of these students sit down to think out what they would regard as an efficient or proper system of education for their children.  I do not believe that they have any educational theories at all. I do not believe that they are in a position to compare one system with another.  I believe that they do not think an agricultural education is worth very much.  But with the point of view that it is essential to cater for the poor man's son and to provide scholarships to enable him to go either to a secondary school like Clonakilty, or a university like Cork, you have to remember that in this country there have been for the last four or five years scholarships made available out <Col N="1783" /> of the rates by county councils, that in a great many counties there are not sufficient students to take them up and that in other counties they have depressed the standard to a level which is very much below the standard which should be set.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say in reply to the Minister that perhaps some of the blame that he attaches to the county councils devolves on the secondary schools.  So long as you have secondary schools which never teach agriculture, or give a rural bias to their work, you will never have students anxious to go in for the agricultural faculty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong.  If he will turn to page 206 of the Estimates, Sub-head F2&mdash;&ldquo;Grant to Private Agricultural Schools&rdquo;&mdash;he will see Mountbellew Agricultural College, Warrenstown, Copsewood, Portumna, Clifden, Swinford, Claremorris, Loughglynn, Dunmanway, Drishane, Killeshandra, Ardagh and Ramsgrange.  Students in all these places get a fair secondary education, sufficient, I think, to enable them to reach the matriculation standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are able to compete with students from secondary schools which concentrate on scholarship work and specialise in it.  It is obvious that if they give a certain amount of time to ordinary agricultural work they cannot compete with students who give their whole time, and are specially equipped in the cities to go in for scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy's point was that there were no secondary schools in the country to give a good general education and at the same time give an agricultural bias to the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant by a secondary school a school that trains students for intermediate examinations, and I have never heard that these agricultural schools bring their students up to the matriculation standard.  I <Col N="1784" /> understood they concentrate solely on agricultural subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question of giving an Intermediate education; it is a question of giving them a general education to enable them to pass matriculation, and, so far as a pass in Mountbellew or Copsewood is concerned, these are the only boys that could enter for agricultural scholarships. They are competing with boys from other schools.  You have nine or ten schools financed by the State at a cost of £10,000 each year, and, in addition, they have the advantage that they are run by Orders of some kind or another, who have unpaid teachers and who can do things extremely economically. Nevertheless the fact remains that these secondary schools are quite competent to give the boys an education sufficient to enable them to pass matriculation, and you have the national schools qualified to give boys a general education to get a scholarship for entrance to schools like Athenry. Nevertheless these scholarships are not fully availed of.  In any event you cannot allow a student into a university who has not a sufficiently high standard of education.  He must be able to avail of the university education. If you did otherwise you simply depress your university to the standard of a secondary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say in conclusion that if University College, Cork, in collaboration with the secondary schools, is providing a good system of scholarships I admit that not very much more could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point of view I would like to put to the Minister. It has been represented to me that in some counties at any rate it would be better if there were fewer scholarships to the university, and if the value of them were raised, because the grant given is not sufficient to enable these students to live in Dublin, Cork or Galway, wherever the scholarships are to be held.  Perhaps the same thing would apply to the secondary scholarships. I have known cases in which those who were awarded scholarships were loth to take them up for the <Col N="1785" /> reason that the grants were not sufficient without being subsidised from home, and that the parents were not in a position so to subsidise the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a great deal in what the Deputy says. From the University point of view the University would be better pleased to have a fewer number of students and give that smaller number scholarships definitely in accordance with the newer cost of living in Dublin or Cork.  It is a matter for the county councils.  I think that unofficial representations have been made to the county councils from time to time that a scholarship is not sufficient to keep a student in the University unless there is a big subvention from home.  Sometimes these subventions come and sometimes they do not. It has been found that students dropped out midway in their courses, not through any fault of their own or owing to failure to pass examinations, but because their parents cannot afford to keep them in the University.  It is a matter for the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture left off at the really interesting point, with regard to the Dairy Institute at Cork.  I think he was going to describe what its probable work would be.  What is the Dairy Institute intended to do?  Will it be merely an off-shoot of a creamery to test and analyse butter and things like that or is it intended to start a dairy farm?  Is it intended to do such things as to experiment as to the best type of dairy cow, as to the question as to whether there can be a dual purposes cow, for instance, and the difference between the different breeds?  Is that part of the work, or is it what I might call indoor work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pay at least this tribute to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Department generally, so far as the initiation of this faculty of agriculture is concerned.  It is certainly the most constructive work that the Minister has engaged in.  If I interpreted Deputy Derrig correctly, he suggested that the standard of examination for students for the faculty of agriculture was rather high.  Well, if I interpret the intention of the Minister <Col N="1786" /> rightly, it is to attract to the faculty the best teachers or professors that can be had in this country or outside it, and, secondly, to attract the best type of student to those classes.  I think we have heard a good deal here from time to time of the position of agriculture in this so-called agricultural country. I said a moment ago that this was the best piece of constructive work that the Minister had engaged in; I said that in view of the manner in which for many years as we know agriculture to be conducted.  Most of you are aware of the fact that nearly in seventy-five per cent. of cases that have come under our notice from time to time you have a family consisting, let us say, of two or three sons, and the custom has been, in the case of a farmer who can afford it, to send away one or two of those sons to a University, or to send them to a secondary school where they might qualify for a position in the Civil Service, or at least for a commercial position. The eldest son, as we know the system which obtains at present in this country, is kept at home and gets little or no education.</P>
      <P>Let us assume the sons are A. B, C. B and C are sent to college.  One of them, we will say, is made a clergyman, and the second is qualified as a doctor. A, the eldest son is kept on the farm and gets little or no education at all. And then we talk about the decay of agriculture.  All the time remember that the costs of making the doctor and the costs of making the priest or parson had to be paid out of the land. And yet the producer on the land, who was the eldest son, was neglected in his education.  These are the facts of which most of you are aware.  You have in most of those families a priest or doctor, and the eldest son who succeeded to the farm out of which the money came to make a priest or doctor is neglected in his education.  This is an attempt on the part of the Minister for Agriculture to remedy that state of affairs, and, in my view, and in the view of any person who has given any thought at all to the matter, it is one of the best means by which you can raise the status of the agriculturist in this country.  We are told frequently that agriculture is our main industry. I do not know that that is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" /> Recent publications of figures, at any rate, issued through our Statistical Department, do not corroborate that view. We have a lot of land lying idle.  We have much of the capable brains and intellect of the country turned into other pursuits&mdash;to trade and commerce. But here you have an attempt made to raise the status of the agriculturalist and to encourage the budding agriculturalist, who is to study in Cork University College, to look upon his profession of agriculture in the same way as his brothers might look upon the profession of the Church or medicine. I had intercourse not so long ago with numbers of farmers from various parts of the world.  I met there Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, Germans and other nationalities at the World's Congress of Farmers.  I was lucky enough to meet some of them and to discuss with them agricultural conditions in their countries, and I was certainly surprised, but agreeably surprised, to find that agriculture in the countries I have mentioned is looked upon as one of the best and noblest of the professions. Here in this country, where there is so much make believe, the agriculturalist is looked down upon by his brother the clergyman or his brother the doctor. There is no gainsaying that.  This is an attempt, and I welcome this attempt on the part of the Minister to raise the status of the agriculturalist.  Any expenditure consistent with our revenue, and I say that now as a townsman, will be well spent on a Vote of this kind. In so far as the faculty is concerned in Cork, I am glad to say that the building is proceeding.  I can corroborate the Minister when he says there was a demand and a right demand from the professors of the University College in Cork, and a demand that was voiced by nearly every citizen of Cork who has any civic spirit at all, that the new building should conform as far as possible, in character and design, etc., with the existing handsome University building there.</P>
    <P>There was a difficulty, but that difficulty has been got over due to the business capacity, ability and, perhaps, a little generosity on the part of the Minister for Agriculture.  I believe that we will have one of the finest <Col N="1788" /> agricultural buildings there not alone in Ireland, but in Europe.  I understand it is the intention to get some of the very best professors of agriculture in Europe to teach in that University. If that intention is realised, I believe that this will prove to be the best thing that was ever done in this country so far as agriculture is concerned.  Agriculture, we are taught to believe, is our main industry, though I do not fall in with that belief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like that the Minister would inform us how many of those University farmers will go back to the farm when their course is finished in the University, and how many of them will be turned into another kind of parasite to live on the farmer in addition to those gentlemen who are made priests and doctors. How many more parasites of this class are we going to have, with agricultural instructors on top of them?  I would like to get an explanation as to the percentage of those University-trained farmers who go back to the farm, and how many of them are turned out in the shape of additional parasites to live on the unfortunate farmer?  What is going to become of the farmer who has to pay for all these?</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate Deputy Anthony on his agricultural or, I should say, horticultural skill and in the way in which he has been able to produce bouquets to throw at the Government.  The Deputy answered the question why the farmer is looked down upon.  I would say that the answer to the question why the farmer is looked down upon is simply because he cannot make money.  I got up to ask the Government a question, not in a hostile spirit, but to know if any attempt is being made between the Government and the University authorities at present to attract the brains of the younger generation into becoming technical experts and builders-up of industries in this country?  One of the great difficulties at present is the lack of real technical experts for the purpose of building up new industries. There is also another thing that is very much needed in the country, and that is the turning out of men trained with a view to building up a proper system <Col N="1789" /> of banking.  The country would benefit by technical experts on the side of credit.  I would like to have an answer to that, if possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>To a great extent I must say that I agree with Deputy Anthony.  I have some experience of county council scholarships, and I think if one examines the list of students who have gone through a university course and taken out degrees in medicine one will find that the majority of them go abroad.  It is bad enough to have to export our people, but it is infinitely worse to put the ratepayers' money to the expense of giving them a highly specialised education and then to see them giving their services to a foreign country.  I think you might take it that this would be typical, one university class of thirteen medical students, eleven of them are gone out to practice in England and only two remaining in the country.  There is no doubt at all about it, as Deputy Anthony has pointed out, the farmer member of the family is in this country considered socially inferior to his brother the doctor or his brother the priest or lawyer. That should not be so.  Every effort should be made in this country to put the man who is producing all the wealth on a good social level and every effort should be made to give him as good an education as is given to any of the professional men.  If there is one type we want in this country it is captains of industry.  We have been turning out for years parasites to live on the wealth produced practically by one section of the people, and then you have the position that the men who live on this wealth look down on the men who are producing it.  If we want to go ahead in this country we must alter all that.  It would be well if the county councils of the Saorstát would follow the lead given by the Waterford County Council, who, when giving out scholarships, refuse to give any scholarships in medicine.  Of course, it is not a good thing to say that we should not have doctors in the country, but then we should not have too many doctors nor too many lawyers.</P>

      <P>In my opinion this debate is getting on to the dangerous line.  What is really now being discussed is that a direction should be given to autonomous universities and university colleges as to how they are to develop their Faculties. Deputy Goulding has spoken of attracting people to the universities by means of scholarships.  No question of scholarships arises in the Vote.  That is really a matter for the country councils or whatever other outside bodies interest themselves in scholarships. Unless the Deputy actually suggests that there should be a quota of students for admission to the universities, say a quota of students for clerical studies, a quota for the study of medicine, etc., I do not see what the relevance of his argument is.  I suggest to Deputies that not without great deliberation should they enter on a course of debate which would seem to be leading to a direction to the universities in the country as to how best their Faculties should be organised.  I think Deputies should be content to leave those matters to the best traditions of the universities, and I believe that the freer they are to develop along the lines that they consider best the better will be the system of education. The universities certainly ought not to be directed by any debate in this House as to how they should spend the moneys given to them.  That attitude ought not to be adopted unless it is proved that the system of autonomy in the universities is shown to be a failure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked about technical matters.  Well, there are Faculties of Commerce in all the university colleges, or at least in most of them.  Students are getting whatever academic training can be given in that line.  This matter of technical <Col N="1791" /> education in the lower grades can easily be raised on the technical education Vote.  As to how the universities should direct themselves to the new tendency in the country, and as to how they are to meet the needs which we all hope will be increasingly apparent for people with industrial capacity, those are matters that may safely be left to the governing authorities of the universities. Deputies may rest assured that the university authorities can see the tendency of the country just as well as everybody else.  I think the question raised by Deputy Little will be answered when I say that nearly all the universities have Faculties of Commerce. Deputy Little spoke particularly of the industrial side.  The universities have Faculties pertaining to what the Deputy has in mind.  They may not be able to do a great deal in the direction indicated.  Students themselves or their parents will best be able to realise what their chances or their prospects will be, and what vocation is best suited to them.  The universities can be depended upon for making arrangements, and how far these arrangements will be availed of depends upon the people.</P>

      <P>That is actually being done in the matter of electrical engineering.  That is one point upon which there have been talks with certain university heads with regard to the getting of professors on the subject of electrical engineering.  I thought the Deputy was referring to courses, standards of study on certain lines. Deputy Goulding more or less insinuated <Col N="1792" /> that the Medical Faculty should be attended to, that the numbers of students should be reduced and that they should be diverted to other Faculties.  That cannot be done.  The point is that we must give the facilities to the people and enable them to avail of those facilities; let the Universities divert the students if they think it desirable to do so.  Any governing authority in a University which is alive to its duty will always keep its eye on the way in which the country is tending and will observe how tendencies develop.  They will always look at the trend of developments.  I do not think that any University authority can be said to be behind in that matter or can be accused of not moving in the direction of whatever the needs of the country may be.</P>

      <P>Possibly the Minister may have misunderstood me.  What I want to drive home is that too much attention has been paid to certain Faculties and not enough to other subjects. This country is different from other countries that are more highly industrialised.  They can afford to do that more than we can, and every encouragement should be given to enable us to go in the opposite direction.  I do not want in the least to lower the status of the Universities.  By all means let them have the most liberal courses possible, but do not turn out too many men in one profession.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Goulding if he used the word &ldquo;attract,&rdquo; and that is what I believe he means.  I believe his intention is that there should be some attraction for farmers to become professional farmers and to get degrees in the University. I believe the position really is that in most of the other professions in this country there are people who have a fixed rate of salary.  The pay they get is absolutely fixed; not alone that, but in many cases it is fixed by law.  The result is a case of demand and supply. They find those professions are lucrative, comfortable and secure, and therefore the people go for these professions. If the policy was in the direction of an agricultural Faculty, if the agricultural industry was made a profession, <Col N="1793" /> which it ought to be, if we were not more or less still a nation of shopkeepers, I think that tendency would take place.  To my mind, it is altogether a matter of enticing or encouraging the farming community to take out degrees in the Universities.</P>
      <P>That attraction can only be brought about by the policy which the Government will adopt.  I believe that the agricultural position could be bettered if the Government took it seriously in hands and meant to better it.  I believe that a sufficient effort has not been made, that it will have to be made, and that the farmers in the future will insist that they get at least a fair chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intervene because I am afraid the impression will go out that sufficient provision is not being made in the Universities at present for technical studies of different kinds, for example, for agriculture. As a matter of fact, there are at present in existence schemes of scholarships of a very generous kind by which students can go to the University practically from the primary school and get a most elaborate technical education in agriculture from the very beginning to the top.  If Deputies look up the regulations in regard to scholarships into the Agricultural College at Glasnevin they will find that there are in existence very useful schemes of scholarships by which boys can get in at an early age without necessarily passing the University matriculation, be prepared for the University matriculation, get instruction in University subjects at a very early age, and be brought from the earliest stage to the fullest degree of technical competence. The same thing applies very much to all industrial and commercial matters, as far as they can be dealt with by a University. Certainly, as far as matters relating to economics, which Deputy Little spoke of, are concerned, a very great deal is being done at present.  In all the Universities, as far as I know, and I can certainly speak for my own College, not only is there ample provision for students, but very good work is being turned out at present and year by year.  For instance, the publication of various valuable and important <Col N="1794" /> works relating to economic subjects is taking place.  These things are only in their early stages at present, and they will develop more and more later on, but I do not think it would be right that the impression should go out that nothing is being done.  From what I know, I can hardly conceive that very much more could be done at present than is being done in these respects. As a matter of fact, looking at the matter from the point of view of general education, what I am afraid of is that in this country there is more danger that we will suffer from an exaggeration of the tendency to go in for too much technical and commercial education and neglect unduly general education. I do not say that this is necessarily a peculiarity of this country&mdash; it is a general tendency all over the world at present, but I think, if anything, this country is rather inclined to suffer from that danger in common with other countries.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Deputy Tierney has said about the publication of important works, since the Faculty of Commerce was established in the University there have been a number of very important theses written on economic subjects, and I should like to know the position as to the publication of these.  I do not know what the custom is in the University with regard to them, but it seems a pity that some of these should be lost to the general public.  I know, for instance, that a very brilliant student of Cork University College recently wrote a thesis on marketing, as applied to Irish agricultural products chiefly, I think.  It would be very important and very valuable if such a thesis as that were made available. There have not been many attempts of that sort, and it would be extremely valuable for Deputies if such a paper as that were available.  They would at least have a statement of facts that <Col N="1795" /> would be very useful and a sort of index of the books on the subject, as well as the conclusions of the student. I do not know the position with regard to these things, but perhaps Deputy Tierney would say whether there is any use in suggesting that such theses should be published from time to time for the benefit of the public&mdash;at least the most valuable of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way this question arises is whether the House is to vote money for that purpose which is not specifically provided for in the Vote.  This is a Vote for the university colleges.  As a matter of fact, Cork University does run a University Press of a minor type, and has, in fact, published the thesis to which the Deputy referred as a booklet. I do know that under the auspices of the Senate of the National University a bequest which came to hand some years ago was used for the publication of certain Irish books&mdash;they were published out of money that accrued under that trust.  I think the scheme for that trust was that it should be run on the lines of publishing certain academic works sent in either for the Doctorate degree or the Master degree, but I cannot say what stage that has reached.  It is a matter for the internal economy of each university college, unless the Deputy is suggesting that there should be a special vote for the publication of these theses.  Generally speaking, one finds that a thesis, particularly one dealing with economic matters, generally makes its appearance later in the pages of certain of the better-class reviews, and afterwards makes its appearance in book form. &ldquo;Studies,&rdquo; for instance, reprints a great number, or, certainly, summaries of them.  Then the student, if he thinks there is going to be a sale for it, can proceed to publish it.  I know that some small help is given in two university colleges.  University College, Cork, is giving help, and University College, Dublin. did give help for a period.  I do not know what has since been done, but the money is there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> The first two sub-heads of this Vote relate to ordinary pensions and allowances that are paid to civil servants retired since the change of Government. Sub-head B covers the lump sum allowances that are paid.  Under the Superannuation Act of 1859 superannuation allowances were paid on the basis of one-sixtieth of the officers' annual salary, subject to a maximum of forty-sixtieths or two-thirds.  By the Superannuation Act of 1909, under which certain civil servants came by opting, and under which all male civil servants employed since September, 1909, come automatically, a change was effected and civil servants were paid on a basis of eightieths with a lump sum allowance, called an additional allowance, which may amount as a maximum to one-and-a-half times the annual salary of the civil servant retiring. It also provided that in the case of the death of a civil servant while serving, a sum not exceeding the annual amount of his salary might be paid to his legal representatives.  Under this sub-head also provision is made for gratuities that are paid to established female civil servants who resign on marriage.  The amount paid is one month's pay in respect of each year of service, the maximum being twelve month's pay, and it is only paid in the case of a civil servant who has a minimum of six years' service.</P>
    <P>The next sub-heads, C and D, relate to pensions allowance and gratuities payable under the Treaty.  Awards under the Treaty have been held up for a considerable time, first because the Chairman of the Committee, Judge Wylie, who had made the assessments, resigned.  Then, before a successor had been found, civil servants, who had been in litigation with the Minister for Finance, carried an appeal to the Privy Council, and it was found, while that case was pending, impossible to obtain any judicial officer who would act as chairman of the Committee.  A certain decision was given by the Privy Council in the matter which, in the opinion of this Government, was an unfair and incorrect judgment.</P>
    <P>The British Government agreed that the judgement given by the Privy Council did not carry out the intention <Col N="1799" /> of Article 10 of the Treaty, and they agreed with the Government of the Free State that the burden which that judgement would have thrown upon the taxpayers of this country did not rightly fall upon them.  The British Government themselves subsequently referred the general matter that had been at issue in the case to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and so far no further action has been taken in regard to it.  The sums, therefore, that are voted under Sub-head D are, to a considerable extent, a re-Vote.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E&mdash;&ldquo;Compassionate Gratuities&rdquo; are paid in the case of unestablished civil servants not eligible for pensions under the Superannuation Acts.  But Section 4 of the Superannuation Act of 1887 authorises the Minister for Finance to pay gratuities, not exceeding £1 or one week's pay, whichever is the greater, for each year of service to whole-time officials paid from voted moneys who retire on the ground of ill-health or who are discharged from their office.  The provision under Sub-head F for &ldquo;Extra Statutory Grants&rdquo; covers payments made in certain rather exceptional cases where acute distress exists.  For instance, in the case of a Gárda killed in the execution of his duty payment might be made to his dependents.  Sub-head G is &ldquo;Injury Grants.&rdquo; Sub-head J covers pensions made to resigned or discharged members of the R.I.C. under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923.  The number of pensions is shown on page 74 of the Estimates.  Sub-head L shows ordinary pensions of the members of the amalgamated police forces. It includes the old Dublin Metropolitan Police.  Sub-head LL includes the Treaty payments to members of the D.M.P. who resigned or were discharged since the change of Government. The numbers discharged were two, a Chief Commissioner and an Assistant Commissioner.  In addition to those who were discharged, 576 members resigned in consequence of change of Government&mdash;13 inspectors, 129 station sergeants and sergeants, and 434 constables.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M includes repayment to <Col N="1800" /> the British Government in respect of civil pensions.  As Deputies will see in Part III of the Estimate on page 75 the exact portion of the expenditure repayable by the Saorstát has not yet been fixed, and the payments set out in the Estimate are provisional.  It includes for Inland Revenue pensions £5,250 roughly, for Customs and Excise £41,700, and the remainder for other pensions.  The last item is the repayment to the British Government in respect of the ordinary pensions and disbandment pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  The Saorstát payment is based on a proportion of 75 per cent. of the total.  That figure was arrived at after consideration of the proportion of members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who were serving in the Saorstát during the period of 19 or 20 years prior to the change of Government.  For instance, in 1901 the number serving in the Saorstát area was 78.59, in the next year 77.68, then 77.65, 76.86, 76, 75, 76, 77, 77.3, 77.4, 77.05; in 1912, 74; in 1913, 73; in 1914, 74.15; in 1915, 74,68, and so on, rising up to 77.86 in 1920.</P>
    <P>On previous Estimate discussions the question of the auditing of these pensions was raised.  So far the position has been that we accept the certificate of the British Comptroller and Auditor-General, but there is a right. It is admitted that the Comptroller and Auditor-General here may himself or by his officer inspect the accounts and documents and test the accuracy of the British certificate. The Comptroller and Auditor-General so far has not judged it necessary to do so.  It was really a matter for him whether he would, as a check, conduct himself the audit of the ex-R.I.C. pension payments.</P>

      <P>I think the answer which the Minister for Finance has just given ought to determine the course of this debate.  This is one of the most important Votes the House is called upon to pass.  I think it is the fourth largest Vote in the Estimates. The Vote for Superannuation and Retiring Allowances in this little country of ours amounts to £1,794,295. It is proportionately very much larger than the amount which is voted in respect of similar services in a very much wealthier country which is our neighbour.  In Great Britain the amount which is voted, including War pensions, in respect of annuities and pensions only amount to something like 2.46 of the actual income of the taxpayer, as assessed for revenue purposes by the Revenue Commissioners. In the Twenty-six Counties, this poor and impoverished country unable to pay its way, this country whose revenue at present falls far short of what it was this time last year, the proportion we are called upon to vote in respect of superannuation and retiring allowances is 3.4 per cent. of the actual income of the taxpayer, as assessed for income tax purposes by the Revenue Commissioners.  We are called upon, therefore, to pay, in this poor little country of ours, almost 50 per cent. more proportionately than they are called on to pay in Great Britain in respect of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote, as well as being important from the point of view of size, is also worthy of very serious consideration from the point of view of its economic effects.  This Vote differs from practically every Vote in the Estimates in so far as it is the one from which we get the least return.  In respect of all the other services, practically all the money granted by this House is expended in this country, passes from citizen to citizen and helps to maintain the whole population, but in the case of this Vote an appallingly large part of it is paid to people who do not live in this country, and who have rendered no services to this country.  It is not possible to give exact figures in respect <Col N="1802" /> of this Vote, but the Minister, in reply to a question which I addressed to him early last month, said that the British Government estimated that out of the total amount paid by way of pensions to the ex-R.I.C. only something like £960,000 are paid to people who were resident in Saorstát Eireann, and of that £960,000 it was estimated that the Exchequer of the Saorstát had to repay something like £700,000.  Now, the total amount to be repaid to the British Exchequer in respect of disbandment and ordinary pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary is something like £1,205,000.  Therefore, since of that £1,205,000 only £700,000 is paid to residents in this country the total amount of this Vote which is exported is something like half a million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not, because the war pensions are paid by the British Government to Irishmen in respect of services rendered to the British Government defending the British Empire.  These pensions are paid by Irishmen to the British Government in respect of services rendered to the British Government and of which the British Government reaped the sole advantage.  In one case, Great Britain pays for services rendered to her, whereas in the other case we are asked to pay for services rendered against us. I think the difference is sufficient to justify Irishmen accepting the British pensions and to justify us denying pensions to the R.I.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, before going further, to point out that the total amount of this Vote does not represent the total amount which we pay by way of pensions. In respect of other services we pay an additional £600,000, so that the total amount paid by way of pensions in this State amounts to something like £2,394,000, and, estimating on the basis of the figures which the Minister for Finance furnished to us at the beginning of the month, it is possible to form a very rough and approximate idea as to the total amount of money paid to pensioners who are not resident <Col N="1803" /> in the Saorstát.  I think we could roughly place that figure at £1,000,000, but it is, more or less, beside the point, and I only mention it in order to draw attention to the gravity of the situation which these pensions are creating.  We cannot afford to continue to pay pensions to people who are not resident in this country.  That is one problem we will have to face.  This country, whose industries, we are told, languish for want of capital, cannot afford to withdraw each year £1,000,000 from productive processes and export it without securing any commensurate return. But the very fact that under this Vote something like £500,000 of Irish money is to be exported or, if you like, allowing for the fact that the British Government estimate that they pay £900,000 by way of pensions to ex-members who do reside in the Saorstát &mdash;something like £300,000 is exported from this country to people who never rendered any service to the country, who do not render any service at this moment, and who, in fact, are only a drain upon the industry and thrift of the community&mdash;would indicate that if the Minister were to discharge his duty properly to the House he ought to have a more searching investigation to see whether that money was properly due before he paid it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has told us in his statement, in 1926 Deputy Esmond raised this very matter in the House. He asked the Minister for Finance if it were not possible that a more effective check could be kept over this expenditure. Remember, this is a payment which, according to the Minister, will have to be made for a very long time as, he himself admitted, most of the people to whom it is paid are comparatively young.  Are we to continue to pay £1,200,000 without satisfying ourselves, without even making a cursory examination to satisfy ourselves, that that money is rightfully due, that, in fact, Great Britain does pay pensions to that amount, and that she pays them to people who, from her point of view, but not from ours, have earned them?</P>
    <P>In 1926 the Minister admitted that we had the power to make the examination for which I am pressing.  He informed <Col N="1804" /> Deputy Esmonde, I think, that the British Government were aware that we had that power, that we claimed it as a right, and that within a short space of time the Minister proposed to exercise that right and have that examination made.  Why has he not fulfilled that promise?  What has happened in the meantime?  The other day, speaking upon Deputy Tadhg Murphy's motion in regard to allowances to destitute widows and orphans, the Minister told us that we could not afford the sum necessary to provide these allowances and that, therefore, he asked the House not even to consider the matter in the present state of the country's finances.  Yet, though we cannot afford to make that provision for destitute widows and orphans, we can, with lavish and careless hand, fling millions away to able-bodied pensioners who have no claims on this State, most of whom, in fact, are not even citizens of this State, and we allow the poor and destitute in our midst to go without bread and sustenance.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this matter has attempted to shelter himself behind the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In the question to which I have already referred, he stated that it is no part of the functions of the Minister for Finance to examine and check the lists of persons in receipt of pensions or other moneys payable, directly or indirectly, from the Exchequer of the Saorstát.  If that is the Minister's attitude I would ask him to turn to page 70 of the Estimates, and there in Part II. of the Estimate he can read, as I am going to read, sub-heads under which this Vote will be accounted for by the Office of the Minister for Finance. Accounted for to whom and where?&mdash; accounted for to the representatives of the people in this Dáil.  If it is the Minister who is responsible for checking that expenditure, for disbursing that money, and before a singe penny piece is paid away, it is his duty to see that that money is not spent unless the people who claim it are rightfully entitled to it.  How can the Minister satisfy himself that the claim made by Great Britain for repayment in respect of these pensions is justly due unless he has had some check and examination <Col N="1805" /> of the lists of persons to whom it is paid?  I should like the Minister to deal with that aspect of the question. He is responsible in this House for the expenditure of this money.  He has come to the Dáil in a moment when we are poverty-stricken, when we are faced with a situation that before another Budget passes we must raise another loan, when we are faced with the fact that next year, unless we can secure some reduction in expenditure, there must be an increase in taxation, he comes to this House and asks you to vote £1,205,000 in respect of an item which he has not even taken the trouble, during the five or six years that he has been asking you to spend that money annually, to ascertain whether that money is due or is not due.  The Minister, in this instance. cannot shelter himself behind the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  He is responsible, in the first instance, for paying out that money.  Before a penny piece of it is paid he ought to have the list of pensioners presented to him, and in order to satisfy himself that that list is a correct one he ought to check, examine and analyse it in detail.</P>
    <P>That is the case that I put to the Minister, and that is what I had in mind when I said that the answer which the Minister gave to my question would, I hoped, be the key-note to this debate.  I asked him what was the reduction under sub-head N due to, and he told me that he did not know. Death, I suppose.  That indicates the extent of the care with which the Minister handles the finances of this State. Here is an item in which there has been a reduction.  An account has been presented to him.  He knows that it is possibly somewhat lower than last year's but he has not even taken the trouble to ascertain why it is less and why, if it be less this year, it should not have been less last year.  He does not know in what way the British Government account for the fact that last year the amount which they were demanding under this head was greater than this year.  That is the point.  The Minister imagines it might be due to death.  It might be due to an outburst of generosity on the part of the British <Col N="1806" /> Government.  They recognise that our revenue is £1,100,000 less than it was this time last year, notwithstanding the fact that, I think, we have imposed almost one and a quarter millions extra taxation this year.  Therefore, out of the goodness of their heart they are going to be satisfied with something like £40,000 less than last year, and so far as the Minister is concerned that might be the explanation, but that is not an explanation that is going to satisfy this House.  Is death going to be sufficient answer to those who want to see the social services in Saorstát Eireann equal to the social services provided by the neighbouring Governments?  Is that the answer which is going to be given by the Minister to the Deputies sitting on the Labour benches?  Are the Deputies on the Labour benches going to be satisfied with that answer?  Is Deputy Anthony going to get up and fling his usual bouquet to the Minister for Finance?  If the Deputy is as good at paying his taxes as he is at paying tributes to the Government, then he is an exemplary citizen.  That, I think, goes to the root of the whole matter.  I want to put it to my friends who sit on the Labour benches that they cannot pursue, in regard to this Estimate, the attitude which they have adopted in regard to some of the others, if they really want to see their social programme carried out.  I am not saying this because I wish in any way to antagonise them or to be held as antagonistic to them, but I wish them to take our view of the present situation and to realise that we cannot, and that they cannot, fulfil or carry through their social programme unless there is very close scrutiny of every penny piece, and particularly of every penny piece spent by way of payment of pensions to those who do not reside inside this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has indicated, I think, that there is grave probability that we are being overcharged in this matter, grave probability that the British Governments is shall we say, faking the accounts, and that the British Comptroller and Auditor-General is giving deliberately false certificates.  I simply refuse to believe for a moment that the Comptroller <Col N="1807" /> and Auditor-General in Great Britain is giving deliberately false certificates when he knows, to put it at its very lowest, that we claim, and that the British Government have admitted our claim, to examine the accounts and to check them.  The British Comptroller and Auditor-General occupies the position in that country that our Comptroller and Auditor-General occupies here, and it is conclusive evidence, apart from the possibility that error might occur, that the amounts that he certifies as having been paid to certain classes of persons were paid to those classes of persons.  Remember, to send people over to check those accounts involves expenditure, and while I think that at some time or another&mdash;it is a matter really for the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;there ought to be a check account, no matter how much confidence we have in any person who is doing it, but as to being deliberately misled, there is not, I believe, any ground for thinking that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rumours have been put around occasionally that certain people were being paid by the British Government pensions to which they were not entitled. I remember, I think, a Deputy from the Labour Party bringing to my notice the case of a man who alleged that he served in the Royal Irish Constabulary as a constable for a long period, that he left the force as a constable, and that he was being paid a sergeant's pension, which was being charged up to us.  Immediately that particular instance was brought to my notice I had investigations made.  It is quite true that the man had been going around Dublin making such statements. On investigation we found that he had served in the force for twenty years, or something like that; that he had left as a constable, and that he was being paid a constable's pension, and that the cause of his discharge from the force was insanity.  No doubt that particular man, who was not right in the head, may have caused large numbers of people to believe that all sorts of tricks were being played by the British Government in the matter.  That was one instance that was brought to my notice.  I think there were one or <Col N="1808" /> two other instances.  When the rumour took concrete shape, and was referred to a particular individual so that we could fairly easily conduct an investigation, we found that the rumour was entirely incorrect.  If we were to send over a staff to examine all the relevant documents, and to test the work that is being done by the British Government; if we were to insist on taking the attitude that they were sure to be cheating us and that we must keep this matter up, we would spend a great deal of money and get no return. Remember that whenever a check test takes place, if it is found that anything is wrong, the whole matter can be re-adjusted, with interest paid.</P>
    <P>The position is that the British officials, including the British Treasury officials who are responsible for making these payments, will do the work in the ordinary course of their duty.  They will take all the ordinary precautions. Their work is subject to the check that is provided for ordinary expenditure, the audit by their Comptroller and Auditor-General.  He gives us a certificate, and he again is subject to the check of any audit that our Comptroller and Auditor-General may carry out. When we hear it alleged that Treasury officials are going to pay out pensions which are not due under the statute and under the regulations to people, and that their misdeeds are going to be overlooked and not reported upon by their Comptroller and Auditor-General, we are really asked to believe too much. It is a proper thing to take all necessary precautions, but it is not a sensible thing to go to considerable expense when we have no good reasons to believe that the accounts and certificates presented to us are wrong.  So far as the Department of Finance is concerned, the certificate we get from the Comptroller and Auditor-General is sufficient evidence upon which we can pay out the money claimed.</P>
    <P>If the Comptroller and Auditor-General here entertains any doubt, if there is anything at all that leads him to suspect something is wrong or something undisclosed, it would be his duty at once to undertake a test audit.  If he has no grounds whatever for suspicion <Col N="1809" /> I think it would be his duty some time to carry out a test check himself, but that is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I believe that perhaps some of the reasons why a test check has not been carried out so far are that, one way or another, there has been a good deal of pressure on that Department; a good many of the members of the staff were new to the work they have to do, and in addition to that, as Deputies are aware, a great deal of time was spent by the officers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Department in dealing with the old Army accounts, and other matters of the kind. There was really an abnormal pressure of work in that Department.  They had to detach officers to take part in a great many investigations along with the officers of the Department of Finance. I think now that the abnormal inquiries in which they had to engage are no longer likely to occupy them they will find some early opportunity of carrying out an examination into that particular matter.  In the meantime, I am quite satisfied that everything is in order.  If there is any loss due to an error or bona fide mistake, or if any such thing be found, the Saorstát Exchequer would suffer no loss, for the amount wrongly charged would be repayable, and repayable with interest.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the case of Mr. McInerney who was formerly a magistrate and who owing to his very loyal attitude to the national movement of the time was really victimised by the British Government, and subsequently owing to that victimisation got into a state of poverty, really?  He is an old man now and in ill health.  Applications were made to the Finance Department in this matter before, but apparently they are unable to do anything in the matter.  I would like to know would the Minister in some way or another bring him under one of those heads, for instance, the compassionate gratuity head, or otherwise give him technically an appointment and then give him some pension?  It would not be a matter of a great deal of money. It is rather a slur on our gratitude to one who when we were all together fighting against the common enemy <Col N="1810" /> was with us, and who is now left in a position of poverty.</P>

I doubt whether such a man would come in under the sub-head for compassionate allowances, for these allowances as I indicated are intended for minor unestablished civil servants and there is a very narrow limit to the amount which may be given.  I do not know the merits of this case.  Of course, if a case were sufficiently meritorious, and if there were a general desire to have it done it is always possible to find some means.  It is possible to insert a special sub-head in the Vote, if the case were such as to demand that treatment.  The matter was not personally before me and I cannot answer the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to what has been said by Deputy Little with regard to the case of Mr. McInerney, K.C.&mdash;or S.C. It is a long time ago since he was forcibly retired from the Bench.  He was a magistrate in the city; I am not quite sure of the year, but it was during the fighting and was previous to the Treaty.  He took up a strong attitude with regard to certain actions of the Government police, and plainly told one superintendent, according to my recollection, that he did not accept his word.  The next day he was retired as a magistrate, and he was never given any compensation or allowance, and he did that without any thanks when we were sustaining the national fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a great hardship on him.  I <Col N="1811" /> do not think he was many years on the bench, but he was a very distinguished lawyer.  I have no personal acquaintance with him, but I recollect his career all my lifetime since I was able to recollect anything of the kind.  He took up our side in that way while on the bench and suffered severely for it. If the Minister can find any means of trying to meet the situation that has <Col N="1812" /> arisen owing to his forcible retirement, I would be very glad.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will see, the Personal Injuries Compensation Vote is now a comparatively small one.  The provision made under Sub-head A is for periodic allowances, and for the re-issue of certain payable orders which, for one reason or another, were not cashed during the last financial year.

    <P>(1)  Where the injury was an injury to which the Criminal Injuries Acts would have been applied by the Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1919, as amended by the Criminal Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1920, had these Acts remained in force.</P>
    <P>(2).  Where the injured person was or was likely to be excluded from the benefit of the Criminal Injuries Acts as so applied, by reason only of the injury having been inflicted by members of the British Military or Police Forces.</P>
    <P>(3).  Where the injury was sustained without default on the part of a person being a non-combatant in the course of belligerent action between the British Forces, and the Irish National Forces, or in the course of operations by the National Forces against persons engaged in armed rebellion against the Government of Saorstát Eireann, whether before or after the passing of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>II.  The Committee will recommend to the Minister for Finance what sums should in reason and fairness be paid in the several cases above-mentioned, regard being had to (inter alia) the actual earning capacity of the injured person prior to the injury, and to the impairment of earning capacity attributable to the injury and to the actual extent of dependency of dependents upon the deceased person prior to the death or injury of the deceased person and to any effective provision made by the deceased person for his dependents by way of insurance or otherwise.</P>
    <P>III.  The Committee shall in general recommend awards by way of lump sum, but shall also recommend in the alternative monthly or quarterly allowances in cases of injury <Col N="1816" /> considered likely to be permanent. The payment of a periodical allowance may be recommended to commence on the 1st day of April, 1923, but a payment of a sum in the nature of arrears, but not exceeding the amount of one year's arrears, may also be recommended.</P>
    <P>IV.  The Committee shall not recommend an award in any of the following cases:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1).  Cases eligible for any award under any Act making provision for Army Pensions.</P>
    <P>(2).  Cases in which a final decree under the Criminal Injuries Acts was obtained prior to the 12th February, 1922; and</P>
    <P>(3).  Cases in which the British Government have undertaken full liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdmondCarey" hpid="Mr. CAREY Mr. CAREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CAREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to an incident that happened in 1920&mdash;the battle of Clonmult.  Compensation has been given in respect of some of those who were shot on that day, but the compensation was not enough to make up for the loss of those who were shot.  There were two in one family&mdash;the Desmonds &mdash;and another case was that of MacNamara. I think seven were shot altogether. Some people have got something, but it would not half compensate the parents for what they suffered since.  The bread-winners who were supporting the fathers and mothers are gone, and the parents are living on outdoor relief.  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to these particular cases.  I have been from time to time in communication with the Department about that matter, and I take this opportunity of bringing the facts before the Minister to ask him if it is possible to re-open these cases.  Clonmult is adjacent to Midleton.  Does he think it would be essential to reconstitute the Committee to go into these cases? There are a few other cases in East Cork also which I would bring under his notice if he were inclined to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point that I would like to have cleared up. I notice that the President, when <Col N="1817" /> Minister for Finance, did not include among those disqualified from securing a recommendation from the Committee people who might be thought to be in sympathy, or who were in sympathy, with those who at that time took the side of the Republican Army, the side of the Republicans.  I would like the President to reassure us upon that point, for if compensation were granted in such a partial way as to exclude from the consideration of this State any appreciable section of the population because of their political opinions, I think that it would be a very bad policy for us to perpetuate, and we on this side of the House, at any rate, could not accept responsibility for perpetuating such a policy.  I think the impression has prevailed that those who were suspected of having Republican sympathies were excluded from compensation either on the ground of personal injuries or damage to property.  So far as damage to property is concerned, they were specifically excluded by statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>They were specifically excluded by statute only in certain cases&mdash;in cases, for instance, where armed resistance took place or firing took place from a premises.  In the case of damage being done to the premises of a person who had those sympathies but who was not actively engaged against the National troops, there was no exclusion, and I may tell the Deputy that there were many such cases in which compensation was granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept the explanation that the President has given, but even proceeding on that basis I think there were numbers of people excluded wrongfully, possibly by reason of the fact that their testimony was not accepted as reliable in certain instances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <P>I will leave that for the moment, and I will ask the President if the Committee that he set up took into consideration cases of the nature referred to in the motion which <Col N="1818" /> stands on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Aiken.  If the President refers to the motion he will see that it relates entirely, at least the first part of it, to property which was destroyed in December, 1920.  The latter portion of the motion relates to property destroyed in June, 1922.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I say.  In a great many cases a sum of £50 was awarded, and that simply was meant to cover burial expenses.  The amount was awarded in cases where the Committee was satisfied that no dependency existed.  I could not remember any individual cases, but I can clearly remember a great many cases in which the relatives of the deceased were quite well-off, and it was quite obvious that they were in no way dependent on the deceased.  The loss they suffered by the death was not financial loss, and consequently the amount paid was simply to cover burial expenses.</P>

      <P>In the case of McNamara I know the father of the boy is at present in very poor circumstances, practically starving.  It is a case for home assistance.  The families of spies who were shot during the Tan period in that very district were paid sums of £1,200 and £1,000 in compensation. The value placed on the lives of volunteers amounts to £100 or £150.  I think these are cases where the Minister <Col N="1820" /> should open his heart a little bit, at any rate.  It is a proceeding in which the honour of the State is involved.  It is time that paltry sums like £20 or £50 should receive reconsideration from the Minister.  In this particular case the boy was lost and members of his family are starving.  The family lost their breadwinner, and it is really a case for compensation.  On the other side we see lavish expenditure.  In all seriousness, I suggest to the Minister that he should re-open such cases, and he should see that the fathers of the boys who suffered and died for this country are not left in poverty and in starvation, while the families of spies in the district are drawing thousands and living in luxury.</P>

This is the case of a child that was killed through the explosion of a bomb brought home by a Volunteer during the Black and Tan war period.  As far as I can learn that case is not covered by the terms of reference.  In this case, as I understand, the child had no earning capacity at the time.  As I understand it, the Terms of Reference only covered earning capacity of the person injured.</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Minister that to my knowledge a widow's son, in fact the eldest son of a widow, was shot on active service in 1921.  I understand that his Department offered the woman compensation to the amount of £30 for the loss of her son.  As I say, he was her eldest boy, and the family were very largely dependent on his work and endeavours. The younger members of the family were at the time very badly beaten by the Black and Tans.  When we have a case of a woman like this offered £30 compensation I can only say that it is very ridiculous compensation for the loss that woman has suffered.</P>

      <P>Deputies must recognise that I cannot discuss individual cases here.  If Deputies would see me in my office where I would have the files got out I would be in a position to discuss with them any individual cases.  There would be cases where even Deputies raising the matter would not know all the facts. There were cases in which, before this Committee was set up, the relatives had received substantial sums from other sources.  For instance, very substantial sums had come from the National Aid.  That was a matter that would be taken into account.  Then there is another fact, as I have seen from time to time; I have seen cases of families where there was a small holding and there were two or three grown-up sons on that comparatively small holding.  That was really more than there was room for on the holding. In a case where one of these was killed the Committee would take the view that the father and mother had not suffered a financial loss, and I think that would be correct.  We were not going to pay people for the human loss, the emotional loss that they suffered through the loss of their relatives.  We were definitely going to pay only for the actual financial loss suffered.  I do not know the facts of these cases raised here this evening and I cannot argue the matter closely.  In these awards the general principle that was adopted was to give a sum to cover the burial expenses.  As I say, if there are cases in which Deputies are interested and if they will write to me giving the facts of these cases, I will undertake to have the files looked up and to state to the Deputies interested on what principle the sum that was actually <Col N="1822" /> given was justified.  Then they would be in a position to consider both sides of the case.</P>

      <P>Some of the people that the Deputy has referred to as having got large sums were probably paid by the British Government.  Deputy Corry has asked me if I would be prepared to re-open the particular case.  I would be very reluctant to re-open a case, but if it were made clear to me that some very grave injustice had been done, I would feel coerced to re-open the case, but if it were a border line case, I would certainly decline to re-open it.  There is this thing to be borne in mind in connection with the policy of re-opening cases, that it is extremely difficult now to get the actual facts.  It has become much more difficult now than, say, three or four years ago to get the actual evidence about the facts. That would be a reason for not going into the cases again.  People's memories are not so clear now, and people in good faith might depose to things that they would not have regarded as facts two or three years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is a general one.  Before this Commission had finished its work, in a great number of cases, people wrote objecting to the awards, or Deputies in the House objected to the awards.  I had occasion to go into a great many cases. What I did in these circumstances was <Col N="1823" /> this: I asked for the file; I examined it, and if I thought that the person's claim was reasonable, I would send the whole case back to the Committee.  I sent a fair number of cases back to the Committee.  In a few cases the Committee did vary their awards; but, in a great many other cases, having gone over the matter again, they stuck to their awards.  In the majority of cases they stuck to the original award. There may have been cases where people felt strongly and did not write to me at the time; but I can only say, unless it was absolutely clear that an injustice had been done, I would have to take the position that the matter was closed; that it had been fully considered, and that there had been an opportunity of objecting.  Everybody knew, by references in the newspapers and questions in the Dáil, that the cases were being reconsidered.  Those who did not complain then and apply for reconsideration can hardly expect to have the matters re-opened now.</P>

      <P>I gave notice that on the adjournment I would raise the question of the recent flooding in the Ballinagleragh district of County Leitrim. The flooding which took place on the 15th October was a very exceptional and unusual occurrence.  I believe there has been flooding at times in that district for the last 50 years, but for the last 20 years there has not been such a severe flood as this.  The result of it was that eleven families suffered severely and their property was damaged to a very considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> After the flooding took place, some people got into telephonic communication with the Land Commission.  After a good deal of delay they were told that the person to whom they wished to speak was not there.  That was not a satisfactory reply.  Since then an Inspector of the Land Commission was sent down to the district.  He made an inspection, but nothing has been done since.  The conditions that prevail there are simply deplorable.  I do not wish that this should be used for the purpose of making party capital.  My object is to bring home to the Parliamentary Secretary the responsibility that he owes to that district and to see that steps are taken to meet the situation. I visited the place myself, and I can only say that I am quite incapable of giving a description of the conditions prevailing as a result of the flood.  The land in the district is of very poor quality.  For instance, one of the persons affected by the flood has a farm of 30 acres. only 10 acres of which are arable.  Deputies will realise what the value of the land is when I tell them that the owner of this 30 acre farm only pays a land annuity of £1 16s. per year.  Of the ten acres of arable land, three acres have been damaged by the flood to such an extent as to be quite useless for tillage purposes.  In addition, the district is a mountainous one. The holdings run from Lough Allen to the top of Slieveaveirin, which would be close on a mile&mdash;just one narrow strip of land.  On the whole of that long stretch it is hardly possible to find a suitable site for a house.  Consequently, you find what is very unusual in a country district&mdash;a number of houses built together in a cluster on a spot which was suitable for building. The river runs convenient to these houses, and so great was the flood that the houses were swept through and through.  Most of the furniture in the houses was carried out by the flood.  In one house all the bed-clothing was swept away, and in all the others the furniture and bedding were damaged to such an extent as to be practically useless.</P>
    <P>These are the conditions under which these people are now living.  The people are extremely poor.  In order to maintain themselves and their families the <Col N="1826" /> men have to go to Scotland or England for a period every year for the purpose of earning money.  For the last two years that source of revenue has not been very profitable.  As a consequence, the people are unable to make good the ravages of the flood.  In addition, owing to the wet season they have been unable to save any turf.  The bed of the river which caused the flooding is almost filled up with big boulders, so that the channel of the river has been turned in another direction.  The road way leading to the houses has become quite impassable for a distance of a quarter of a mile.  At the present time the river is raging along without any definite course, flowing over the land. In these circumstances it is only reasonable to expect that immediate action will be taken.  There is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary saying that it does not rest with him to take action. It does.</P>
    <P>Very recently some of these lands were purchased by the Land Commission, and I was on a deputation to the Land Commission, which pointed out that special attention should be given to the question of the price to be paid to the landlord in view of the danger of flooding.  The Land Commission very courteously promised to go into that matter before it was finally settled. Whether they have done that or not I do not know.  At any rate, up to the present they have given no indication. If the Land Commission feel justified in using public money for the purpose of paying the landlord for this property and handing it over to these small farmers, it is surely the duty of the Land Commission to see that the land upon which they have expended public money will not be destroyed through any neglect of theirs.  The whole parish includes somewhere about 400 families.  In the last twenty-five years the number of families in the area has decreased by 150.  Many of the farms at present are derelict and, a most unusual thing, the parish priest told me, is that for the last three years only two marriages have taken place in that parish.  He is of opinion that in the course of the next ten years the schools in the parish will be closed because there will be no children to <Col N="1827" /> attend.  Attention should be given immediately to providing these poor people with bed-clothing and some fire for the winter.  Many of them have lost their crops, their feeding stuffs for the cattle and their hay.  The average size of the farms in the district does not exceed the feeding of two cows.  It is necessary that immediate attention should be given to this problem and that some work should be found for these people.  In addition, some effective attempt should be made by the Land Commission to deal permanently with the situation there.</P>
    <P>Unless a number of these people are taken out of that area and provided with suitable farms where land can be found available, it does not require any great intelligence or mathematical resources to discover that the end of the little territory in Ballinagleragh is in sight.  I deliberately state that.  All I say in addition is that I have no wish to make political capital out of this matter, but I urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary that it is his duty to go down to this district and inspect for himself the condition of the people there.  If he does so, he will not have any hesitation in making a demand on this House to give him facilities to make provision for the wants of these people.  If he wishes to show himself capable for his job, he certainly will utilise the power he possesses to provide larger holdings of land for the people whom he may retain there by the removal of as many as can be conveniently given farms in better districts.</P>
    <P>The district is not a good farming one, but it is rich in minerals.  At the present time there are some financiers in New York and London negotiating for the right to investigate there for minerals, and they have gone a certain way in attempting that work. Surely, if financiers in New York and London can interest themselves in the possibilities of the mineral resources of Ballinagleragh district, where the people are at present living under such conditions, it would not be too much to ask the Government to make a geological survey, so as to be able to say to the financiers ready to invest their money: &ldquo;There are mineral deposits <Col N="1828" /> there, come and work them.&rdquo; These are some of the matters that are patent to any person interested in this district.  Surely it is only reasonable that the Government should undertake responsibility and save the people in this district from extermination.</P>

      <P>There were five queries contained in the question which I addressed to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to-day.  The first was whether reports had been received by the Department dealing with the recent flooding in Ballinagleragh district; second, whether these reports have been considered; third, what steps the Department intends to take to carry out the recommendations contained in the report; fourth, the nature of the proposals to be taken to alleviate the distress; and fifth, what steps are to be taken to prevent a recurrence of the disaster.  The reply we received to-day has been very unsatisfactory, and so it is necessary to make a further statement. On the 24th October I addressed a question to the Minister for Finance in connection with the floodings of this particular district.  I asked the Government to take all such steps as may be necessary by grants or otherwise, to help the poor people to tide over their losses and to relieve the prevailing distress.  The reply I received from the Parliamentary Secretary was most evasive and unsatisfactory. He said as the area was not an existing drainage area, no action could be taken by the Commissioners for the improvement of the drainage conditions in that area, and that grants for the relief of distress are not administered by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then asked the Parliamentary Secretary if it was not the duty of the Local Government Department to relieve distress of this nature, and he replied that that did not concern his Department.  I wrote a letter to the Minister for Local Government and drew his attention to the distress which existed in that district, and asked him to send down an inspector to make inquiries for himself. The reply I got from the Minister was that if there was distress there it was a matter for the County Council.  Again on 1st November, in the House, I drew <Col N="1829" /> attention to this matter, and I stressed the danger people were in should another flood take place.  What was the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary? He said there was no good in raising a caoin here about the deplorable condition of these people.  No words of mine can adequately convey to this House the poverty and distress existing amongst the people of this district. With them it is a fight for mere existence. From the quality of the land they can scarcely make sufficient to keep body and soul together.  Like the people of other districts in Leitrim, they are depending on their friends in America, and, were it not for American money, these poor people would be in a state of starvation.  Inspectors from the Land Commission recently visited this area&mdash;since the flooding&mdash;and statements were made locally to these people that houses would be built for the people in those cottages which were seriously threatened with destruction by the floods.  In the &ldquo;Leitrim Observer&rdquo;&mdash;the paper circulating in this district&mdash;there is a leading article by the editor which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A Land Commission Inspector, accompanied by an engineer, visited the Sradrinagh district, Ballinglera, in connection with the recent destruction following the floods, and the only thing they can suggest, as a practical means to help the families residing there, is that the eleven families should move away into more secure and better territories in order to avoid the dangers with which they are at present threatened, in the event of further floods.  To replace the embankments which were totally destroyed by the floods from the Stoney River would cost anything up to £1,600, and after going to this expense it is believed that the first flooding which would follow heavy rains, would again sweep this away. The cost of building eleven houses for these people would be less expensive, and it is believed that as soon as the report reaches those in charge of the Land Commission, something practical will be done.</P>
    <P>If these people are to be compelled by the Government to live in this district, I think proper houses, at least, should <Col N="1830" /> be built for them, and built in a position safe from flooding.</P>
    <P>In June last, I happened to be in that area and I was told that the Parliamentary Secretaries, Deputies Roddy and Dolan, had been there a day before and were looking over a list of names of people who would leave the district and take farms in Roscommon.  I wonder if there is any truth in that.  The Parliamentary Secretary (Deputy Roddy) is here now, and he can tell us if that is so, and how far his Department has gone in the matter of providing these people with farms in Roscommon.</P>

      <P>It has everything to do with it.  Something must be done by you people to relieve this distress.  Is it not your duty to do it&mdash;your duty to the people in Ballinagleragh?  You must either provide them with houses, if you are going to keep them there, or you must provide them with farms in other counties.  You must do one or the other of these two things.  You are not going to get out of it as you got out of it up to this.  We are not going to let you get out of it.</P>

      <P>I want to know what is going to be done for these people in the future.  The Government may say that they had not time to do anything, as the flooding is of recent occurrence. May I point out that as far back as July, 1927, there were officials and engineers from the Land Commission in that area, and they were then promising the people that they would get grants to relieve the distress which existed.  That was in July, 1927&mdash;immediately before the election.  Nothing has been done since.  I hope this is the last time that we will have to bring this matter up; that the Land Commission will do something practical for these people.</P>

      <P>Deputy Maguire, in introducing this motion, mixed up a number of matters that are not in any way relevant to the question asked by <Col N="1831" /> Deputy Holt to-day.  He forgot to mention, however, that the county council, of which he is a member, has a certain share of responsibility in this matter. If very acute distress prevails in this area, why has not the county council taken steps to repair or restore the 300 yards of roadway swept away by these floods?  It is a contract road and they are responsible for the maintenance and restoration of the roadway.  This flooding was abnormal.  The old people in that area admit quite candidly that never before had they experience of such a flood.  This is a mountain stream.  The Land Commission could expend thousands of pounds on the construction of, say, a concrete embankment and yet it would have no effect whatever in preventing the possibility of danger to those people who are living in the hamlet at the foot of the mountain.  It might happen that the torrent would break some yards away from the embankment and flow down a different course and, perhaps, bring the embankment along with it.  Instead of an embankment of that kind being a safeguard to the people, it would be a positive source of danger.  There is no possibility of preventing or stopping an unusual occurrence of that kind.  You might as well say that it would be possible to prevent the eruption of a volcano. Similar things are happening all over the country, and even the most skilled engineers in the country cannot suggest an adequate way of preventing dangers of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This flooding occurred, I think, on the 10th October last, and the only communication received by the Land Commission with regard to the matter was a letter from Father Brady, the local priest.  In response to that communication, a Land Commission Inspector was sent down immediately to report on the condition of affairs in that district.  The report, as I said in reply to Deputy Holt to-day, is under consideration by the Commissioners at the present time.  To my mind the report is not altogether satisfactory, and the engineer has been instructed to go back and make a further report after consultation with the county surveyor. If anything is to be done for the purpose <Col N="1832" /> of relieving the immediate flooding, it must be done in conjunction with the county council.  Deputy Maguire, I think, stated that this land was only acquired recently by the Land Commission.  As a matter of fact this land was acquired under the Land Act of 1891, and the holdings were vested long ago.  These lands are on the Kingston Estate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is correct.  Some of the farms were purchased recently, because I remember making representation in connection with them.  I think what the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind is the Sradrinagh area, but there is also the damage on the Yellow River, which we have not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerably more damage done on the other river.  Some of these lands were vested in the tenants a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is supposed to be an authority on the Land Act and he should know that the Land Commission have no authority to spend money on the improvement of estates already vested in the tenants without getting the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance.  There is just an element of doubt as to whether the county council are not responsible for carrying out such work as may be necessary for the relief of the present flooding.  The county council have, I think, certain powers with regard to sudden damage and I think, in the exercise of those powers, they could come to the immediate assistance of those people and spend a share of money, at any rate, in relieving the immediate necessities of the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Maguire referred to another matter.  He suggested that the Land Commission should come to the assistance of those people and supply them with bed-clothing.  Surely the Deputy knows that that is entirely a matter for the County Board of Health of which Board, I think, he is a member.</P>

      <P>If there is any distress of that kind, it is a matter for the County Board of Health and not for the Land Commission.  At all events, this matter is under consideration. What it is possible for the Land Commission to do I cannot exactly say at the moment, but whatever is done <Col N="1834" /> for the purpose of relieving distress in that particular district will have to be done in conjunction with the county council and the county council will have to assume their share of responsibility in the matter.</P>
