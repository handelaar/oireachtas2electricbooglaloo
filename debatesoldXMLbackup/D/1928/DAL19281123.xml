    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried yesterday evening to show that if the Government paid attention to the value of money paid on services, or paid for items which are certainly not productive in any shape for the country, that no matter how small the item was it could be made use of.  I said yesterday with regard to the Vote for the establishment of the Governor-General, and I think I proved it, that if that money were capitalised over a certain period it would mean that for the amount that we are paying, if that money were saved, the country would be the richer to the extent of between £400,000 and £500,000 over twenty-five years, on the basis of present and future Votes.  I <Col N="744" /> now turn to the Army.  It was stated by the Minister for Defence that the average cost to the State per soldier was something like £135 per year.  That sum of £135 is somewhere about the average grant made for a normal house that is built.  If, for every solider that we cut down expenditure on, we devoted that money towards helping to solve the housing question it would mean that you would have an extra sum of £135 for every house per year per man.  Deputy Davin suggested that at the present time he thought, with the huge number of unemployed people that there are in Ireland, it would be wrong to reduce the Army before certain works could be found to absorb them.  I say if that particular soldier is demobilised, and if he is employed on building a house, his salary would go in the subsidy or grant given for the building of the house so that the question as far as that soldier is concerned would be easily solved.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House at any length except to say that we on this side of the House recognise that the policy of the Government with regard to housing is all wrong.  Perhaps I might say this to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that while he may not approach the proposition from the same angle that we do, he has a responsibility to the State with regard to the Shannon scheme which he put through this House.  It is quite clear that there is going to be an over-production of consumable energy, to the extent of something like forty million units of electricity&mdash;that is, the overproduction for which there will be no use.  In other words, an over-production of electricity which will be wasted.</P>

      <P>It is not prophecy at all.  It is fact.  I say that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce considered the matter that he would try to find a means for the consumption of every unit of electricity generated, and would be interested in seeing the housing question solved.  I am prophesying an over production of electricity.  I do not wish to delay the House except to say that unless the expenditure of the Government is tackled on the basis of seeing what return the State is going to get, whether they are going to increase their assets or keep on spending money on frivolous things while the country is getting no benefit in return, it is about time that the Government would either go out of office or at least change their attitude, and see if it would not be possible to do what the people of this country consider to be necessary, and which will have to be done eventually.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Opposition have the feeling that they have not been treated very well in this discussion so far&mdash;that Deputies on the Government Benches took no notice of them.  I do not know that my intervention will be regarded as much of a compliment in that respect.  It is said that a lot of nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest.  We had a surfeit of it during the course of this debate, and the Front Opposition Bench should be suffering at the moment from a bad attack of mental dyspepsia.  I have great sympathy with the Ceann Comhairle, who had to listen to all the speech-making on this discussion yesterday, and which is continued to-day.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle said the other day that his heart bled for me.  Well, physiologically, I think that is a heresy.  Nevertheless, I feel very much for the Ceann Comhairle, and I reciprocate the kindly feeling he expressed for me.  What I feel is that the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should have their brains encased in steel.  I certainly do not envy them their salaries, because I think they are very much underpaid for what they have to undergo in this House from time to time.  I was sorry, in the course of this debate, to hear Deputy de Valera complain that he was the victim of what might be described as moral assassination. I have no sympathy with that, but somehow I have the feeling that anybody who would look at Deputy de Valera would not regard him as a successful Don Juan or a successful Don Giovanni.  I remember, in connection with defamation, that there was a certain royal household half a century ago a member of which was physically effeminate.  It was supposed that he was sexually debilitated.</P>

      <P>Anyhow, suddenly the rumour got afloat that he was the father of six unofficial children.  A communistic paper made the comment on that that they were only boasting. However, I believe, notwithstanding the rumour, that he remained unmarried until the day of his death.  Now I have not heard very much in the way of useful suggestions with regard to this Appropriation Bill as to where economies can be effected.  Of course the old story about the Civic Guards and the Army was introduced.  I believe that if you had not the Army and the Civic Guards that you would have anarchy. I believe that the expenses for both <Col N="747" /> forces have secured, as I said before, constitutional law and the rule of the majority in this country, and I say that they are absolutely necessary in their present numbers.  I believe that if you wanted to raise a loan in the morning and if these forces were abolished, that loan would be a failure. I think that the Civic Guards and the Army are a necessity for this country, and that economically they are a good proposition.  I have heard a lot said about the delinquencies of the Government. I am not going to get into that or defend them.  They can defend themselves.  But there are other people who have their delinquencies, and I would refer them, in conclusion, to a speech recently delivered by the President of Sinn Fein.  If they study that speech they may become a little more moderate in accusing other people.</P>

      <P>In listening to the debate last evening, I was very much impressed by the remarks of Deputy Corish in which he brought to the notice of the Executive Council the destruction of Liberty Hall in 1916. The extraordinary thing to me is that since 1916 there has been no compensation whatever paid to that public body as regards the destruction of Liberty Hall and the furniture in it.  I know another case in the country somewhat similar to that.  Perhaps it may differ from that case in more ways than one.  It is a case of a house that was attacked on the 2nd May, 1916, by the British forces.  After five or six hours of stubborn resistance the house was partly, or I might say wholly, demolished. When the military got possession of that house they destroyed the furniture and took away valuable property that was inside it.  Subsequently there were two lives lost.  There was an application made, I think, in 1922 to this Government when it came into power, but for some reasons unexplained the application for compensation was turned down.  I made several inquiries from time to time, but I could get no reason to explain why the application was turned down.  You must all remember that the men who went out in 1916, amongst others the President and some members sitting on the Front <Col N="748" /> Bench opposite, nobly fought for the cause of their country.  Their action helped to bring this House into existence.  If it were not for them, I doubt if some members on the benches opposite would be occupying to-day the positions they do.  Coming back to the case which I was dealing with, and which I hope the President and the Executive Council will consider, I trust that the Minister, when replying would take it into consideration, and do something in the way of giving compensation for this house.  The house cost £2,000 to build twenty-five years ago. The furniture alone was worth between £400 and £500.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate I heard references and comments made to the interests of other countries, such, for instance, as Soviet Russia, and Poland, I think it is very unfair, when we seem to take such a great interest in the affairs of other countries, that we should not first look after the interests of our own people and do justice to the men by compensating them&mdash;men who made such noble sacrifices as they did make in 1916.</P>
      <P>My friend Deputy Sheehy, the gallant member for West Cork, spoke about the catches of herrings and mackerel down in Kinsale and Baltimore, and said it would be advisable to keep them in this country.  To my mind, it would, in view of the way that taxation is increasing year by year.  In view of that we will require all these herrings and mackerel because we will have nothing else to fall back upon, and it will be well for us to have the herrings and the mackerel. The ratepayers of the country have been reduced to such a state that they can hardly eke out an existence.  It is very painful for me to have to refer to the case that I mentioned.  I do not wish to go further into that matter, but I would like to lay all the facts before the House.  I am absolutely certain that the President, when this case is brought before him, will consider it sympathetically, and I am absolutely sure that he will do full justice to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been left under some mystification by Deputy Briscoe.  One is whether he realises <Col N="749" /> what the Appropriation Bill means or not.  A Deputy announced last night that in the discussion on the Appropriation Bill we do not see as we ordinarily do a number of civil servants present so that the points raised could be answered.  Apparently the Deputy thinks the Appropriation Bill is a second gallop on the Estimates, and that it gives him a chance of raising the things he had forgotten previously. There is a certain amount of mystification as to what the Appropriation Bill is, judging by the speeches delivered.  This is not a runover the Estimates again.  That is not what the procedure has been.  The Deputies are not used to the procedure. The procedure that has been found useful in practice has been that on an Appropriation Bill general matters, but not small details, such as questions about old age pensions and certain small things affecting Deputies' constituents, are raised, general matters relevant to the particular Bill; not general taxation, for taxation has nothing to do with this.  The second matter about which Deputy Briscoe left me in doubt was what the Shannon scheme has to do with housing.  I wish that point had been developed. He contented himself with a prophecy which he describes as a fact, and the fact is that under no conditions can there be used in this country more than a certain number of millions of units per annum.  That is what he calls a fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I said yesterday I thought it would have been far better if the Minister for Finance, who is responsible to the House for finance, would be in the House to hear criticisms of the Bill and to give explanations if necessary.  I thought it was not fair that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be left here to answer for another Minister's Bill.  With regard to the Shannon scheme, I did not make the statement that under no circumstances could a certain number of units be used. What I said was that a certain number could not be used under existing conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested a prophecy, though I may belong to a nation of prophets.  I say under existing conditions that the greatest number of units for which an outlet can be found would be about 75,000,000, and that at some future date, when industry increases, as I hope it will, there will be a certain increase in the number of houses, and there will then be a greater use of the current produced.  But I say that for a certain number of years there will be a surplus amount of energy generated.  Now, that is not prophecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says something will not happen, and then he says that is not prophecy.  It seems to me he does not understand the meaning of the word prophecy.  I would like if the Deputy would seek the opportunity of giving his views as to what are the existing circumstances with regard to his assumption in that matter, and what the likelihood is of an increase in consumption if we do something about housing.  I do not know what it is that is required to be done about housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That we should build a sufficient number of houses to raise the consumption of electricity from 75,000,000 units to 110,000,000 units? That is the problem the Deputy has to face if he is going to get the Shannon current utilised.  Deputy Corish raised a point, dating back to 1916 about Liberty Hall, and Deputy Ruttledge raised a point with regard to certain ex-R.I.C. men and particularly one man.  These are not matters that should be raised under the Appropriation Bill.  How what happened to Liberty Hall in 1916 becomes relevant to the Appropriation Bill in 1928 I cannot see.  With regard to the ex-R.I.C. man about whom the Minister for Finance is alleged to have made a promise and about whom I think he made a certain statement, and asked that a certain letter of his should be read before the matter was raised again, that surely is not a matter that falls under the Appropriation Bill of 1928.  Deputy Fahy is concerned about a number of <Col N="751" /> Commissions we have set up to deal with a big number of things, and he hopes that good results will come from them.  Having by implication derided the various Commissions that have been set up he suggested that another Commission should be set up with general terms of reference to find out what good we are getting from the expenditure of money on educational services in the country.  That is a Commission that might be usefully set up, for there is too much disposition in this House to say on education votes: &ldquo;This is for education and let us spend all the money we can on it.&rdquo;  The educational service is one regarding which there is less criticism and analysis than other services, and it costs the country very much.  All we got from Deputy Fahy by way of criticism in his speech in which he derided Commissions in general is the suggestion that we might have a Commission to inquire into the question of what is the good of the money spent on education, what is the good of education, and what is the result of the expenditure of money on education. Previous to that he gave an example of how the educational system is overborne by the political situation in the country, and he gave a certain anecdote with regard to a teacher putting particular types of questions to a class.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera wants our Ambassador in the United States of America to be able to answer questions about the Twenty-six Counties, and by implication about the Six Counties, and whether there is one nation or whether there are two nations here.  Deputy Fahy told the Dáil that an inspector criticised a teacher for asking this type of question, and Deputy de Valera criticised the Ambassador who does not give the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Deputy de Valera was recently announced to have stated that his policy with regard to the Twenty-Six Counties and the Six Counties was that there was no clear-cut solution, that it was better not to talk too much about it, a matter on which silence is ordained at home is a matter on which the ambassadors abroad must lecture the people, and a matter on which inspectors get aggrieved because <Col N="752" /> teachers put questions about it to classes.  Is that what is to pass for criticism in the Appropriation Bill? Deputy Little criticised external affairs.  I gathered that Deputy Little has pledged that when his Party comes into power one of the first things to be achieved is the neutrality of this country guaranteed, as he previously said, by France, Germany, England and the United States.  One of the aims of the Republican Party, as it is called, is that we are going to get our country's neutrality guaranteed by these four nations.  We gathered last night, for the first time, what is to result from this neutrality, or what is the advantage that is going to accrue to the country when that guaranteed neutrality is secured.  We were told about Belgium.  I interjected: &ldquo;Did the guarantee of neutrality save Belgium very much?&rdquo; I was told it had not, but &ldquo;Look at the advantage it has been to other countries.  What we want is to have our neutrality guaranteed. If it is broken it will not do us much good.  We will be subject to the horrors of invasion to which Belgium was subject, but it will do other countries some good.&rdquo;  It is a bright prospect.  It is not the prospect that previously was held out as a result of guaranteed neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Deputy had a second example to put before the Dáil; he had the example of Holland.  He referred to the neutrality of Holland and emphasised that the territory of Holland was not invaded.  And why? Both countries, both peoples, were anxious to invade Holland, and what was to prevent their doing so? It was because they had the object lesson of what world opinion meant in the case of the invasion of Belgium.  By what State or nation was the neutrality of Holland guaranteed?  The Deputy will find, though it may not be any addition to European history, that there was no guarantee of neutrality given to Holland save whatever guarantee Holland had in her own armed forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Had not Belgium the same guarantee? Had not Belgium an identical guarantee with Holland, and <Col N="753" /> did Belgium's armed forces do anything more than attempt to protect their own country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The object sought here is to abolish the Army and the Civic Guards.  We are told they are no good to prevent invasion.  Let us aim at guaranteed neutrality, and the result of that will be that it is going to be a tremendous weapon from the point of view of world opinion on behalf of certain other nations; but the country is not going to be preserved from invasion.  Deputy Little forgot to say whether public opinion was swayed or was not swayed by what Deputy Law referred to&mdash;a certain invasion that took place of the sovereign rights of the Greeks at a certain period.  The historical lesson was not completed by Deputy Little.  The Deputy set out to prove the thesis that guaranteed neutrality was the aim and object of the Party on behalf of whom he spoke.  The Deputy wanted to show us what were the advantages of guaranteed neutrality, but then he stopped very short. The idea of public opinion being swayed was given in the case of Belgium, but it failed in the case of Greece. The idea of securing benefit from guaranteed neutrality was not shown in the case of Belgium.  The virtue of guaranteed neutrality was attempted to be shown by Deputy Little, but when the actual results of guaranteed neutrality were specified, it would scarcely be regarded as guaranteed neutrality at all.  I do not know by what method exactly the Deputy would seek to have the guaranteed neutrality for this country established, or how he would manage to get that neutrality guaranteed by France, England, Germany and the United States in the event of a war arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clery was very concerned about some items which pertain to my own Department in particular.  One was the establishing of some new method dealing with kelp.  He made <Col N="754" /> the allegation that a letter was written to my Department three months ago, and no acknowledgment was received. A Deputy who waits for three months nursing a grievance about a letter that was not acknowledged, and then simply talks about it here, can scarcely be considered serious in regard to the business about which he wrote.  If the Deputy was really serious about the kelp industry, and was anxious to see how far his suggestions could be made use of, he would scarcely have waited so long.  The Deputy wanted to find out what exactly the Department was doing.  There were many occasions during the days on which the Dáil was sitting when the Deputy could have put me a simple question or written me a note asking what was happening about the letter he sent.  Instead of that, he left over this business, which apparently is very important for his constituency, for three months until he got an opportunity of parading the fact that his letter was not replied to as a fault of the Department.  I hope the Deputy will give me a reference to the date upon which he sent the letter.  He promised to do so.  We will see then if the Department has any record of that letter being received, or if there is any record of an answer being sent out.</P>
    <P>It is peculiar if the Department would not reply to a letter about kelp, because if there is one thing that has occupied the attention of a particular section of the Department during the last year it has been the question of kelp.  At the moment at least two bodies from outside have been called in to give the benefit of their advice on proposals before the Department.  A variety of proposals in regard to kelp have come forward of which two stand out.  Discrimination between the two needs some care and this matter has to be very carefully considered before a decision can be come to.  The proposal will have to be considered from many angles, from the chemical, the financial and the market angles.  The proposals are in and consideration has been given to them for many months.  I do not admit that there has been any delay in dealing with this matter and I do not promise that the matter will be cleared up quite soon.  If the Deputy had been <Col N="755" /> really concerned for his constituency he should have done something more than merely send in a letter and then wait for three months until he got a chance of complaining about it.  Deputy Clery speaks in a vague way of deposits of clay in Erris and he asks what has my Department been doing in regard to mineral deposits.  Just because the Deputy does not know about a thing, therefore he concludes that nothing has been done.  I wish the Deputy had been more precise and more definite in what he was speaking about.  I know that there are parties definitely interested in certain deposits in Mayo and I know there are other clay deposits in which people are interested along the western seaboard outside Mayo.  I cannot identify any particular place from the vague reference the Deputy has made. He can always address a letter to me or to my private secretary and through myself or my secretary he can get into touch with the people who will tell him whatever information there is available. Instead of that it is thought to be the duty of a Deputy&mdash;a duty fulfilled or achieved to his constituents&mdash;to have something which he believes can be worked up or attended to.  He remains quiet about this and then uses it as a complaint whenever an occasion offers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went further to complain of my attitude with regard to suggestions about trading in fish with Russia.  I do not regard the suggestions that were made, as they were made here, as very serious or as seriously meant.  If the suggestions that the Deputy has to offer about kelp are on the same level of seriousness with that suggestion, I do not think very much attention ought to be paid to them.  I wish people would understand what I did say with regard to trading with Russia, fish being the particular item under consideration. As far as trade relations with Russia are concerned, that matter will be dealt with in the order of its importance. The matter of trade relations with certain countries is dealt with according to the order of importance, political, diplomatic, or from the point of view of trade.  I asked was there any hindrance to the people who <Col N="756" /> wished to trade with Russia at the moment, and if it could be pointed out that any impediment could be traced to the fact that there were no formal trade relations with Russia, I would like to have it brought to my notice. That would immediately bring Russia up from the position it occupies in our list; Russia would then reach a plane of higher importance.  I had only one proposition put to me with regard to an interchange of commodities between this country and Russia, but that proposition, when examined, did not prove to be a business-like one.  That was the only case that was brought to me.  If any further business proposition came up like that, and if we found that any difficulty in dealing with Russia arose out of the fact that we had not formal trade relations established with Russia, then that matter could be attended to.  If people think that the reason there is no trade relation with Russia is because of some previous contrary agreement with England, then I ask them to test that out by bringing forward some business-like proposition which would help us to establish some form of trade relations with Russia.  I have no hesitation in entering into this matter at the moment if it becomes sufficiently important.</P>
    <P>Eventually there will be an opportunity of opening relations with Russia in a formal way.  These negotiations will establish trade relations in a formal way; but with so many countries to open up trade relations with what happens is that the most important are taken first.  Russia at the moment, reckoned on the volume of trade with that country, ranks very low in the scale. I would like that the question of the export of herrings should be considered from another angle.  Is it alleged that there are greater catches of herrings than what can be disposed of profitably at the moment?  Or even if that question cannot be answered affirmatively, can it be said that the herring catches that are made when disposed of are disposed of less profitably than they could be disposed of to Russia? Is that the allegation that is made?  Is it the allegation that the opening of direct communication by sea with Russia would mean better profits for the fishermen who catch these herrings? These <Col N="757" /> are the things that should be put up formally here in this House if there is going to be a case made for the establishment of trade relations with Russia. These are some of the matters with which I dealt when the question of a trade in fish was last raised in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig referred to police raids and to matters that he had been told just before coming into the House. He made certain allegations in his statement.  It is quite impossible to follow that statement without the name of the party against whom the allegation is made or the name of the locality. Surely this matter that he raised is a matter for a parliamentary question. It is a matter for a parliamentary question except that there is only one impediment to a parliamentary question from the point of view of the Deputy. It does not give him the same opportunity of making the insinuations that he made without the party whom he is charging being named, and the charges being precisely stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no insinuations at all.  It was only in the interest of the general co-operation of the National Forces that I made a statement. I am quite sure that if the Fianna Fáil were not in the House that every one of them would find that their houses would have been raided in the same way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>The insinuation that was made was that a gentleman, an official in some way of the police forces, had been drinking in a district for two days, and in order to excuse his conduct, to explain his absence from his office, or his presence in that district for the period he had to make an allegation that he was engaged in supervising certain people in that district. That is what I regard as an insinuation, that is the charge the Deputy has made, and he puts it forward on the word of a friend of his with the statement that he believes his friend to be as truthful as anybody who will advise the Minister for Justice when he comes to reply.  That charge, at any rate, is made without giving the name of the man against whom it is made, and without an opportunity <Col N="758" /> for having the matter investigated and giving, perhaps, a certain answer.  But the advantages conferred by that method on the Deputy are quite clear.  He gets a certain amount of publicity by raising the matter in this way, and he is able to get that publicity without there being any chance of the thing being contradicted here in the House.  These are the advantages which he would not get by putting down a question giving the names and having the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore revealed himself in his usual simple way yesterday.  He challenged any Deputy voting on this Bill hereafter if he could say that he was satisfied with all the Votes.  He answered that question for himself by saying that no Deputy could possibly, honestly and conscientiously, say that. Therefore, his argument was that this Appropriation Bill should be refused. It was not long until we heard from certain Fianna Fáil members afterwards that they did not disagree with all the Votes that are going to be passed.  Would Deputy Moore's argument run the counter way and say that if the Fianna Fáil Deputies are not dissatisfied with all the Votes, that they should vote for the Bill; or is this a further example of the simplicity which the Deputy ordinarily brings to bear on matters in this House?  He said that Deputy Byrne had spoken of strengthening the industrial arm, and he said that that was a peculiar statement to come from Deputy Byrne, seeing that the Deputy is a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  It was a very correct statement to come from Deputy Byrne, being, as he is, a member of this Party that has tariffed 50 per cent. of the tariffable imports to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture did not go to the Chamber of Commerce to preach protection. Deputy Moore seems to think that he was brought down there to preach protection, and he seems to think that any Minister going to the Chamber of Commerce must be invited always to speak for or against protection.  But at any rate, if there are to be discussions on tariffs of a general type, why not proceed on the recognition of facts, and a recognition of the fact that there have been tariffs placed on a considerable number of articles imported previously without tariff into this country? I have given a calculation that fifty per cent. of the articles which can be tariffed and that are imported into the country have been tariffed.  I have always said when I mention that figure of fifty per cent. that it may be argued as to whether or not I have to segregate all the articles in that calculation on which a tariff could or could not be placed.  There could be an argument about that, but eventually one can get a basis that there are certain groups of articles coming in on which a tariff could be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get back to the time when the State was established and see what percentage of articles coming in have been in fact tariffed, and in the face of that I ask would Deputy Moore still consider this a free trade Government? Again, we get from Deputy Moore the type of remark which apparently it is part of the considered policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to make.  He asked what is the director of industry doing to liquidate mills going out of commission, and then he gives a list of the mills that are going out of commission. I have stated previously, and I gave, in reply to a question put down, a list of places that have been closed down.  I said that on a calculation based on this and any conclusions to be drawn from it that there was a tendency for them <Col N="760" /> to be wrong.  I heard a great many calculations made on that matter, and most of them wrong.  Is it alleged of any country that an index of the prosperity of the country can be made clearly and completely on the basis of the figures of the number of factories that have gone out of existence?  If that were the case, it would appear that in the last five years the industrial position of Germany had become much worse, because in Germany in the last five years large numbers of factories have gone completely out of existence. About 70 per cent. of her factories did disappear.  They disappeared for rebuilding, reconstruction, and because there were big amalgamations.  Goods that previously were made in small factories, small units, were afterwards made in economic units.  A simple calculation of the factories gone out of existence in Germany would, if that were an index, leave us a picture of Germany that does not correspond with the truth.  Yet we know that is not so. What were the causes?</P>
    <P>Supposing there was to be one big central flour mill erected in this country.  It is quite likely that one properly equipped mill built in a suitable position would result in the wiping out of nine-tenths of the country mills that at present exist. Yet, that mill when erected could supply most of the needs of the country, and certainly could supply all the needs of the country previously supplied by the mills put out of action. That central mill would probably reduce the number of people employed. It would be more efficiently equipped, and yet that mill would be a more economic unit and would turn out more goods than the twelve or thirteen mills at present in existence.  According to the calculation of Deputy Moore, we would have the position that the number of mills in the Free State had been reduced by eleven or twelve.  That sort of simplicity may be good enough in a debate, but it does not do for a criticism of the economic policy of the country.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy de Valera stated the other night that if the business people, or the agriculturalists or, generally, the people who are engaged in production, did not show sufficient enterprise it would be the Government's business in some way to remedy that.  How was not precisely stated&mdash;these things are never precisely stated.  But I have heard that previously advanced by other speakers on that side&mdash;that the Government should run industries&mdash;not help to run them&mdash;and at the same time we are told that no official of the Government should be paid more than £1,000 a year.  Business would be taken over where industrialists fail, where good chances are obviously seen&mdash;because the Government is not going to go into bad business&mdash;and the Government is to go into industry.  It is to do that with the salaries of the managing directors scaled down so that they could never raise beyond £1,000 a year, and there is going to be success, prosperity and good living in the country after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore was very anxious about the transport situation, and, like many other people before him, complained that nothing had been done&mdash; or rather he did not complain, because he did not advance, even by insinuation, that he wanted co-ordination of the different branches of transport. But he wanted to know what is being done about it.  He wanted to know. He did not offer any suggestions.  I waited a long time to hear Deputy Moore, who is recognised, I believe, as an expert in transport, to indicate what he thinks ought to be done, but so far we have failed to hear that from <Col N="762" /> him though this year's Appropriation Bill has offered him a chance to do so. Certainly a speech like that on this debate would have been much more relevant than nine-tenths of the matters that were debated.  We got nothing but insinuations from the Deputy that there was no indication given as to what was going to be done about this. The Deputy himself did not even state the facts upon which a decision could be taken.  He did not even venture a suggestion.  He did not even indicate his belief that all the data are available on which a decision could be made.  He just wanted to know, and he complained. Surely that constructive criticism which Deputy Little said has been forthcoming so often and so copiously from that side might have been given on this very important matter of transport.  Even the Deputy might have advanced timidly to express the point of view that there should be co-ordination.  A great many people have advanced to that point, at any rate, but Deputy Moore preferred to be silent on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carney was concerned about the people of Donegal.  The position of Donegal is quite well known.  Anybody who looks at the map will see one or two of the things to which Deputy Carney referred.  But I cannot understand one of his points.  He said that this was a county united only by a bridge at Ballyshannon with the Twenty-six Counties, a bridge, he went on to state, which could not bear the weight of traffic that would have to pass over it if all the needs of Donegal were to be supplied via that bridge.  At any rate he said that the people of Donegal could not pay the huge rates that would be imposed if all their material had to come from Dublin. Again we got no suggestion.  We were told that the bridge at Ballyshannon cannot bear the traffic, and even if it could the people in Donegal cannot bear the rates.  Therefore they are driven to Derry, and the Deputy said that they must go to Derry and then they have to pay 33?% on one thing and 25% on another, and, he hastened to add, mind you, that that was not an argument against tariffs.  I do not know what it is an argument in favour of.  I do not know what useful suggespres <Col N="763" /> tion he was indicating to the House as to how the situation might be remedied.</P>

I wonder if the Deputy would consult any people who have got money for destroyed buildings to find out how far they are satisfied that the compensation money covers the cost of rebuilding.  Will the Deputy go further and state, even if the money did cover the cost of rebuilding, why we should impose on people who were unfortunate enough to have their property destroyed, the condition that they must use stone from Mountcharles, when the people of the country generally have not such a condition imposed upon them? Let there be no confusion of thought with regard to the people who are rebuilding in O'Connell Street.  They are not favoured citizens; they are unfortunate citizens whose property was destroyed and whose compensation awards do not in fact pay for the new buildings that they have to put up.  Why should a heavier burden be put on those people?  They are not in a better position than the ordinary citizen, and an argument founded, as Deputy Carney did found his argument, on the fact that they are getting £18,000, has no relevancy, or, if it has any relevancy, it is only to show that these people are <Col N="766" /> worse off than people who enter on building on their own.  Why should they be made to take stone from Mountcharles?  They would themselves, presumably, take stone from Mountcharles if Mountcharles stone is cheaper, quality and durability being regarded.</P>

Certainly there is a case if those are the facts, but they are not.  Is the ordinary citizen going to be asked to use Mountcharles stone instead of imported stone?  It is either a case of protecting Irish material or the Deputy runs off on another line that I never heard before, that there is some agreement in the building trade against the use of Irish material.</P>

      <P>What I was suggesting was that there had been a general suggestion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there had been complete irrelevancy in the discussion &mdash;that every word which was said from this side was irrelevant&mdash;and that therefore that must have gone on without the proper supervision of the authority in the Chair, and that now that a proper authority is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister made no such suggestion.  The suggestion was made by Deputy Flinn, whose suggestions are uniformly and persistently made against the occupants of the Chair, whoever they may be and whoever they have been, since he came into the House.  I want to tell the Deputy that he cannot continue that particular course.  No such suggestion was made by the Minister.  It was made by the Deputy.  It is an untrue suggestion and unworthy of the Deputy&mdash;at least.  I should say that it is in consonance with his usual conduct.</P>

      <P>I do not know if we can now discuss the question of what has happened.  The Deputy asked me the question: Is it in order for a Deputy to say that a Minister is making a privileged attack? I did not hear these words used.  I <Col N="771" /> thought different words were used.  It is not in order for any Deputy to make an attack upon the Chair&mdash;upon anybody occupying the Chair, whether the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, or a Deputy who is a member of the Panel of Chairmen.  I did not catch any reference at all to the fact that the Minister was speaking last.  The reference I caught seemed to have reference to the Chair.  In any event the question has been put and decided, and I do not think we can go back on it now.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to say this. A certain question has been put from the Chair and decided, and we cannot have any point of order raised on that &mdash;that matter is now decided.  The Deputy is mistaken altogether in his attitude towards the Chair if he thinks that, when a point of order is put to the Chair, the Chair admits that it is a matter for argument.  I answered Deputy de Valera's point, though I think there was no necessity, strictly speaking, to answer the point at all, seeing that it relates to something that was already decided.  The question is decided, and a point of order cannot be raised now on it, but if any Deputy desires to raise the point generally and gives me notice of it, he can raise it subsequently, or the matter can be raised generally by a motion in the House, but no question can be raised now on a decision which has been reached.  The Deputy will realise that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get clear on this.  This is rather a disorderly discussion.  Deputy Flinn has taken up a particular attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. COONEY Mr. COONEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COONEY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That attitude has been consistent towards the occupants of the Chair.  When Deputy Padraic Hogan (Clare) was Leas-Cheann Comhairle he was told by Deputy Flinn that a ruling he had given was a &ldquo;damn shame.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asked a question and I must answer it. Further, when other Deputies were in the Chair&mdash;when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair, the same thing happened constantly.  The Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle must not be put into the position of being constantly harped at.  They are in quite a different position to Ministers.  A Minister is fair game.  In fact, Deputies have attacked Ministers to an almost endless degree.  As I have pointed out frequently, to attack a Minister is generally in order, but it is not in order to adopt the same attitude towards the Chair.  I dislike discussing this general matter in the absence of Deputy Flinn, but it might be possible to have it raised with Deputy Flinn present.  We might possibly get the whole matter settled by next Wednesday. It was stated here a few days ago that when the Chair called upon a Minister to conclude the debate, that was the closure.  That is an insinuation <Col N="774" /> against the Chair which is constantly being made.  Such a statement as was made here that the cat has come back was an improper statement in reference to the Chairman of this House.  The general impression I received is that Deputy Flinn's attitude towards the Chair is altogether a wrong attitude. If I am deceived in that, I shall be the first person to acknowledge that I am deceived.  There are 152 Deputies in the House and myself.  With 151 of these Deputies it would appear that the Chair, whoever occupies it, is able to agree.  With the 152nd there is some disagreement and there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case that it is the fault of the Deputy.  As I say, if I am deceived in my view as to the desire of a particular Deputy constantly to treat the Chair with disrespect, then I shall be very glad to be undeceived and very glad indeed to start upon a new line. I feel that if responsible Deputies on the Front Opposition Bench are desirous of consulting the Ceann Comhairle on this matter it may be susceptible of settlement.  I think it is hardly susceptible of settlement by speeches across the House, and not susceptible at all of settlement by disorderly interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, and as far as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is concerned, we are quite prepared to discuss the matter either in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or with the responsible leaders of the Opposition Party.  That particular discussion might lead to a solution of the situation in which it appears to Deputies on the Opposition Benches that a particular Deputy is singled out for special treatment.  That is the only suggestion I can make.  I am prepared to allow that suggestion to work, but for the reasons I gave before on one occasion&mdash;not from my own point of view, because my own position in the Chair is perhaps such that I can refrain from taking notice of a great many things which may be said, but from the point of view of other Deputies who may succeed me in the Chair and who may have to fulfil the difficult duties that fall to the Chair&mdash;from that point of view I regard it as my bounden duty to see that a proper attitude is maintained by Deputies towards the occupant of the Chair.  That is my <Col N="775" /> principal concern in the matter.  If there has been any mistake or any difficulty it may be solved.  I think it cannot now be solved by Deputies, and particularly by taking it in the House when Deputy Flinn is absent.</P>

If there is no misunderstanding, and if any Deputy endeavours to carry out a particular line towards the Chair, that endeavour is bound to be unsuccessful. That is the whole situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">

      <P>In view of the fact that there was on the part of the Chair an obvious misunderstanding as to the words used by Deputy Flinn, in view of the further fact that Deputies do not appear to know why the suspension was moved, and the additional fact that Deputy Flinn was, in my opinion, no more disorderly than many other Deputies have been on many occasions, will you take a motion now to rescind the decision that has been arrived at?</P>

      <P>I will not.  I suggest to the Deputy that there is a method by which a solution can be found before Wednesday.  I will not take a motion now.  I disagree with the suggestion that any other Deputy was disorderly to the Chair in <Col N="776" /> that particular fashion&mdash;I do not think that is so.

      <P>Might I give what seems to me an explanation of the words that the Chair complained of, particularly about &ldquo;the cat comes back&rdquo;?  I did not catch that word. It seems to me that the idea is that you are stricter than the previous occupant of the Chair.  Surely we all recognise that some people in the Chair have a greater degree of strictness than others.  I do not think that particular remark was in any way uncomplimentary to the Chair.</P>

      <P>That may be.  It seems to me that the Deputy was introducing a particular meaning in the Minister's speech deal-with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle which the Minister's speech did not contain. It is quite in order to say that a certain statement was irrelevant.  The Chair does not take that as a reflection on the Chair.  If it did, the Chair would be very busy rebutting reflection on the Chair.  When I read the debates, I charge myself continually with extreme leniency.  As I say, if there is a misunderstanding it can be cleared up between the leaders of Deputy Flinn's Party, the Leader of the House, and the Ceann Comhairle before the next meeting.</P>

      <P>May I make this clear?  The previous remarks made by Deputy Flinn were certainly considered by the Chair, but the subsequent action was taken by the Chair arising out of what you understood Deputy Flinn to have said.  I want to make it clear that what I heard Deputy Flinn definitely state was &ldquo;privileged attack.&rdquo;  You may have imagined him to have said &ldquo;the privilege of the cat.&rdquo;  That was wrong on your part, and I wish to have on record what he said.  I took the precaution of asking Deputy Flinn if what I heard was right and he said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  You are not clear yet as to what he has said. I would like to ask you now if you still think he said &ldquo;the privilege of the cat,&rdquo; or if you are satisfied that the words he used were &ldquo;privileged attack&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Standing Orders do not permit of a review of a case in which a decision of the House has been taken in a matter of this kind.  They are such that they exalt into a very important and privileged position the Speaker of the House.  That is a position as to which I think there is general agreement amongst all Parties from their experience of the attitude which must be maintained to the Chairman of the House. If an occasion should arise when there is disagreement as to the judgment of the Chair, that cannot be settled immediately.  It may be settled afterwards and ought to be settled satisfactorily, but certainly not in the heated atmosphere in which the incident occurs.  The spirit of the Standing Orders, as I read them, is that a decision of the Chair must be accepted without question, and the decision of the House which follows upon that, whether we subscribe to it one way or another, is fundamental to the conduct of business.  If there has been a misunderstanding in this connection, if there has been a misconception, if there has been any incident which ought to be taken into account this is not the time for it.  It cannot be done satisfactorily. We have business to discharge here and can only do it in the light of the Standing Orders as they are framed.  I think members generally will agree that subsequent to such an occasion as has taken place with regard to the decision of the House is not the time to settle any matter in dispute and I would suggest that it should be allowed to drop at the moment.</P>

We all realise that it would be impossible to conduct this or any other assembly if <Col N="778" /> the decision of the Chair were not upheld. It seems to me a palpable injustice has been done.  It seems to me&mdash; I have been here during the whole debate, as many of the members were not &mdash;that the injustice might be undone as quickly as it was done.  Deputy Flinn's general attitude in the House is one we cannot discuss now, but his attitude and his statements which brought about the decision which has been come to were not, I believe, intended to be offensive to the Chair, and were not directed to the Chair.  If the Ceann Comhairle, as he certainly did, did think it was offensive to the Chair he was mistaken.  I believe from what has been said that the Ceann Comhairle probably realises by now that he misunderstood the statement.  Therefore, sir, again by courtesy of the Chair, perhaps as an injustice has been done to a member of the House, that injustice might be undone just as hastily as it was done.</P>

He refused to repeat it, and therefore I had no means of determining what was said except by my first impression.  I think the atmosphere created by the discussion we had is a good and proper one, but I do not think we can go into the matter now.  I think before next Wednesday, if there has been a misunderstanding, that can be cleared up. The suspension of the Deputy would last for a fortnight.  Deputy O'Kelly stated that what Deputy Flinn said was imperfectly understood, and that the Deputy did not mean any reflection upon the Chair.  On that statement coming from the Deputy himself the matter might be settled, but I do not think we can settle it now.  A decision of the House has been taken, and cannot be gone into now, but if there is an injustice it can be settled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass urges the criticism against my Department that it has been very ineffective in the matter of bringing in legislation this year.  It is a strange complaint. Previously we used to hear about the rush of legislation there was.  Now apparently the Deputy's mind runs to a confusion as between running round with legislation, whether legislation is of use or not, and doing nothing.  He has failed even then to tell us what part of the industrial activities of the country can be benefited by legislation, which has not been brought in.  That is surely part of the following out of the statement the Deputy made, that only three small Bills were introduced by the Minister this year, and that therefore he is doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I wish to correct the Minister.  I said these Bills were the only signs we could find of the activities of the Department in the Dáil.  We could find no signs outside the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If these are signs in the Dáil and the Deputy could never find any outside notwithstanding what I said on the Estimate, I think there is apparently very little ground in the Deputy's argument.  The Deputy has not made it clear that there is any phase of industrial life in the country which could be bettered by legislation brought into this House.  The Deputy should not hurriedly rush to a conclusion that because legislation has not been brought forward here that nothing has been done, at any rate with regard to legislation.  Reference could <Col N="780" /> be made to the Weights and Measures Act, the Gas Regulation Bill or the Trades Loans Guarantee Act.  The useful activity of the Department should not be measured by a plethora of legislation brought in on the initiative of the Department or the absence of that legislation.</P>
      <P>Some other Deputy said&mdash;I think it was Deputy Moore again in that simple speech of his, that there was no explanation given of the work of the Department. I went into such details at first of the activities of the Department that Deputy Derrig criticised me afterwards for having an establishment on an imperial scale, too big for this country and suitable only for a highly industrialised community like England. He said it was out of place here. The Deputy forgets that what we are discussing is an Appropriation Bill which covers the Estimates and the discussion on the Estimates.</P>

      <P>I stated quite a lot with regard to the activity of the Department and went into an analysis of the sums of money voted for it, and pointed out that there were huge sums paid to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  As a matter of fact, if the unemployment insurance branch was taken away, if there were any complaints to be made against the Department, it is that not enough money was voted on the industrial side.  One does not vote money hurriedly to pile up staffs of officials until one can see the useful intervention the Government may make in the way of industrial development in the country.  I am tackled on three points by Deputy Lemass.  He raised the question of slates, and said that he knows one quarry where the slates were produced, and where the owner could get them exported for big housing schemes in Glasgow, but that they could not be used here by the Dublin Commissioners.  He referred to the Trades Loan Act, which he criticised me for bringing forward, and said that that was brought forward to help cases of that kind.</P>

      <P>I would like the Deputy to examine the files in my Department with regard to the Trade Loan Guarantee Act and see the number of cases pending at the time which would have lapsed if that Act had not been effective for another year.  The fact that most of them may not have got loans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that none of them came to completion in the meantime would have been no excuse for my not bringing forward the Act to give such cases a further chance. As a matter of fact the Trade Loan Guarantee Act not merely started this quarry to which Deputy Lemass referred, but allowed the owner afterwards to open a second quarry which was also helped by that Act.  As to the Dublin Commissioners, I do not know why they do not use slates from this quarry.  It is not because they have not information or that they are not disposed to use Irish slates.  One of the best investigations in regard to quarries, particularly for slate purposes, was made under the auspices of the late Town Clerk of Dublin, and a very well-drawn-up report was presented as a result of the investigations conducted in the old days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass refers to slates, cement, and building materials of all types.  As a matter of fact, the Dublin Commissioners send to my Department every year a list of their requirements with a view to ascertaining whether we could put them in touch with manufacturers in this country who manufacture any of the things which they have on their list.  From time to time, under the guidance of my officials, they change their specifications and lists in order to give more scope to Irish manufacturers to tender for articles which the Commissioners require.  The lists come round annually and correspondence is entered into and over and over again the Commissioners make changes in the original list in order to cater for what Irish manufacturers produce.  I do not know why exactly the Dublin Commissioners do not avail <Col N="783" /> of Irish-made slates.  I do not know on what their decision turns.  It is probably a matter of quality and the particular type of slate they want.  In the report referred to a defect was alleged in regard to a particular type of slate produced from a particular quarry. That particular slate may be used and may be more suitable for houses in Glasgow than here.  From my knowledge of the Dublin Commissioners I know that on every possible occasion they make use of my Department and make every endeavour to get their requirements from Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Cement was alluded to.  From the first day on which I entered the office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce I do not know any proposition that more often came before the Department than that of cement.</P>
    <P>It was first brought prominently and vehemently under my notice by Deputy Corish in regard to the Drinagh Cement Works.  There have been four groups of foreigners brought across here almost entirely at the initiative of my Department, to see if anything in the nature of a cement manufacture could be started here.  There are people who have options on sites where there seems to be raw material in abundance. Yet the thing cannot be got moving. I would like Deputy Lemass, on his tour of investigation in my Department, to give two days to the investigation of all that has been done in regard to cement.  I believe that there is an application for a tariff on cement before the Commission.  I know that a case is being prepared.  In regard to slates, cement and building materials, I find that there is a disposition to speak in a different fashion in this House alleging a different type of impediment to the use of Irish manufacture from the case made by people who apply for a tariff to the Commission. Deputy Lemass said that by taking action in these matters the Department might help in some way in bringing down the cost of building in Dublin. His allegation in regard to cement was that it was sold here at ring prices.  In any application ever made in regard to tariffs the contention is quite the reverse, namely, that it is dumping that is going on in the matter of cement, <Col N="784" /> and that if there is to be any result from a tariff it will inevitably mean an increase in the price of building, by whatever small fraction of the building costs is represented by cement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BUCKLEY</NameTxt>
      <P>An bhfuil cead agam ceist do chur?  Is it not true that one of the foreign firms that came here to make cement is waiting to start, waiting to see whether a tariff will be put on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that any firm is waiting to start, but I know that one firm is preparing an application to the Commission, and that options have been taken on sites by that firm.  I am referring particularly to Deputy Lemass's argument.  I never heard it advanced in regard to cement that this country is suffering from high prices imposed by a monopoly, by a ring.  It is, in fact, quite the reverse.  We are told that cement was being dumped.  Vague use is made of the word &ldquo;dumping,&rdquo; as there is an absence of definition in regard to it.  If you take it in its most extreme form as meaning that the price in this country is under the cost of production in the country of manufacture, it applied at one time more to cement than to any other article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain why foreign firms sell under production cost in a country where there is no cement manufactured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is due to competition.  There are Belgian, French and English cements all in competition.  It is alleged that these people are off-loading surplus stuff which they cannot get rid of on account of competition among these three countries.  At the time of the depreciated currency there was a case to be made that there was dumping, in the most precise meaning of that word, partly from France and, to a slight degree, from Belgium.  As to building materials in general, the Deputy ceases to be precise.  One item that may come into consideration is the question of bricks.  There used to be a certain number of brick yards in the country but some of them are closed down and some of the remaining ones are in a bad <Col N="785" /> way.  Again there were people who came across to this country to investigate the possibility of establishing here one good brick works of a particular type.  The people concerned who came here pursued the matter no further when they discovered that the smallest economic unit at which they could produce bricks&mdash;I mean the ordinary type of brick and not the fancy or glazed brick&mdash;was a unit producing about, I think, 14,000,000 bricks in the year.  The number of bricks used in the country hardly amounts to that. Again we would be faced with the difficulty that if a really good firm from another country came in here and set up in a good situation, picking a good site where they would have water and other transport facilities, it would inevitably wipe out every other brick yard existing in the country.  One will be faced eventually with the problem of consolidating the small units in the country into a larger unit, and of getting the thing done, it is hoped, under the auspices of Irish industrialists instead of letting foreigners come in here to wipe out our Irish industrialists. Irish industrialists ought to be wide awake enough to their own interests to make an inquiry, go into details and find out, as regards all the small brick yards that are dotted all over the country, if there is any chance whereby these could be consolidated into a single unit.  If Irish bricks are to be used, if there is to be the obligation of people building houses to use Irish bricks, which will cost more than bricks you can get from outside, then instead of there being a reduction in the cost of housing, I fear very distinctly that there will be an increase in the cost.  As a matter of fact, it is doubtful if brick-built houses are going to be common at all in the future.  It is a question whether that type of house has not gone for all time, except, of course, in the case of a person who wants to build a luxury or a fancy house or in the case of one who has a taste for a structure of that type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost is the matter that really comes in.  If there is to be a tariff put on stone, or any form of protection which results in putting on people the necessity of using Irish-made stone or Irish-manufactured cement, or Irish-made <Col N="786" /> bricks or building materials of various types, then it seems to me that is a thing that will have to be examined in the greatest detail.  On the allegations made, the natural inference to be drawn is that there would be some slight increase in the cost of building.  I suppose in the order of things, what one would most abhor is any increase in the necessities of life, and an increase in the cost of building materials.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the building of houses is sufficiently lagging at the moment without making the situation more difficult by increasing the cost of building materials.  Deputy Lemass&mdash;I hope this is a misunderstanding of what he said&mdash;used the phrase that I had made a tilt at Irish industrial inefficiency.  I never said that.  I alleged that there was inefficiency in a particular case.  I take it that the Deputy was referring to the debate on the Tariff Commission where I did refer distinctly to one report&mdash; the report on margarine.  I referred distinctly to what the Tariff Commissioners had said with regard to that, and I spoke of certain in-and-out conduct on the part of certain people who made the application with regard to margarine, and I said that was hiding inefficiency.  That phrase ought not to be extended.  The Deputy can read what I said, and if there are any words of mine which would seem to indicate general inefficiency in regard to Irish industrialists, then I take this the first occasion that I have of withdrawing that, but I repeat again that I never made that statement.</P>
    <P>I did allege it with regard to a particular thing, and said with regard to the conduct of that person on the prima facie case made, that that person was trying to get inefficiency protected until that applicant firm makes a better case for the particular conduct that characterised the application.</P>
    <P>Deputies Lemass, Carney and Moore spoke of industry and transport.  I was waiting, even on an Appropriation Bill where one does not go into details and into small points, to get a general line of policy from these Deputies, <Col N="787" /> where I would hear schemes put forward and one big point picked out for discussion and emphasis laid on that. I waited to hear what would be said. Deputy Moore talked about transport and wondered what the view of the Department was, but he gave no indication of what his own views were. Deputy Lemass wound up by saying that if proper methods were adopted he had no doubt but that all the unemployed could be employed and that emigration could be stopped.  One could not go borrowing on a prospectus which merely referred to &ldquo;proper methods&rdquo; for industry.  One has to be more precise than that and get down to details of the scheme if there is to be any proper approach to the problem.  Then we had a statement from Deputy Carney.  He said that if the moneys spent on the Army and on the Civic Guard were spent on some other purpose&mdash;&ldquo;look at the use that could be made of it.&rdquo;  I waited to hear the use.  He said it could be used to stablise industry.  How?</P>
    <P>Again there was silence.  He said he was only quoting from Deputy Flinn. I read what Deputy Flinn had said, and so far as I could see there was very little in the way of precise statement.</P>

      <P>I said that it was not the place to ask for details such as are usually given on the Estimates when Deputies ask questions as why so-and-so did not get an old age pension or why a particular drainage scheme was not carried out.  But I do say that a debate on the Appropriation Bill is the place for general suggestions in regard to things that are relevant to an Appropriation Bill.  If there was relevancy in talking of scrapping the Army and Civic Guards and saving money, surely the purpose for which money so saved could be applied is equally relevant, but that was not done.  The Deputy simply went on to say &ldquo;stabilise industry.&rdquo;  Deputy <Col N="788" /> Lemass spoke about proper measures being taken.  As a kind of preamble to his whole speech he said the country's poverty was due to the fact that the country had accepted a lower national status than what it ought to have achieved.  Again I do not know that that is a proper matter for an Appropriation Bill.  The general statement was that what is wrong with this country and what is keeping it in poverty is the fact that it accepted a lower national status than what should have been given to it.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera prefaced his remarks by the statement that as the main details had been gone into on the Estimates he would not go into them again but that he would recapitulate them.  Ministers have sat here during the Estimates each answering for his own Department.  If Deputies proceed to recapitulate points previously discussed is there any necessity for lengthy replies to those particular things?  Deputy de Valera proceeded after that to have one of those rambles through the country he sometimes indulges in.  I did not hear the whole of his speech, but I have read since something about it.  What are the things the Deputy wanted done?  A reduction in the number of members of this House.  That means legislation, and is not a matter to be discussed on this Bill.  The Governor-General's salary. That has been voted, and the arguments for and against it have been made.  A reduction in the number of members of the Seanad.  For that again legislation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy then went on to talk about his desire to get the truth through the country.  There is one answer to that particular type of claim made in the leading speech on the Appropriation Bill, particularly when the question of truth is mixed up with the unsavoury matter he referred to here yesterday.  I do not know what the sublety was in introducing that unsavoury matter.  The Deputy referred to a statement with regard to certain things he alleged have been said against him.  It was news to me.  I queried a lot of people since and they never before heard that such statements <Col N="789" /> were made.  I do not know what reason the Deputy had for giving publicity here for the first time to rumours which he alleged were circulated about him in America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did he could see why I introduced it.  The Minister for Agriculture suggested that Deputy Aiken in the United States was saying things, in other words, was telling cock-and-bull stories to the American people and deliberately deceiving them, and that brought in the question of truth. If Deputy Aiken ever said anything like what he was reported to have said, I gave the probable reasons why he mentioned these matters about rumours at election times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I contradict the Minister?  I said that these reports are absolutely unreliable.  I gave an example of another case to show how unreliable they are, and how unfair it is to quote such reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The first suggestion was that the Minister for Agriculture was not quoting from any paper, but was going on his own imagination. Counsel always have two defences. The first in this case was that counsel had not the report before him, and the second was that if the matter quoted was in the paper it was incorrectly reported. We will see about that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>And the third is that the Minister for Agriculture had no <Col N="791" /> right, without having complete evidence, to introduce that matter at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming to the point that it is not believed it is in the newspaper.  I will leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the allegations by Deputy <Col N="792" /> Mullins was that the Ministers, by refusing to take part in debates, were rapidly earning for this House the reputation of being a talking-shop. That is a curious definition, that because Ministers will not intervene in debates the House is turned into a talking-shop.  I hope I am going to be famous for having drawn from Deputy Smith the only coherent remark he has made on any subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the amendment which stands in the name of Deputy Flinn.  It is to insert in subsection (1) of Section 2, in line 22, after the words &ldquo;Bank of Ireland,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or other approved bank having its headquarters in Saorstat Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think a better justification for that amendment could not be found than is expressed on page 39 of the Fourth Interim Report of the Banking Commission, where the members of that Commission who signed the majority report stated a point of view which was expressed by some members of the Commission. Dealing with the question of the holding of public funds certain members of the Banking Commission stated that there was, in their opinion, no reason why some distribution of Government funds at least could not be made as between the different banks. This fact, they go on to say, is attested by the Government attitude or action in dividing the public deposits between the Bank of Ireland, on the one hand, and the National Land Bank on the other hand, when these were independent concerns.  They state that the other commercial banks are justly desirous of having a share in the Government accounts, not alone because the custody of such funds may be a source of possible profit, but because it does confer a certain prestige on the bank, and the other commercial banks in this country who are doing a good deal, possibly more even than the Bank of Ireland, to build up industry and agriculture in this country feel that it is unfair to them that a monopoly in this matter should be reserved to the one institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to intervene for a moment, I want to say that this is the phraseology that has been used in the Appropriation Bills up to this, the reason for that being that the Bank of <Col N="795" /> Ireland is the one bank which, unless it was specifically mentioned in the Appropriation Act could not lend to the Government.  Sums of money have been borrowed from the other banks, on the wording which is already in the Appropriation Act up to this, and this money has been borrowed on many occasions during the last few years. This shows that there is no necessity for the insertion of these words in the Bill.  There is power already, so far as these banks are concerned, to lend money.  The reason for mentioning the Bank of Ireland is because the bank, under its Charter, could not lend money to us, and we could not borrow from them, unless it was mentioned in the Appropriation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates only then to this disability which the Bank of Ireland labours under?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, the explanation which the President has given puts a rather different complexion on the matter.  One would be inclined to think that the purpose of the section was to reserve a monopoly to the Bank of Ireland, and it was with a view rather to have from the Government a statement of their reasons as to why such a monopoly had been reserved that we put down this amendment. At the same time, I think it is advisable to point out that at the present moment the Government does, I think, deposit all its moneys with the Bank of Ireland except in so far as certain statutes compel them to deposit these moneys elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter.  This is simply borrowing.  The insertion of this would not affect the other question at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is a certain relationship between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, it is not the custom of a bank to lend money to people who do not normally deposit money with it.  The customary relationship between a bank and its clients <Col N="796" /> must be established generally before a bank is prepared to lend money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>But it does affect it.  I say that the question of borrowing and depositing are not dissociated entirely.  We do know that the Government from time to time have borrowed from other banks, but we do know also, at the same time, that the other banks are not entirely satisfied with the situation.  The fact that certain representatives of the other banks on the Banking Commission did make a statement that they thought the Government funds should be deposited equitably&mdash;that the public deposits should be divided equitably between not only the Bank of Ireland and the other banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  Now, the question is how will the Minister for Finance be able to borrow from the Bank of Ireland?  How will the Bank of Ireland be able to make that loan unless in some way or another a deposit is made?  As a matter of fact, it is one of the controversial points in the theory of banking as to whether, when the Government borrows money, or when a loan is made, a deposit is created, or whether the deposit creates the loan.</P>

      <P>I would just say it was not really as an act of discourtesy that Ministers did not speak. I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce explained that point to some extent, but in a review of the Appropriation Bill, which is a very large Bill, it would be utterly impossible to traverse the same ground already gone over in connection with the Estimates. But I would be sorry if Deputies would jump to the conclusion that there was any discourtesy intended.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that, I think I should make it clear that in my opinion the words objected to were directed against the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was asked to speak yesterday.  On his refusal some of us on these benches felt that he was unwilling to give us an opportunity of replying to what he would say, and that therefore he was using the privilege which the Government have of concluding a debate for making an attack on us.  I think if that were generally known the incident which happened to-day could have been to some extent undone.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that after having had something like 100 hours' discussion on the Estimates, for Deputies to get up and speak about such a thing as that some person was refused a pension and so on appears to me to be to some extent not giving to the House that sense of responsibility that it certainly deserves, and that it is not an occasion which afforded, or which ought to afford, Deputies an opportunity of introducing matters without notice.  I do not regard the business of the House as being properly discharged by merely scoring debating points.  Unquestionably that is what happens when matters are introduced without notice, and when Ministers are asked to explain across the floor some of the countless details of administration that pass through their hands in the course of the year.  I think it is unreasonable to expect that, and that it is not in accordance with the very responsible duties we have to perform. As regards the other matter, it is one which ought to be dealt with at the moment.  It is one of a number of matters which a little more generous consideration of the circumstances might prevent occuring.</P>

      <P>In this Act the word &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; includes a person who was a secondary teacher on the 1st day of January, 1927, and ceased to be such teacher after that date and before the passing of this Act, and also includes a person who was formerly a teacher and while he was a teacher was appointed to a pensionable post in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann and at the passing of this Act holds the same or a similar post in the said Civil Service.&rdquo;&mdash;Aire Oideachas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that on the Second Reading I made it quite clear that the intention was that the enabling powers of the Bill would extend, for instance, <Col N="805" /> to people in the position of national teachers who became national school inspectors, and I think I also indicated that it was proposed in the scheme of pensions for secondary teachers that those should be included who, with the consent of the Minister of Education, had resigned since January, 1927.  That was to carry out the promise that any delay in introducing the Bill would not prejudice individuals in that particular position.  It struck me afterwards that there was just a danger that a very strict interpretation of the Bill might prevent any scheme under this Bill from dealing with these particular cases.  It is to set any doubts of that kind at rest that I now propose the amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a superannuation scheme is expressed to apply to any <Col N="807" /> class of teachers to whom the National School Teachers (Ireland) Act, 1879, applies, such scheme may be in addition to or in substitution for the provisions of the said Act as amended by the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, relating to such class of teachers and may revoke or amend such provisions accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Superannuation Act of 1879, to which reference is made here, there is power in the Ministers for Education and Finance to make modifications in the actual pensions scheme.  But I doubt if there is power to bring in any new class into that particular scheme. In case at any future date it may be found advisable to do so, it might be impossible to add to that particular scheme, for instance, the teachers in convent schools, as the interpretation we have got of the Act of 1879 is that it applies only to one class of teachers. Without an amendment of this kind the position, under the Act of 1879, might be jeopardised, or the pension scheme in general.  It might be impossible to make provision of the kind I mention, in case, at a future date, it is found desirable to make such a change.</P>

      <P>On the section itself, I want to draw the Minister's attention in sub-section (d) to the words &ldquo;to teachers to whom such scheme applies&rdquo; and to ask if he will consider the advisability or possibility of taking these words out.  I do not think their absence would affect the meaning of the section, but they might have a very deleterious, restrictive effect on the nature of the scheme which will at a future date come before us.  For example, if they remain in the Bill, they will prevent the possibility of any scheme containing anything like a deferred pay consideration, because payment must be made to teachers.  It is quite possible that in a pension scheme some portion of the pension may be regarded as deferred pay to be paid as a sum to the widow of a teacher if he died at an early age.  I think these words would prevent the possibility of that.  I suggest that they have no particular force as they stand, because the <Col N="808" /> section will still give power for payment of pensions and gratuities, but that they might have a rather serious restrictive effect, and I ask the Minister to consider before the Report Stage the advisability of removing the words.</P>

      <P>A superannuation scheme may in the case of a person to whom such scheme applies appointed to a post in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann make special provision for the award of a pension to such teacher in respect of his service as a teacher, and for the suspension of the payment of such pension during such time as such person continues to be employed in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; line 1, to the end of the section and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In regard to persons to whom such scheme applies appointed to pensionable posts in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann, make special provision for the award of pensions to some or all such persons in respect of their service as teachers and may provide for the assessment and payment of any such pension being postponed until the person to whom it is awarded leaves the said Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is one which is somewhat more in favour of the teacher.  It is really to secure that it would not be immediately necessary, say, in the case of a national teacher becoming an inspector, to compute what his pension service as a national teacher amounted to, and take that into account as suggested by the section, as it stands, but that we should wait until his final retirement from the Civil Service. For instance, a national teacher might come in at the age of 25, and he might afterwards have forty years' service as a civil servant, and it might be better for him to have his ultimate pension paid on the forty years instead of the broken type of computation that now exists.  The suggestion is that even the computing of the actual pension due to him for his services as a national teacher could wait over until the final pension is being decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>The original section makes special provision for the award of a pension to a teacher who has subsequently become a civil servant, an inspector, for example, in respect of his services as a teacher, and for the suspension of the payment of a pension while he occupied that post.  I notice in the amendment that not alone is the award of the pension for which special provision is to be made postponed, but the actual assessment is to be postponed until the person leaves the Civil Service.  I think that that weakens considerably the position of persons affected, and that the Minister ought to make it clear to us now why it is that <Col N="810" /> assessments should not be made at the time on their previous service.</P>
      <P>The whole thing would be simplified if the Minister would see his way to accept these persons as having been civil servants during the whole period of their appointment.  After their appointment and as soon as they became teachers they were under the control of the Ministry just as much as any other civil servant and they were under regulations.  The fact that civil servants have been transferred to other posts should not militate against them and there should not be any differentiation because of that transfer. If a junior clerk in the Civil Service is appointed to a higher position there is no question of postponing assessment or the payment of pension.  In this case there is a postponement and we do not know upon what basis the pension will be awarded and what the term &ldquo;special provision&rdquo; means, but payment of pension is to be suspended.  I do not think the amount involved is very large.  Teachers working for a very long time would, I think in most favourable circumstances, only get a small annual amount.  Does the fact that the pension for the period during which they were teachers must not be paid while they are occupying civil service positions mean that no allowance would be made in respect of bonus and gratutities?  Will that amount not be taken into consideration?  If it is not I think an unfair discrimination is made by arbitrarily dividing the particular class who have good grounds for saying they were civil servants all the time into two periods&mdash;one when they were civil servants and another when they were not.  In the North of Ireland the whole period of the teacher's service is accepted as reckonable for pensions. If the Minister would intimate to us now that the whole period of the teaching service of these inspectors will be taken into consideration and make it clear how the assessment will be made he would avoid a good deal of trouble later on.  I have no doubt if there is any attempt at discrimination or evading the question of giving the full benefit of their teaching it will have to be gone into again when the regulations come up for consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to make it clear that I do not at all accept the position that any teacher is a civil servant.  I want to be quite clear on that, and anything that would seem to involve that would run counter to our whole policy, and even to the method in which we propose to deal with the matter.  The teacher is not a civil servant.  His whole pension scheme rests on a different basis from the Civil Service Pension Scheme.  The teacher pays into a fund.  We want to see that he will get credit in assessing his pension so far as his service as a teacher is concerned, that there will be computation, and I think it is better at the end than at the beginning, because, as I say, it may be necessary to see what number of years service he has as a civil servant.  So far as the section as it stands is concerned, to my mind our proposed amendment is more favourable to the teacher.  Supposing a person has a number of years service, the teaching portion of the pension would be assessed up to a point that he would reasonably have reached when he ceased to be a teacher.  It will be better from his own point of view that the assessment should be postponed because he may have his full forty years in the Civil Service, and, therefore, his assessment would have to be according to the number of years he was in the Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill validates certain <Col N="813" /> judgments given in the High Court over a considerable period of time.  The necessity for this Bill has arisen owing to the decision in the High Court in the case of Stokes against Wilkie.  The old practice in the High Court was that in the case of an undefended action you went into the office and marked judgment there.  It was considered by the legal profession and by the officials that the new Rules of Court did not destroy the existing procedure, and in consequence a considerable number of judgments were marked in the old fashion, that is to say, in all undefended cases the old method of procedure was adopted and judgments were marked. In the case of Stokes v. Wilkie it was held that the new Rules of the High Court superseded the old Rules of the High Court, and that judgment could only be marked before the Master or a Judge.  That decision invalidates all judgements given in undefended cases in which no appearance has been entered. This Bill is a Bill to validate all these judgments with the exceptions of any judgments which have been set aside before the 18th October, 1928. The reason why the 18th October, 1928, has been inserted in this Bill is because upon that date, in answer to a question by Deputy Wolfe in this House, I undertook that legislation of this nature would be introduced, and in consequence every person against whom a judgment of this nature had been marked had fair and ample notice that this legislation would be introduced and that any steps he took to set aside a judgment would be at his own risk and loss and would not be in any way fruitful to him.</P>
      <P>Section 4 lays it down that in cases&mdash; and there are very few&mdash;in which judgments were set aside before 18th October, 1928, these judgments remain good but that in any proceedings which are taken upon these judgments for illegal seizure or anything of that kind the plaintiff shall not be entitled to receive what I would call vindictive damages and would only be entitled to recover the actual sum of money the sheriff received into his possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain other exceptions in this Bill.  They are set out in Section 2. If the person is an infant or of unsound mind a judgment would not be <Col N="814" /> validated.  The House will recognise that this Bill is one which does no injustice to any person.  The persons against whom judgments were marked were persons who had no defence to the actions and who did not go to the trouble even of entering an appearance. They were all persons who by their attitude admitted that the debts were due.  It appears, through a mistake made by the legal profession in interpreting the new Rules of the High Court and also through a mistake on the part of the Court Officials, it would be a grave injustice to people to whom money was due and who got judgment and also who took further steps to realise such judgments if all such judgments were en bloc declared to be bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RUTTLEDGE</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as we are concerned we welcome the Bill.  The only criticism I wish to offer is in regard to the delay that there has been in introducing it.  The Minister is aware of the considerable amount of hardship that has been inflicted in consequence of the confusion caused by these Rules.  These Rules, owing to the interpretation of which this confusion has arisen, were before the Judges.  I am not criticising the judgments but the fact that these Rules were before the Judges of the High Court and were approved of by them.  The opportunity was availed of by someone to interpret them and to find loopholes in them.  It was only because the case of Stokes v. Wilkie was decided that this question arose but even this Bill does not go far enough because there is considerable doubt amongst solicitors whether if it were passed they would be safe in entering judgment.  The time, however, to deal with that is in Committee and if the Minister does not put in amendments which we think are necessary it will be for us to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that will arise is the interpretation of that word &ldquo;hearing,&rdquo; that there must have been a hearing before the Master.  Possibly what was decided before the Master in Stokes and Wilkie is that there should be a hearing.  Since Stokes and Wilkie, solicitors, and their officials go up with the papers which are put in the Master's list, who rules on them.  A number of legal men are of the opinion that <Col N="815" /> that does not constitute a hearing in the broad sense of the word.  It has been the practice since Stokes and Wilkie to have a hearing.  Many legal men are of opinion, and I would say from what I know that it was the opinion of a good many sound lawyers, that to constitute a hearing it is necessary to serve notice on the other side to attend before the Master.  That is not done in the present practice.  It is very questionable if this matter came before the High Court that you would not have it set aside on the ground that it was not a hearing within the ordinary meaning.  That is the first question I want to raise.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty is where, even in those undefended cases, there can be only costs levied according to the Circuit Court, that is, where the Circuit Court jurisdiction would obtain.  The difficulty then arises with the officials that they do not know what the Circuit Court costs are, because there is no Circuit Court ruling.  There again is the difficulty that will arise.  If someone, as in Stokes and Wilkie, is so fond of irritating litigation as to make some little point or question like this, that may upset the question again.  I am informed that there are a number of solicitors in Dublin who are afraid to enter judgments as a result of this indefinite position.  It has been suggested that this Bill might settle the question of the Master's jurisdiction finally.  It has been stated, and it would be an advantage especially to the solicitors' profession, that his jurisdiction should to some extent be extended.  With the present system, whether as a result of that decision or not I do not know, the other courts are, it is said, overcrowded with work that might be dealt with by the Master.  I do not know if that is so, but the Minister could find out whether it is, and also whether benefits would result by having the Master's jurisdiction more clearly defined.</P>
    <P>The first amendment which I had in my mind is with reference to Section 3 &mdash;the matter of hearing.  I suggest that instead of the words &ldquo;shall be deemed always to have been valid&rdquo; there should be put in the words, &ldquo;shall not be deemed to be invalid.&rdquo;  In Section 4 I would like after the words &ldquo;High <Col N="816" /> Court or judge thereof&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;the Supreme Court.&rdquo;  I do not know how many cases there have been, but I know one case in which there has been a judgment of the Supreme Court.  The Minister will probably remember that case.</P>

      <P>It is a case in which a letter was written to you on the 3rd October, 1928.  At that time the decision had not been given.  It was a letter from Mr. J.J. O'Shea in the case of Stokes and Quirke v. Johanna Quinn.  I shall read it.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Stokes &amp; Quirke v. Johanna Quinr</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court on 13th July last in the case of Stokes &amp; Son, Ltd., v. Wilkie affirming the decision of Mr. Justice O'Byrne setting aside judgment by default on the grounds that the procedure under Order VII., Rule 4, for marking judgment was not observed; following the decision the defendant in above case moved to set aside judgment against her for £225 12s. 11d. obtained on 5th June, 1928, under Summary Summons served on 25th May last, to which she entered no appearance, and the judgment was set aside by Order of 27th July last with costs against our clients, Messrs. Stokes &amp; Quirke, the plaintiffs in the action.  We communicated by telephone with your office when the Notice of Motion to set aside the judgment had been served and we were informed that you had already received a deputation from the Incorporated Law Society on the subject of the invalidity of all the judgments in undefended cases marked since the Rule mentioned was made on 13th July, 1926.  We were informed by your representative that you promised legislation as soon as the Dáil reassembles this month to validate all these judgments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision setting aside above judgment in the hope that the judgment would be validated. <Col N="817" /> Meanwhile, notwithstanding Plaintiff's appeal being duly entered, the Defendant taxed the costs of setting aside the judgment and Plaintiffs have had to pay £15 3s. 9d. taxed costs to the Defendant's Solicitor. The defendant has threatened proceedings for a seizure made by the sheriff on foot of plaintiffs' judgment which would be a very serious matter for them or the sheriff.</P>
    <P>Please let us know whether you have had a Bill drafted to deal with the situation as promised, and whether under its terms plaintiffs will be enabled to recover the costs they have had to pay and will be protected from the threatened proceedings.</P>
    <P>Since that letter was written the appeal appeared in the list, owing somehow to the way in which the case was fixed for hearing.  The case appeared on the list and has been disposed of by the Court of Appeal.  The Rule made in Stokes v. Wilkie has apparently been followed.  That is undoubtedly a hardship and there would be hardship in any case of a similar character.  It was not the fault of these people.  It was due to the interpretation of the Rule by the Court Officials.  It is unfair that any loss should be entailed by any litigants in such cases.  That is the reason that I suggest adding the words &ldquo;Supreme Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another amendment is in connection with Section 4, sub-section (3).  I would suggest an amendment there to this effect.  It may be possible; indeed, I believe it is probable, that in some of these cases where judgment has been set aside a mortgagee may have come in and registered a judgment, and in that way would gain priority.  I suggest that an amendment should be made in Committee dealing with that, so that no priority could be gained by another party who came in subsequent to the judgment having been obtained but previous to its having been set aside.  I suggest that, perhaps, this would be an opportune time for the Minister to consider whether he would have the whole working of these High Court Rules considered.  They have resulted in confusion and, as is proved by the necessity for introducing this Bill, have also resulted in a considerable <Col N="818" /> amount of hardship.  This Bill is brought in to meet something like 2,000 judgments which are affected by this particular rule.  Considering the costs and expenses of entering judgment, it means considerable hardship.  Perhaps the Minister would adopt my suggestions, namely to define the Masters' jurisdiction and to obtain a proper definition of the word &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; so that no one will be taken advantage of, especially as these are cases in which defendants have not entered an appearance except to come in afterwards and, on a technicality, get the judgments set aside in cases where they owe money.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of the Masters' jurisdiction, I may say that that is a very difficult matter, because it becomes questionable whether the Constitution does not limit very much the powers which could be conferred on the Master.  As to the exact meaning of &ldquo;the exercise of judicial power&rdquo; in the Constitution, I had hopes that at some time we would get a decision from the Supreme Court setting out the meaning of &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; in the particular clause of the Constitution.  An extension of the Master's jurisdiction would lead to a grave risk of infringing on the Constitution and to give him the extra power which Deputy Ruttledge would like to see&mdash;I know there is a strong feeling amongst solicitors to give him that jurisdiction&mdash;it would be necessary probably to amend the Constitution. That is rather a big thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is brought in rather ad hoc, simply to deal with this particular emergency which has arisen owing to the mistake made in marking judgment. <Col N="819" /> In regard to the question of &ldquo;hearing,&rdquo; that is really a question which hardly requires legislation, because it was not the interpretation of a Statute but rather the misinterpretation of the Rules which caused all this confusion, and the Rule Making Authority can, and I hope will, deal with this question.  It is really a matter for them.  As the Deputy knows, I have no control over them but I feel satisfied that they will deal with this question.  I venture to think that it is highly probable that they will go back to the old procedure, if they ever really meant to depart from it.  I think it is quite sufficient to go into the office and mark judgment when the other person does not wish to attend.  This Bill does not validate, and I do not think it should, judgments already set aside. The case which the Deputy mentioned is a case in which judgment has been set aside.  This Bill does not deal with <Col N="820" /> that except it safeguards where a judgment mortgage has been entered or where a seizure has been made&mdash;if there is a case in which a seizure has been made under a decree of the Supreme Court, because I do not think there should be.  I do not understand how that case could arise because judgment by default is always judgment of the High Court, never of the Supreme Court.  This was not a judgment which went to the Supreme Court but the setting aside of the judgment did.  I suggest to the Deputy that that amendment would not be one which would apply.  All that this Bill deals with is undefended judgments.</P>
