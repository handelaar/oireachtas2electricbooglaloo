    <P>Ordered: That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the insertion therein of the following Article immediately after Article 38 now contained therein, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;38A.  Whenever a Bill (not being a Money Bill) initiated and passed by Dáil Eireann and sent to Seanad Eireann is within the stated period hereinafter defined either rejected by Seanad Eireann or passed by Seanad Eireann with amendments to which Dáil Eireann does not agree or is neither passed (with or without amendment) nor rejected by Seanad Eireann within the said stated period, Dáil Eireann may within one year after the said stated period by resolution expressly passed under this Article again send such Bill to Seanad Eireann in the form (save only for such modifications as are hereinafter authorised) in which it was first so sent, and if Seanad Eireann does not, within sixty days thereafter or such longer period as may be agreed to by both Houses, pass such Bill either without amendment or with such amendments only as are agreed to by Dáil Eireann, such Bill shall, if Dáil Eireann so resolves after the expiration of such sixty days or longer period aforesaid, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas at the expiration of the said sixty days or longer period aforesaid in the form in which it was so last sent to Seanad Eireann with such (if any) amendments as may have been made therein by Seanad Eireann and agreed to by Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>The said stated period is the period commencing on the day on which the said Bill is first sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann and ending at whichever of the following times is the earlier, that is to say, the expiration of eighteen months from the commencement of the said period or the date of the reassembly of the Oireachtas after a dissolution occurring after the commencement of such period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> When a Bill initiated in and passed by Seanad Eireann is amended by Dáil Eireann, such Bill shall be deemed to have been initiated in Dáil Eireann and this Article shall apply to such Bill accordingly and for the purpose of such application the said stated period shall in relation to such Bill commence on the day on which such Bill is first sent to Seanad Eireann after being so amended by Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>Whenever a Bill has been sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann nothing in this Article shall operate to restrict the right of Dáil Eireann to send such Bill on any subsequent occasion to Seanad Eireann otherwise than under this Article and when such Bill is so sent to Seanad Eireann this Article shall apply as if such subsequent occasion were the first occasion on which such Bill was sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann.</P>
    <P>A Bill sent a second time by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann and required for the purposes of this Article to be in the form in which it was first so sent may contain such (if any) modifications as shall be certified by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann to represent amendments made therein by Seanad Eireann and agreed to by Dáil Eireann or to be necessary owing to the lapse of time since such Bill was first sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 3, line 2, to delete the word `eighteen' and substitute the word `four.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill was explained, I think, when it was being introduced as being to give to the members of the Seanad additional powers as compensation for some of the powers it was proposed to take away from them.  As I indicated, speaking on that occasion, the powers it was proposed to take away from the Seanad were powers that were more apparent than real. It had the power of Referendum, but being the body it is, it was very unlikely that it would dare put any question to the people that had been passed by a majority of the representatives of the people&mdash;most unlikely&mdash;<Col N="1482" /> and, therefore, it cannot be said that they really possessed that power at all, that is to say, that it was a power they could effectively make use of.  Now it is proposed to give them in compensation power which is a real power, that of thwarting the purpose of the majority of the elected representatives by holding up measures they might consider vital for a period of twenty months at the very least.  In the Article of the Constitution which was just deleted they could hold up a measure only for nine months&mdash;270 days&mdash; while now the period they can hold up a Bill and thwart the Executive is increased to twenty months.  Giving compensation in that sense at all to the Seanad, in our opinion, is wrong, and particularly is it wrong when there is no question whatever of giving compensating powers to the people from whom is taken away the right of ultimately deciding whether a certain law should be passed or not.  The power of Referendum is taken away from the people, and in addition the power of initiating laws is taken away from the people.  There is no question of giving compensation to them, but the Seanad is so important from the point of view of the Executive, that is, dependent largely on the section they represent, and which has the power of reproducing itself if this series of Bills goes through, that they must be compensated, and they must get the power of holding up Bills for a period of twenty months.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Report, it will be obvious to anybody that this Bill does not, in fact, carry out the suggestion as it was intended to do.  I was a member of that Committee, and I know that the period of suspension that was in the minds of the members&mdash;certainly it was in my mind&mdash;was a period from the day on which the Bill came back, that is, there was to be a suspension when the Bill had come back from the Seanad.  If it was rejected, or if there were amendments which were not agreed to, there was to be a period of suspension.  I certainly thought that a Bill that would give effect to these recommendations would not have a single period running from the day on, which the Bill was first sent to the Seanad until the day on which the period would <Col N="1483" /> end, but that it would be divided into two parts, one in which the Seanad would have to have reported within a comparatively short period, and, after that, if there was to be suspension, a period of suspension.  A little care in the drafting would have made that possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to develop that point about the difference in the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I intend to develop it.  There are two periods that would naturally suggest themselves to anybody considering this question of the powers of the Seanad and the machinery by which ultimately the Dáil would have its way.  There is, first, a period in which the Seanad would have to take action.  That period might be such as would give reasonable time to the Seanad, if they were in earnest about a Bill, to consider it carefully, prepare amendments, and send it back. Then the Dáil would consider the amendments to the Bill, and make up its mind as to whether it was going to accept them or insist on the Bill going through in spite of any objections which the Seanad might have.  That is the first part of the period.  Then a period might elapse in which there would be, if you like, negotiations between the two Houses, or between representatives of the two Houses, attempts to fix up the difference, a period in which public opinion could be canvassed in the matter or in which steps might be taken by those supporting or by those opposing the Bill to inform the public so that they might be acquainted with the matters in dispute between the two Houses.  That period would be, to my mind, the period of suspension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the lapse of a certain time the Dáil would be empowered to take action and send back the Bill with the right to pass it over the head of the Seanad. These two periods are run into one in this Bill.  Remember that what I say is quite consistent with stating that the total period should be counted from the day on which the Bill comes to the Dáil.  It is a question of separating a certain period into two parts, making provision that the Seanad should report at a certain stage and allowing the second part to be the period of suspension <Col N="1484" /> in the sense used in the report. As I say, these two periods are run into one.  There is no attempt to run the periods into two parts, and indicate that the Seanad must take action within a shorter period than eighteen months. The Seanad can practically postpone dealing with a Bill until eighteen months have elapsed.  It need not touch it, and those responsible for the Bill would not be aware until the end of that period what action the Seanad proposed to take.  Therefore, it means that a much longer period would have to elapse if the Executive Council wished to inform public opinion.  They would have to exhaust a lot of that year in which they should take action.  That, in practice, means that the Seanad would have power to give a Bill a much longer period than 18 months before the Dáil would be in a position to send it back.  As a member of the Committee, and as one who was present and listened carefully to the discussion, I say that that Bill does not really give effect to the ideas that were behind the proposals.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to allow the Seanad eighteen months in which they could leave a Bill suspended absolutely in mid-air without indicating what action they may take.  This House should know what action the Seanad propose to take within a period not longer than three or four months.  My amendment does not break up the period into two parts.  If I thought that there was any chance of getting this House to agree to anything, getting the majority to agree to anything, I would have put down two amendments.  It would have meant a good deal of redrafting, but the first amendment would deal with the period within which the Seanad would have to report, and the other would deal with the suspension period.  Since the President, however, put down his motion declaring that the immediate passage of these Bills is necessary to the preservation of the public peace and safety, it seems to me that he thinks himself strong enough to get members of the Dáil to subscribe to an obvious lie.  As long as that is the situation nobody can take part in the proceedings with any feeling except that it does not matter what arguments may be adduced from this side of the <Col N="1485" /> House against a measure, as the Executive Council feel strong enough with their present majority to pass it, whether it is good or bad, right or wrong.  Consequently I was not disposed to go to the trouble of redrafting all this Bill to make it read in two periods when the conditions are as they are.  I have contented myself with giving a generous limit to the period within which the Seanad should report, namely, four months.</P>
    <P>If we met, say, early in February it should be necessary for the work of this Dáil, in the case of Bills sent to the Seanad, say, on the 1st February, that a period including February, March, April, and May should be sufficiently long to allow the Seanad to consider them properly and report back here in time so that the matters could be dealt with in the Spring Session, at least.  This means that, for example, if we send a Bill to the Seanad in February it is away until the coming year and need not appear back until June of that year.  Suppose it is an important Bill and that the majority party consider that it is a matter that requires a good deal of despatch and that it should be dealt with within a reasonable time, yet the Seanad, by this Bill, is empowered not to look at it.  They can say that they have this, that, and the other work to do and that they had not time to deal with it. There is no question of the Seanad reporting on that Bill for a full year and a half.  Suppose the majority party say: &ldquo;Very well.  This is an important Bill.  We do not agree with the amendments of the Seanad and we have to take action.&rdquo;  Meantime they would probably feel that it is necessary that the position of the majority party should be explained to the country, that the matter in dispute should be thoroughly understood by the community, and a certain time would necessarily elapse before they would be prepared to take the drastic step of forcing the measure through in spite of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Consequently another six months would elapse.  That is, you would have two years, half the life of a Parliament. Let us suppose that that was to happen about the middle of a term. You can take four years as the average <Col N="1486" /> life of Parliament under the present system.  It means that any measures that would be introduced by an Executive about the middle of their term would be held up until after the elections. When an Executive has passed over the middle of its period, it may make up its mind, if there is a hostile Seanad, that every one of its measures may be held up, that it will be prevented from putting a single one through, and that it has to face an election on the most important measures that are being considered.  I certainly think that any Executive that realised its responsibility at all would be very slow indeed to allow a House, even though the Executive has been its creator, to have that power.  It is too great a power to give to any Seanad, and even though the period may be longer than I would wish for, I think you should divide the period definitely into two parts, and say at one stage that the Seanad should report back to this House, and that the period should not be longer than three months.  If I thought there was any reason on the other side, or that any argument would appeal to them, I would have tried to put an amendment into the Bill which would have worked out in two parts, Instead of that I have tried to remedy the matter in a way in which it could be remedied&mdash;by the simple substitution of four months instead of eighteen. If the Seanad had four months to consider a Bill, the operation of that Bill would be suspended during that period. The Bill will of necessity, if there is a division between the two Houses, require time for negotiations between the two Houses or for informing public opinion as to the merits of the controversy. That will carry on the period for probably six months more.  It may not take six months, but suppose it takes another four months; that is, eight months.  A further two months will have to elapse after the resolution is passed, and that gives you ten months.  In my opinion, ten months' delay is all the delay that should be necessary in order to get over any difficulty.</P>
    <P>We listened to the Minister for Finance yesterday talking about the uselessness of Constitutions and the uselessness <Col N="1487" /> of checks, except in so far as these checks might be useful in considering a matter more carefully in the second instance than in the first. So far as the present Executive is concerned, I am inclined to agree.  They did not allow Constitutions in the past to stand in their way, and they are not allowing this Constitution to stand in their way either.  That is if they think they have a majority, their will is law. They have shown no respect whatever for any fundamental laws.  The laws are the laws that seem expedient to themselves at the moment.  However, there was a grain of truth in what the Minister for Finance said, even about an Executive other than the present Executive, and it is that if they feel that they are the representatives of the people, and that there is a certain programme which they are pledged to carry out for the benefit of the people as they conceive it, that Executive is not going to allow the Seanad to thwart it in that particular way, and they are going to have their way in the long run.  What does it lead to?  It leads to what is happening recently. It leads to a general disregard for law altogether.  It leads to absolutely arbitrary action on the part of the Executive, and the feeling in the country that there is nothing stable, nothing solid, that the whole thing is changing from day to day.  Consequently, the result of the passing of this Bill will be that on the first occasion on which there is a clash the Seanad goes, and I will not be sorry for it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things passing here, and as I said in the Committee, if my idea were, by some trick or other, to get rid of the Seanad by putting it in a position in which it was finally going to be swept away, these are proposals which would do it admirably, but I do not believe myself in that line of action at all.  I believe if you want to do these things they should be done in a straightforward way.  We have never made any secret whatever of our desire to get rid of the Seanad as it is at present composed, anyhow. As I said, we are not speaking in a doctrinaire way on the question of whether we should have one-chamber <Col N="1488" /> government or two.  We are simply taking the position in which we now are, the type of Seanad which we now have, the purpose for which it was originally instituted, and all our present circumstances into account, and in all these circumstances we are against the existence of a second House as formed at present.  We make no secret of the fact that we shall do our utmost to get the people to stand for a programme of abolishing that Seanad, but if it is done in one way, it will lead to very little trouble.  If it is done in another way it may lead to a great deal of trouble, and the value of the fundamental law that has been so disregarded in the considerations of the Minister for Finance yesterday, is this: that in one case you are making for revolutionary changes.  If you want that, very well.  In the other case you are making for the right kind of change, namely, a constitutional change.</P>
    <P>Since the present Executive five or six years ago&mdash;all the present members were not in the Executive Council then &mdash;first got power every action of theirs has been action which would be consistent only with actions of those who had no regard whatever for constitutional change, and who wish only for revolutionary change.  If you are going to say that all fundamental laws are to be swept away, once you get a majority, that is one thing, but if at the same time you say that you prevent people from effectively changing their minds, or giving effect to a change of mind easily, then they have got to do it by methods which are not constitutional. It seems to me that the natural deduction from the statements made by the Minister for Finance yesterday was that the people are to be blocked from changing in the ordinary way.  Every possible barrier is to be put up, and therefore if you are going to deal with an unscrupulous Executive, the only way is to deal with it by arms or force of some kind or another.  An unscrupulous Executive cannot be dealt with under any fundamental law or Constitution. The only hope of redress held out to those who object to being governed by an unscrupulous Executive is to take arms against it.  Such a <Col N="1489" /> position was forced before, and it is quite consistent for the present Executive to face a similar situation again.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that they are doing it.  I do not want, however, to get away from the actual matter in hand, and the question here is whether this period of eighteen months should be given.  I hold it should not, because it means that the Seanad will start in the middle of a period of office of an Executive and say, &ldquo;We are going to hold up all the Bills that are necessary to show the people, for example, that you have been faithful to the pledges that you gave them at the election.&rdquo; A new Executive coming in will take a certain time naturally to take over the machinery of Government.  A certain amount of time is necessary to make investigations as to the staffing of Departments and other things, about which information cannot be got from outside.  The whole question of redundancy of staffs and other questions are matters which would naturally occupy any Executive for a certain period after coming into office.  They will also require to make investigations of various kinds, and get their experts to give them detailed information about matters that they may have been considering as well as they could when out of office.  Then the most effective part of their term of office, the second period, is just the period in which the Seanad comes in, and is in a position to prevent them from carrying out any of their programme.</P>
    <P>The present Executive probably feel that they are quite safe in this.  They feel that the Seanad is going to be one of their creations, as it will be composed of sixty members, thirty of whom they have nominated, the remainder being elected by their own particular group.  They therefore feel that they have a vote of sixty to add at any time to such vote as they may have in the House here.  Therefore, they feel they are in a very strong position, particularly as they have arranged that there is to be no disturbance for twelve years, for instance, of those who were elected at the last election&mdash;that they are to run their whole period of office. The Senators who were nominated for a period of twelve years shall run out their whole period, and the Executive <Col N="1490" /> feel that there is no danger.  But if there was a normal position, I hold that no normal Executive elected would stand for that arrangement, and I am quite certain that if any other Executive gets into office, no matter what Party it is&mdash;any other Executive that will at all represent the national viewpoint&mdash;they will not stand that arrangement of giving the Seanad power to keep a Bill in the air for eighteen months, and compelling the Executive to go without giving effect to their programme in the last two years of office.  Therefore I propose that, instead of a period of eighteen months, a period of four mounths should be given.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that a period of four months will in practice amount to six at the minimum, and more likely to ten months.  That gives you very nearly the old period which has just been deleted. Nine months was the period of delay that was given already, and even that period was too long.  A shorter period would appear to most people to be quite sufficient.  The period of delay that I propose will mean about ten months, instead of a period of well over two years.  As I say, I think that anybody really interested in fixing in a reasonable way the relations between the two Houses, giving to the Seanad reasonable power, would not object to that amendment, and that it is only those who are taking quite an unreasonable attitude who would even suggest that this preliminary period of eighteen months should be given, which in practice would work out as a period of over two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech to which we have just listened postulates several things which neither I, nor the majority of the people of the country, nor in fact many people in the country, would agree with at all.  It starts out with the assumption that there is bound to be a dispute between the Dáil and the Seanad.  It goes on to assume that in any change which takes place as a result of further general elections the Party which is responsible for the election of the President and Executive is bound to come into conflict with the Seanad; that there is nothing but conflict possible all along the line; that <Col N="1491" /> you are dealing with an unscrupulous Executive, and that you must always frame any of your regulations and any of your safeguards with that in mind. These are not the circumstances of the time.  The Seanad happens to be composed of persons just as anxious for the advancement and progress of the country as the Deputy's conception of his own wishes in that respect, if we are to take his public statements or his statements here as his conception of what is necessary for the advancement of the country.  Eighteen months, with an addition of two months, is the period for which the Seanad can hold up a measure.  It is most unlikely that a measure will be held up for that or for a long period.  It ought to be borne in mind in connection with the holding up of legislation passed by the Dáil that if there be no accommodation found between the two Houses the Bill as passed by the Dáil, subject to whatever amendments are necessary in accordance with the change in time, is going to be law eventually.  The Seanad will have that in mind, and with that in mind there will be a disposition towards accommodation. The last word in wisdom is not always with one of any two Houses in any part of the world, and a conflict such as the Deputy invites the House to consider, a conflict upon national lines, is a conflict which has never taken place between the two Houses and which is most unlikely to take place in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two Bills have been held up in over five years.  With the provisions enshrined in this particular amendment to the Constitution it is possible, in fact it is more than likely, that accommodation would have been found, that they would have been law with very few minor alterations during the period.  They became law after nine months, and, as I say, with this new amendment, accommodation is much more likely to be found, and the disputes which the Deputy seems to envisage are not disputes which have arisen or are likely to arise in the future.  He envisages the possibility of a new Executive being returned.  To put it in a nutshell, what he imagines is that he is going to be here after the next general election and is going to <Col N="1492" /> take two years to make up his mind about introducing any legislation.  It is going to be two years before he consults his experts and gets a majority decision from his Party, and the Seanad is there then to watch and hinder and hamper all his legislation. It takes him two years to make up his mind as to what he is going to introduce. He then enters into the consideration of presenting all these legislative proposals to the Dáil.  All the time he has the fear of the Seanad, which is not a fear that a man should have who is proud of his position in the country or confident in his capacity to carry whatever he proposes.  The Seanad, I am sure, after being given a rest of two years, will give due consideration to whatever proposals he puts before them.  It is not, to my mind, a very remarkable indication of the great forward policy about which we have heard so much that we are going to have two years of breathing space before anything is introduced.</P>
    <P>Even suppose the Deputy ever does get a majority in this country, and gets here and takes two years to put his proposals through this House, within four months he is safe, even against a hostile Seanad, perfectly safe.  And let us suppose for a moment that he takes another year before he introduces his proposals, and that he is still dealing with the hostile Seanad, he has a great advantage, because with a dissolution the time is short.</P>
    <P>Now, in considering these matters, we ought to give a little consideration to other people being just as anxious for advancement and progress and fair consideration, on their merits, of every proposal that comes from one House to another.  It may be a disease of the mind or intellect that people enter into the consideration of legislative proposals with the idea that those opposed to them are always wrong.  That has not been our experience here during the past four or five years but rather that proposals put from any side of the House got fair consideration.  They were all considered in that light.  This is a proposal for bringing about more workable accommodation between the two Houses.  At any period during the eighteen months amendments from the Seanad can be considered here. <Col N="1493" /> Their amendments have not always been accepted here.  There has been occasionally accommodation found on amendments that come from the Seanad.  There have been very sensible and useful amendments put in by the Seanad.  As I said before, the last word in wisdom is not with one House in any part of the world The fact that a Bill is going to be made law in the form in which it left the Dáil in the first instance will always be before the mind of the Seanad, and the only thing that can be done by them is to effect delay.  It would be in the interest of both Parties if the measure was a useful one to pass it.  I hesitate to think that in this country it would be possible to find a House of 60 members with a majority against a useful measure.  That is what the Deputy opposite is inviting this House to consider in this case.  He has made a poor case for his four months amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we are to take this Bill as representing another attempt to reap the wild oats sown in the reckless youth of the Executive or what apology they have to offer for it.  We were told yesterday that Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution which were being deleted were inserted in consequence of the inexperience and youth of the Government.  This Bill we shall have to assume has been introduced in consequence of their senile decay, because I do not think that any Government still in the possession of all its faculties would introduce this Bill into this House.  Either that is the explanation or there is a much more serious explanation.  I am going to give the Government the benefit of the doubt when I say that this Bill is the product of senile decay.  If it is not the product of senile decay it is the product of a deliberate design against the people, to lessen the powers the people have to make laws on their own behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the power of the Seanad.  Not all the speeches that came from the Government Benches, not all the fine arguments that could be advanced would serve to cloak the fact that the design that the Executive hopes to <Col N="1494" /> carry out as a result of this Bill is to double the power which the nominated House holds to interfere with and to veto legislation enacted by this body. Deputy de Valera pointed out that the period during which the Seanad may suspend a Bill or allow to elapse before it proceeds to discuss a Bill is not divided in any way.  The President, of course, said it was most unlikely that a Bill would be held up for eighteen months.  Is it desirable that a Bill should be held up for eighteen months?  Are we to give to that House powers that they do not now exercise because the President is of opinion that it is most unlikely that these powers will be exercised?  Why give these powers if it is most unlikely that they will be exercised?  Do we not provide checks in the Constitution for the purpose of dealing with abnormal situations such as would be created by the coming into office of an unscrupulous Executive?  Of course I am prepared to admit that the coming into office of a scrupulous Executive would be a perfectly abnormal situation in this country, and people would regard it as such.  But we are discussing constitutional theory now, and we must talk as if the normal condition of the country was to have a scrupulous Executive in office.  The President is reckoning on the fact that a Bill sent to the Seanad and held up by the Seanad will finally become law, to influence the Seanad to arrive at the accommodation. He is gambling upon the chance that the Executive will be prepared to facilitate them, and he does that with the knowledge that the Executive that exists, and will exist for many years, will always be prepared to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>Of course there has been no dispute between the Seanad and the Dáil on national issues.  There never was any reason for a dispute between the Dáil and the Seanad on national issues.  The majority of the Seanad and the majority of this House hold the same views on national issues.  What is to happen when an Executive comes into office whose views on national matters are completely opposed to the views the majority of the Seanad hold, and will hold, after that Executive has been <Col N="1495" /> elected?  There will inevitably be a clash, and when it comes that Executive will have no alternative but to take drastic and, if necessary, unconstitutional action, to suppress the Seanad.  The giving of powers of this kind to a nominated House, composed in the majority of people who are, and always have been, in the opposite camp to the Irish people, will inevitably lead to some unconstitutional action being taken.  I do not mean necessarily forcible action, but some Executive with a big national reform to carry out, faced with a national crisis, will be compelled ultimately to put that Seanad where it belongs without the formality of introducing a Bill at all, because the only authority the Seanad has for its existence, and the only authority it can quote, the Constitution, has been admitted by both parties in this House to be something of no importance and that can be ignored as occasion requires.</P>
    <P>The proposal embodied in this Bill is, in our opinion, a very serious one.  No matter what the President may think to be likely or unlikely, it is, in fact, intended to give to the Seanad the power to suspend the Acts of this House for a minimum period of twenty months, a minimum period of over one and a half years.  You can easily imagine a number of Bills of considerable urgency, a number of Bills designed to improve the economic conditions of the country, which would not recommend themselves to the Seanad as constituted at present, representing, as it does, a number of vested interests in this country.  Is it proposed to give that nominated body the power to prevent necessary legislation, urgent legislation, and legislation required to prevent poverty or unemployment existing among our people&mdash;to prevent such legislation coming into operation for a period of two years?  That is what it is proposed to do.</P>
    <P>That is the effect this Bill will have when it is passed.  The President may not consider it likely that the Seanad will exercise its powers in full to delay the passage of Bills into it from this House.  This House will have to be satisfied on other grounds besides the President's opinion.  Before this House <Col N="1496" /> gives powers of this nature to the Seanad it should think twice and not be satisfied with a mere expression of opinion as to whether or not it is likely the powers will be exercised.  I hope&mdash; it is too much to hope, of course&mdash;that the Government may get a lucid interval and realise exactly where they are going, and, even at this stage, withdraw the Bill for the purpose of reconsidering the situation which they are attempting to create.  The President seems to think that he has scored a point against Deputy de Valera by referring to what the Deputy had said concerning a new Executive coming into office and taking two years before it would be in a position to carry out its full legislative programme.  Is the President serious?  Does he really contend that a new Executive coming into office would be in a position to carry out all of its programme within two years?  Has the Government found that they can prepare for presentation to the House important enactments in less than two years?  I wonder how long it is since the report of the Committee on Evil Literature was published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the Government finds it necessary to take longer than two years to prepare for presentation to this House important Bills, Bills that have not been prepared yet.  I have been told that the Evil Literature Bill is to be introduced before the end of the present session. There is no sign of its coming.  I hope that the Government promises in this matter will not evaporate into thin air. It will certainly not be passed before the end of this session, unless the Government is prepared to co-operate with the Fianna Fáil Party in order to give it a swift passage.  The amendment which Deputy de Valera has moved is designed to reduce the period of eighteen months in the Bill to four months.  Even a period of four months is long, because, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, it will ultimately mean that the Seanad will exercise its powers in full to hold up a Bill for eight or ten months.  The view of this Party, of course, on the matter is that the Seanad should not be there at all, but if it is, it should not have powers to hold up legislation, and if it is to have powers these powers should be such as not to give it the right to interfere unreasonably with the actions and decisions of the people's representatives. If the people are sovereign, if the people are the ultimate authority in the country, then this House should have the right to take action, and speedy action, on behalf of the people, where such action is necessary, without any other authority not representative of the people having the right to hold them up and put on the brake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad, we must remember, has not been effective in preventing hasty and panicky legislation in the past, <Col N="1498" /> although it did possess the powers heretofore to hold up unwise and unnecessary Bills for nine months.  They never attempted to do so in the case of Bills which were obviously the result of panic and the result of immature thought on the part of the Government. In fact, they showed themselves more liable to be influenced by panic than did the Government.  They were always prepared to come to heel when the Cumann na nGaedheal whip was cracked in the matter of the Public Safety Bill, the Treason Bill, or any other Bill designed to give the Government power to suppress all Nationalist opinion that may have remained in the country.  The President seems to be of opinion that it is impossible to find a House of sixty members prepared to interfere unreasonably with necessary legislation.  It is not at all impossible, and the President knows that it is not at all impossible.  I could find such a House of sixty members in a few moments.  In fact, with a few slight alterations the existing Seanad could fill the bill very nicely.  I could find a Seanad prepared to interfere unreasonably with certain legislation if that legislation was of a Nationalist tendency and not merely of the county council variety.</P>
    <P>The proposal, we are also informed by the President, is designed to secure a more workable arrangement between the two Houses.  The President can always contrive to advance fine arguments, as I said yesterday, in defence of a bad case.  We are taking out Articles from the Constitution in order to implement the Constitution, and we are proposing to surrender a considerable part of our power to the Seanad in order to find a more workable arrangement between the two Houses. Why not abolish the Dáil?  There would then be no clash between the Dáil and the Seanad.  The will of the Seanad in all these matters would be paramount.</P>
    <P>Why give the Dáil power to legislate at all?  We could devise a system, I have no doubt, by which Bills could be sent to the Seanad for final consideration. We could, in fact, reverse the position of the two Houses and let the Seanad be the operative part of the Oireachtas and the Dáil the mere delaying <Col N="1499" /> part.  A much more workable arrangement even than this could be found.  I do not think that is the explanation, and I do not think the explanation given by the President is likely to deceive anybody.  It is quite obvious it has not deceived even himself.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to ask what was the mysterious purpose the Government had in presenting an amendment of the Constitution in this elaborate form?  The section which it is proposed to insert in the Constitution is one that only the President could understand, and he could only understand it after giving it many days attention and many sleepless nights. He will remember that when he started to explain it on this day week he found he was off on the wrong track.  It is obvious he has given it very close attention since.  If it was the purpose of the Government merely to alter the Constitution to ensure that the power of the Seanad to suspend a Bill would be increased from nine to eighteen months, could they not insert in the Constitution an amendment to that effect?  You have taken out of the Constitution the section which says that &ldquo;a Bill passed by Dáil Eireann and considered by Seanad Eireann shall, not later than two hundred and seventy days after it shall have been first sent to Seanad Eireann, or such longer period as may be agreed upon by the two Houses, be deemed to be passed by both Houses, in the form in which it was last passed by Dáil Eireann ...&rdquo; Why not change the two hundred and seventy days to eighteen months?  A much less elaborate amendment would then be necessary. Certainly the amendment which appears here gives to me the impression that it was deliberately designed to prevent it being understood by anybody not versed in the reading of Bills. I would like to bet, if betting is still legal, that one-half the Deputies in this House have not gone to the trouble of reading Section 2 of that Bill.  The first few lines would frighten any of them off.  Only a few of us whose duty it was to find out what sense there was in it, if any, had the courage to wade through it.  The remainder, and I challenge <Col N="1500" /> contradiction, have not gone through the section and could not give a concise account of what it means.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>We have Article 17 instanced, and the Deputy says very definitely that is the effect the Bill will have if passed.  That statement suggesting to us that he has now explained the thing absolutely in clear detail follows along the line of nebulous talk about national issues and national matters, and then comes a period of transition and we have the Deputy saying that legislation might be introduced in this House to improve the economic conditions of the people here, and that such legislation would be very definitely turned aside by the Seanad because of the type of House it is, the <Col N="1501" /> type of vested interests that there are there, and there is no suggestion of any kind as to any one particular matter affecting the economic condition of the people here that might be turned down in that very drastic way by the Seanad. The position simply is that the Deputy considers that there are certain constitutional maladies that this country suffers from and that, in so far as he or his Party are concerned, they could think of no other way of doctoring this constitutional malady or these maladies, which they have not very clearly defined for us, than by a stimulant of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>We, on our side, think that any constitutional malady that the country suffers from cannot be assisted in any way by a stimulant of any kind; that you have to get down to the economic, social and industrial conditions of our people and build them up.  When we approach the question of the purpose of the two Houses, we approach it not with any great complex with regard to constitutional difficulties.  There has been other legislation referred to here that Deputies of the other side consider would have been useful for constitutional matters but not for ordinary legislation.  In the same way they refer to the relations between the two Houses in constitutional terms and not in terms of legislation.  We are thinking of the other House in terms of legislation and the work that can be done to build up the country industrially and economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take the period of time here we can have some interesting examples to work upon.  Let us take the Arterial Drainage Bill, which was before this House, and which left this House on the 30th March last.  It is going to be discussed back from the Seanad on to-morrow, the 28th June; that is, three months have passed as between the sending of that matter to the Seanad and its return.  Now, the matters that had to be dealt with in the Seanad, and that will have to be dealt with between ourselves and the Seanad, are not matters of very great intricacy or with any great possibility of any long drawn-out disputes.  Let us take it that they were matters of some intricacy.  We might easily spend a fortnight, a month or two months here between our ordinary matters and <Col N="1502" /> else considering this Arterial Drainage Bill.  Let us take it that it was a subject around which a very considerable amount of public heat of one kind or another had been developed in the course of the discussion, in working up towards its introduction in the Dáil, and in the discussion going on between ourselves and the Seanad.  There is no possibility, under the periods of time suggested by Deputy de Valera, of the matter being brought to a decision with any period of rest in between in the matter of its public discussion.  In that connection one must take into consideration the discussions in the Dáil, the subsequent discussions in the Seanad, and the disputes between the Dáil and the Seanad until the matter would finally come to a decision.</P>
    <P>What is here provided for is that a matter that had been discussed in the Dáil for a particular period and passed on to the Seanad, then having been discussed in the Seanad, and then having been in dispute perhaps between the Dáil and the Seanad, would have a period of rest free from discussions in either of these Houses.  That is a period during which any public agitation of any particular kind that might have been stirred up would have, in so far as it was spurious or exciting, subsided, and the representatives in both Houses, as well as responsible people in the country, could have a chance of looking at the matter in a clear, calm and unagitated light.  The matter comes again to the Dáil for decision in eighteen months.  Let us say that six months of the eighteen months are, in the case of a disputed Bill, taken up with discussions in the Seanad and with disputes between the two Houses. Assuming that the period is six months, that gives you a period of twelve months for the calming down of minds on the matter.  But at the end of that twelve months&mdash;that is, at the end of the entire eighteen months&mdash;the matter comes for clear decision by the Dáil. If the Dáil is clear in its mind as to what position it wants to take, then there is no reason at all for the period subsequent to eighteen months extending beyond the sixty days.</P>

As a matter of fact, the example taken by the Minister presents a certain ludicrous aspect because, suppose this Arterial Drainage Bill was held up for two months, that holding up would not only give time <Col N="1504" /> for feeling&mdash;supposing that there was feeling in the matter&mdash;to subside, but it would also give time for the floods to subside, give time to the farmers to subside, give time for anything to happen which would spoil largely the effect of the Bill.  Suppose, for instance, when the Fianna Fáil Party comes into power that it finds that certain measures are necessary to stop immediately unemployment and emigration, are we to be in the position of having to wait two years until the rest of the people have gone out of the country, simply because these measures do not please the Seanad as then constituted?</P>

      <P>Those measures that you will see when the time comes.  If you will look at our programme you will notice that there are a number of things in it which the Seanad would not like, and which are not relevant to the discussion upon this measure.  But they are there; I have them in my mind.  I can see the conflict that is going to arise, and it is exactly the elements that are represented in the Seanad that we are up against that will make all the difficulties possible. If you were to examine the way in which your own difficulties had to be faced, if you were sincerely and frankly to tell the House the difficulties that you had in dealing with certain elements in this country, elements referred to in uncomplimentary language by the President himself, elements that the Minister for Finance found it difficult to deal with, you would see what the position would be.  The people who make the difficulties are the people who have the power in the Seanad, and if they made difficulties for you, you are creating machinery so that when you go out of office they will be able to make ten times as much difficulty for anybody who stands for national principles or for the small farmers and the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President started off by charging Deputy de Valera with assuming that there was going to be conflict between the two Houses.  The only reason for the existence of Section 2 is the possibility of an element of conflict.  The argument is so cheap that really I cannot understand the President using it. <Col N="1505" /> It is a mere jibe at an individual, when the real matter lies in the Clause.  If there was no assumption of a conflict there would be no reason for the existence of Clause 2 at all.  The example taken by the Minister for Local Government in reference to the Arterial Drainage Bill was an excellent one as bearing out the contention of Deputy de Valera, because he showed in that case that three months was the period which was taken to deal with the matter over its various stages up to the time it comes back from the Seanad.  It happened that on that Bill there were people in the Seanad who were experts and who gave considerable assistance in dealing with the matter.  You have it within three months, but this amendment proposed by Deputy de Valera allows a month over and above that.  So that that is a close issue, a concrete example of the value of this amendment, and still it would leave time over, supposing, as the Minister supposed, it were a matter where there was a certain amount of contention; according to the amendment there would be still four or five months to feel public opinion on the matter and to see whether it was in accordance with the interests and the wishes of the people generally, that is to say, if the Seanad had decided for suspension.</P>
    <P>Another of the Presidential jibes was that we were assuming that we would be in power after the next election, and then a picture was drawn of what we were going to do&mdash;we were going to sit down for two years and do nothing. That is, of course, a cheap jibe; I cannot really describe it as anything else, because it implies that after two years there is not to be any more legislation. That is what is suggested by it, if anything. Even as it stands that is the way it works out, because the words in the last paragraph of Section 2 are: &ldquo;The said stated period is the period commencing on the day on which the said Bill is first sent by Dáil Eireann to Seanad Eireann and ending at whichever of the following times is the earlier, that is to say, the expiration of eighteen months from the commencement of the said period or the date of the re-assembly of the Oireachtas after a dissolution occurring after the commencement of such period.&rdquo;  Now, suppose an Act comes into force at the <Col N="1506" /> end of the dissolution, what happens? The next Government coming into power can repeal that Act and render it nugatory.  The carrying out of the Act is the most important part of it, and if a Government delays up to the very last minute in enforcing an Act which should properly have been enacted two years earlier, and then that Government goes out of office, of course it has not the power to carry the Act through.  Suppose, for instance, that a central bank were established by an Act within two years.  The Act would not come into force within that two years, a dissolution would take place and, I suppose, President Cosgrave then would anticipate that he might come back into power and render the legislation as useless as it was intended to be useful, to subserve the interests which have prevented him from dealing with matters like that in the past, so that that particular measure of legislation would be of no value to the country.</P>

      <P>First of all the Deputy set out with the assumption that a Bill establishing a central bank would be a Money Bill, which, of course, is not <Col N="1507" /> so.  I think that disposes of the matter, because it is ordinary legislation.  Of course these changes in the Constitution only bear out the original contentions of a very distinguished lawyer in this country who is now dead&mdash;I refer to Judge Stephen Ronan&mdash;who, in his decisions, regarded the establishment of the Constitution as ordinary legislation, and changes of the Constitution as ordinary legislation.  That is not the view held by other judges, and obviously it is not the view held by the Government, but, as a matter of fact, from beginning to end, from our point of view, the Constitution is only ordinary legislation, and no matter what rush tactics are adopted now there is nothing sacred about it.  In fact it is less sacred on account of the rush, and when the time comes it will be subject to change by ordinary legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I see in the proceedings of the Joint Committee in connection with the Constitution of the Seanad:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Joint Committee recommends, if the foregoing recommendation of the Joint Committee with respect to Article 38 of the Constitution be accepted, that Article 47 of the Constitution be amended so as to remove from the Seanad the power to demand a referendum save in the case of a Bill to amend the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that, as far as I can make out, the proceedings of the Joint Committee and the decisions they arrived at were not so much determined by points of constitutional development or matters as to what was the best way to provide us with a Seanad, but were dictated, as this resolution plainly indicated, by the fact that the Seanad felt itself to be in a certain bargaining position. The whole question, therefore, is not a question of ordinary constitutional usage and practice, but a question whether the House is going to accept the decisions of a Committee whose decisions have been prejudiced in this way.  I think the Seanad might have done its work a little better; it might, <Col N="1508" /> at least, have concealed its hand.  It might have failed to show the country quite so clearly as it has done that this is merely a question of a bargain between the Government Party and the Seanad, that on the strength of that bargain, and on the strength of the demand of the Seanad that there would be a quid pro quo, that for something they were asked to give up, something else should be taken away, and that in order to make up for the taking away of the power of the Referendum from them they should be given this additional power.  I think that the House should take the whole position into consideration, and ask themselves whether at this hour of the day, after the experiences and struggles of the past five years and the changes that have recently taken place, this position, this foundation, this extraordinary bargain is the best way in which to approach this whole question of the Seanad.  I cannot believe that, and I am more than surprised at the attitude of Deputy Tierney.  He recognised clearly, apparently, that this is a question far beyond Party matters, which may, as other Deputies have pointed out, lead to conflict in the future, and is a question which, in any case, is definitely changing the balance of power between these two Houses as we knew them in the past, into something entirely different.  But I am surprised to see that Deputy Tierney allowed that change to go, and that the only Deputy, in spite of the fact that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Labour Party, as well as the Fianna Fáil Party and Senators themselves were represented, dissenting from this bargain, which was proposed by a Senator, apparently at direct dictation from the Seanad itself&mdash;was Deputy de Valera.  The Minister for Agriculture endeavoured to develop a point of view yesterday, but did not succeed in developing it, because I think he found himself in the position that he could not very well go forward and, perhaps, had not the courtesy to go back.</P>
    <P>He did not find himself in the position of developing his argument about the will of the people and all that.  I hope that he will show, now that he is here, how he proposes to defend his doctrine that the will of the people is <Col N="1509" /> being safeguarded in this matter.  He said yesterday, of course, that the position is entirely changed.  During the past four or five years the country was in the position that it had a constitutional dictatorship inside, although it was not called that, and a military dictatorship outside.  If they did not do what they were told inside, and if the Seanad did not prove sufficiently accommodating to allow the legislation of the past few years to be rushed through, the people would have been faced with the lawful alternative of military dictatorship outside.  Now the Minister for Agriculture wants to make us believe that the military dictatorship, or some other form of dictatorship, is here on these benches.  I should like to hear the Minister developing that point.  In my opinion the element of dictatorship is lurking at present in these proposals, and if a dictatorship or a centre of resistance, as an English philosopher calls it, is going to be instituted in this Constitution and in this Assembly against the mandate of the people, and against the will of the people, that centre of resistance is being made in the Upper House, and the Government Party themselves are plainly making it.</P>
    <P>The President made a few jokes, as usual, about the fact that certain things were most unlikely.  He made no attempt whatever, I think, to reply to the clear statement of Deputy de Valera, which has been amplified by other Deputies, that if these proposals take shape it will mean that unless a new Executive proceeds to rush all its legislation through immediately it comes into power, and if there is delay, as there must necessarily be delay if you have a change of Government, before the Government can get all its legislation into ship-shape&mdash;we know how slow the draftsmen have been in the Government Party in preparing schemes on which nearly all Parties were agreed&mdash;the position will be that if legislation should come up about the middle of the term of office of the future Executive, the Seanad will be in power to negative that legislation.  The mandate on which the Executive may have been returned will have been thrown away, the time of the House will have been spent, and the conflict <Col N="1510" /> can only have one ending, which will mean the possible disappearance of the Upper House.  At any rate it will mean victory for the Lower House.  Such a conflict will undoubtedly be precipitated, and, as I said last week, is it worth it to plunge the country into another struggle simply because you want to take away from your present Opposition the powers that they had under the Constitution and believed they had when they came into this House?  Without lessening in any way the powers of the Seanad, you propose actually to increase their powers and place them in a stronger position than they are in at present.</P>
    <P>Now, even if we had not the element of bargain there in the report of the Joint Committee, and if we did not know that this was simply a quid pro quo between the Government Party and the Seanad, I submit to Deputies that even if that were not so we should still be careful of taking this Bill in a rushed manner, and of assuming that this particular piece of legislation is so necessary and so urgent that it should be thrown at our heads at this time.  Whatever justification there may be for the introduction of the other measures, even for the measures dealing with the abolition of the Initiative and the Referendum I say that there is no justification whatever for bringing this Bill forward now and rushing it, a Bill that is clearly and distinctly quite separate in principle from the other measures.  As I suggested before, the proper way to have dealt with it would be to have taken the other parties in the House into your confidence and to have got your constitutional lawyers to examine the whole question from every angle, and after you had done that, if you were quite satisfied that it was for your own good, not alone for the good of the Executive and the good of this House, but for the good of the people at large, that the powers of the Seanad should be extended, then by all means extend them.</P>
    <P>Had this Committee any single case put before it, and to what extent did it examine the history of this Assembly for the past five or six years to enable it to come to this decision?  As far as I <Col N="1511" /> know, the Seanad, during the past few years&mdash;I hope that in the future it will be equally so&mdash;proved itself admirably accommodating.  It never went out of its way in the slightest particular to interfere with the Government, even though it knew that a solid body representing one-third of the citizens of the country, if they could have secured representation here upon certain terms, would have fought to the last inch certain measures that were being passed. That body had so little regard for these people, for its own real position and for its future, that it made no effort whatever to combat these pieces of legislation. On a certain occasion, when they had the audacity in the Upper Chamber to introduce a trivial amendment into a certain Bill which had nothing whatever to do with politics, and which the Speaker of this House declared was merely a matter of electoral machinery, specifying that a person, in order to be on the register, should have his rates paid, the amendment was ruled out by this House.  The President and the Minister for Local Government at the time, and in fact the whole Ministry, got quite excited at this extraordinary development whereby this accommodating Seanad had the impudence to bring in an amendment which they themselves&mdash;and there are some good lawyers in the Seanad&mdash;believed was an amendment in keeping with the principle of the Bill, but which the Ministry in their anxiety to rush through legislation, did not or could not accept, and which they ruled was not in accordance with the principle in the Bill.  Therefore, on that slight occasion, when the Seanad on a small matter showed a certain amount of independence, the present Ministry, who tell us now that we have nothing to fear, that it is quite unlikely that any serious situation will arise in connection with this matter, told us at that time that it was the height of impudence on the part of the Seanad to do that, and that a piece of non-contentious legislation had been changed into a contentious one, and that the whole principle of the Bill had been changed, that it was quite unfair to the Dáil, and so on.  But now they have entirely changed their tune.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> What were the circumstances at that time?  They were that although you had not the closure and had not these resolutions so frequently proposed of declaring certain measures to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the peace and safety of the population, although you had not these arms which the Executive has now taken to itself, you had here a large majority and a small Opposition, and you were able to get your Bills through in a fairly rapid time.  On the particular day when this matter happened in the Seanad, there were about eight Bills, I think, introduced.  Not alone did the Seanad propose to give all of them a Second Reading, but some of them suggested, or I think it was suggested to them by the Ministry, that they might actually let these eight measures, or some of them, go through for Report Stage.  That is an indication of the extent to which the Seanad had been a check.  It was no check whatever.  It made certain amendments, but never attempted to interfere with the principle of legislation. It never attempted to give voice to the ordinary opposition in the country that was against these measures, and there is nothing whatever in the report of the Joint Committee to show that this matter was considered in that way: to what extent this check which the Seanad was supposed to be in the past has been for the good of the country, and to what extent legislation had benefited by the work that the Seanad had done in connection with other measures.</P>
    <P>What really happened during the last few years was that you had a strong Government Party and this weak Opposition, and no matter what was said or done everything was secure and serene when a Bill had passed through this House.  The Seanad was not regarded seriously by the present Executive.  Let them not attempt to make us believe now that they regarded the Seanad as something valuable and worthy, and something which really contributed to legislation.  They never regarded it seriously for a minute. They rushed through their legislation, and if the Seanad had attempted to hold up a finger against the Public Safety Act, for example, they would <Col N="1513" /> have fallen under the anathemas and objurgations of the Executive and of the President and his Ministers.</P>
    <P>We are in the position at present that we have an Opposition.  Let the Minister for Agriculture, with all his knowledge, tell us what check is better for democracy than a large Opposition Party on certain defined principles.</P>
    <P>The whole argument made by Deputy Tierney and others that the Seanad cannot possibly be a replica of this House is a false one.  It is an argument that democracy is unsound, that while it may be good enough for this Chamber we cannot trust it in the Seanad, and that our endeavour must be to baulk and cut out democracy and to institute some undemocratic power as far as lies in our power.  We have an Opposition here, and that is the best check, an Opposition that, as the Minister for Agriculture said yesterday, has to fight its way in the country.  It has plenty of difficulties in its way, I can assure you.  You have adult suffrage behind it, you have a fairly well-educated population with, I hope, a growing feeling, of what the Executive often say they are so anxious for, of civic responsibility and with an interest in public affairs.  In addition, you have every Party represented in this House.  Whatever argument might be put forward for the maintenance of the Seanad, if you had merely a two-party system, if you had not proportional representation, and if you had fear of that Party coming back with a large majority that might be out of all proportion to its real strength in the country&mdash;whatever arguments you might have for the maintenance of the Seanad and the existence of its powers under that system, I hold you have no argument for its maintenance under the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Every class in the community is represented in this House, whether they are represented by a large or small body of Deputies.  In certain constituencies you have nine Deputies.  You have, perhaps, a 50 per cent. poll, and you can calculate from that that only a very small interest in a particular constituency can get representation here, and that the proportional representation system is the best and real safeguard. While you have it there, and <Col N="1514" /> while you have now the position that every Party except one is represented here, you have a far better check than the check you seek to give to the Seanad by enabling it to hold up legislation for a longer period.  And as well as that you have the Constitution.  Are you afraid that the future Executive is going to treat the Constitution in the way you have done: that it is going to tear out Articles here and there to suit its purposes?  Have you any belief in this structure you have set up that you do not think your Seanad, as at present constituted, with the various interests you have built up behind you, your own Party, the Press, the Constitution and the Treaty, that all these things put together are not sufficiently strong to meet what the President terms the extraordinary conceptions of Deputy de Valera?  Surely they ought to be strong enough to meet poor Deputy de Valera.  Surely no extraordinary revolution is going to happen in the country.  Surely the Press is not going to change its tune.  Surely the people are not going to become alive to the facts of the situation, in the way that they will return a large majority for Deputy de Valera at the next election. I think that the Ministry know the Irish people better than that, having treated them so well, and having understood them so well, and having been able, like the Minister for Agriculture, to tell them that you are the will of the people.  You stood for the will and sovereignty of the people, and at the same time worked that will of the people not in the way the people wanted it, but in the way the Maxwells, the Cromwells and the landlords did.</P>

      <P>I submit that whether the other Parties can agree with Deputy de Valera's amendment or not they at any rate should not accept the principle laid down in this Bill by which the power of holding up legislation in two different periods will be increased to eighteen months, and that will mean the particular circumstances and atmosphere and the particular influences that have given rise to and grown up around the introduction and passing of legislation in this House will have completely disappeared.  You cannot hold up the business of the country, and that is what I believe it will mean, if you have important measures which are passed through this House after being discussed in all their stages held up for eighteen months.  You are adding to the insecurity you want to get rid of, and creating the position Deputy de Valera spoke of, that the people do not know whether or not there are other changes in the offing. If there is to be a struggle why not let it come off as soon as possible, and shorten the period to a reasonable limit so that within twelve months the country would know where it stands? If there is to be a conflict between the two Houses, if you cannot accept an amendment to shorten the period to four months and you keep this eighteen months, that would be out of all proportion and no precedent has been mentioned to show that anything like it exists in any other country.  No argument has been adduced to show that good will be rendered to legislation. No one doubts the growing incapacity and lesser influence the Seanad will have because of the growing time <Col N="1516" /> devoted to legislation here, and if you are going to make them a tool in this way they will take advantage of certain particular enactments to hold them up, and they will hold up the business of the country in that way.</P>
      <P>I ask you not to give them that power.  It means that not alone on national questions the way to achieving the full national aspirations of the people will not be left open to the people, but it means that certain matters which affect particular interests in this country will be held up.  You say the Seanad will not be a replica of this House.  It will not, but it will be a replica of the interests that feel they cannot get themselves sufficiently strongly represented under adult suffrage and proportional representation, and they will want additional representation.  You must give them that no matter what panel you adopt, because the whole thing is wrong from the democratic point of view.  Notwithstanding that, you propose to give them this power which will enable them to interfere with the many measures which we all foresee would be for the uplifting of the common people, but would not please the interests that have entrenched themselves here during the British times and, I am sorry to say, also during the past five or six years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, from what I have heard of these debates, that we are really in need of a few definitions of political terms in this country.  Great use has been made of the word &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo;  The suggestion is being constantly put forward from the Opposition Benches that you cannot have democracy unless every single matter is decided by direct election. The argument is put forward that this Seanad which it is proposed to set up will not be a democratic Seanad, and therefore should not be given any powers at all.  One would imagine, from some of the statements made from the Opposition Benches, that this was the first time in the history of the world in which the happy idea of inventing a Senate and giving it powers had occurred to any legislature.  One would imagine that there was no such thing <Col N="1517" /> as a Senate with specific powers in any State; that we had suddenly conceived the idea for the first time; that we were doing something altogether unprecedented and unheard of in the whole history of democracy.  I do not know what exactly the Opposition Deputies mean by their use of the word &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo; I would like to know whether they mean that you must have a system under which every single action taken by the State would be taken by means of direct election, or whether they would go as far as Deputy de Valera seemed inclined to go, when he talked about bringing back the system of ancient democracy, and introduce selection by lot into the country.  In ancient times, when democracy was first invented, nobody thought democracy was perfect unless most matters were decided by lot.  If we are to have this system of democracy, I would suggest to the Fianna Fáil Deputies that they should put forward this idea of selection by lot for all offices and for the election of the Seanad as well as the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives the Seanad a certain extended power to hold up Bills passed by the Dáil, but that power is not really so wide or so far-reaching as speakers on the Opposition Benches seem to imply.  In the first place, it does not apply to Money Bills.  When Deputy Little talks about a Bill to deal with the unemployment situation being held up by the Seanad, he overlooks the fact that it would be very difficult for any Government to frame a Bill of any value to deal with the unemployment situation which would not, in some way or other, come under the definition of a Money Bill, and which, therefore, could not be held up by the Seanad. Of course, speaking frankly, I should contemplate with equanimity any Bill which would prevent Deputy Little taking heroic measures in connection with unemployment, both for the sake of the unemployed and for the sake of the country as a whole.  But I would point out to him that this Bill would not prevent him from taking heroic measures&mdash;at least, measures which are to have any effect&mdash;when his Party come into power, if it does come into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> In the second place, what this Bill really does give to the Seanad is power to compel the Government of the day to go to the people with any piece of legislation which the Seanad deems to be sufficiently contentious to hold up for eighteen months.  If Deputy de Valera and his Party, for example, do come into power, and if any highly-popular piece of legislation of theirs is held up by the Seanad, then they have always by this Bill the option of putting that piece of legislation before the people at a general election, and if it is so popular, and so badly needed, surely they will be able to get a mandate from the people at the general election which will enable them to put their Bill through without any delay afterwards.  What Deputy Little and other members of his Party seem to be really afraid of&mdash;I would not be surprised if there was some reason for their fear&mdash;is that if the Fianna Fáil Party come into power, some Bill, passed by the Dáil, will be held up by the Seanad, and that, at the general election, the country will immediately take the first opportunity of putting them out of office, their piece of valuable legislation being lost as a result. That is what Deputy Little seems to be really afraid of, and I agree that there are some grounds for that fear.  However, the remedy for that situation really lies within the power of the Fianna Fáil Party itself.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made with the statement that the Seanad, as contemplated by this Bill, will be a nominated body.  An attempt is made to obscure the fact that, in a comparatively short time, the Seanad will be a body selected very largely by this House and, as time goes on, selected in increasing measure by this House.  Ultimately, the time will come when every member of the Seanad will have been selected at some stage or other by this House and the nominated element will have disappeared. There is no reason whatever to assume that the Seanad will be the last refuge of any class or section of the community which is filled with deadly hatred of Deputy Lemass and everything that Deputy Lemass stands for.  Speaking for myself, I am getting somewhat tired of Deputy Lemass on <Col N="1519" /> these questions.  He talked about the Government reaping the wild oats it had sown in its boyhood.  I am afraid the Deputy is treating us to the spectacle of himself actually sowing his wild oats.  He never opens his mouth but he smells the blood of an Englishman. Even if he does not smell the blood of an Englishman, he cries, &ldquo;Fee, faw, fum.&rdquo;  Every speech he makes is a threat that at some future period he will be forced to take some unconstitutional action.  Deputy Lemass and his Party took unconstitutional action before and this country survived it.  If they are so anxious to take unconstitutional action again, they might shout less about it.  They might wait until the time came and take their unconstitutional action.  As it is, the edge will be worn off our expectation.</P>

      <P>I cannot see where the justification is for all the strong language about this Bill and the denunciation of oligarchy and of the undemocratic action of the Government. I do not see the justification for all the fear that the Seanad may be able to hold up some highly-popular and badly-needed piece of legislation. This Bill is not only a substitute for Article 38 of the Constitution, but it is also a substitute for Article 47.  While giving the Seanad extended power in one direction, it takes away from that body extended power in another direction. It takes away from the Seanad a power which was dangerous and&mdash; partly because it was dangerous&mdash; largely unworkable.  It was a power which I, personally, believe the Seanad should never have had.  It gives the Seanad a power which is workable and <Col N="1520" /> which does not allow them to interfere too much with the wishes of the Dáil. It always provides that any Government whatever which finds its work being held up by the Seanad can put that work through easily after a General Election.  I do not see that there is any real reason for opposing this Bill on any democratic grounds at all.  I believe the opposition which has been offered to it is not inspired by any real feelings on this Bill, but by the general state of mind of the Opposition in regard to the Bill to delete Article 48.</P>

      <P>I fail to see the necessity for extending the present period of time to eighteen months.  I cannot find anything in the report of the Committee to justify that action. The Seanad seems to have been very loath in the past to have taken the course of even holding up a measure for nine months, and it certainly will be a great deal more loath to hold one up for eighteen months.  With all respect to the proposers of this amendment, I do not see how in any way the proposed amendment is going to facilitate either the business of Parliament or be of any advantage to the electors of the country.  Nine months is a considerable time to give to a second Chamber the right of delaying the passage of a Bill passed by the other Chamber, and until I am shown some tangible reason why this period should be extended I, for one, will vote against it.  I do not say that a period of four months would be quite sufficient, but I see nothing particularly wrong in the present period of nine months, and until I am shown to the contrary I will be prepared to leave things as they are. The Seanad, undoubtedly, will even be less democratic than it is now when the new system of election comes into force.  It will not be elected directly by the people in this country.  It will be elected, I suppose it might be said, indirectly by representatives of the Dáil and those who are in the Seanad, and in that sense it will not be an entirely nominated body.  If nine months were a sufficient period to give to a body which ultimately would have been directly elected by the people of this country <Col N="1521" /> for the holding up of measures passed by the Dáil, I certainly see no reason for giving eighteen months to a Chamber which shall not be so elected, and which shall be formed by a process in which the electors of Saorstát Eireann will have no direct concern. Therefore I think that the proposal is unnecessary, that it is going too far, and that nine months would be quite sufficient to give to the other Chamber, elected as it will be upon an entirely different basis from the present one, to delay the passage of measures passed by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself largely in agreement with Deputy Redmond in this matter.  First of all, I cannot understand why the Government introduced this Bill, having regard to the fact that the Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill, which leaves the Seanad without any responsibility to the people, has been already practically passed.  It has been said on both sides&mdash;I do not know which side wants to make the argument in its favour&mdash; that up to the present the Seanad has not interfered with or held up legislation&mdash;in other words, that it has not used the powers it has under Article 38.  What is the justification for introducing a measure to give them more extended powers when they have not already used the powers that are there? I can find one reason, and one reason only.  Up to the introduction of these Bills the Seanad had a certain responsibility to the people, because at some time they had to go before them for election.  Hence the holding up of legislation passed by this House, which is directly representative of the people, would have been a dangerous policy for the Seanad to adopt.  What is going to happen now?  In these circumstances the Seanad did not hold up legislation, but now we have a Bill practically passed&mdash;its passage was made easy&mdash;by which the Seanad is going to be elected by the Senators themselves and this House.  If you give people, under those circumstances, extended powers, is it not likely that they will use them to the fullest and the time will come when they will hold up this legislation for eighteen months simply because they are not accountable to the people?  For that reason <Col N="1522" /> alone there is a sufficient argument for not supporting this Bill.</P>
      <P>I admit that if the Seanad is going to be useful at all it must have certain powers of restriction, but those powers are amply covered by Article 38.  If Deputy de Valera had adopted the period in Article 38, or had satisfied himself with moving the rejection of this Bill, he could have made a case. I can see his difficulty.  The period had to be a little different from what was in the Constitution before, and at the same time he had to see that the Seanad was not getting too much power.  I would prefer to vote for Deputy de Valera's four months than for the Government's eighteen months, but I think that Article 38 does not require a comma removed, and in my opinion this Bill is altogether unnecessary.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect.  It is an extraordinary fact&mdash;I pointed it out in a lesser degree before&mdash;that not one of the Senators missed a meeting of this Joint Committee.  All this new legislation is practically legislation suggested by the Seanad itself.  This Bill is a suggestion of the Seanad itself.  This Bill is a child of the Seanad, and the Government are adopting that child and want us to give the Seanad more extended powers.</P>

      <P>Not as it should be.  Many of the members elected, as I pointed out before, did not attend.  The representation on this Committee was five from the Seanad and five from this House.  One member of the Seanad was equal to two and a half members of the Dáil in this division.  There are sixty members in the Seanad and 153 members in the Dáil, so one Senator is equal to two and a half Deputies.  If the proportion on the Committee was properly arranged, we would have fifteen on that Committee instead of five.  That is an answer to Deputy Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> All this legislation has been suggested by the Seanad.  The Seanad as represented on that Committee has entrenched itself, and the Government have adopted the idea, so that the Seanad is going to be a stronger body than the elected representatives of the people, if this Bill passes.  With reference to the power the Seanad is to be given under this Bill, I for one will not allow popular election to be wiped out on the one hand, and these people, to be nominated by this House or any other, given larger powers than the people's House have to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. COONEY Mr. COONEY">

      <P>If this Constitution (Amendment) Bill is passed&mdash;I presume the Government feel certain it will pass&mdash;the people will have at least one consolation as a result of the discussion here.  The President has clearly indicated that he realises the truth of what Deputy Flinn said yesterday, that the writing was on the wall.</P>
      <P>The writing is on the wall.  This Government is on its last legs.  It is to go at the next election.  Consequently it finds it necessary to set up some barrier to prevent progress by its successors in the hope, I presume, that those barriers will be sufficiently strong to drive the new Executive to the country, and in the hope also that Cumann na nGaedheal may again wangle back into power.  The Minister for Local Government has asked what national matters might give rise to a clash between the Seanad and the Government.  No doubt it must be very difficult for a Minister who has been in the position which that Minister has occupied, or rather in the varied positions which he has occupied in the last few years, to visualise any issue on which the Government could clash with the Seanad.  I would, however, like to submit that the Government which we visualise in the future will be a very different Government in national matters and in national outlook to that which we have known for the last five years.  As to what matters might give rise to a clash, I do not think that it requires a great stretch of imagination to visualise some of them, particularly economic matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might have, for instance, on a <Col N="1524" /> clear mandate from the people, a Bill brought in to nationalise railways.  Is it assumed that we would not find in the Seanad people who for certain reasons would oppose such a Bill tooth and nail?  We might find, and we might secure, a mandate for various economic reforms, and I submit that the personnel of the Seanad is such, and is likely to be such during its term of office, that any economic reforms brought forward here for the specific purpose of uplifting the masses of the people would undoubtedly find a united opposition in the Upper House or, at least, an opposition by a majority of the members there.  That Upper House was put there, not for the purpose of helping national legislation, not for the purpose of helping this country to progress towards national or economic freedom, but was put there as a definite barrier to the realisation of these ideals.  It will be only serving its purpose by continuing to oppose any such measures. Yesterday the Minister for Defence impressed on us, in discussing another Constitution (Amendment) Bill, the necessity for government.  Above all things, he said, we must have government, and the majority Party, or the Party which goes to the country, submits a coherent programme to the people and obtains a mandate, is entitled to come back and put that programme into effect.  Is this proposal not aimed at destroying that authority or, at least, at hindering its progress? At least, one could agree that the Party which obtains a mandate is entitled to give effect to that programme.</P>
    <P>Why then come along the following day and take away from a Government the right to give effect to that programme? This Bill, as some other Deputy has said, aims at giving more power to the Seanad.  Those of us who have known the record of that Seanad since its inception can quite understand why that power is being given. It is being given because this Government sees that its term of office is nearing an end, and that it has got to hand over all the powers it possibly can confer on its allies in the ring.  The relationship between the two Houses since this Government came into existence <Col N="1525" /> has always been harmonious, and if on any occasion there was an attempt at independent criticism on the part of Senators, we know how it was treated by Ministers.  President Cosgrave attempted to lead us to believe that this Bill is introduced because he recognises that the last word in intelligence and judgment does not rest with one House in any country, but it is not for that reason that we are extending the powers of the Seanad, it is not with a view to soliciting their judgment and opinion on any matter.  Deputy Tierney referred to a statement alleged to have been made by Deputy de Valera when he advocated selection by lot.  I do not know exactly what he means, but, at any rate, I am sure that it would be preferable to the present method of selection to the Seanad, namely, selection by lodges and Chambers of Commerce and all the other various interests operating in this country against the common people.  These are the interests represented there, and these are the circles from which Senators have been drawn to serve the imperial idea.</P>

      <P>I am replying to the statement made by Deputy Tierney.  If the Government were sincere in this matter, if they were sincere when they say that it is with a view to preventing hasty legislation and with a view to ascertaining whether the Government are acting in the interests of the people and with a mandate from the people, they have had ample opportunity here during the last few weeks of proving their sincerity in that matter. They failed to practise what they preached.  They have rushed through Bills and, not alone have they rushed Bills through, but they are putting down a motion for to-morrow, I think, to prevent the Seanad from holding up those measures, even for the limited period in which they are entitled to do so at present.  That proves the extent of the sincerity of the Government in that matter.  I was glad to hear Deputy O'Hanlon opposing this Bill, and I hope to have the pleasure of hearing Deputy <Col N="1526" /> Alfred Byrne supporting him in that opposition.</P>

This is the product of the representation of the Seanad on that Committee. I do not know exactly whether it is their proposal or not but, at any rate, the Report indicates that they never missed having their full forces present at every one of these Committee meetings and they were, as has been pointed out, in the majority.  I think that the Independent Deputies should assert their rights to representation on the Committee which was considering such important matters as these.  I trust that with the aid of Deputy Alfred Byrne, Deputy O'Hanlon, and all other Deputies who care to exercise their intelligence on this matter, we will be able to defeat the Government.</P>

      <P>The one great improvement that has been made in these discussions since we started them is that that atmosphere of contempt and contumely for their own off-spring, contempt and contumely which no doubt that off-spring deserves, the attitude of contempt and contumely, with which the Government treated its own Constitution Amendment Bills, 13, 14, 15, 8, 7, and 6, has been amended.  Instead of Ministers getting up mumbling two or three words which none of us could hear&mdash;the fact that we could not hear them was their best recommendation&mdash; we now have Ministers actually put up to defend these Bills, but having regard to the actual calibre and to the actual merit and nature of the speeches which have been delivered yesterday and to-day in defence of these Bills, by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Local Government, I am doubtful whether they were more greatly insulting their legislative off-spring by leaving them unannounced <Col N="1527" /> than by announcing and defending them.  Of course it is impossible for me to obtain at this early stage the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the speech delivered by the Minister for Local Government, but if I could get the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of that great utterance, the best speech I could make against this Bill would be to deliver that speech word for word in relation to the Bill itself.  You have the extraordinary position that the exact and detailed arguments put up for the provisions of this Bill by the Minister for Local Government are an exact and detailed argument against the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Delay,&rdquo; he said.  Delay!  Delay is the one wonderful solvent of all difficulties.  Delay is the thing which enables us to come together.  Delay is the thing which enables us to understand one another&mdash;gaps and intervals in which we can go back and let our passions die down and our prejudices disappear.  That is what is wanted in relation to ordinary legislation.  People do things hastily.  They do things without consideration.  They are influenced by the passion and the heat and the Party interest for the moment, but wiser counsels will prevail.  &ldquo;There cometh wisdom in the sleep of many months.&rdquo;  That is for ordinary legislation. Delay gives the people time to think, gives the separate interests which have been antagonised and said hard things about one another, and used prejudiced and interested arguments, time to pool their experience in the wisdom of their constituents.  With the passing of time all will be well.  Am I misrepresenting in any way&mdash;no doubt I am saying it a great deal better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;am I misrepresenting in any way the spirit, the purpose and the purport of the speech of the Minister for Local Government who introduced a Bill to create delay under the closure, to hurry up the process of delay?  We gave him a fair chance. There is no man in this House less willing than I am to deal in generalities, if he could come close to the issue.  We gave him an opportunity of coming close to the issue.  We said: &ldquo;Apply <Col N="1528" /> the principles of your speech to the actual measure which you are introducing, to all those measures.&rdquo;  Why, therefore, put this great, wonderful, amazing and alleviating virtue in delay, in relation to ordinary legislation, and none of it in relation to a serious matter of Constitutional changes, in relation to a whole series of Constitutional changes, in relation to the most vital matters of Constitutional change?  Why should ordinary legislation be passed in an atmosphere of peace, consideration, carefully long-drawn out, slow delayed consideration, and why, on the contrary, should Constitutional amendments be rushed through here under the closure in the middle of the night, at an abnormal time, at the cost of interfering with the course of ordinary legislation, at the cost of transferring the Estimates to the next session?  Why?  We are entitled to know.  If the argument of the Minister for Local Government is good that delay is good, why is not delay good in relation to these matters?  We are not evading the issue.  We are not talking generalities.  We are coming dead close to the clean, hard issue.  Why should his principles only be applied when they suit him?  No answer.  There will not be any answer except Peadar Doyle.  That is the only argument, the only answer.  We have three men, who on a change over on a division would throw us out, but we have got these three men.  As long as we have not these three men, who on a division make six, we have a mandate of the people to pick, choose and select how we shall apply principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We only apply first principles in such a manner that they will never interfere with our interests.  It is not in principle they apply; it is in interest, self-interest.  The principle of delay is magnificent, but it must not be applied when it does not suit them.  The principle of calm consideration of legislative enactment, waiting for the time for passions to die down&mdash;Oh no!  Excellent principles; but they must not apply to interests.  That is the argument Ministers have got to meet or to run away from and sit back, broken, in their seats, incapable of answering &mdash;the inferiority complex made manifest and made flesh in the person and <Col N="1529" /> presence of the Minister for Local Government.  You saw it; you saw the whole argument; you saw the clean issue put to him, and you saw him stumble and mumble and sit down unable to meet the issue he had raised.

      <P>If you are suggesting that throughout the whole length of the speech of the Minister for Local Government he never got near the Bill, I am prepared to agree with you, but why did you not hold him up?  Behind this there is a perfectly simple proposition. The President, who probably is the most useful man in the House to his opponents, let the cat out of the bag. It was not Deputy Little's cat this time.  It was his own.  He said this was done as a consideration&mdash;a legal term.  A consideration for what?  A consideration to whom?  And under what circumstances?  A consideration to the semi-nominated, semi-elected, semi-co-opted, self-renewing body of the Seanad; a consideration to them for a vested interest which was being <Col N="1530" /> interfered with; a vested interest under the Constitution by which they had these amazing and alleviating powers of delay to the extent of nine months, plus the fact that under Article 47, they had power, if they dared&mdash;and it is a pity that on one occasion they did not dare to send back to the people legislation which came from here and which they regarded as undesirable. That further power of holding up legislation was to be taken away from them, and in consideration of that they were to be given other powers instead. Voluntarily given as between a willing buyer and a willing seller?  No.  As between someone who had the grip complete, due to the laziness, the idleness, the ignorance or the connivance of the Front Bench opposite.  You are not free to say whether you can give the Seanad this consideration or not. They can enforce it.  You cannot take from them the power of 47 or 48; you have no power whatever to do it.  You have to buy it from them and buy it at their price, and they are no fools in bargaining, judging by 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Constitution Amendment Bills we have here.  They can exact their price, and this is part of the price and it is a downright good price when you consider that it is only part of the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the position?  The Seanad election was due at the end of this year.  At that Seanad election if they went to the people quite a number of the key men, who fit into the conspiracy between the Front Bench and those who are blackmailing them at present, would have disappeared.  They do not want that.  It was necessary to set up some machinery by which they could be saved.  It paid the Front Bench opposite to keep these key men in existence.  They could not go on with the old thing, because if they did they would disappear.  So they had a conference.  The wolf lay down with the lamb, and they formed a beautiful and now quite indistinguishable combination. &ldquo;If you do not give us something better than we have,&rdquo; say the Seanad, &ldquo;we can keep what we have.&rdquo;  Under these circumstances, what sort of a bargaining position do you think the Government and the Dáil were in, even if they had twenty representatives <Col N="1531" /> of the Independents for Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>

The point we want to get back to is that we are not free agents in the matter.  The Seanad holds the position.  The time at which it is necessary to hold the election will legally evaporate before you can enforce upon the Seanad anything you pass now. They are in a position to blackmail you, and they have blackmailed you all along the line.  Assume for a moment that you send to the Seanad something that the Seanad does not like.  Even now they can put 47 and 48 in operation for what provisions they like, and then they can pass the Bill abolishing 47 or 48 for the things they do not like, and there is no means whatever in this House to stop it.  A beautiful position! It does not raise one's respect for the intelligence of this House, but that is it&mdash; a bargain with a man who has absolute control of the position&mdash;and that is the price that is paid to a nominated, self-renewing, irresponsible, undemocratic body for the vested interest it now has in holding up the legislation and activities of the democratic and the elected body.  That is the price and that is the issue.  There is not the slightest use getting away from it. That is a price and a consideration for a vested interest in anti-democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by my friend Deputy Derrig that in doing this something else is done.  The balance of power, as between the Upper and the <Col N="1532" /> Lower House, the House of the proletariat and the House of something else, is disturbed against the democratic House.  Perfectly true, but why do it? Why not delay a long time?  Why not have months of delay?  Why not ask the people about it in the interval? On the passing of these Bills, by a Party majority in this House, depends the existence of this Government. Their Party majority is operative within the Constitution to keep them a Government at present, because if they do not use their Party majority to interfere with the discretion of the people under these Bills they would disappear.  They could no more go to the country, they could no more let go to the country the suggestion of destroying Articles 47 and 48 on a Referendum by the machinery provided by itself and hope to survive than they could fly.  Three members!  That is their mandate to tear up the Constitution. That is their mandate to give power to the Seanad to put snags on the wheels, to screw down the safety valve.  Three members!  And they do not dare test the opinions of the people under the Referendum.  If they did they would disappear at once.  It would hurry on the process a little.</P>
    <P>Now, I do think, getting back to the speech delivered in favour of the provisions of this Bill by the Minister for Local Government, that we ought to be treated seriously, that a man ought not to be put up on the Government Benches to argue a special case which is against the principle upon which the special case is founded.  In religion &ldquo;What damned error, but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with text.&rdquo;  That is exactly it.  Their own principle destroys their own arguments, and when they are asked to come close to the issue and to meet that they mumble, and sputter and fall back.</P>

      <P>Yes, I did.  I want that picture of a responsible Minister faced by a clean issue, and the result of being asked to face that clean issue, to remain in the minds of the House, because it is typical of everything and <Col N="1533" /> of the whole position of the Government now.  These things are just oxygen poured into the dying patient just to keep him alive a little longer, to give him a kick so that he can make a will in favour of someone in whose favour he ought not to make it.  Their political shrouds are already woven, and the graves in which their political reputation will rot are already dug. They dare not face the people; they do not dare to come before them with the Referendum; they do not dare to ask their opinion under democratic conditions.  Footling and fooling, playing round behind the scenes with little small devices to drag out their lives for a little time and to insure, if that is humanly possible, a succession of power which is worse even than themselves. Democrats!  They do not dare to come to the people; they do not dare face any issue, because not all their little footling ways and special arguments and special pleadings will hold them in the face of the people long. These things are just part of a series; this is not the biggest of them.  It is one portion of the price of the blackmailer who has held them up, and into whose hands they are playing.  This House should not consent to pay the blackmail price or the consideration by the Seanad for the vested interest it has, and the power they now possess to hold up the legislation of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>Fearing that anybody would be so disposed as to believe what Deputy Flinn has said, I looked up the proceedings of the Joint Committee which presented the report, one of the recommendations of which is embodied in this Bill.  I find there were present five Senators at the Joint Committee, and on the 9th May, on which this recommendation was made, there were present the Ceann Comhairle (in the Chair), the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad; Deputies de Valera, Morrissey and Tierney; Senators Bennett, Douglas, O'Farrell, Jameson and O'Hanlon.  I find of that number two were nominated Senators by me in 1922.  One was elected by the Dáil&mdash; that method of election to the Seanad which appeals, I expect, to Deputy Flinn and his confreres&mdash;and the other three Senators were elected by a much <Col N="1534" /> larger number of voters than Deputy Flinn was, and the remainder are members of the Dáil.  There was one dissentient.</P>

      <P>I rise to point out, in connection with the section of the Bill which we are discussing, that the Constitution under which we are working, and under which some of our friends seem to be suffering, when it was originally passed some years ago, was very similar to a large number of Constitutions which have recently come into being in Central and North Central Europe.  In the course of the last few years very many of these Constitutions, similar to ours, have shown certain defects and the countries concerned have had to take steps in order to remedy those defects.  The principal defects have been that in these hastily arranged Constitutions there were not sufficient checks put upon the main popular Chamber, which resulted in a certain difficulty in the carrying on of parliamentary government.  The solution which has been found in most countries has been to increase the powers of the head of the State.  That has been the case in Poland, and in many of the Northern and Central Republics.  I think that solution in this country would be very undesirable.  I think all Parties will agree that it would be undesirable to place on the Governor-General any more responsibility than he already possesses under the Constitution.  In the first place, the heads of the States in these Republics are for the most part elected by the two Chambers sitting together, whereas the Governor-General of this country is nominated on the advice of the Executive Council, which is responsible to the Dáil alone. It is proposed in this Bill to grant that power of check and delay to the Seanad, which is to be elected in a similar manner as the Presidents of Republics in these States are elected; that is to say, by the two Houses sitting together.  I think that body so elected is a more desirable body to <Col N="1535" /> exercise this power of delay than the head of the State, who is nominated on the advice of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>I would appeal most earnestly to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to support this section in the Bill in the interests of their own Party and its future.  I think their opposition to it is entirely mistaken and is due to some misunderstanding.  As Deputy Tierney pointed out to Deputy Little, they will be enabled, if they come into power, to put into operation practically the whole of their economic programme. I cannot think, in fact, of any measure dealing with the economic life of the country which could not take the form of a Money Bill.  Even their policy of the prohibition of exports could be made a Money Bill by the imposition of a prohibitive export tax.  So far as I know, all the main items of their economic policy could be carried through in the form of Money Bills, which can only be held up by the Seanad for a period of 21 days.  Similarly, their fears that the Seanad would make it impossible for them to carry out the constitutional changes which they propose are, I think, groundless. This Bill is designed to facilitate the Fianna Fáil Party in carrying out its policy.</P>

      <P>I will not say that it is solely designed for that object, but that was kept in mind, I daresay, when it was being introduced.  They will have an opportunity, although apparently the Opposition is a bit doubtful that it can be done, of immediately, on obtaining a majority, introducing two Bills, the two Bills that I understand they are mainly interested in introducing.  The first will be to amend the Constitution Act by removing Section 2.  They will not have to wait two years for that, because it could easily be done.  That is the first measure they could introduce&mdash;to amend the Constitution Act.  Then they have only to introduce Constitution (Amendment No. 16) Bill to remove the empty formula as they describe it.  Assuming&mdash; and it is by no means certain&mdash;that the Seanad were to hold up those two <Col N="1536" /> measures for periods of eighteen months, it is only right to the country, if the Fianna Fáil Party felt that this issue of breaking the Treaty had not really been put before the people, that they should immediately proceed to another general election, and automatically those two Bills would come into force.  Otherwise, if they are specially confident in their majority, they could wait for the specified period to elapse and then the Bills could be made operative in that way.  I think it is unfair to them that, by the method of the Initiative, the people should introduce this legislation, and then that this Government should get all the glory of carrying through this magnificent and patriotic work, which glory should rightly go to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think they are not doing themselves justice in the whole attitude they have adopted towards these Bills. Under this particular Bill, when the time comes, they will be in a position to take responsibility for such Acts as they propose to introduce, and I do not think they really should expect this Party and the Government to take responsibility for their policy.  For that reason I appeal to them, in the interests of their own Party and the future effectiveness of their own Party, to vote most enthusiastically in favour of this section.</P>

      <P>When the President was Minister for Local Government he looked for help and support from the county councils, and that was at a time when it was very hard for the people on the county councils to help him.  The people remember that they did the work when it was necessary.  Nowadays the councils are looked upon as corrupt bodies, incapable of appointing even a sub-sanitary officer, and the power which was good enough for them at that time is not good enough now that their duty is done.  The President has got the help that he required from them and the people who gave him very little help are now to be given the power to hold up legislation in this country.</P>
      <P>When the President was talking a few days ago he referred to the Fianna Fáil Party as some sort of mythical old maid who was angling after the support of Deputy O'Connell, and he pictured this old maid in a condition of spiritual exaltation.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Connell cares for old maids in a state of spiritual exaltation or not.  I know, however, that the President reminded me very forcibly of an old maid himself, of a famous old lady known as Sairey Gamp.  Sairey Gamp was well known with her friend, Mrs. Harris, for septic work.  I think the nine Bills that are now brought in here for strengthening and improving, or disimproving, the Seanad are very septic Bills as regards the Constitution.</P>

I am sorry that Deputy Sir James Craig or Deputy Thrift is not here.  Deputy Craig would understand that by small doses of sepsis it may lead to a condition of hypersensitiveness, and if you touch the constitution of any state or individual by a small diluted dose, then the next dose will probably smash up the constitution. The left boots of Deputy Craig and Deputy Thrift would require soleing from the numerous turns to the left that they have made.  They should know, on a question like this, that if the Constitution survives the initial dose it will get into a state of anaphylaxis, and the next dose will probably mean that the Constitution will be finished.  I am sure that Deputies Craig and Thrift would not like that.  But you cannot have your bread buttered on both sides.  The point that I see is that by any of these Bills it is shown that the Constitution can be amended into such an unrecognisable thing that Deputy Craig and Deputy Thrift will realise that when we come into power we can abolish it.</P>

      <P>The claims of the non-permanent clerks who were originally recruited without any test by way of examination have already been investigated. Three examinations for permanent situations, the tests in which were of a particularly easy standard, designed to suit persons who had long left school, were specially arranged for the benefit of these temporary clerks.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that flour prices have fallen considerably during the past three months, and quotations ruling at present are 42/- per sack; whether, as bakers are buying much lower than this figure at contract rates, as 94 loaves are baked from each sack of flour of 280lbs., and as the price of the 4lb. loaf to the consumer still remains as high as 11d. (delivered, or over counter) in many parts of the Saorstát, he will request the Master Bakers' Association to give an explanation for these apparently excessive charges to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices of flour have tended to fall somewhat during the last three months, but according to my information the price quoted in the question is less than that at which the master bakers generally are able to obtain supplies.  A substantial alteration in the price of flour, maintained for some time, is necessary to justify an alteration in the price of bread, and I <Col N="1543" /> do not consider that at the present moment a prima facie case exists of excessive charging against the master bakers.  My Department will, however, continue to watch the price of bread in relation to the price of flour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the answer, in view of the findings of the Tribunal on Prices to the effect that excessive profit must have accrued to the master bakers in the Saorstát for the years 1926-27, owing to the decline in flour prices not being reflected quickly enough in the price of the loaf, and also that they were satisfied that there was urgent need for the early intervention on the part of the proposed Prices Board, will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether it is the intention of the Minister to set up such a Board in the near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of whether I am satisfied with the price of bread in relation to the price of flour.  The facts are as stated in my answer, that any alteration that takes place in the price of flour is a matter that is being watched by my Department, and it will continue to receive our attention.  If there is a substantial reduction in the price of flour, which in our opinion ought to reduce the price of bread, we will take the necessary steps.</P>

      <P>Progress was reported and the President announced that he would take this Bill. That is the reason why I took this Order first.  On Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, Deputy MacEntee has an amendment in page 1, line 29, to insert after the word &ldquo;words&rdquo; certain other words.  I am taking that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two amendments in my name.  There is one which is in page 1, line 29, Section 4, to insert after the word &ldquo;words&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;within the terms of the scheduled Treaty,&rdquo; and of the words &ldquo;but no such amendment, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, after the expiration of a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall become law, unless the same shall, after it has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the said two Houses of the Oireachtas, have been submitted to a Referendum of the people, and unless a majority of the voters on the register shall have recorded their votes on such Referendum, and either the votes of a majority of the voters on the register, or two-thirds of the votes recorded, shall have been cast in favour of such amendment,&rdquo; and the deletion of the words &ldquo;the said period of eight years&rdquo; and the substitution for these latter words of the words &ldquo;a period of thirteen <Col N="1548" /> years.&rdquo;  That is one amendment.  I have another one which is shorter.  Is the first in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given notice of two amendments one of which he has read out. That one seeks to delete in Article 50 the words &ldquo;within the terms of the scheduled Treaty&rdquo; and to substitute for the period of eight years in Article 50 the period of thirteen years. I think both these matters are outside the scope of the Bill.  The Bill has no concern with the period during which the Constitution may be amended by ordinary legislation or with the first two lines of Article 50.  I am not prepared to accept that amendment, but I am prepared to accept the other amendment which deals with the application of the Referendum to constitutional amendments on the ground that it is an extension of what is actually in the Bill. The other amendment dealing with the deletion of the words &ldquo;within the terms of the scheduled Treaty&rdquo; and the extension of the period could not be taken on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you allow me to submit that had we had the statutory time to deal with our amendments we might have been able, in co-operation and consultation with yourself, to amend this amendment which is now being moved out of order into a form in which it would be a substantive matter which could be dealt with?  It seems to me that the ruling out of this matter is simply an intensification and advertisement of the injury which is being done to the House in carrying on the procedure which has prevented private members from putting in amendments after proper consideration. I submit that under the circumstances every opportunity ought to be given to Deputy MacEntee to amend that amendment into any form in which it would be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>No form would bring an amendment into order which purported to do the two things mentioned. namely, to delete in the first two lines of Article 50 the words &ldquo;within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty&rdquo; and to extend the period of <Col N="1549" /> eight years to thirteen years.  No form of words would bring these matters into order on this Bill.  The Deputy's other amendment is in order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a modification of the method.  There was a question of the extension of the period or a modification of the method by which after the period the Constitution could be amended.  I think the Minister for Finance explained that there was a proposition under consideration for an amendment of the Constitution passing through two Parliaments, that is, to be passed by one Parliament and, subsequent to a general election, by a second Parliament&mdash;the Parliament resulting from that general election again passing the same amendment. We suggested two methods of considering it, either extension of the time or passing it through two Parliaments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say, because the explanation I gave on the last occasion shows that it is a matter upon which one cannot easily make up one's mind.  Personally I feel rather disposed to disagree with the proposal to extend it to thirteen years, because I hesitate to think that that is even final.  I would like to reach such a stage in which it would be possible to amend the Constitution, but, at the same time, difficult to amend it; that there should be some degree of finality about the Constitution itself; that it should not be subject to easy amendment.  It does appear to <Col N="1550" /> me that the method in that Article is rather a difficult one.  That is, &ldquo;that a majority of the voters on the register of voters shall have recorded their votes... or two-thirds of the votes recorded.&rdquo;  That is rather a difficult method; but I do not like simply extending the period for an additional five years.  As a matter of fact, while the disposition and decision, almost, of the Executive Council is to alter the present method, they are not yet agreed upon the manner of doing it, but I have no hesitation in saying that it will be altered before the period elapses.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that this contingency variation of the Constitution is to remedy a defect created by the Bill now being introduced?  Is it for the purpose of giving that interval and consideration which the Ministry desire in connection with a Bill of that kind?  If that is so, would not the best, most patriotic, and statesman like attitude be for the President to withdraw this Bill until he has an opportunity of reconsidering it in the light of the amending Bill he proposes to introduce? <Col N="1551" /> If he would do that it would make for accord and good feeling and unity and co-operation in the House.  I am talking now, for the moment, on the assumption that the President is a statesman, and that he is not looking at this from the mere Party point of view which prejudiced people are suggesting that he is.  If he was looking at it as a statesman, having regard to the fact that during the process of passing a certain Bill he has found it necessary to produce certain contingent alterations in the Constitution, and, in so far as he has not been able to make up his mind as to the nature of the contingent variation, I suggest he should withdraw this Bill, which has caused the necessity for this contingent variation, until he has made up his mind what contingent variation will fit into the Bill he is now introducing. I submit that on the grounds of statesmanship, on the grounds of accord, and in order to get the House to act together in a serious matter of constitutional change, that he ought very seriously consider withdrawing this Bill until he comes to us with a comprehensive and co-ordinate change in the Constitution, such as he himself has now discovered during the process of introducing this Bill is necessary. I appeal to him to do that.</P>

    <P>In page 1, line 29, Section 4, to insert after the word &ldquo;words&rdquo; the following:&mdash;&ldquo;but no such amendment, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, after the expiration of a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall become law, unless the same shall, after it has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the said two Houses of the Oireachtas, have been submitted to a Referendum of the people, and unless <Col N="1552" /> a majority of the voters on the register shall have recorded their votes on such Referendum, and either the votes of a majority of the voters on the register, or two-thirds of the votes recorded, shall have been cast in favour of such amendment&rdquo; and of the word &ldquo;said&rdquo; where that word secondly occurs &ldquo;and of the words.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is introduced for two reasons.  First of all to draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that, while ostensibly the provisions for the Referendum are being deleted from the Constitution by the abolition of Article 47, the Referendum will remain in the Constitution, and its use will be obligatory for a certain purpose.  After the period laid down in Article 50 of eight years within which the Constitution may be amended by ordinary legislation, it will be necessary, if the Article stands amended only as proposed by Section 5 of the Bill, if amendments to the Constitution have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas to submit these amendments by Referendum to the people.  In the debate upon the Constitution Bill 13, which took place this morning, the Minister for Local Government was definitely asked from these benches whether he would submit the question of the present constitutional amendments to the people by Referendum.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, yesterday, was asked the same question, and in both cases I think they did not give an express refusal.  But we can take it, so far as their attitude is indicated in this House, and by the means in which they are forcing this legislation through this House, the one thing they do not want to do in regard to the present Bills is to submit them by Referendum to the people.  Yet at the same time it is their avowed intention&mdash;the President practically said it a few moments ago&mdash;that so far as future constitutional amendments are concerned&mdash;and I speak now in regard to amendments after the period of eight years prescribed by Article 50 has elapsed&mdash;that so far as these particular amendments are concerned, first of all their way is going to be made as difficult as possible, and unless the President can make up his own mind as to which is going to be <Col N="1553" /> most advantageous to him from his own party point of view either to maintain that Article as it stands or to secure some other machinery which will make it more difficult and introduce greater obstacles in the way of those proposing to amend the Constitution, that all further constitutional amendments will have to be submitted to the people by Referendum.</P>
    <P>Now, if there is any virtue at all in the Referendum in respect of amendments which are taken after the year 1930, surely that virtue remains in the Referendum to-day.  It is either going to be effective to-day, and would be useful to-day, and ought to be used to-day, or else it is going to be ineffective and useless after 1930 and should not be used after 1930.  There is the dilemma the Government have to solve. How can they reconcile their present attitude with respect to the series of Bills they have now introduced with their future attitude as adumbrated by Article 50 of the Constitution?  I ask the Minister for Local Government, who has taken some part in defending these measures.  I ask the Minister for Defence.  I ask the Minister for Justice how can they now justify the retention of the Referendum in respect to Constitutional amendments which may be proposed after the year 1930 with the attitude they have taken up with regard to that instrument to-day.  It is either useful to-day and advantageous to the people and to the State that the people should get an opportunity of using it in respect of these Constitutional amendments, or it is useless and disadvantageous and should be cast aside altogether.  They have to reconcile these two propositions.  They stand on one leg with regard to amendments after 1930, and on another leg with regard to amendments proposed in 1928.  What greater virtue will the people of this State have in 1930 that, according to the Minister for Defence, they do not possess to-day?  What great virtue will this Constitution instrument have in 1930 that it does not possess in 1928?  That is the first question we should like to have an answer for.  The other thing is this&mdash;if the Referendum cannot be used in respect of Constitutional amendments which <Col N="1554" /> are being proposed by the Executive Council, why should it be in force in regard to the Constitutional amendments which will be made by their successors?  I do not think that the present Executive Council are going to remain perpetually in office in this State.  Every General Election that has elapsed since 1923 has shaken their position, has made their tenure less secure than its predecessor, and accordingly this Government which, at the present moment has only a bare majority in this House, this Government which depends for that majority, not on the people, not upon the representatives who are directly elected by the people, if I may say so, but upon those who are elected by a privileged franchise&mdash;the Government gets a majority in this House, a large part of it, at any rate, from representatives who are elected by the two Universities.</P>
    <P>Yet a Government situated in that position whose tenure of office in an ordinary normal state would be very insecure, claims this astonishing privilege for itself, that the legislation which it introduces will be absolved from the operation of the Referendum, that there must be some presiding genius at its birth which makes it unnecessary to consult the people with regard to the wisdom of it.  That is avowedly the claim which the President puts forth on behalf of the Executive in that motion which he has introduced, to declare that the Bill which we are now considering is essential for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety.  Necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety!  A strange mentality, a queer mentality, indicated in the resolution which is being put down in respect of this particular Bill. No person, I think, is aware, at any rate the ordinary common citizen of this country is not aware of any danger threatening the public peace, health or safety of the citizens of this State.  But the Executive Council seem to be able to foresee things or to see things which are not clear to the ordinary common citizens. They must have greater judgment, greater sagacity, greater wisdom, and I suppose it is in virtue of that greater wisdom, that greater sagacity which <Col N="1555" /> they believe themselves to be possessed of, or that at any rate they claim, that they have taken up the attitude that the present constitutional amendments which they have introduced must, on no account, be submitted to the people.</P>
    <P>If that is their attitude, what right have they to introduce a Bill to delete Articles 47 and 48?  What right have they to preserve Article 50 virtually in its entirety in its present form?  But we do not want to deny to any Executive Council of this House the right to amend the Constitution.  We have already indicated that we would like the Oireachtas to have power to amend that Constitution without any reservation whatever, without any reference to the Treaty, to amend it in any way in which it would seem best in the interests of the people to do it.  We do not suggest either that the power of the Oireachtas to amend this Constitution instrument should be fettered or circumscribed in any way whatsoever, and therefore we put down the amendment which the Ceann Comhairle has ruled out of order, to delete from Article 50 of the Constitution the words &ldquo;within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty.&rdquo; But apart altogether from that, even on this particular Bill we would not be entitled to introduce such an amendment. We have introduced an amendment here which, in effect, states this, that if the present Oireachtas has power within six years after the enactment of the Constitution by ordinary legislation to amend the Constitution, then that every succeeding Oireachtas should have the same power.</P>
    <P>Or to put it in another way: If it is not essential, if it is not desirable, if it would not be for the good of the community as a whole, that the present Constitution Bills be submitted to the people by referendum, then that no future constitutional amendments should be submitted to the people either.  That is the position that we state in this amendment, and I submit that since the Executive Council will not be able to reconcile the contradictions now indicated in their attitude towards these and the future Constitution amendments, the proper thing for them to do would be to withdraw the Bills altogether, <Col N="1556" /> allow Articles 47, 48 and 50 to remain in the Constitution as at present, and to leave the Constitution to operate as was originally intended between the State and the citizens when it was originally enacted.</P>

      <P>It is now pretty clear that the President is not willing to consider or to enter into any agreement on the question of this amendment, and perhaps on the whole it is just as well, because if some agreement were arrived at between the two sides of this House on the matter of the amendment of the Constitution, then we would feel bound by it afterwards.  We would undoubtedly be bound by it afterwards. But, no matter what amendment they would bring in, in the teeth of the general contempt of the people for the present methods of government, in the teeth of opposition from those on this side, whatever amendments they would bring in are of such a nature that they are in the nature of ordinary legislation. There is nothing can give that stamp and seal of national consent which is essential to the Constitution in any country.  If there is anything to be said for the Constitution in any country it is that it is a set of rules by which every Party acts and works.  It is an agreed set of rules or nothing. This Constitution is brought in as a schedule to the Constitution Act.  That Constitution Act can be changed any time, and it is not merely a matter of abstract theory.  We can also, when the time comes, get good precedents or bad precedents anyhow, or any number of precedents can be quoted for changing the Constitution in any direction that the next Government may wish to change it, and nothing that is done here now is going to tie the hands of those who come after us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst element in the deletion of Article 48 of the Constitution is that it is actually about to be put into operation when it is sought to remove it. Now, if it were removed after it had been tried and found impossible of operation, there might be some reason for it.  If it were removed, even at the time when, as it were, it was being carefully considered in cold blood, and when it was not actually brought into operation, that would be another matter. <Col N="1557" /> But it is absolutely vicious to remove it now, to change the rules of the game, or, rather, one particular rule of the game, when that rule is being relied on by one Party.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before, it was an unconstitutional act even to have delayed the operation of Article 48 in connection with the petition signed by 96,000 electors.</P>

      <P>I did not think I would have that opportunity, and that was the reason I mentioned those matters now.  We have been extraordinarily generous to the Government in this matter.  We have gone much further than we ever went before in proposing this motion.  It simply shows our bona fides in trying, to use the famous word of the President, to implement the Referendum principle which is in the Bill.  If you do not accept that amendment you will have either to delete reference to the Referendum in Articles 14 and 50, if you want to have a consistent Constitution, and not stultify yourselves further, or, on the other hand, you will have to change the Title of the Bill.  The Title of the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to amend the Constitution by deleting Articles 47 and 48 thereof and making the necessary consequential amendments in other Articles.&rdquo;  If you do not accept this amendment, obviously you are rejecting the principle of the Referendum, and if you reject the principle of the Referendum you will then have to make the consequential amendments necessary, and if you are not going to make the consequential amendments necessary, then you will have to delete those words from the Title of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> It is interesting to find that the Government, which, up to a point, we thought, wanted to use the Referendum as a method of delay in changes of the Constitution, have now even run away from the will of the people in that matter, and do not want to use the Referendum at all.  I suppose it is a case that once they get on, to use another famous phrase, the slippery slope&mdash;running away from the people&mdash; according as they go down it their speed increases.  I would have imagined that the President would have been very glad to consider at least a mixture of our suggestion and amendment, and possibly have some further proviso of his own.  I had hoped that he might extend the time for amending the Constitution and at the same time accept the principle of the Referendum.  I suppose that as he has put on the top-boots of Oliver Cromwell he cannot stop now, and they are carrying him away.</P>

      <P>As Deputies on the far side have said, the Government do not propose to accept this amendment moved by Deputy MacEntee.  The effect of the amendment would be to leave Article 50 of the Constitution as follows: &ldquo;Amendments to this Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty may be made by the Oireachtas.  Any such amendments may be made within a period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation.&rdquo;  The result of the acceptance of the amendment would be to leave Article 50 of the Constitution reading like that; that is, that the Oireachtas could change the Constitution, and that within eight years they could change it by ordinary legislation. We are left to imagine or devise by some other legislation later on how the Constitution is to be amended by the Oireachtas afterwards.  As I say, the Article would be left like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Government to accept this particular amendment. It has been stated very clearly by the President that the matter of the extension of this period of eight years, or any further provisions arising out of that, or the general making of provisions as to how the Constitution should be amended in future years, is a <Col N="1559" /> matter that already has been given very careful consideration by the Executive Council.  We are not at the present moment in a position either to make proposals or to deal with this particular matter at all.  The actual position is that we are well inside the eight years, and that within that period of eight years there is power in the Constitution to amend the Constitution by legislation.  Beyond the fact that <Col N="1560" /> we are prepared to make such changes in the Constitution as the Oireachtas considers desirable within the eight years, and that we do propose to extend that period to such further period as will seem proper to us to recommend, we are not prepared at the moment to give consent to the amendment proposed by Deputy MacEntee, and it is not, therefore, acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main arguments which the Government have put forward for the adoption of this Bill is that there is no necessity for this provision in the Constitution in this democratic country; they have pointed out to us here over and over again that the people by electing the majority opposite have expressed their will.  They have pointed out again and again that anything that that majority does is the will of the people and that the people are sovereign in this country.  It just struck me, when listening yesterday to a speech by the Minister for Agriculture, when he was talking of this very democratic and very sovereign arrangement which the Irish people enjoyed, that I could draw a picture of a democratic and sovereign community which would fit just as well as and which would be more apparently ludicrous than his.  For instance, I remember an internment camp where men had the right directly to vote in their own leaders.  Those leaders had power when they came together to elect an executive and that executive had full power within that camp over local government, always subject to a certain overriding authority.  They had full power over local government, in fact more power than the people in this country have, because the men themselves conducted local government by direct vote.  They had full power over internal defence just like this country.  That is, we had a defence force there to punish those who were recalcitrant amongst us, but it was not in a position to deal with external people.  They had full power over justice; they could punish a man for doing wrong, and so on.  It could be held equally and just as democratically that the men in that internment camp were a sovereign people, just as the people of this country are a sovereign people, because they elected an executive in that camp to govern the camp, always subject to a certain overriding authority from outside.  The very same position is here.  Of course, by a large majority in that internment camp, they elected an executive which carried out their wishes, but that executive always came to decisions which did not in any way get up against the authority outside&mdash;up to a certain stage at any rate.  If <Col N="1562" /> I were to have said to those men at that time: &ldquo;You are a sovereign people; you have this place here run on democratic lines,&rdquo; they would tell me I was not telling the truth because they could see through it.  We admitted the fact that we were not sovereign in that camp. We had the decency to admit it; we had the decency to admit that we had internal control to a certain extent, always subject to an outside overriding authority, and the same may be said of our very democratic and sovereign system of rule in this country.  This country has become so very democratic in the eyes of the Minister and so very sovereign that we are asked to take certain powers from the people, the powers of the Initiative and Referendum, and we are told that adult suffrage at a general election is quite a sufficient guarantee for the people that they will get their wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a few people&mdash;I daresay there are several&mdash;who voted for me at the last election and who did not agree with me in certain votes that I gave here and which were unforeseen at the time of the general election.  Take, for instance, the Vaccination Bill.  There are one or two doctors in County Wexford who voted for me, and they may not agree with my vote on the Vaccination Bill.  Suppose it was a very important Bill and it had gone through this House, would it be democratic and fair to those people who voted for me, possibly because I had given certain promises that I would try to improve the Constitution instead of wiping out whatever good was in it, that they should be tied by my decision?  There are people, I am certain, who voted for the Government on certain issues and who are not satisfied with every single thing the Government does.  It would be very hard to imagine no such person. If we take the legislation we had here for the last three or four days, leaving out these Constitution Amendment Bills.  I think we are all agreed that the people would not be unanimous about supporting them.  For instance, a person might vote for the Minister for Agriculture because he had a certain programme in regard to buying out creameries.  It does not follow, necessarily, that the same person would <Col N="1563" /> be in favour of the Forestry Bill.  A person might vote for the Minister for Justice, for some reason which does not occur to me at present, and it does not necessarily follow that that person would naturally be in favour of the Courts of Justice Bill which I see down here.  If one of those Bills were a really important and vital one, would it not be democratic that the people should get an opportunity of deciding themselves whether their representatives in Parliament had done right or wrong?</P>
    <P>I listened as attentively as I could to the arguments that were put up in favour of this No. 10 Bill.  Another argument that was produced was that the provision in the Constitution is unworkable.  One of the Ministers said that not only is it not democratic, but that it really is undemocratic.  But a majority might be returned at a general election with a certain programme, and the very first Bill they might bring in might be thrown back to the people, and the people might decide against that majority within a few months of their being elected.  If such a thing should occur I think that it is only right that the people, at any rate, should have that power.  If they have not got that power, I think we should be honest enough to admit that once elected the majority are in supreme control, and that they have nothing whatsoever to answer for to the people until they go before them at the next general election.  As far as I have studied systems in other countries, I have learned that one of the results of this system of the Referendum is to do away with Party Government altogether, especially when we have the Initiative as well.</P>
    <P>The people begin to realise that it does not matter very much to them about supporting a Party.  An individual begins to realise that he could not possibly get a Party that would represent him on every single issue. You have members in every Party who differ on certain issues.  The result is that Party Government, where the Referendum and Initiative are in force, gradually disappears, and what happens is that people begin to select the best type of person, the most intelligent and straightest type, to represent <Col N="1564" /> them, because they say: &ldquo;This man will have to do what we tell him, and if he does not, we can reverse his decision. Therefore, why should we follow any Party programme?  Let us put in the most intelligent man, and we can reverse any decision that we do not like.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am afraid I will have to take the Deputy seriously.  The reason why they put in intelligent people is that these simple people in other countries realise that it is possible to have Deputies in Parliament who would do more intelligent things than they would ever think of doing&mdash; Deputies who would give them a lead, act more straightly and more intelligently than the people.  There is, as I have said, no necessity to get a Party. At first sight it hardly appears reasonable to think that there could possibly be a Bill which it was not possible to get some group in Parliament to introduce; yet such a situation is possible.  There might be a Bill which the people want, but which a group of Deputies could not be got to introduce, for instance, a Bill to reduce salaries.  If people wanted the salaries of Ministers and Deputies reduced, they might not possibly find a group in Parliament to initiate such a Bill; the people themselves would have to initiate it, and, if it were not passed by Parliament, would have to put it to a Referendum.  Again, there might be a big volume of opinion in favour of having the liquor taxes reduced, yet those in favour of it might not get any responsible section, or any people whom they think would be a credit to them, to introduce such a Bill in this or any other House, and so they might have to introduce a Bill themselves. There are other Bills which you could think of if you wanted to go into that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the Initiative is <Col N="1565" /> necessary as the corollary of the Referendum if you want to make the system of government democratic and the people sovereign in their own country. The point has been stressed&mdash;I do not want to go into it now except that it is an additional argument&mdash;that if certain Articles were to be changed at present under the present Constitution of this House, and if a Bill were brought in to change them, it would have very little chance of getting through.  The classical example is Article 17.  I do not think there is any doubt from the action of the Government that they believe, just as we do, that if that question were put to the people by way of the Initiative, they would vote to have that Article removed.  If the Government did not believe that, they would not have brought in this Bill at all.  I think, if we really believe in democracy and in the sovereignty of the Irish people, we ought to reject this Bill dealing with the Initiative, and we ought to see that the people are not denied the rights which they have under these Articles.  If any of us vote for the Fourth Reading of this Bill, we should, at any rate, not base our arguments on the ground of democracy and sovereignty, but we should admit straight out to the people that if we are voting for this Bill we are voting to take powers from them which they have at present, and we are voting to take such powers on ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on these benches, approach this question from a somewhat different angle to that of the Fianna Fáil Party, but our opposition to this measure is none the less as strong as theirs.  We accepted the Constitution. We recognised that it had certain flaws, that it did not give us everything we desired, but we were prepared to accept it, to work it, and to trust to time and the evolution of circumstances to change it for the better.  We were rather proud of some of the clauses in that Constitution.  We felt that there was something to point to as an advance along the lines of democracy, and among these clauses were the two with which we are dealing now.  I listened carefully to the debates on this measure and I am perfectly satisfied that no genuine arguments were <Col N="1566" /> put up from the Government benches to justify the removal of these clauses from the Constitution.  When Ministers were confronted with quotations from their own speeches during the sitting of the Provisional Parliament, in favour of these measures, when they were reminded of the manner in which they pointed to this particular measure, in a special way, as showing that all power was to be in the hands of the people and, further, when they were asked why it was that they had since changed their minds, they, at least the President and the Minister for Defence, said, &ldquo;Oh, we were then inexperienced. We had no experience.  We did these things as a result of our inexperience.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These were the excuses put forward. Might I ask the President and the Minister for Defence what experience they have gained since in the matter of the Referendum and Initiative?  They told us that they were unworkable.  They have never been put into operation. How do they form the conclusion that these Articles are unworkable?  Where have they learned their experience? Ministers have definitely given the impression in this House, and outside that other countries have found that these, as they are called, frills and fringes of the Constitution, are undesirable and that other countries are anxious to get rid of them and are, in fact, taking steps to do so.  The Minister for Justice gave some cases in regard to what he calls the unworkability of the Referendum in Germany.  All he proved was that the Referendum was tried in regard to a particular question and the question was not carried.  They did not get a majority in favour of it.</P>

      <P>It appeared that they did not get the necessary majority. Surely that is not failure.  If a Bill is referred to the people and the people do not vote, does the Minister or the President hold that that is a failure of the Referendum?  That seems to be the argument of the Minister for Justice. The impression was given that this method was found to be unworkable, that other Governments and Parliaments <Col N="1567" /> are anxious to get rid of it, but I am going to show that is a wrong impression.</P>

      <P>I will.  The President knows an institution called the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  There is a branch of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the Free State.  Members of this House and of the Seanad are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and the Parliaments of quite a large number of countries&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;are members of that Union.  A conference is to be held in Berlin in the near future, next August. I have before me the Inter-Parliamentary Bulletin for March and April of this year.  I have there the draft resolutions which are to be submitted to the conference by the Permanent Committee for Political and Organisation Questions.  In that Bulletin reference is made to the number of failures in what is called the growing crisis in representative government in Europe, the apparent failure of representative government as it has been known up to the present, as to the desirability of preserving representative government, and as to the schemes that ought to be adopted to preserve it.  Certain recommendations are put forward in this draft resolution.  This is page 53 of the Inter-Parliamentary Bulletin for March and April, 1928.  It states:&mdash;&ldquo;In this connection the Conference called the special attention of the groups to the following points.&rdquo;  There are points 1, 2, 3 and 4.  This is point 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The necessity of winning the cooperation of a conscious and enlightened public opinion for the work of Parliament, for instance (as examples), by creating a medium of information guaranteeing an impartial documentation and public discussion; by the official recognition of the Parliamentary Opposition through the remuneration of its leader (Canadian system).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the point I want to draw the Minister's attention to:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;By the institution of the legislative Referendum and of the popular Initiative (Swiss and German systems); <Col N="1568" /> by the institution `of public hearings' before Parliamentary Committees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of the Parliaments of Europe and the world getting away from the Initiative and the Referendum, here we have them recommended by a Conference of the Parliamentary Union in the draft resolutions, and members are asked to recommend them to their Parliaments. Representatives of the Free State will attend that Conference in Berlin and when this motion comes forward they will have to get up and tell what the Free State Parliament has done as a result of this measure before us to-day.  I am sure the Free State Parliament will not cut a very great shine before the democratic peoples of Europe at this Conference when they have to tell them that the Referendum we had introduced in our Constitution has now been deleted from the Constitution, without ever getting a trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I might like to suggest that Deputy Tierney should be subjected to that punishment occasionally. The very thing, as I say, that this Inter-Parliamentary Union in the course of its discussions is trying to prevent is the thing that is growing in this country as a result of the action of the Executive taking complete power into their hands.  We hear from the Minister for Agriculture that there was no necessity for referring Bills to the people, because we had in this country proportional representation, we had adult suffrage, and we had an election every five years.  What guarantee have we that we are going to continue to have these things?  I put it to the Minister for Defence yesterday to point out anything that could prevent the Executive introducing a Bill inside a year or two saying that the life of this Parliament shall be extended to seven <Col N="1569" /> or eight or even ten years.  There is no check whatever&mdash;nothing to prevent that.  The same thing applies to proportional representation.  Certainly before the last election the Ministry had some ideas that proportional representation was not a thing that suited their particular book and that it was one of the things that might be changed to their particular advantage.  The same thing might apply to adult suffrage. If it would suit the Party in power at the moment to say that the vote should not be given until a person was 40 years of age, where is the check to prevent them doing that if this is removed? When I spoke of an unscrupulous Executive yesterday the President appeared to be rather annoyed about it.  Let us suppose that this Executive is not unscrupulous, but that it may be succeeded by an unscrupulous Executive. We cannot look into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care whether he agrees with it or not; I make my statement irrespective of who agrees with it.  We cannot look into the future, and we do not know what will happen when the safeguards have been taken away from the people. I do not often appear in the role of a prophet, but I venture to say that a day may come when the President and his Party may be very sorry that they have taken that power away, when that power is not available to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just possible that that may come about.  The President scoffs at the idea that any attempt might be made to take away adult suffrage, to lengthen the life of Parliament, or to take away proportional representation. I am not so sure about it.  I have a certain admiration for the work the Government have done in certain directions for the last two or three years, but whenever they touched constitutional questions they seemed to be always wrong.  They seemed to be always inclined to recede from the position which was taken up in 1922, and always to go back rather than forward, as we expected from them.  As I say, I am not so sure, judging from their actions and the whole history of <Col N="1570" /> the amendment of the Constitution, that they would not be prepared to do away with proportional representation if it suited them, or to lengthen the life of the present Parliament.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the history of this thing.  For four or five years the Article was there and there was nothing about it.  It was not deemed to be unworkable&mdash;it was not even considered. Then a very unfortunate and lamentable incident occurred in our history, and this Bill was heard of for the first time.  The Minister for Agriculture stated definitely that this measure was introduced last August as one of a series of Bills to ensure the public safety.  Let us admit there was a semblance of justification for the action of the Government on that occasion.  Is the President of opinion that no change has come about in this country since last August, that nothing has occurred since in the political life of the country?  We have had a general election in the meantime.  People who were then said to be anxious to destroy the Constitution, and who were keeping out of this Parliament and not recognising it, have come into the Parliament and have been working under the Constitution.  The people have elected them to come here, whether the President agrees with it or whether I agree with it.  They have come in here, and no matter what argument may be put forward by the President and his Party with regard to these measures, it will be impossible for them to get away from this: that the main object, in fact the sole object, of their introduction of this measure and of their forcing it through the House has been to dish in some way their political opponents.  That is the sole purpose of it&mdash;because their political opponents were using these Articles in a way with which the President and his Party did not agree.  That surely is not a sufficient reason to take out of a democratic Constitution Articles of which any democratic country might be proud.  That is the only reason that is given&mdash;because one particular Party were using that in a way of which the Government did not approve.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of Article 17, for which this was to be <Col N="1571" /> used, we on these benches accepted the Oath.  We were not in love with it, but we do not say that it is the one and only question that is of supreme interest to this country.  I have no hesitation in saying that if the majority of the people do not want the Oath, they have a right to take it out.  If they do not want the Treaty, they have a right to renounce it.</P>

      <P>We have had again on this Bill the sort of vague attempts at objection in the name of democracy that we had on this whole series of Bills.  Again I want to protest against this wild misuse of the name of democracy that is being made both by the Opposition Party and the Labour Party in this case.  There are various kinds of democracy and there are some kinds of democracy which are mutually incompatible.  One reason I am in favour of the Bill is because I believe that direct democracy of the kind contemplated in the Initiative and Referendum is incompatible with, and ultimately destructive of, Party or Parliamentary Government.  Deputy Ryan said a thing which is very pertinent except that he did not seem to realise its bearing on the question at issue, that all over the world the system of the Initiative and the Referendum was destructive of Party Government.  I wonder whether Deputies seriously mean to maintain that we should contemplate in this country at present, and under present circumstances, the deliberate destruction of the system of Party Government which we have.  If we do and if we are to be coherent we should define the system of direct democracy that is to be substituted for the Parliamentary Government which we propose to do away <Col N="1573" /> with.  After having pointed out that experience proved that this system of the Initiative and Referendum was destructive of Party Government, Deputy Ryan went on to say that under a system of what he was pleased to call direct democracy the people could send representatives to a Parliament in the consciousness that they could always undo by direct action what their representatives had done.  He said they could by this system choose both honest and intelligent people to sit in Parliament.  It seems to me that if you have that sort of system you will not want any honesty or intelligence. What you want is a Parliament of &ldquo;Robots&rdquo; which has not the quality either of intelligence or honesty.</P>

He would prefer to have the country ruled&mdash;he is so far from believing in the sovereignty of the people&mdash;by some dictate laid down by some doctrinaire in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the members of which we know nothing about and with whom we have not anything to do.  When I suggested that his attitude was that if we do not accept this ukase from the Inter-Parliamentary Union we should be slapped and put into a corner, I meant really a serious comment upon his whole position.

      <P>The only people who talked about immediate and terrible war in this country for the last five years were the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not believe if you had a general election to-morrow on this issue that you would get a mandate for keeping the Initiative and the Referendum alive, and, furthermore, I believe if you went the length of having a Referendum on this question you would not get 25 per cent. of the voters to vote one way or another. That is my main reason for being opposed to the whole proposal of the Initiative and Referendum together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been led in my attitude upon this matter by any consideration of this action of Fianna Fáil in coming into the Dáil or by any part of the Fianna Fáil policy.  I have always <Col N="1576" /> thought it completely illogical that we should try to combine in our Parliamentary system two completely incompatible things.  If we want to talk about democracy and if we want to suggest that every kind of fantastic faddist theory must be taken into our democratic system, I suggest we should go further, take up a system of election by lot and insist that this system should govern the appointment of all public officers and the selection of the two Houses of the Oireachtas. That is just as democratic and more so than either the Initiative or Referendum or representative government. The lot was the one thing which was the fundamental part of the definition of democracy in ancient times, when democracy was founded.  If we want to talk about pure democracy let us go the whole hog and have pure democracy. You must make your choice in this matter.  If you have the lot you cannot have the electoral system alongside of it.  If you want people chosen by taking a bean out of a box you cannot have people chosen by putting a ballot paper into a box.  If you want the Initiative and the Referendum you cannot expect to have representative government side by side with it which will be responsible for its actions and capable of controlling its own action, because that is exactly the thing the Initiative and the Referendum do&mdash; they deprive any Government of control of its own action.  They force the Government, perhaps against its own will, to take some action the consequence of which it fears and disapproves of.  If you get a system like that your best plan is not to try to mix up these two incompatible things, but to throw over Parliamentary Government altogether, govern by direct democracy and have the people vote on everything.  If Fianna Fáil stand for that, well and good.  Let us have a debate, let them explain their system of direct democracy and give us an idea of how they would work it.  But do not let us have the Government and the Government Party accused of being undemocratic because they prefer one form of democracy to another and because they prefer a form that has been tried for five or six hundred years in all the civilised countries <Col N="1577" /> to a form of democracy which has not been put into operation successfully in any country since the Christian era.</P>
    <P>I said I was not influenced in my vote on this question by any action of Deputy de Valera or his Party.  I go further and say that the action of Deputy de Valera in trying to use Article 48 in order to confuse the people is a sound and sufficient reason for deleting Article 48.  I asked Deputy O'Connell if he approved of that action.  Deputy O'Connell uttered a few vague and rhetorical sentences about the rights of the people, but he was very careful not to give any answer.  I hold Deputy de Valera has a right and proper way of dealing with the question of the Oath if he wants to.  The people have a perfect right, and no one on this side of the House ever denied that right, to delete that Oath from the Constitution and take the consequences of its deletion, but there is one way, and only one way, for doing that, and that way apparently has not yet penetrated the head of Deputy de Valera.  I am not going to assist its passage.  But there is one perfectly constitutional way, to use a sacrosanct phrase in Deputy de Valera's language, of deleting Article 17 from the Constitution, and the mere fact that Deputy de Valera has tried by a side wind to use Article 48 in order to have Article 17 deleted is sufficient justification, added to the undesirability of Article 48 itself, for the action of the Government in deleting Article 48 at the present time.  I think it is about time that we were finished with all this wild talk.</P>

It is a matter, from the way in which it has been handled by the Government and the way in which their mind has been revealed on it, that makes me feel very clearly that the blood guiltiness which is on the members opposite is being proved more definitely day by day.

      <P>Very good, we will come on to the Stone Age plebiscite at its proper time.  What was the Stone Age plebiscite?  It was that in a matter of this particular kind the people should meet at the Chapel gates and indicate what their will was.  That was the Stone Age plebiscite, which was worthy of the Stone Age or the Age of Lot, which Deputy Tierney has been talking about just now.  Of course I was against that type of Stone Age plebiscite.  Why should I not?  There were men who felt deeply on that question, men who gave up their lives for it afterwards.  Were they going to abide by a plebiscite of that kind?</P>

When they put to death men like Liam Mellowes, men in whose hearts, aye, in <Col N="1579" /> whose little fingers, there was more love for the Irish people than in the whole Front Bench opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is in the Bill is the deletion of two Articles, and I am concerned particularly with one Article.  The two Articles together were held out as giving to the people the very last word as regards their laws and their Constitution.  It was under cover of these Articles primarily that those people were able to go to the people of the country and to say to them, &ldquo;All power is vested in you.&rdquo; Those who are opposing this are opposing the very Constitution.  I was pointing out that they used these particular Articles of the Constitution while they wanted them.  They used <Col N="1583" /> them in order to deceive the people, and now, when the deception has become effective, they want to remove them.  They have driven out of the country a quarter of a million of young people, and they have drugged the rest of the country and put them in a position in which they feel helpless.  Then they taunt them and say: &ldquo;Very well, you have a way open to you.  You can, at a general election, denounce the Treaty.&rdquo;  They have preached from one end of the country to the other the slave doctrine that an outside country, because it threatens force, must be given perpetual rule over this country.</P>

I said that it was suggested that improper use was going to be made of Article 48.  Article 48 provides that if the people want the Initiative they can compel the Oireachtas to set up the machinery by the simple process of signing a petition which should contain <Col N="1584" /> the names of over 75,000 voters, not more than 15,000 being from any one constituency, so that it might be quite clear that it was not a purely local matter.</P>

They are bound, when that petition was signed in accordance with Article 48, to observe it if they have any regard whatever for the Constitution.

      <P>That petition was brought here, and it was open to the Dáil to set up an examining commission to find whether that petition was not in strict accordance with the Article.  Instead of fulfilling their obligations the Executive immediately set about gaining time in order to remove this particular Article.  As I have said, the removal of it does not get them out of their obligations if they have any sense of what obligations are.  I know they have not, and, therefore, unfortunately this is an argument that cannot be addressed to them at all. They say that there was an attempt by means of the ill-use or the wrong use of Article 48 to get something else done by a side-wind.  Any intelligent person knows that that is not true. They know perfectly well that that petition could have been used only for one thing, and it was intended to be used only for one thing&mdash;namely, to set up the machinery for the Initiative. When that machinery would be set up it was indicated on the part of those who signed the petition that it was intended to take the next step&mdash;namely, to proceed by way of the Initiative for the removal of Article 17.</P>

      <P>When we wanted to get rid of Article 17 it was quite clearly impossible to do anything of the kind.  It had to be brought by the people as a special issue under the Initiative.  It had to be brought forward in that way, and the gentlemen who were so busy in the past deceiving the people had to use all the organs of deception in the past in order to frighten the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the whole policy of the members opposite has been this: you may give up as much of your freedom as you like, you may go as deeply into the trap as you like, but there must be no question at any time of your getting out.  That has been the policy from the beginning to the end, and that policy is practised by people who, at the beginning, got young people to work for them, to fight for them, and to kill their comrades for them, with the cry that it was going to be used as a steppingstone for freedom.  As I say, some of us who have seen the people from the start deceived so effectively&mdash;I can say it for myself&mdash;occasionally began to wonder whether these men really believed the things they were talking about.  Knowing them as I did, I had a certain amount of difficulty even in <Col N="1587" /> coming to think that, but I did think occasionally when these statements were made that perhaps they meant all this thing.  Whatever doubts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whatever wonderings I may have had in the past have been effectively dispelled in the last month or so.  I am not likely ever again to give even one second's consideration to the question that perhaps when they were saying these things they did really mean them, that perhaps they had a big regard for constitutional government and the will of the people.  But not merely am I saved from any such thoughts ever again, but I think any people who will come after us and who may be sizing up the pros and cons of the last five or six years and asking themselves on which side was right, and whether the gentlemen opposite were acting in that sacrificial spirit, with that stern morality we hear of from the other side, will have very little difficulty in convincing themselves by the results of the action of the Executive in the last four or five days that that was not so.  We are told that there are all sorts of democracies, that the most perfect form was the old one, when they went by lot, and so on. There was no talk of democracies from the gentlemen opposite except the big broad words, &ldquo;the will of the people.&rdquo; They are standing for the will of the people, and are afraid apparently to let this question go to the people as to whether the people wish to surrender that particular right or not.  The people have the right, according to this Constitution, to have certain powers of check in one direction and powers of defence in the other.  Both of these are going to be swept away from the people, and the gentlemen who have such regard for the will of the people will not come and consult them as to whether they will give up these powers or not. If there is so much in what Deputy Tierney speaks of, would he not have an opportunity, if that matter were going before the people, to come out on the hustings and tell them it would be much better to trust this assembly?  If he did that there would be something <Col N="1588" /> to be said for it, but he has been most careful not to do anything of that kind.  He wants to say, &ldquo;We speak for the people, and because we want this thing, therefore the people want it.&rdquo; There is no question at all of asking the people a simple question: do they want this Initiative or do they not.  They say this Initiative has broken down all over Europe.  The Deputy would find that more difficult to prove, I think, if he took it out on a campaign where his assertions would not be taken simply as if they were proofs. It has not broken down; the fact that it has been worked out most successfully, and so wisely used in Switzerland, was one of the reasons why it was adopted in other Constitutions. It was its success in that country that made it be adopted in the Constitutions of States in America and elsewhere, in order to have control during the period of office over an Executive that may be unscrupulous.</P>

      <P>I will probably have an opportunity of saying some of the things I would have said on this particular Bill if I had been allowed to continue at a later stage.  The President is bringing on a motion in a couple of days, which is just as much <Col N="1589" /> untruth and falsehood as the other matter to which I was referring.  It will give me just as much reason to talk as this would.  But I ask: Why is it the people are not to be consulted? Why is it necessary to consult the people when there is a chance of making them afraid?  Why is it that when there is a chance of cowing the people they must be consulted, but when there is a question of the people getting back some of the old spirit of marching on, then they must not be consulted?  Why?  The reason is because it would not suit the Executive that there should be a march on. They have now said we are much better off in the British Commonwealth of Nations than we were before.  The British Commonwealth of Nations has changed wonderfully in the last five or six years.  From 1919 to 1921 the British Commonwealth of Nations was something that was so detestable that nobody should have anything to do with it.  It has suddenly changed.  They have taken it to their heart, or they have allowed themselves to be taken to the heart of the British Empire.  It has changed completely.  That which was abominable before has now become <Col N="1590" /> a wonderful institution, full of freedom; there is more freedom under it than under the Republic.  When we hear that, we are always reminded of the old story of the fox without his tail.  The moment his tail was cut off he began to find out that he was much better off with the tail gone.  But the fox is not going to convince people that that is so.  You may be sure, whether you tear these Articles out of the Constitution or not, there are still people who believe that the freedom of this country is worth working for. Thanks be to God there are.  There will be a reaction against the apathy which allows you, with your majority, to get through with this sort of thing, and the gentlemen opposite are doing their best to make provision for that. As I have said already, they are proving themselves very wise in their generation.  What they are going to do is to cause more violent methods to be used by which these things will be remedied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>As pointed out by Fianna Fáil Deputies here to-day, this Bill increases the power of the Seanad; it increases their power to hold up Bills for eighteen months.  It makes it possible for them to keep a Bill that was passed by this Dáil from coming into operation for almost two years. What have we got to expect from the Seanad as at present constituted?  Do members of the Dáil seriously believe that members of the Seanad&mdash;thirty of whom were nominated by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and, when this series of Bills goes through and the next election takes place, another set will have been elected by the Cumann na nGaedheal and Seanad combined, and only a few by Fianna Fáil&mdash;will do otherwise than continue to carry out the purposes for which the Seanad were set up, namely, to be British watchdogs in this country?  The Minister for Local Government stated that he wondered why we were putting in any amendment to this Bill, why we had the audacity to assume that a crux might arise between the Dáil and Seanad.  The very purpose of this Bill is to provide for a crux between the Dáil and Seanad.  If there was no possibility of a crux arising between the Dáil and Seanad there would be no necessity for this Bill, no necessity for the other clauses in the Constitution dealing with the procedure when a dispute arises between the Dáil and Seanad over any legislation.  If a Government formed by Fianna Fáil were in office there might be a crux between the Dáil and Seanad over Bills dealing with a thousand and one things; Bills for instance, dealing with Constitutional changes, dealing with the reorganisation of the Army on a basis that the country could afford, dealing with the reorganisation of the police on a basis which the country could afford, dealing with the reorganisation of the Civil Service on a basis that the country could afford, dealing with the reorganisation of the Oireachtas, the Dáil and Seanad, on a basis the country could afford, dealing with the reorganisation of the Judiciary and Law Courts on a basis the country could afford, dealing with the keeping of land annuities in this country to be spent for the benefit of the people in <Col N="1593" /> the Twenty-Six Counties, just as land annuities are being retained in the Six Counties and spent for the benefit of the people there, dealing with local government, with agricultural and industrial development, with international relations, and with currency.</P>
      <P>If a Fianna Fáil Government were in office Bills dealing with all these matters would be introduced as soon as possible.  Fianna Fáil might also attempt to carry into effect the reports of the different commissions that have reported in vain to the Cumann na nGaedheal Executive for the last five or six years.  Fianna Fáil might put into effect the Report of the Evil Literature Commission, the Report of the Commission set up to deal with insurance, the Report of the Commission relating to Greater Dublin, the Report of the Commission set up to deal with and report as to what steps should be taken to develop the Gaeltacht so that people could live there and save the language, and they might also put into effect the Report of the Commission on Technical Education.  When Fianna Fáil gets into office and endeavours to carry through its policy there will undoubtedly be a crux between the Dáil and Seanad because we have a fundamentally different outlook on all these questions from the present Executive Council and the Seanad, which has been set up with the connivance and help of the present Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wish to abolish the Seanad, and surely when we attempt to abolish it, the Seanad will object.  That was one of the great arguments why this Bill should go through, that we had given no indication as to why we should worry about a dispute between the Dáil and Seanad. There will, of course, be a dispute, a crux, between the Dáil and Seanad whenever the Dáil tries to do what the Irish people want, and when it will not do what the Seanad and the British nominees in this country want. We want to have the constitutional changes which the people want to be carried through in a constitutional and orderly manner.  We will have got very, very rapidly into the position, after a few more Constitution Bills will have been passed, that the written Constitution will have no force or effect whatever. <Col N="1594" /> It will be understood by the people as a whole and by Deputies that the only Constitution is what the majority of representatives here want to have passed.  That is exactly the position we want to see here.  We want to see affairs so arranged that the majority of representatives here can deliberate together and can decide on national policy without reference to any written Constitution or any Constitution imposed here by foreign bayonets.</P>
    <P>The Ministers think that they can impose barriers upon future Executives. They are establishing a precedent which will be very useful.  They are now acting as if the written Constitution had no binding force on them, that their will is law, that whenever they want to change the Constitution they can change it.  We hope, when we take over the reins of Government from them, that we will change the Constitution as the people want it to be changed, but we will do it in a more manly and open fashion, and we will not say one thing in private and do another thing in public.  We now know what was in the cry, &ldquo;The will of the people must prevail.&rdquo;  It meant that the will of the people must prevail so long as Cumann na nGaedheal were the people who were to prevail. President Cosgrave said to-day that the Seanad is composed of persons just as anxious to do good for the people as Fianna Fáil.  He told us that we ought not to fear the Seanad, that the Seanad were good boys, and that there was no reason to be afraid of them. There is no reason for President Cosgrave to be afraid of them.  He will always do what the Seanad want him to do. and, of course, they will be good boys to him.</P>
    <P>We have asked Ministers why on earth they are introducing these Bills and putting them through.  We have asked them to disclose what is really behind all this rushing through of these Bills, why it is that they must override Standing Orders and Parliamentary practice in order to get these Bills through.  Surely to goodness if they have good reason to put them through, if there is any real desire amongst the people of the country to get the Constitution amended in this Bill, they <Col N="1595" /> ought to put the Bills through the ordinary Parliamentary procedure.  What is the good of having a Fourth or Fifth Stage?  What is the reason for having two stages if there is to be no lapse of time between stages in which Deputies can make a re-examination of the Bill after it has emerged from the previous stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope it will not arise.  A very important point was made here by Deputy Dr. Tubridy. That is that there are two legislative bodies in the country, the county councils and the Seanad, and that it is interesting for anybody interested in the affairs of this country to compare the treatment of the county councils and the Seanad by the Government&mdash;the county councils whose personnel helped greatly to establish this Dáil and made the English recognise that the Irish people had some rights, and the Seanad, which is composed of men who always helped the British in this country and who want to have English rule here the real rule.  The Government for the last four or five years have been taking power away from the county councils, and they now propose to give further powers to the Seanad.  Up to now the Seanad could, I think, hold up a Bill for nine months, but after this Bill is passed it can hold it up for practically <Col N="1596" /> two years.  It can stop a change of the Constitution for over two years, and it has great power to create further trouble between the Irish people.  If the Irish people really want a Bill passed through, if this Bill at present under discussion passes it will render that impossible, and it cannot be carried into law under eighteen months if the Seanad desires to delay it.</P>
      <P>Take the question of land annuities as one example.  Suppose a Fianna Fáil Executive gets into power, and we decided, instead of paying land annuities to England, which we do not want, to do what the people in the Six Counties do&mdash;keep them here in the general Exchequer and use them to relieve the economic condition of the people&mdash;suppose that such a Bill goes through in the Dáil and that a hard winter is pending, that the month of November is pending, and that we wanted to get that Bill passed through the Seanad, so that the one and a half million pounds that go to England would be kept here and would go into the general Exchequer to be used for the general relief of unemployment; suppose the Seanad, which is filled by people who always stood for England, the vast majority of them, said that this Bill must not go through for another two years, does anybody here seriously consider that the majority in the Dáil or the majority of the people are going to be blocked by such a Seanad?  They will take some steps to ensure that the Seanad will not have power to delay such measures for two years.  They will take some measures, whether they are in the laws or in the Constitution, but we hope that the members of this Dáil will make it impossible for the British watch-dog to hold up for two years Bills that the Irish people want.  We hope that if any members of Cumann na nGaedheal who got the people's support on the plea that they were going to use this Constitution, that they were going to stretch it in order to secure the right of the Irish people to go forward and to spend their own money for their own purposes in their own way, who vote for this giving away of the people's rights into the hands of the British nominees in this country, the people will take a note of them and deal very effectively with them when they come before them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I know it is impossible, but I wish we could discuss this matter as if we came fresh to it.  If we could skip by any magic these last seven or eight years and appeal to the men opposite who fill the Cumann na nGaedheal benches, as we could have appealed eight years ago, to consider this question, we could put it to them in this way: &ldquo;You are here, you stand for the achievement of the rights of the Irish people.  You want this country to be free, a country governed by a single Government, and that all the money that is raised in taxes in this country should be kept here to be spent for the benefit of the Irish people.  Here is a question in which it is being proposed to deliver into the hands of the people who always stood for British interests here in Ireland, who are largely nominated by England, power over the Irish people.&rdquo; The present Seanad, with a few exceptions, is very much the same as the Irish members of the House of Lords. It is as if we could go back eight years and say: &ldquo;Suppose it is proposed to hand over to the Irish members of the House of Lords power to hold up for two years legislation which we the representatives of the Irish people want to put through immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we could forget these eight years, and if the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal were not committed, as they have been committed by their actions in the last eight years, I do not believe that there is a single man of them who would stand for handing over to the present members of the Seanad the power to hold up legislation for two years.  We know that the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party will not approach the matter in that fashion and that they are going to live up to their commitments.  But behind them there are the people who put them into power in the hope that they would live up to their promises of eight years ago; that they would stand over the deletion from the Constitution of the clauses that gave power to England and the substitution of clauses which would give power to the Irish people. We warn the members of the Cumann na nGaedheal that if they pass this Bill it will not be very long until the people will put them on one side, if they get the opportunity.</P>

      <P>Why do not the Fianna Fáil Party be honest and tell the public plain and straight that the farce they are participating in is pure humbug from beginning to end? Deputy Flinn to-day attempted to deal with the very cogent argument put forward on behalf of the Seanad by the Minister for Local Government. He said that the principle of delay appeared to be the panacea for all things; that delay gave time for reflection; <Col N="1599" /> that delay was an invariable cure for anything inconsistent, or anything irregular, or anything that tended to wrong decision in this House, and he asked the question: why should the principle of delay not be applied to solve all our difficulties; why should the principle of delay not be applied to the ordinary legislation of this House?  The answer of the members on the Government Benches is perfectly obvious.  We can answer that question like the boy in school by asking another, and the question that we would ask the members on the Opposite Benches is: What do you mean by delay?  There is reasonable delay and there is unreasonable delay; there is a legitimate time for giving grave consideration to the various proposals which pass through this House and, on the other hand, there is a delay which is brought into the proceedings of this House with one object and one object only, and that is to hold up the whole procedure and the whole business in which we are engaged.</P>

      <P>With your permission, I should like just to develop my reply to Deputy Flinn, because we have all got so weary of Deputy Flinn that we do think something should be said in reply to the repeated nonsense he puts before the House.  I think I can perform some little service to the House if I deal with the arguments he has put before us.  The whole argument of Deputy Flinn was that the delay which will exist under this Bill in connection with the passing of measures in the Upper Chamber should be applied in exactly the same way to the proceedings in this House.  I have pointed out that delay is of two kinds, reasonable and unreasonable.  From the opposite side we have been told plainly, I think we have been told by the leader of the Opposition himself, that certain accommodations necessary for the carrying on of the business of the House under ordinary normal conditions have been withdrawn.  Anybody who takes part in the proceedings of this House knows that if these normal conditions do not prevail it is almost impossible to carry, on the ordinary business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told further still by some of the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party that the Estimates which have been held up by the Constitution Bills would not be passed this year. They have made no excuse or pretence about stating these things in the House. They have said frankly and freely, and I think it is our duty to point it out, that if this policy of obstruction is the method of criticism that is to be applied to these great Constitutional issues by <Col N="1601" /> the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, we have a duty on these benches, as representatives of the people entrusted with the carrying on of government, to give an effective reply to these criticisms in the interests of the State.  That effective reply has been given.  The reply that has been given has had its effect.  The all-night sitting and other things that have occurred here have had effect.  The House is in a much more reasonable frame of mind to discuss things logically and sensibly than it was some time ago.  We have been told from the opposite side a whole lot of things about the rights of the people. Deputy de Valera was so eloquent about the rights of the people that I was almost struck dumb.  But has he or the Party to which he belongs upheld the rights of the people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to say a few words, and shall finish on this matter. I would merely point out to my friends on the Opposition Benches that all these great Constitutional rights and liberties of the people do not pass away with the passing of this Bill through the House.  If the Fianna Fáil Party are anxious to abolish the Second Chamber the passing of this Bill now will not act as the slightest hindrance to them in carrying out that project. If Deputies on the opposite benches want single chamber government the Bill now before this House will not debar them in the slightest respect from carrying this particular design. They have certain rights and privileges left in the Constitution although they say that by this Bill we are tearing the Constitution up.  It is not my right or my duty to tell the Fianna Fáil Party what these rights are.  I merely say in reply to Deputy Flinn that these rights will remain within the Constitution and that the Fianna Fáil, if returned as a majority, can use <Col N="1603" /> these rights when they become a majority.</P>
      <P>Article 50 leaves these rights and liberties to the people, as far as second-chamber government is concerned, absolutely as sovereign as ever they were.  There are constitutional precedents in other countries which Deputy de Valera should know, and in other Dominions, which Deputy de Valera mentioned when referring to us as a unit of the British Commonwealth&mdash; these other Dominions too have single chamber government under circumstances similar to our own.  If Deputy de Valera wants single chamber government there is nothing in this Bill to prevent him from having it.  If the Fianna Fáil Party wanted to abolish the Seanad to-morrow, all these rights and privileges remain untouched by the Bill before this House.  I say it would be better for the Fianna Fáil Party to be honest and fair and reasonable to the people, not to be hoodwinking and blinding people all the time.  People are beginning to get fed up with all this airy nonsense and piffle.  There was a schoolboy here in the gallery to-day, and, turning to his father, he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have too much respect for the Chair to attempt to continue in making a speech in view of such a ruling, but I do, in conclusion, say that I think that the arguments I have used with reference to this Bill have been in reply to Deputy Flinn. When I said we on these Benches listened to a lot of piffle and nonsense, the House will appreciate what it was like when the Ceann Comhairle cannot allow discussion upon it even on this Bill.  I shall vote for this Bill, and I can assure Deputies on the Benches opposite that the lives and liberties of the people will be as safe under this Bill if it is passed as if it had never been introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not occupy very much time.  But I would just like this House to consider is there any need for putting further barriers to progress in this country?  Have we shown since we got the two Parliaments in this country any wild desire to abuse the powers of this Parliament?  Have we shown a tendency to go too fast, or why is there now a demand for impending such progress as has been made?  To most people in the country it would seem that so far from going too fast we are going far too slow.  If they look around them and see those vast reforms that have to be carried out before Ireland is on a level with other countries of the same resources and the same possibilities, I think reflecting people will feel that we will want to go very fast indeed before it will be necessary to check the rate of progress. This Bill is a Bill, as I say, to impede the work and the progress of the people's representatives, and to see that the wild men who are returned&mdash; the 153 wild men who would be returned at each general election&mdash;are not going too fast.  It seems to me that there is very little sign of these wild men being returned at a general election. I think this House is as conservative in ordinary matters as any Parliament in the world.  Never have I heard a revolutionary remark in the place since I came here&mdash;that is, on non-political matters.  The Labour benches are, I think, an example of respectability. Why is there then a demand <Col N="1605" /> that those 153 men who will be returned here should have barriers erected against them, and why is it that we must put checks on these men, so that they will not land the country in dangerous legislation?  I think the answer must be, and the only answer must be, the word &ldquo;compensation.&rdquo; It seems curious that already in the short history of that House&mdash;a House that has not been particularly useful&mdash; vested interests have got so established that they can come now and claim compensation from the people's House, that, in return for giving up a little right they had and never once used, they are to get the big compensation that they can hold up that legislation passed by this House for a period of twenty months.  That is rather an extraordinary thing, and it seems extraordinary that while arguments that the Initiative and Referendum mean great expense to the country, so logical a speaker as Deputy Tierney, for instance, should say: &ldquo;Why not have a general election?&rdquo; That is, if any Party is returned to the House and that Party finds it difficult to get their legislation through the Seanad, if the Seanad shows itself unreasonable, well they can resort to a general election!  That is hardly consistent with the repeated cry from the Government benches that the Initiative and the Referendum mean expense to the country.  Coming from Deputy Tierney that is a remarkable statement. Yet that was his statement this morning on this very question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I think it would be admitted that the Seanad is not a very popular institution in the country, and I wonder has the Government considered if this is the way to make it popular, since they are so anxious to preserve and establish the Seanad.  When it gets out through the country that the Seanad has this power, a power everybody must admit that is the maximum that can be given to such an assembly, will that make it more popular?  When the country realises that a body like that that has been chosen over their heads, a body that has not been at all events directly chosen by them, a body which represents interests that are to a great number of the people positively loathsome, has that power, will that tend to make <Col N="1606" /> the Seanad popular in the country?  Of course that might be putting in a plea for the Seanad that does not come very appropriately from these benches, but it seems to me that this Bill may well prove a boomerang, and I can imagine nothing more calculated to make an audience in the country indignant and really angry than to be told that if you demand a certain thing at the coming General Election, and if you elect representatives to bring about a certain reform, you have no likelihood of getting that reform within a reasonable time.  Another House, with the election of which you had nothing to do, a House that is there in spite of you, is going to see that that reform does not take place for a full twenty months.</P>
    <P>Altogether I think that the Bill is as uncalled for as any Bill could be at the present time, considering the many reforms that cry aloud for attention by this House.  Considering how little real legislation has been carried through during this session of the Dáil, how little useful legislation there has been, it would have been, on the whole, a great deal better if the final weeks of this session had been spent on work that is more in demand and in a way that is more likely to lead to good results than this Bill is. This Bill may very well create a bitter feeling in the country between two sections. It may create a bitter feeling against this Dáil when the effect of it is realised, and to my mind those who talk about the will of the people are showing very bad judgment when they are forcing a Bill like this through at the present time.  Every Government takes into account what the feeling of its Opposition is.  It endeavours to come towards a compromise at least with the main demands of that Opposition. In this case the Government says: &ldquo;Opposition or no Opposition, we will go in whatever direction we like,&rdquo; and instead of coming to yield a little to the demands of the Opposition and to the similar demands that are expressed in the country, they go in an absolutely contrary direction.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that there is very much more that one can say on this subject than to protest against the passage of <Col N="1607" /> the Bill through this House, and to ask the House to realise that in a country like this freedom will broaden sufficiently slowly down in the ordinary way without instituting artificial barriers and making the pace so much slower than it would naturally be.  It would be naturally slow enough in a country composed largely of peasantry. It would be slower here than in any other country.  When we realise that, and when we realise that there is a great demand for reform in the country at the same time, it seems to me that a more unnecessary Bill could not be introduced into this House, and I hope as many as think freely on the subject will vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to say what I have to say within that time. Deputy Redmond is, unfortunately, not present now.  He indicated that he thought that the time which is allowed by this Bill to the Seanad to hold up legislation is too long, and he said that he would consider the old period of nine months quite enough.  If he read the Report of the Committee he would find that that period of nine months was the period that I for one suggested. The amendment which I have down will generally work out to be about the old period.  I have put down four months within which the Seanad will have to take action.  A period will have to elapse within that year that is allowed, and, as far as my amendment is concerned, a year is given to the Dáil within which it can take action.  I presume that any Executive wishing to put through its Bill will naturally seek the simplest course and try, if possible, to meet any objections by the other House. There will be a period for negotiations, and so on, which will use up about two or three months, and then there is a further period of two months, which will give altogether a period of about nine months.  I think that Deputy O'Hanlon was of the same opinion, that the period of nine months would <Col N="1608" /> be sufficient.  I think if we tried to calculate the period that would be allowed by this amendment the House ought to be convinced that that amendment would give, in fact, roughly a period which the Seanad, by the Constitution as it stands, has as the period by which it could delay legislation. We have been told that all this was humbug.  As I have said more than once, when I stand up to speak I have always the feeling in the back of my mind that arguments are useless.  For instance, I expect that the arguments would be useless in the case of Deputy O'Hanlon, though I pointed out quite clearly that the matter that he suggested could be met.  I wonder if it will affect his vote.  I hope it will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that in fact the four months means nine months.  It certainly means six, and if you count the time that the Executive will require in order to carry on negotiations of one kind or another with the Seanad, and also the time necessary for them if they want to prepare public opinion for forcing their measure over the heads of the Seanad, it would in fact work out at about nine months.  The only inducement to anybody to speak in this debate is that you get occasionally a remark by Deputy O'Hanlon or a statement like that of Deputy Redmond. One feels that there is then something of reality in it.  Otherwise it seems to be a question of wasting time and very little more, that you waste time in talking about this, knowing that anything that is said, no matter how reasonable and no matter how strong the arguments for a certain course, is all in vain.  The President &mdash;I do not wish to say what my opinion is in many cases on the arguments he puts forward in cases like this&mdash;spoke generally about how very unlikely it was that there would be a clash between the two Houses, and yet this very thing is designed to meet that clash.  If there was not likely to be a clash, then why was this Bill introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he was not talking about anything of the kind. My attitude was very clear.  It was to meet the possible clash.  The history of all Parliaments in which there are two Houses is to the effect that very violent clashes and very violent differences of opinion do occur.  They have occurred everywhere, and if you have a second House at all you must have some means of resolving them.  This resolves it by making this House finally supreme.  But I hold that the Bill gives the Seanad power to hold up legislation here for a period which would in effect bring the efforts of an Executive which did not work with the Seanad to a nullity, and compel it to resort to a general election.  If there are arguments against the Referendum and against referring the matter to the people on the grounds of expense, surely there are arguments also against an election.</P>

      <P>I feel certain that nobody is impressed by the argument the President used.  Everybody saw it was all nonsense when it was expressed particularly in relation to a Bill of this kind, the very purpose and the soul of which was to make provision against a possible clash.  Our objection is that it gives too much power to the Seanad, inasmuch as it compels the Executive to go to the people again.  That ought not to be.  An Executive that has been newly elected by the people, and that has confidence for its programme, ought not to be so compelled by a nominated House.  It is quite a different matter if some new question arises in connection with which the representatives of the people who were participating in the election know full well that a certain aspect was not presented to the people, and they have the feeling that it should be referred to the people as a single issue by way of Referendum. That would be a fair way.  The Seanad would not dream of trying a Referendum against an Executive like that.  The only case where the Executive might leave the Referendum to the Seanad is where it thinks the Seanad would work in favour of its own policy, the policy that we can come into the trap as much as we like and surrender as much of our rights as possible, and that there must not be any opportunity of trying to recover these rights.</P>

      <P>I was saying last night that Deputy Heffernan tried to dispose of our objection to the Bill by saying it would reduce the market the owner of the trees had for his timber. Our objection to the Bill, as pointed out by Deputy Ryan, was on two grounds.  First of all, the export of the raw timber should be prohibited, seeing that there is going to be less timber available.  It will not mean that there will be competition between the Irish saw-mills and the people who bring out the raw timber, and we have been told by the people interested in the saw-milling industry that the timber sent away to England is specially adaptable for manufacturing into bobbins, reels and things of that nature very essential to the cotton industry.  There is a chance that not alone will the sawmills be kept going, but there would be subsidiary industries started in the country.  We also object to the unlimited power that is given to the Minister.</P>
      <P>There was a question raised by Deputy Carney as to the interpretation of the word &ldquo;tree,&rdquo; and in answer to it we have been told that &ldquo;tree&rdquo; means &ldquo;trees.&rdquo;  That might not be the case at all.  I think it would not do any harm to take a tip from someone here and to put in the words &ldquo;tree or trees.&rdquo;  There would not be very much doubt about it then, but I suppose a suggestion coming from this side of the House would be <i>infra dig</i> and would not be taken up at all.  It might, however, happen that when we have everything going nicely, as in the case of that insurance company, the law will be invoked against people who think they are carrying out the law properly, and they will find that the Act is wrong.  These things are possible.</P>

      <P>This Bill has had a most extraordinary history.  It was introduced in the ordinary way, and was received with a certain amount of acclamation, as you would expect, having regard to the fact that the terms of the Bill were not before the House.  The Second Reading came on in about a week after the introduction of the Bill. There was ample time given for the Second Reading.  There was no question about time.  Everything was supposed to be fair.  Everyone wanted to see this great problem of forestry dealt with, once and for all, in a big, comprehensive way.  For once I was willing to oblige people.  We had the Second Reading debate about ten days after the First Reading.  The Second Reading debate was interesting.  Deputies from all parties contributed, and made various suggestions, which I took quite seriously. I am sorry that I took them seriously now after the treatment it received subsequently.  I took note of practically every point made by every Deputy in every part of the House.  I listened carefully to the objections put up.  I had no prejudices, predilections or prepossessions one way or another.  I looked on the Bill in a somewhat detached way; I listened to the views of everybody, sifted them out, and put them up to the experts.  I happen to have the good fortune of having, by common consent, a very competent staff <Col N="1619" /> in connection with forestry.  I put them up to them to hear what they had to say.  I came to the conclusion, as a judge without any great knowledge of the subject, which is the ideal position for a judge, that if there was anything in these suggestions we could embody them in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, I listened to every point that was made on Second Reading.  I went back and I spent, I very much regret to say, two or three days' hard work on this question.  I came up to Committee a week after the Second Reading with about ten amendments down, and I can say that these amendments were meant to meet points made from all quarters of the House.  In fact they were judiciously distributed over all parts of the House.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies rightly said that the amendments were complicated and long, that they had not time to examine them, and that the Committee Stage should be postponed.  The Ceann Comhairle suggested that perhaps the Bill could be recommitted on Report, and the Bill was adjourned for a week for the Report Stage.  At that time my amendments were on the Order Paper for ten days and when the Bill reached the Report Stage it had been before the House for nearly a month.  Fifteen days had elapsed since the Second Reading, but on Report there was not a single amendment from Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that was one amendment.  I gathered that from the speeches yesterday.  There is good reason why it was not moved and why it was not accepted.  I have not the slightest doubt that it was out of order. There was no other amendment&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent.  On the contrary, Deputy after Deputy on the opposite benches unsaid practically everything they had said on Second Reading. They misrepresented, misinterpreted the Bill and treated it with the grossest contempt.  They said that it was not worth introducing although it was, to a certain extent, their own Bill, because <Col N="1620" /> I had adopted three or four rather radical proposals suggested to me from those quarters.  That, however, had not the slightest effect.  We were treated on Report to two or three hours of obviously obstructive debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There you are.  That is not an answer.  I came to the House with the Bill&mdash;and I make you a present of this&mdash;without any great technical knowledge of forestry, but with a first-class staff behind me.  That is admitted in every country, both here and across the water.  The Forestry staff is a first-class one.  I wanted to get a good Bill.  I would have left every section to a free vote of the House, but we now see what has happended. I pressed no points.  I came with a good Bill to which a considerable amount of thought had been given.  I radically changed the structure and improved the Bill as a result of suggestions made on Second Reading. I got fifteen days between Second Reading and the time in which amendments had got to be in.  When that time came no amendments were <Col N="1621" /> put in.  The discussion lapsed, and Deputies addressed themselves to the Bill as if they never read a line of it and had no interest in it.  Last night you had the same performance.  I suppose, however, I have got to take it seriously.  There are some objections to the Bill.  First of all, it is said that it is bureaucratic.  It is bureaucratic. Deputies opposite regret the fact that there is a tendency to bureaucracy in this country.  I dislike bureaucracy.  I think there is too much of it, but it does not lie in the mouths of Deputies opposite to talk about bureaucracy, because every day the Dáil meets they are asking for more and more bureaucracy.  They think that the function of the Government is to do everything for everybody, to spend the taxpayers' money here, there and everywhere, on all sorts of objects which are financed by private individuals in other countries.  They must realise that all these demands mean more and more bureaucracy.  If they have no respect for the taxpayers' money, for the man who is working, if his money is to be spent here regardless of how much he can afford, they must realise that you cannot take it without a certain expenditure of it.  So there is a constant demand from those Benches opposite for more and more bureaucracy. This Bill is attacked because it is a bureaucratic Bill.  It is; but why is it?  Deputies say that there is not a proper outlook on this question in this country.  They admit, and I have never heard it denied, that there is less tree planting among private individuals in this country than in any other State.  Deputies will admit that the Irish farmer never has the slightest compunction about cutting down a tree, and often does it quite wantonly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could understand the point of view of people who say that if a farmer wants to cut a tree on his own land, let him do it, and do not bother about scenery or any other considerations. That is a point of view I sympathise with.  There is a lot to be said for it, and I do not know that it is not sound. On the other hand, it was the general opinion that we must do something to stop the indiscriminate felling of trees. If the State must do that, you must have more bureaucracy.  You must <Col N="1622" /> have the rather ridiculous position in which a man cannot cut a tree or trees without the consent of somebody authorised by the State to give consent. There was another point of view expressed.  I heard phrases such as a big forestry scheme, a comprehensive and ambitious forestry scheme.  I heard of the hillside that might be bought for a small amount and covered with timber.  I listened to Deputies talking of this country producing magnificent forests such as are in other countries if there was a proper scheme. There is nothing to prevent us doing that except one thing, and that is a certain amount of money.  You have to say the amount of money you are prepared to spend on forestry.  But this Bill does not affect that problem at all. That problem is a simple one.  That problem is one of getting the Dáil to agree to voting £10,000, £100,000, £1,000,000 or £10,000,000 to finance such a scheme.  The more money you give the more land you will be able to buy and the more trees you will be able to plant.  That does not require legislation, and when Deputies were talking as if it did require legislation, they were talking beside the point.  We do not want any legislation for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We do require some modifications in the existing legislation, and in the first section of the Bill you have taken power to acquire land compulsorily for forestry.  That is the only thing limiting the State, apart from money.  Outside that you have the question of trying to protect existing forests.  This Bill is the best way, we suggest, to protect existing forests, and all this other talk about a tree and trees is beside the point.  There is no doubt that under this section we are giving a general licence, but the fact is that I am afraid that Deputy Carney did not see the forest for the trees, as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to remember whether there were any points of substance really put up against the Bill. There was one point in reference to the saw-millers.  That was ruled out of order, and there could be no question that it was out of order.  This is not a Bill to encourage the manufacture of wooden articles.  This is a <Col N="1623" /> Forestry Bill to promote the growth of timber.  It would be entirely out of place in a Forestry Bill.  Undoubtedly it is a fiscal question, pure and simple. I would ask Deputies to remember that also the amendment which they suggest had a very much less ambitious purpose than was suggested in the speeches later on.  The amendment put down, I think, in Deputy Moore's name simply suggested that no timber could be exported unless it was sawn.  That is all it came to, but when I listened to the speeches on the Report Stage last night and on the Second Reading, it would seem that Deputies had some scheme in their heads under which no timber could be exported unless it left the country in the form of furniture, caravans or ships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>What was in my amendment was that it should be semi-manufactured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is sawn admittedly. That is all it comes to.  Anyway that is a fiscal question.  There would be something to fight about if no timber could leave the country except it was manufactured into ships, caravans or furniture, but what the amendment suggested was that no timber could <Col N="1624" /> ever leave the country unless it was sawn.  That is a purely fiscal question. It is a question with which I dealt at great length on Second Reading, and I do not propose to say more on it now. I am glad that this Bill has been unloosed and disentagled from the mass of verbiage thrown over it for the last fortnight here, and I shall now take it to the Seanad, where I hope it will get better treatment.</P>

I hold that it would be helpful in this way&mdash;that if a prohibition of the export of unsawn timber were entered in a Bill like this, it would automatically put a stop to the cutting of timber in this country except for domestic uses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend to vote against the Fifth Stage of this Bill and we desire to make our position clear as to why we are taking this action.  First of all it is part, of course, of the financial measures adopted by the Government for this year.  We believe that these measures have not been suitable measures; that the amount to be raised was in excess of the requirements of the country, and that an opportunity should have been taken of cutting down expenses.  Then we hold that the methods adopted, even assuming that the money was required, were not the most suitable for the country. We think that this is going to be a very awkward impost upon business, and business in the Free State cannot bear any more burdens than it has at this moment.  We think it is going to hamper and impede business, that, taken in addition to the high postage rates which prevail it will be felt by many small concerns.  Furthermore we hold it is not likely to bring in the revenue estimated to come from it.  We hold also that this money if really required could be collected by a method that is being adopted more and more by other countries, that is, by taxing imports of foreign goods.  We think that if that method had been adopted to bring in this amount of £69,000 it would be an encouragement to certain people to engage in industrial enterprise and it might do good.  But we can see nothing but annoyance and trouble coming from this attempt to raise money by an increase in the telegraph rates, and that is the principal reason why we are opposing it.  We think that it represents what the Minister for Agriculture termed laziness yesterday afternoon.  The Minister for Agriculture taunted us with laziness and said that we had not energy to prepare a case for the Referendum.  We hold that the whole financial measures of the Government represent not merely laziness, but indifference and a policy of drift that is very serious for the country in its present condition. <Col N="1627" /> We think that the Government simply went looking for any and every expedient to raise money and that that is all this measure means; that it has no financial philosophy and has nothing to justify it, and we suggest that the Bill should not be passed.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to this was explained at very great length by the Minister for Finance.  It is one of the services which, by reason of the economic situation, is rather more burdensome than it might otherwise be.  The Minister is simply endeavouring to place on a particular service responsibilities <Col N="1628" /> which that service entails of itself.  Even this impost will not, I think, meet the entire demands of that service, but it is a sound policy to endeavour to make each service contribute towards its own upkeep.  As to the other questions raised by the Deputy, they fall more for consideration on the Finance Bill.  I think that the real case for this has been made when the Minister stated that he was endeavouring to make up a particular loss incurred by providing a particular service for a limited number of years.</P>

      <P>This is a purely verbal amendment and I should like to draw the Minister's attention to Standing Order 98, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>During the progress of a Bill, corrections of a verbal or formal nature may at any time be made in a Bill by the Clerk, under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle.  Versional, and all other correction, shall be made by way of motion, and dealt with as any other amendment.</P>
      <P>I suggest that this amendment is quite out of order and that it should have been dealt with purely as a verbal amendment.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the contrast between the treatment of this purely verbal amendment and another change that was made in an Act.  I drew attention, some time ago, to the fact that the Short Title of the Agricultural Credits Bill was: &ldquo;That this shall be entitled the Agricultural Credits Bill&rdquo; and not Act.  I took the trouble to look it up afterwards and I discovered that without the leave of the House and behind the back of the House that was changed; the title was changed to read: &ldquo;That this Bill be entitled the Agricultural Credit Act.&rdquo;  This is a serious matter, because if it is done in small things it might extend further. The actual text is to be the authoritative text and is to be signed by the Governor-General.  I made inquiries to see it at that time and I found that the whole thing was so definite that it became almost impossible to see it and to this day I do not know how one could see it.  There was to have been an arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Amendment declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 3 to delete lines 5 to 9 inclusive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That amendment deals with paragraph (a) Section 5 of the Bill.  The intention is to give effect to the criticism that I levelled at that particular section when the Bill was introduced.  I pointed out on the Second Reading that I did not like to see the Court of Appeal being given the power to set aside what might be regarded as legal technicalities. I believe that close adherence to legal principles is very important from the point of view of justice. I believe that these principles were evolved slowly, and that in general their purpose is to prevent injustice, whilst now and again, of course, they may work in the wrong direction, and that the general effect of them is to prevent abuse of various kinds.</P>
      <P>Everyone of us knows how legal formalities irritate the layman, and they do that because you imagine you can do all these things more easily by short cuts.  The more one examines questions of that kind, the more one is convinced that to attempt to follow short cuts, the more they lead to danger. Such had been my experience in these matters, and there was a time in which I had a great deal of anxiety, for my position was such that I had a great deal of anxiety as to what might result from short cuts of that particular kind. It was my one fear as to the operation of our courts at a certain period, and any thought that I gave to the matter at that time confirmed me in the opinion that one cannot afford to dispense with these principles, or that if you attempt to do that you are going to run into far greater danger in the countrary direction.  The effect of this particular section seems to me to put at the discretion of the judges the whole question of ignoring these principles, and saying: &ldquo;After all, substantial justice has been done.&rdquo;  I do not think that we ought to proceed that far.  Again it seems to me it is unnecessary, because the Dáil has allowed paragraph (b) of that same section to stand&mdash;that is, giving the power of re-trial.  If you are going to give the power of re-trial, and if anything wrong has been done in the trial, if a formality that should have been observed has not been observed, then the Supreme Court ought to feel bound to order a re-trial instead of acting on their own responsibility.  There is another aspect of the situation that I think ought to be considered, and it is this&mdash;that the Court of Appeal, giving its decision on notes, will not have the advantage that the court of first instance will have in seeing witnesses and in giving judgment&mdash;and the advantage that the juries will have in giving their verdict&mdash;and in judging the credibility, for example, of the witnesses after seeing them actually before them.  The Supreme Court will not have these advantages, and consequently I think it is most unfair to allow the court to say, &ldquo;Very well, in our opinion.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I did not say that.  I did not say that they must not call witnesses.  But I say that as a rule they are denied the advantages that a court of first instance has of seeing the witnesses actually giving their evidence, and judging their credibility from their general conduct. And, mind you, by watching the witnesses under examination and under cross-examination one can form very often a very good opinion of their credibility or not.  As I said, it is not necessary in any case.  The power of re-trial is there according to the decision of the Dáil, and if that power remains there is no need of that discretionary power which it is proposed to give the judges under paragraph (a). The argument will convince only those who have considered the whole question. Only those who have considered what the consequences of ignoring legal technicalities are, are likely to take the view that I take in this particular section.</P>
      <P>Others are disposed to take the short cut to deal with these matters as the layman says he will deal with them&mdash;&ldquo;Put all that red tape, the nonsense, aside.  Let us examine straight off and do these things,&rdquo; as they would say, &ldquo;in a commonsense fashion.&rdquo;  That is a very short-sighted view to take of it.  As I say, I fear that my arguments will not have weight with those who do not fully appreciate that particular point, but it ought to have weight with them. This is unnecessary.  If common sense dictates that something has gone wrong, if some legal process which should be adopted in the trial in the first instance is not properly carried out, the power of re-trial is the natural one to invoke, and they should say, &ldquo;Very well, let the trial begin again.&rdquo; I hope the result in this case will be the same as it was in the deletion of Section (c).</P>

      <P>I am astonished at the bringing forward of this amendment by Deputy de Valera.  It appears to me that it certainly is verging on the borders, at any rate, of political dishonesty. The whole section was fully debated here.  There were originally three sections, and I left every <Col N="1636" /> single matter under discussion to the free vote of the Dáil, and thought that the free vote of the Dáil would be accepted.  I did not think that Deputy de Valera would try to go back upon the free voting of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There were three sub-sections in this section originally.  Deputy de Valera moved to delete two of those sub-sections. Those were voted on by a free vote of this House.  Sub-section (b) was omitted from the Bill.  Sub-section (c) as it then was&mdash;it is now sub-section (b) &mdash;was retained in the Bill.  The section then stood precisely as it stands now, and there was no division challenged by Deputy de Valera upon the section then.  The section has been decided by the free vote of the House, with three amendments, and now I discover, when the House has made up its mind in that fashion, that Deputy de Valera wishes to re-open the whole matter again.  I say that his decision to do so came to me, at any rate, with a very great amount of surprise.</P>
      <P>The Party opposite said to us a short time ago they were not going to oppose blindly by mere obstruction Bills they thought were of advantage to the country.  Here is a Bill, a great number of the sections of which, at any rate, are, as they have admitted, to the advantage of the country.  Yet we have had, I think, the most stupid bit of obstructive tactics that have yet been adopted a few moments ago with reference to Section 1.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister at least to know my position in this: I spoke against that particular section when the Bill was on its Second Reading.  I gave my reasons against it.  Deputy Ruttledge, who generally has charge of that particular department, put in two amendments.  I was surprised myself to find that there was not one covering section in.  There was no time to put in an amendment at that particular time.  I took the first opportunity I had to put in an amendment to the section.  There is nothing behind it and no question of using it for obstructive purposes.  There was no question of withdrawing private accommodation. This is consistent with my action at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that the Deputy did not divide the House against the sub-section which stood in the Bill at the time.  Now I come to Deputy de Valera's arguments, or what pass for arguments, and the first of them is that this is doing away with an old legal formality.  That is the best way in which I can, I think, abbreviate the Deputy's argument.  That is not so. This Court of Criminal Appeal is a court which up to a very short time ago was unknown in this country, or in any other country which administered a code of criminal law similar to the code which we administer, and based upon that code.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is, in this country, an extremely new thing created by the Courts of Justice Act.  There has been no time for legal formalities to grow up.  Certain defects were shown, and it is these defects, which have been shown in action, that we are seeking here to remedy.  I might say that in the two countries, England and Scotland, where more or less the same laws <Col N="1638" /> exist, where also by statute a Court of Criminal Appeal was set up, it has been found necessary to have a section of that nature, in one case an amending Act and in the other the very Act which created the court.  We find on the one side the statement by the Deputy that this is doing away with old-established legal formalities, and we have on the other side the experience, not only of our own courts, the practical experience in this country, but we are also fortified and strengthened by the experience of other countries in the belief that such a section is necessary.  The Deputy again says that this section is unnecessary because sufficient remedies are put in sub-section (b).  I have already in this House explained the difference between what is now contained in sub-section (a) and what is now contained in sub-section (b).  I think I did so fairly fully, but since the Deputy certainly has not dealt with the matter in a fashion which would lead me to believe that he had either listened to, or, if he listened to, had followed the argument I was endeavouring to put to the Dáil, I will repeat my argument. My argument was this: These two sub-sections are concerned with quite a different state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the judges are clearly of opinion that there is a very trifling matter&mdash;that the judge has allowed in a piece of immaterial evidence that could not have weighed upon the minds of the jury at all, or something of that kind.  Then a retrial is a great deal too big and too cumbersome a procedure.  They see that a small mistake has been made, some little immaterial thing has been done which could not have affected the minds of the jury in finding the prisoner guilty, and in those circumstances if the court are perfectly satisfied that no miscarriage of justice has taken place, then it is, I submit to the House, quite right and proper, seeing that on an immaterial issue or an immaterial point a mistake has been made and that no injustice is being done to the prisoner, that the court should uphold the verdict of the jury.  Another case arises; that is the case which arises under sub-section (b). I will only deal with that very shortly. There something has gone wrong.  Let <Col N="1639" /> me make the illustration again which I have used before.  The court is not satisfied on a piece of evidence that has been admitted and the court cannot make up its mind; it cannot say as to whether if that bit of evidence had not been admitted the jury would inevitably have convicted.  It is in a case like that that the court would order a new trial.  But you must bear in mind that a new trial is absolutely necessary in order that justice shall be done between the State upon the one side and the prisoner on the other.  If that is your object, still that new trial consists of a procedure which must cost a great deal of money and a great deal of public time, money certainly of the State and, in certain cases, it may be money of the prisoner also, because though the court have full jurisdiction to make any order they like as to the costs, still they may not, of necessity, make such an order.  All that procedure is perfectly unnecessary in a case in which the court are clearly convinced that whether a trifling error which has been made in the conduct of the first trial or not a conviction must have followed.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera talked again about the advantage of judges seeing witnesses, if they are going to decide questions of fact.  That is the one thing that the judges do not do in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The one thing that they have never done and never will do&mdash;certainly not under this section&mdash;is to decide questions of fact.  I mean by question of fact a question such as the Deputy has brought up, the credibility of witnesses.  The credibility of witnesses is never for the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The credibility of witnesses is for the jury, in the first instance, and for the jury only, and it is only from the evidence which it is clear the jury have believed that the court is free to draw deductions, and from that evidence only the courts do draw deductions.  The credibility of witnesses is always for the jury.  There is no difficulty in applying those principles; they are regularly applied. Here we are really dealing only with this one sub-section, sub-section (a).</P>
    <P>I have wandered, I am perfectly aware, from sub-section (a), but I have <Col N="1640" /> wandered away from it because I wished to counteract, as I hope I have counteracted, Deputy de Valera's argument, that sub-section (a) is now unnecessary, because sub-section (b)&mdash; the new trial&mdash;exists.  When the Deputy put his contention to the House at the end it was not really that sub-section (a) is bad; it was not really that sub-section (a) is wrong; it worked itself down to this, that sub-section (a) is unnecessary in the Deputy's view.  Yet the Deputy has got the whole experience of people in this country, and of the legislatures in the two neighbouring countries, whose criminal system is similar, that a section like this is necessary.  Now the Deputy has talked very often of, and is very pleased with describing himself as a layman unconversant with legal matters.  Yet the Deputy puts up his own authority&mdash;I will leave out for a moment the experience of this country &mdash;against the authority of the working of precisely the same system, as far as appeals go, in two neighbouring countries. What is the strongest argument that the Deputy can put forward?  He has put it forward as his strongest argument that this sub-section is unnecessary. Then the judges who administer the law, even if that were right, would never use it.  It would not be harmful; it would be, at most, useless. My contention is&mdash;and it is a deliberately-considered contention, based on experience and on authority&mdash;that a section of this nature is necessary for the proper working of any Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is a new court; it is a court which has been established entirely in favour of not merely accused persons, but convicted persons.  It is a one-sided court, so to speak.  No appeal lies on the part of the State; appeal lies on the part of the prisoner and on the part of the prisoner only to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The prisoner has got under the Courts of Justice Act a right which a prisoner in this country never enjoyed before, a right of appeal.  That right of appeal should be exercised to acquit men where there is or there can be a real doubt as to their guilt, but this new right which is given should not be made, and I trust will never be made, <Col N="1641" /> a way by which a man found guilty by a jury of his fellow-countrymen and, in the opinion of the courts of this country, correctly found guilty upon the evidence before the jury&mdash; a subterfuge by which a guilty person of that class who has wronged the community can escape from the consequences of the wrong he has done.  I ask the House to reject this amendment and to stand over this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that that remark in regard to Deputy de Valera is outrageous, because it is essentially a layman who is required to deal with this matter.  It is like a jury making its case here.  It is the mind of the jury asserting itself as against the over-legalistic mind.  That is one of the valuable functions of an institution such as this.  It is to safeguard not merely the rights to mercy as well as justice of the person who is charged, but also to safeguard the functioning of a jury properly, that we are opposed to this particular section.  I think we made it clear on the Committee Stage that our opposition was to the principle underlying the whole of this section, and our attempt was to minimise that evil. As one who was associated with Deputy Ruttledge in the amendments which were put down, I quite frankly accept any blame attaching to the responsibility of not having moved at that stage for a more radical and fundamental amendment of the whole section. We could not touch sub-section (b), because it had been already dealt with, and we were only left the remedy of attacking sub-section (a).  So long as <Col N="1642" /> sub-section (b) is there, there is no danger of a criminal escaping.  If (b) were not there, it is just possible on a technical point of law that a criminal might escape, but so long as (b) is there the judge has more than ample powers, more than justifiable powers, to deal with the situation as it arises.  As a matter of fact, we in this country are too much dominated by the genius of English criminal law, which is known all over the world as being extremely severe.  It is very much more vindictive than it is remedial.  As a contrast to ancient Irish law and to laws in other countries, English law is a very vindictive kind of law.  Here you have the whole iron framework, the whole machinery of State, directed against one individual, let him be as great a criminal as possible.  In the long run there may be imposed greater respect and reverence for the law in a country where you have justice tempered with mercy than in a country where everything is so fixed and so superimposed on an individual as to make people feel that it is something super human and something which is in human as a result.  This is another case of the one-way valve, because it is giving greater facility to the legal machinery and it is leaving the severe iron framework of the thing directed against the person charged.  Where this clause would be of any use would be in cases where either the pleadings had been wrongly drafted or some mistake had been made on the legal side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that it might happen that, in cases like these, mistakes might be made by the judge in directing for want of clarity or mistakes made by the lawyer who is directing the course of the case.  In these cases a jury may get confused in their minds on technical points of law, and so give a wrong decision, wrong technically, and so, arising out of that wrong technical decision, the judge is called upon to make this particular kind of decision. I say that in that case it is far better that lawyers rather than the criminal should be punished, if only in order to ensure that they would be more careful <Col N="1643" /> in matters such as this.  It is a natural thing, due to the over-earnestness sometimes of lawyers to see that the very letter of the law is carried out, to lose sight of the human element in a situation, and very often a criminal may be sufficiently punished by going through the suffering of having an appeal coming on than by being charged, tried, and convicted.  A pending appeal might, as I say, be a severer trial than anything else, and, in the long run, mercy, even if it occurs accidentally, may not be against the cause of public policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the opposition to this Bill. Surely the important thing in the selection of officers for public boards is that only persons competent to fulfil the duties attaching to any office are appointed.  This Bill makes provision for that.  The objection appears to be that a number of names have to be sent down to the local authority for selection. This Bill makes provision that only the names of persons competent to do the work are sent down.  It has been stated that in one or two cases the persons who were third, fourth or fifth on the list of candidates or that, in some cases those who only came fourth or fifth in the examination, were selected by the local bodies.  I think it <Col N="1644" /> will be admitted that no system of competitive examination can find out certain qualities or can detect a want of certain qualities in candidates, and it is just possible that a person who would come fourth or fifth in a competitive examination might be a far more suitable person to do the work than a person who came first.  The best person in the world to pass an examination might be a clever rogue.  A man who would be lacking in very essential qualities might be a very brilliant scholar and might easily secure first place in a competitive examination. He might be a very unsuitable official and perhaps in the end a very expensive official if appointed to a position in the gift of a local council.  Moreover the local councils are the best judges of the characters of those whom they appoint to positions.  I admit of course that canvassing and local influence have a lot to do with these appointments.  Still I hold it does not matter who is appointed provided a man competent to do the work is appointed, and provided he is a person of good character.  This Bill gives every safeguard in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very serious opposition throughout the country to the Act at present in force.  It takes out of the hands of local Boards power to appoint officials, and that is very gravely resented.  I think it is only fair that some protest should be made against the attack made by Deputy O'Hanlon on the present Boards.  He made a very grave charge to the effect that members of Boards, appointed in the 1919 elections, were practically all corrupt.  He stated that in fact corruption was introduced into public life by both the President of the Executive Council and the Leader of the Opposition.  That is a very serious charge.  I happen to have been one of the representatives appointed in that election, and personally I resent very strongly the imputation.  I do not at all admit that the members selected by Sinn Fein to go forward in 1919 were, to say the least of it, any bit more corrupt than those whom they succeeded.  As a result of the extraordinary conditions that obtained during the period subsequent to the election of 1919, members of public Boards in Ireland had an opportunity, if they <Col N="1645" /> so wished, to be very corrupt.  At the time, owing to the campaign against the English Local Government Board, the administration could have been very loose.  Certain precautions had to be taken in connection with the funds of the local Councils, and I know myself that members of many of the Boards had a very great opportunity indeed of making away with the funds.  No audit of the accounts took place in many cases, but I do not think that in one case throughout the country was advantage taken of that.  A few members on a Board in many cases had to be appointed to take care of the funds, and to take certain measures for their protection. The result was that these men had it in their power, if they so wished, to misuse the funds, but that was not done.  I think it is only fair to say that there is no foundation at all for the charges made by Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>
    <P>Of course it is quite possible that the men appointed were not the best administrators. Many of those who could have made the best administrators took very good care not to go forward at that election.  Some of the best administrators, in some counties, not satisfied with the way in which the Boards were working, asked for an inquiry into their working after some years.  I happen to be a member of a Council into whose conduct of affairs an inquiry was held at the instigation of the Farmers' Union in the county.  That inquiry entailed a certain amount of expense on the local ratepayers, but they discovered nothing whatever.  After a long exhaustive inquiry the only thing discovered was that some member of the Council had to do some work at one time in connection with some contract&mdash;a matter of a few pounds.  Nothing whatsoever was discovered against the Council.  Many of the members of that Council could have made a good thing out of it if they had been corrupt.  They could have benefited themselves very considerably, but when the accounts were audited after some years not a halfpenny was found to be missing.  I think the same thing occurred in connection with the Clare County Council, and it is not fair to make such charges as these against the Councils elected in 1919.</P>
    <P>I do not admit at all that always or practically in the majority of cases the <Col N="1646" /> wrong men are selected by these Councils. I think if they are given a fair chance the local Councils are just as well able to select suitable officials as any Selection Board.  This Bill gives the greatest safeguard to all.  It ensures that only the names of people competent to do the work will be sent down.  The names of those who are really suitable for the work will be sent down to the Council.  It does not matter whom they select, even if they select the fourth or fifth on the list, provided the fourth or fifth is quite competent to do the work.  I know that in the case of an election that occurred in my own county a qualifying examination was held, and the person, a young lady, who secured No. 3 on the list, was appointed. I know that that young lady had been employed by the Council on many occasions, and that she was quite competent to do the work.  However, a query was sent down by the Local Government Department to the Council as to why they appointed this young lady, who was No. 3 on the list.  The difference in marks between the candidates was very small, and a rumour was very current in the district that some person or persons brought pressure to bear on the Local Government Department to question this particular appointment.</P>
    <P>A query came down as to why the Council appointed the young lady that was third on the list.  The Council knew well what they were doing.  They knew this young lady was quite as well able to do the work as the person who was first in the examination.  So that provided the safeguard is there that only persons competent are sent down, it gives all the safeguard that is necessary.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether any detailed criticism of the Bill is necessary&mdash;I presume it is not&mdash; first of all, because I find that anything like detailed examination of this Bill coming from the Fianna Fáil Party is resented by them, and I should not like to do anything that they would resent very strongly.</P>

      <P>The next thing is that I think that detailed criticism has already been given by the <Col N="1647" /> President and by the Minister for Local Government, and that dealt with the character of the Bill itself.  Personally, I feel compelled to agree with the verdict given from every quarter of the House, except the Fianna Fáil Benches, as to the merits and value of the Bill.  I agree with them that it is a bad Bill.  It is a bad Bill, but not because the drafting is bad&mdash;that is a consideration and a circumstance that could be overcome.  If the drafting is bad, I say that it is bad because the instructions given to whoever drafted the Bill were confused and not clearly thought out.  The Bill is itself confused. It is impossible to make out what it aims at, not because of any lack of draftsmanship on the part of Deputies opposite, but because I doubt very much if they knew clearly what they wanted.  As I say, detailed and destructive criticism of the Bill has already been given, and I think at this stage any speaker may be spared the necessity of going into the Bill again.  Everybody must feel that the Bill is bad.  Nearly every party in the House is against it.  So far as I can gather from one or two speeches, even the Party opposite seem to have abandoned their own child more or less. That is the only conclusion that I can draw from the speech of one of the sponsors of the Bill&mdash;Deputy O'Kelly &mdash;when he said he was prepared to vote, not apparently for the Bill, but for the hanging-up motion of Deputy O'Connell.  I can very well understand his attitude after everything that was said about the Bill.  I can quite well understand the attitude of the Party opposite in wanting to run away from this Bill; in wanting the House to pronounce a verdict on the merits of the Bill; being themselves at last convinced, of what everybody else was convinced of when they saw the Bill, that it is a worthless one, that it is an attempt at compromise, an attempt to reconcile really conflicting positions, to reconcile apparent acceptance of the principle of the present Act with the old system that prevailed before that Act came into force.  As I say, by implication, if there is anything at all in what Deputy O'Kelly said when he spoke of accepting Deputy O'Connell's <Col N="1648" /> amendment&mdash;I think another Deputy on the Front Bench opposite said the same thing&mdash;if there is anything at all in that acceptance, it means that they really see the worthlessness of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is no real principle in the Bill in the sense that it does not stand for anything definite.  As I say, it seems to be a compromise by a Party that once held&mdash;at least it was said in debate that they held&mdash;the principle of the present Act: an effort to reconcile that position and maintain that reputation of consistency that they attach so much importance to with getting the most out of what they think is the unpopularity in certain quarters of the present Act.  I can only see one purpose in the Bill, if it has a purpose, and that is to destroy the present Act and yet appear faithful to the principle that appointments and promotions should be made on merit; that there should be the beginnings, at all events, of the building up of a national service in local government.  I think it is an effort really to reconcile these two impossible positions that has led to the present unfortunate measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all respect to Deputy Goulding, the aim in the Civil Service, and it ought to be the aim too in the local authorities, is not merely to get the candidate who has qualified, but to get the best service.  You may have several people qualified, but there may be degrees in the value of the service that they can give.  May I take an analogous case from my own Department?  Every year there are examinations for candidates for teaching, and a large number of people qualify, in the sense of passing the examination, but only the top people on the list are selected.  Does anybody suggest seriously as a policy that the Minister in charge of that Department should have the liberty to pick any candidate he liked from the so-called qualified list?  That, after all, is an analogous case to the one put forward by Deputy Goulding.  I do not say that an effort has not often been made to persuade the Minister that he has that power.  People have pointed out to me again and again that so-and-so is qualified and that I had the power to call whom I liked.  I have had to point out that the examination is strictly competitive and only the best <Col N="1649" /> can come in.  The first aim, whether in the case of the Civil Service or the service of local authorities, ought to be to get the best service, not primarily to consider whether certain professions are satisfied, whether certain people get a reward for hard work, but to see whether the best service is given to the State on the one hand or the local authorities on the other.  In doing that, I think in the long run you will not only secure the best service to the State, but also the best thing for the profession and for the individuals that go for that profession.  Those who profess to support the Bill&mdash;as I say, I am doubtful whether they are really supporting it or not now&mdash;speak of a national service, and yet object to the existing Act, which is the one way towards the realisation of that particular national service.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Kelly was that publicity was necessary to restore the confidence of the people; that the public ought to know what is going on; things are done too much in the dark; let the public know, just as in the case with examinations. It is very hard, seeing that Deputy O'Kelly himself confessed he did not know what is meant by competitive selection, and seeing that in many cases competitive examination is obviously an unsuitable method for making professional appointments, to follow Deputy O'Kelly quite clearly. How do you satisfy or allay that particular type of public suspicion by sending down three names&mdash;supposing, as there has been in some cases, twenty or thirty candidates for a position?  At present one name in sent down, and most of the other twenty-nine candidates are under the impression that there was dirty work; otherwise each man thinks his name would have been sent down.  There is suspicion due to that; it is only human nature.  Would there not be the same suspicion if you sent down three names?  Does anybody believe that of the other twenty-seven not sent down, the tenth man, say, on the list would not feel that he ought to have been the first on the list?  There have been cases in which a man very far down on the list believed very <Col N="1650" /> strongly and genuinely that he should have been first.  You do not allay public suspicion by that method of sending down three names.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy O'Kelly meant to publish the whole list or not; apparently he did.  Have Deputies who support this Bill, at least those Deputies who made that demand, considered what would be the result of a publication of that kind?  Supposing there were thirty candidates given, what would happen to the thirtieth placed there by the Selection Board? It would be the verdict of a competent body of his colleagues, experts and leaders of his own profession.  Would that hurt him?  See the danger there would be of frightening off individuals who believed well in their own qualifications, but who would hang back, because, while they believed in their own qualifications, others might have a different opinion of them.  See the risk that would be run by a publication of that kind.  Would you not seriously diminish the candidates who would come forward for selection?</P>
    <P>One of the suggestions of the Bill is to hand these functions of the Local Appointments Commission over to the Civil Service Commission.  How that is expected to work miracles nobody has been able to find out.  Certainly nobody on the other side has demonstrated it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">

      <P>What is the precise value of that particular provision?  The personnel of the two Commissions has two out of three members in common.  The machinery is the same.  They have the same set of officials working for the two Commissions. The mode of procedure in the case of the Civil Service Commission, and in the case of the Local Appointments Commission, is the same.  Why then this extraordinary belief apparently in the Civil Service Commission, and why the unbelief and so-called unpopularity of the Local Appointments Commission?  If Deputies think for a moment they will see the answer quite clearly&mdash;namely, that it is the business of the Civil Service Commission to appoint officials at headquarters.  So far as patronage was taken away from <Col N="1651" /> anybody, it was taken away from the Executive Council, and that was highly popular.  So far as the Local Appointments Commission goes, any patronage interfered with was the patronage of the local bodies, hence the unpopularity. That is the explanation of the comparative freedom from criticism that the Civil Service Commission enjoys, and of the amount of criticism that the Local Appointments Commissioners come in for.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the position before this Act which it is now proposed to amend, so far as mere words are concerned, but in reality which it is proposed to destroy, was a case in which you had patronage in public boards. And many of the arguments put forward for the retention of that particular patronage might as well have been put forward for the retention of patronage by the central authority. The analogy of the Dáil, as everyone will remember who listened to those debates, has been quoted again and again.  Why trust the Dáil and not the local authorities; but surely, as Deputy Anthony pointed out, a moment's consideration will show that there is no analogy between the two things.  The Dáil makes no appointments, even so far as selection is concerned.  Ministers make no appointments in the Civil Service.  The analogy of the patronage exercised by local authorities, if you are to have a similar thing here at headquarters, would be as follows:&mdash;That in case of a number of vacancies in the Civil Service the Civil Service Commissioners would send down to the Dáil three times the number of candidates that there are vacancies for, and then the Dáil would proceed to allocate which of the candidates would fill the vacancy.  That is the analogy when you compare the central body and the local bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so sure that that particular method of procedure would shock every Deputy because, as one of the members of the Labour Party has already called attention to, Deputy O'Kelly naively put forward, apparently as a particular objection to the Appointments Commissioners, that their Party had no nominee upon it.  If <Col N="1652" /> their Party had a nominee upon it then they would have to be satisfied with the position of that body.  That is the conception underlying a great deal of what is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Now certain charges have been made in course of the debate in connection with the activities of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  I am not going to waste any time in trying to elucidate whether or not charges of that kind were foreshadowed by the leader of the Opposition.  I suppose we will leave that rather vexed question of exegesis aside and turn to the actual course of the debate.  There were various interruptions, so vigorous that we on this side happened to miss the exact terms of the interruptions when the Minister for Agriculture was speaking. He thought that Deputy O'Kelly said &ldquo;We will bring forward charges,&rdquo; but what Deputy O'Kelly said was &ldquo;We did.&rdquo;  Therefore, the suggestion is that the charges had been brought forward and apparently substantiated in connection with the activities of the Local Appointments Commission.  Now, one thing is that nothing is easier than to get up here or in any other assembly or place to deal with any appointment and take one candidate, mention his qualifications, set out how brilliant he was, not perhaps all round but in certain respects, and then say: &ldquo;This man was passed over.  Could he have been passed over if the body was animated with the spirit that they should have been?&rdquo;  Nothing is easier than that. Where the facts are not before the assembly, and where the qualifications of the different candidates are not before the assembly, it is easy to make a plausible case for any one candidate. I think that is admitted.  Consequently everybody will realise that the claim cannot be made by which a decision of this body or any other body would give universal satisfaction.</P>
    <P>We must realise that these men animated with the best disposition will reach a different opinion as to the qualifications and merits of the different candidates.  That happens every day in every walk of life.  Even divinely instituted bodies find it is extremely difficult to give universal satisfaction, and certainly any human <Col N="1653" /> body of this kind is liable to err.  But because another person would give a different verdict on the evidence before him is that a suggestion that there was anything in the nature of unfair dealing on the part of the Appointments Commissioners?  Then, as I say, people with only very partial knowledge, having heard only one side of a case in which there are possibly ten sides, if there are ten candidates, it is very easy for a person of that kind to come to a decision that a little consideration would show is entirely unjust and entirely wrong.  The Appointments Commissioners are a statutory body; they are under statutory obligations and on them in the last run must rest responsibility for whatever recommendation they make as to the suitability of the candidate.  The functions of the men who have been functioning on the Selection Boards is to test the professional and relative technical qualifications of the different candidates.  As I say, in the last instance it is the Commissioners who must take the responsibility for the recommendation that the Selection Boards make.  That is a statutory obligation and they cannot rid themselves of it.  They must reserve to themselves always the right to say that in every case as far as they are able to see it there is no case of injustice, either inadvertent injustice or otherwise. So far as the action of the Commissioners is concerned it has in fact been the invariable practice to adopt the reports of the Selection Boards on the technical and professional qualifications, if they are satisfied that there has been no miscarriage of justice and that there has been no oversight.  In one case there was a wrong age stated by one of the candidates.  That was afterwards discovered.  In the course of the operation of the Act no case has yet occurred where the Commissioners have not adopted the views of the Selection Board on the technical and professional recommendation of the candidates.  The order of merit in which the candidates are placed by the Selection Board may be disturbed by three considerations, and the principle that they are to be disturbed by those considerations has been acknowledged from every quarter of the House.  A <Col N="1654" /> preference may be given for a knowledge of Irish, and a preference to a very small degree indeed for local connection.  That is if a couple of candidates are practically equal, then if one is a local man preference is given in that direction.  I think Deputy de Valera made a demand of that kind. That has been the practice of the Appointments Commissioners.  The third thing that may disturb the order of merit as put by the Selection Board is an inquiry into the health and general moral character, age and so on of the different candidates.  These are the only cases in which a candidate placed No. 1 on the list by the Selection Board has not been automatically submitted by the Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In every case, including those that have been mentioned in this House, the candidate that was placed first by the Selection Board was recommended, unless the considerations that I have just referred to operated.  These considerations have been approved of, I think, by every Party in this House. As I say, that has been the position. There have been cases mentioned.  One was mentioned by Deputy Little.  He quoted a certain Waterford paper.  In quoting it he managed to leave, perhaps unwillingly or unwittingly, certain impressions on the minds of the House.  Certain of these impressions were afterwards corrected by the Minister for Agriculture.  But as he was quoting from that paper I think it was a pity that there were just two sentences that Deputy Little did not quote in fairness to the Commissioners, whom he said he did not want to criticise because they were unable to answer.  He might have quoted a sentence, which would not have taken him long, and it would certainly have conveyed information to the House.  He might have quoted the following sentence from the charge of the Judge:&mdash;&ldquo;It was a source of great gratification that the appointment made by the Commissioners was the candidate placed first on the list by the Board of Examiners.&rdquo;  He might also have quoted from the defendant himself in this action, the man in whose paper the charge appeared which was the cause of the action.  He might have quoted <Col N="1655" /> from the leader in the paper of that same date.  It was as follows: &ldquo;There were six names in this document, and the total marks credited to each candidate were recorded.  We are very pleased to be able to inform the citizens of Waterford that the candidate recommended by the Local Appointments Commissioners, David Sheehy, was placed first on the list and undoubtedly received the appointment on merit alone.&rdquo;  It was a pity as Deputy Little was quoting from that paper that he quite unwittingly managed to give a rather misleading impression of the trial&mdash;that he did not quote these two relevant statements in connection with that particular case.  There was a case mentioned by Deputy Ryan.  He did not give the name of the particular man.  The man he referred to had, he said, very excellent academic qualifications. He had excellent academic qualifications.  Deputy Ryan went on to say he had also experience.  If so it is a pity that he concealed that information from the Appointments Commissioners.  The candidate did not lay claim to the two very important things that count in an appointment of that kind, general experience or special experience.  If he had that experience that Deputy Ryan says he has, or had, it is a pity that he did not acquaint the Commissioners of that. It is a pity he kept that in the dark. But how were the Commissioners to know that he had that experience that he apparently had, if Deputy Ryan is correct, when he did not acquaint them of it?  We had a very eloquent appeal from the Deputy's colleagues.  Deputy O'Dowd, I think it was, pointed out the value of experience.</P>
    <P>You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot slate the Appointment Commissioners on the one hand because they do not take experience into account and then you cannot have a Deputy of the same Party slating them for taking experience into account.</P>
    <P>There was another case dealing with the appointment of an opthalmologist in Wexford.  The Local Appointments Commissioners adopted the recommendation of their Board.  They appointed a man who, as an expert, in the <Col N="1656" /> opinion of the Board very favourably outshone the other man.  The charge is made that they should not have done so, because he was not a local man and would not be able to fulfil the duties. It must be assumed that every man when he goes for a position is willing to undertake all the steps necessary to carry out his part of the bargain.  If he does not, there is a remedy.  But until he fails to do his duty it is not fair to attack the Appointments Commissioners because they do not reject the opinion of an expert Board.</P>
    <P>There is an amendment down to this Bill in the name of Deputy O'Connell. It proposes to hang up the Bill until a Committee of a certain kind has been appointed.  I suggest this to Deputy O'Connell for his consideration.  There is one thing I am convinced of.  The whole attitude of the Labour Party indicates that they are in favour of the present Act, and they are in favour of seeing it work.  They think a case has been made for an inquiry of a certain kind into the working of the Act.  They have as strong a view of the present Bill &mdash;they have stated it as strongly&mdash;as the members of this Party have.  I suggest to them that that being so there is no excuse for keeping this Bill; they should not attempt to keep a Bill they consider a bad Bill from every point of view, keep that in a state of suspended animation, and give it a kind of artificial life for a few months.  The Bill is of such a character in their and in our view that there is only one thing to be done with it, namely, to kill it.</P>
    <P>I am not now dealing with Deputy O'Connell's amendment, I am dealing with what Deputy O'Connell and the other Deputies who spoke said in favour of the amendment.  I refer to columns 135 and 136 of the Official Reports. Again, I think there is no lack of clearness in what Deputy O'Connell had in mind and intended.  He moved his amendment, and said there was a case for inquiry, but he was very careful before the Minister for Finance spoke to state that there were certain limitations to the inquiry he called for.  He said: &ldquo;I want to make it quite clear that I do not mean that this Committee should go into particular appointments that have been made under this Act.  I want to make that quite clear.  I do not <Col N="1657" /> propose that the particular appointments that were made or the methods used by the Local Appointments Commissioners of finding out who should be the best candidate for any particular appointment would be inquired into in any particular way.  What I do wish would be to get a Committee together who would find out what the general complaints are with regard to the working of this Act generally and what defects have been shown in its working and in its operation.&rdquo;  So far as the Government is concerned they are quite willing to co-operate in the setting up, if the Dáil wishes, of a Committee of that kind that will inquire into operations of the Act, see how the Local Appointments Commissioners work, and see what system they have of dealing with the different classes of appointments that come before them.  But Deputy O'Connell was careful to limit himself to rule out certain kinds of inquiry.  I hope I am not misinterpreting the Deputy.  He did not think a Committee of that kind ought to undertake the work.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister for Finance felt in duty bound to point out that there were certain types of information that could not or ought not to be called for has been held up as something unclean by the opposite Party.  I will take two particular types of cases, and I think from what he said that Deputy O'Connell will agree with me in this, that he would not want these things to be brought into public because if they were, the working of the Act, as a practical Act, would be impossible and the Act would be dead. Let us take it that there is a Board appointed, a Board of eminent men who are asked to act.  We will suppose that it is for a professional appointment. They give their opinions very candidly, I presume, on the different candidates.  Does anybody suggest that these opinions should be brought to the public, opinions that were given in confidence and on the strict understanding that they were in confidence? Is that the way to secure the future of this or any similar Act?  I suggest it is not.</P>
    <P>There is another type of case I might mention where it would be disastrous if publicity was given to the information <Col N="1658" /> that came to the Appointments Commissioners. It is known that in the case of these appointments, just as in the case of Civil Service appointments, the candidate who has been successful up to a point is asked to nominate references&mdash;people who know him and who can give evidence and information as to his character.  He nominates them and very often he gets people who, he thinks, will carry weight, men of position in his district.  Very often these men give an opinion very candidly and very honestly and perhaps it is not the type of opinion always that the candidate thinks they would give.  Is it suggested that a Committee should be appointed with power to make public anything of that kind?  I suggest if anything of that kind is done the future working of an Act of this kind, of the present Act, or any amendment of the present Act, would be impossible. There could be no confidence on the part of those called upon to act on boards.  There certainly could be no confidence in those asked to give their opinions as to the character of individuals examined by the Civil Service or by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  There could be no confidence on the part of these people. The danger is that they would refuse to act or give the information required. In the case of experts they would have to refuse to act.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on these considerations, so far as the actual words of Deputy O'Connell's amendment are concerned, he will realise that it does not aim at or achieve the purpose that he has set before himself.  So far as he and the Labour Party made the case for the setting up of the Committee to inquire into the general working of the Act and see how the Appointments Commissioners operate, as I say, the Government is quite ready to co-operate with the House in the setting up of a Commission of that kind, but I do oppose, and am bound in honour to oppose, the dragging into public of documents of the kind I have referred to&mdash;documents given in confidence to the Local Appointments Commissioners. I do not think it is reasonable to ask it.  I know Deputy O'Connell and the Labour Party are <Col N="1659" /> keen on the proper working of the Act, and I take it for granted that they do not want anything of the kind.  I oppose any such publication of confidential documents of that kind, because it would actually kill the Act. I do not believe the publication of every document in the hands of the Local Appointments Commissioners would show that there was a single case in which political considerations influenced them in rejecting any candidate put forward by the Board.  That is the attitude of the Government towards the Bill and towards Deputy O'Connell's amendment.</P>

      <P>There is one thing I have learned from the speeches of the Government members on this particular subject and it is that there is a cankering sore on the body politic that has been diagnosed by Deputy Dr. Hennessy and others of the Government Party as a case of septic poisoning due to an overdose of graft.  I have learned, much to my surprise, that all the public bodies of this country are absolutely rotten with graft.  We had Deputy Gorey and other Deputies giving us figures in relation to sums of money that had been paid out for certain appointments that were given out by the local bodies.  When I heard sums of hundreds of pounds having been paid by doctors and others for positions, honestly I began to wonder if I knew anything about the country or not, because I had just a little experience, not much but a little, of a public body some years ago.  That was before I started to accumulate grey hairs, and, honestly, I never could see any of this graft spoken of by Deputy Gorey.  I begin to realise in the part of the country Deputy Gorey came from&mdash;if he were speaking about his own part of the country&mdash;that it must have been a gift to have been a member of a public body.</P>

      <P>I do not know who was making the speech.  If the members of the Government wish to tell us here &mdash;they have told us already&mdash;that those people who returned the local bodies <Col N="1662" /> closed their eyes to dishonesty, then of course we have nothing to do but accept it, but I would like the members of the Government to tell the people that they have been dishonest for years.  They have been accessories before and after the fact where there was bribery and corruption concerned. They returned these people to power. These people accepted bribes for jobs. There was graft, and they returned the same people to power at the next election. They are accessories before and after the fact.  Tell the people they are all dishonest and be finished with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education drew an analogy between the Civil Service appointments and those made by the Appointments Commission, but I would like to suggest, humbly, of course, and all that, to the Minister for Education that his analogy is absolutely off the rails, for this reason: Nobody will suggest that a teacher who, when qualifying, takes high marks in an examination makes the best teacher when he comes out to teach.  Even a Minister would not suggest that, because he knows well it is not true.  The same thing applies to appointments that might be made under the Appointments Commission.  It is not always the person with the post-graduate course that Deputy Hennessy talks about who makes the best dispensary doctor, and I am sure Deputy Hennessy would not suggest that for a moment.</P>

Then again with regard to the Civil Service appointments, I know there are people appointed in the Civil Service to positions in the Government who are sons and daughters of those who were putting us under arrest a few years ago, and who do not even have the saving grace of belonging to the Free State.  They come from the Six Counties, from the Northern <Col N="1663" /> area.  Who knows how they got in there?  How do we know that the same thing does not go on with the Appointments Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is not a hidden hand that pushes people into the jobs?  It is mysterious how those people I refer to get into jobs.  I know two or three of them myself, and the same would apply to those appointed by the Appointments Commissioners. That is what Deputy O'Kelly and the rest were talking of when they were talking of things being done in the dark.  We know such a lot of things that have been done in the dark that we are afraid of other things that might be done in the dark.  Remember you cannot have your loaf and eat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot tell the Irish people that they have been guilty all their lives of making it a practice of returning dishonest men to councils and at the same time you cannot say you have produced men with a halo around their heads, men who are experts on the harp, to act here on a Local Appointments Commission. If you have men who are dishonest all over the country where are you going to get men to make these appointments on the Appointments Commission? You cannot get supermen like that, if you have a country full of dishonest men.  It is impossible.  The Minister made a very significant statement when replying to something that Deputy O'Connell had stated.  He said that there was certain information submitted with regard to certain candidates which should not or could not be divulged. There is the hidden hand, the hand that is working in the dark.  In the local bodies if a man is appointed his merits or demerits will come out, but in this case you have a system the same as you had in the days of the French Revolution. A <i>lettre de cachet</i>, posted in the night, goes in, and a man is either made or damned.  It should not be exposed !  It would not be in the interests of the public good to have that thing exposed!  Is there any wonder that people have their doubts as to the <i>bona</i><Col N="1664" /><i>fides</i> of the Appointments Commission? Is there any wonder that people on these benches have talked about the hidden hand that was working in the dark? You had certain information submitted about certain men, we will say doctors. That information cannot be disclosed. Why not?  If a man is an honest man, if his record is absolutely above reproach, like the record of Caesar's wife, that can be put on the boards; there is no doubt about that man's <i>bona fides</i> at all.  But if a man has anything to hide, if that man has a bit of a pull, if there is a letter submitted from a second or a third cousin of somebody else, and that man should get the job because he is a relative, then the <i>lettre de cachet</i>, the letter posted in the middle of the night, or the Minister's ear gently got and whispered into.  There you are; the appointment is made. If the members of the Government have doubts as to the honesty of the Irish people, remember they do not keep those doubts to themselves.  If they did well and good.  We all have certain things that we do not tell the world. But they come along and they make a song about corruption in public bodies, they make a song about the dishonesty of the people, and then they expect us calmly to sit down here and take all the findings of the Appointments Commission with a grain of salt.  What kind of simpletons do they take us for at all? I know that they have not a very high opinion of our intelligence, if we are to judge from the remarks of those on the benches opposite, but surely they do not think that we are as simple as all that; they do not think that we are going to swallow all that piffle&mdash;that is a good word, it came from the benches opposite &mdash;about dishonesty and that the Appointments Commissioners are absolutely above reproach, men who cannot do any wrong, supermen who could put their finger on a bunch of twenty men and pick out a winner.  It is very simple.  You have got two alternatives. Tell the people that they are all rotten, that they are all dishonest, that they are all prepared to vote and vote again for men who are prepared to accept bribes for their votes from somebody who is looking for a job, or tell the people: &ldquo;We will trust you; you may have faults, there are black sheep in every <Col N="1665" /> fold, but on the whole you have not done too badly in the past.&rdquo;  If you want to give them the chance of proving whether they are honest or not why not send them down a panel of names? Why not let them make their own choice?  You send them down one name now and they must take it whether they like it or not.</P>
    <P>The reason we had all the talk about Deputy Ward during the last week was because Deputy Ward did put up certain concrete cases which could not be answered.  The Government members said that we were talking merely in generalities, vaguely about suspicions, about this and that.  But when there were concrete cases put forward they were not answered.  It is not up to me to defend Deputy Ward, because I reckon he is well able to defend himself, but his name was in the mouth of every Deputy who spoke from the Government Benches.  He put up certain concrete cases to the Government which have not been answered and which, I think, they were not in a position to answer, and because we have those examples we are quite as much entitled to doubt the <i>bona fides</i> of the members of the Commission as the members of the Government are entitled to doubt the integrity of the Irish people.  It says little for the members of this House, no matter what benches they sit on, that it is this corrupt people of Ireland who returned the corrupt public bodies who have put us in here to represent them.  Is it not an insult to the people?  Is there any Deputy on the Government Benches, or any Independent Deputy, or any other Deputy who would have the temerity to go on public platforms through the country and tell the people, &ldquo;You have been corrupt; you are not capable even of appointing a doctor to a local dispensary; you are so dishonest that you are prepared to countenance dishonesty?&rdquo; Is there any Deputy here who would have the temerity to suggest that?  I do not think so.  Why not, then, give the local bodies credit for having some honesty or some honour?  Why not give them the opportunity of picking out from a panel of doctors the man that they think will suit their own particular district? <Col N="1666" /> If local men have applied, let the local men be included on it.  Send them down names and give them an opportunity to pick and choose for themselves.</P>

      <P>If you stultify the public boards in this way, there will be no honour or honesty left in them. If you persist in telling them that they are not honest, that they are dishonourable, what can you expect? Auto-suggestion.  If it is repeated often enough people will come to believe it.  What must people outside the country think if they read the speeches of Deputies opposite?  You talk about tourist development.  What must tourists think when they hear that every public body in this country is rotten with corruption and is dishonest? What must they think of the people as a whole?  Why, they would be afraid to come to the country at all. They would need all their pockets sewn up, for they would expect to find pickpockets at every street corner.  If you do not trust the people sufficiently to give them a say in their own local affairs, then, for goodness' sake, be honest about it.  Tell them that they are not honest enough to run their local affairs, their county councils, their urban councils.  &ldquo;You cannot do it&rdquo;&mdash;why not be honest and tell them that?  If you do not want to tell them that, then give them an opportunity of proving their honesty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BENNETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened more or less attentively to a number of speeches in this debate, I am not at all convinced that this Bill improves the original Act in any respect.  A great deal has been said about sending down a panel of three names to the local bodies from which to select.  If it was originally contended that canvassing among local bodies was improper, this sending down of three names would certainly revive canvassing to as great an extent as ever existed.  If the sending down of three names is intended as a sop to the wounded vanity of the local bodies, I cannot for the life of me see how it would be effecttive. If the local councils are not <Col N="1667" /> deemed worthy of making a selection themselves, how will the position be improved if the Commissioners, having made a selection and having picked out two or three candidates, say to the local bodies: &ldquo;We have picked out the best of the candidates.  You can fight among yourselves.  You can pick and choose among them.&rdquo;  I am not in favour of the panel.  So far as competitive examinations are concerned, I have been for many years a consistent advocate of them, and the council, of which I had the honour of being a member at a very early stage in its existence, put into operation the principle of competitive examination.  I will admit that that system has perhaps its faults, that it does not always happen that the man who comes out on top in an examination has the natural abilities to fill the position, but it appeared to us at that time that something was needed to improve the old system of selecting candidates for public bodies.  We felt that the competitive system was, at least, an attempt&mdash; only an attempt&mdash;in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there was introduced into this Dáil the Local Officers Authorities Bill and the council of which I was a member opposed that Bill, not because we believed that any change in the existing mode of election was unnecessary, but because of the manner in which it was debated in this Dáil and the unworthy and, I might say, absolutely unfounded attacks that were made on the honour and integrity of members of public bodies in this country. I am not going to suggest for a moment that there was never any corruption among public bodies in the Saorstát.  The Irish people would not have been human if, once in a way, some little departure from the ordinary code of morality did not occur, but because there were improper appointments made in the country or because a candidate who was regarded as the best was not selected is no proof that there was corruption.  Human nature, being what it is, it is not very hard to conceive that a member of a local body who had, perhaps, a friend or relative, was prejudiced in favour of that person when it came to a question of appointment, but prejudice in favour <Col N="1668" /> of a person does not necessarily mean corruption.  We are apt at times to consider our own geese as swans and it happens sometimes that members of local bodies regard their friends and kindred as swans, but to impute that all public bodies in this country were corrupt was an accusation that we and most public bodies could not stand for. That to my mind was the reason of the opposition to the present Act.  I do not see that the Bill now before us improves that Act one iota.  It may be said that having opposed that Bill I appear here in sackcloth and ashes, if you like, but I pay willing and unhesitating tribute to the Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>So far as my experience of their work goes and after watching it critically, I can say that the appointments made in my constituency and, so far as I know, in the surrounding counties were made on merit alone.  If that body continues to operate as it has operated up to the present in the south of Ireland there is no reason to change the Act.  I am sorry that in this debate the old accusations that were made in this House during the passing of the original Bill should have been revived.  Deputy Gorey thought fit to renew them and to make a deliberate attack on the county which I represent.  Not alone did he say that there was corruption there, but he imputed that the corruption in regard to public appointments ran into hundreds and thousands of pounds.  I do not know whether I have a more honest face than most people or whether ordinarily people would be corrupt enough to bribe public representatives. I think all this campaign centres around doctors, and doctors must have considered that I have a pretty honest face, because never in my experience of public life have I been interfered with, nobody ever approached me to depart from my duty to my people in one iota, either with a bribe or any other temptation.  I believe that what happened in my case happened to the majority of the men with whom I associate, and with whom I am proud to associate.  Is it suggested that bribery and corruption prevailed in the council of which I was a member?  The <Col N="1669" /> previous council was elected in a time of stress on practically a political basis There were appointments, perhaps, made by such councils which I would not have made, but in nearly every case they were the appointments of very poor men&mdash;men who had nothing in some cases&mdash;but it could never be charged against them that they paid bribes to the extent of £50 or £100.  Deputy Gorey was good enough to exempt his own county.  I would not go into this matter if his accusations were general, but he slung mud at the Shannon and Limerick and as long as I am a Deputy for Limerick I will not listen to attacks on my county from any Deputy.</P>
    <P>There has been far too much mudslinging, not alone amongst Deputies in this House, but amongst people outside. Quotations have been pretty frequent during this debate, and I might perhaps appropriately quote Byron:&mdash;&ldquo;A man must serve his time to every trade save censure,&rdquo; but a little quotation I saw written in a saloon in Western America seems to me more appropriate:&mdash;&ldquo;There is so much good in the worst of us and so much bad in the best of us that it ill becomes any of us to criticise the rest of us.&rdquo;  Some of us should assume that spirit and not forget that insinuations carry us nowhere, that if we have no definite charge against a person we should keep our insinuations to our own minds and in our own souls, because insinuation and suspicion are bad companions.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to hear the last speaker in the few remarks he addressed to Deputy Gorey, because if any Deputy from these Benches spoke of Deputy Gorey I am afraid he would have very little chance of finishing his speech.  However, I think there is an excuse for Deputy Gorey in this way, that it used to be an old story that corruption at one time occurred in the sale of a dog. Somebody must have told Deputy Gorey this story about the worthless dog.  Probably that is how the story originated.  Probably that may settle the question between the last speaker and Deputy Gorey.  I can understand the attitude of the Government Party on this question, but I fail to understand <Col N="1670" /> the attitude of some of the Labour members, including Deputy Anthony.  Deputy Anthony spoke here a few days ago, and his speech was like that of his famous ancestor, Mark, of that ilk.  He began with a &ldquo;Friends, Corkmen, and countrymen&rdquo; oration, and he proceeded to praise this Bill. Then he proceeded to cut it, and when I thought that bad points had convinced him of the uselessness of the Bill, he changed round and again praised it.</P>

      <P>In a sports model Forde coupé.  The Government opposition to this Bill is principally on the grounds of efficiency.  They base their opposition to it on the grounds of efficiency and because they are against corruption.  We have had too much experience of Government appointments to take much talk from Ministers and from the Government on the question of corruption.  We have heard a little too much about people going around with hats in their hands looking for votes.  I wonder did many of the Deputies on the opposite side go around with hats in their hands looking for votes.  When they wanted to make appointments to the Civic Guards did they make them on the grounds of capacity or was it purely white washing for a general election?  I am very glad the last speaker brought home to the Government that a number of members of their own Party do not stand for this wholesale charge as to all the public bodies being corrupt.  When you come to the question of efficiency, a Department that in its dealing with the poor is so inefficient as the Department of Local Government and Public Health should not charge public bodies <Col N="1671" /> with inefficiency.  The Department of Local Government had plenty of opportunities for developing efficiency in many ways.  They have a drug list from which doctors down the country are supposed to select their medicines. It was probably written in the Stone Age.</P>

      <P>Some of the Independent Deputies in dealing with this Bill took very good care that they criticised it here, and at the same time down the country at public boards and at public meetings they professed to be very interested in the Bill, before the Government pointed out that they were opposed to it and before the Government case had been made.  One of these Deputies&mdash;Deputy Brennan&mdash;brought up a case here on an adjournment debate and criticised the Appointments Commission very severely.  In Roscommon he took up a certain attitude at the Board of Health.  Now I find on looking up the Official Report that Deputy Brennan was one of the people who came here, after his record in Roscommon, and spoke against the Bill in true independent fashion.  The only Deputy who made a case against the Bill was Deputy Sir James Craig, but even he admits that his case is weak.  He admits that he has been a university examiner for many years and that he cannot generally say that the best men show up in examinations.  He <Col N="1672" /> went so far as to suggest that even some of the post-graduate courses do not entitle a man to preference in appointments. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to offer any apology to Deputies for raising this important question at this hour.  I think the matter is of sufficient importance to warrant Deputies giving it attention for the half hour proposed to be given to it.  The question of the price of bread in the Saorstát at the moment is one which requires very serious investigation.  I am perfectly satisfied at all events that there is no relation between the price of flour and the price of bread to the consumer. Hence I put my question to-day in order to get from the Minister some statement with regard to what he proposes to do on the findings of the Tribunal on Prices.  Deputies will remember that in 1927 the cost of living had reached such an abnormal figure that representations were made to the Minister by Deputies, at the call of their constituents, that it was time some action was taken by the Government to reduce the cost of living.  The Minister set up this Tribunal.  The Tribunal went very exhaustively into the examination of the figures.  Unfortunately the consuming public did not give them very much assistance at the time.  However, they dealt exhaustively with the figures relating to the price of flour and bread.</P>
      <P>In their introductory remarks to their Report they say:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Bread was the first commodity to which we directed our attention as we were of opinion that it is of prime importance in the budget of the average consumer.  That view was confirmed by the Director of Statistics who stated that the cost of living index number is affected to the extent of one and a quarter points by a rise of one penny in the <Col N="1673" /> retail price of the quartern (4lbs.) loaf and that if the increase in bread prices is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the retail price of flour as is usually the case the total increase is two and a quarter points.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The tribunal, as I say, went exhaustively into the question in such important centres as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and elsewhere, and they made certain recommendations.  On page 49 of the Report they say: &ldquo;Dealing with the case of Dublin and elsewhere, we find that an excessive profit must have accrued to master bakers in the Saorstát over the years 1926-27, owing to the decline in flour prices not being reflected quickly enough in the price of the loaf.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were dealing there with certain figures submitted to them by the Dublin master bakers for 1925-26.  During these years the prices ruling were&mdash;In 1925, 48/- to 54/6; in 1926, from 47/- to 50/-, and the price of the loaf to the consumer varied from 11d. to one shilling. On these prices the Tribunal said that they found that an excessive profit must have accrued to the master bakers. Lower down in the Report they say: &ldquo;We are satisfied that there is an urgent need for early intervention on the part of the proposed Prices Board in the matter.&rdquo;  The Prices Board is in one of the recommendations.  They recommend that a Prices Board should be set up, and that there should be a scale of standard flour prices to which the price of bread should correspond. What is the position to-day?  If the Tribunal found that on the figures submitted to them by the master bakers and the flour millers the prices charged for bread are excessive, what change is there in the position to-day?  Can any person, examining the thing impersonally, arrive at any other conclusion than that the same state of things exists to-day?  That is my contention.  I have made some study of the figures, and anybody looking in the papers from day to day will see the prices quoted for the London markets.  During the last three <Col N="1674" /> or four weeks I notice that the price of flour has been falling; recently, I think last week, the price quoted was 42/-, and I think it is down now to 41/-. The quotations here of 41/- and 42/- refer, of course, to the British quotation. I may say in passing that these are quotations for the very best flour. We must reasonably assume that there are quotations, if we could find them, for the surplus flour that they export to this country, because we know that 60 per cent. of their surplus is exported to this country.  Anyway, we must assume that these quotations are very much lower than the quotations we find in the newspapers.  The prices of the Irish flour millers are usually from 2/ to 3/- over the prices quoted in the Press by the British millers.  I have some figures from December to June indicating that the price ruling here to the master bakers was from 44/- to 48/-. The price of 48/- was for a short time, I think it was two weeks.  In December, January, and February the prices stood at 44/-.  In March it stood at 45/, and in June, that is, at the present month, the price is 44/-.  The Tribunal discovered that similar prices were ruling for the years 1925-26, and on these they definitely and clearly stated that excessive profits accrued to the master bakers.</P>
    <P>I maintain that on the prices ruling since December excessive profits have accrued to the master bakers.  No Deputy will object to any particular factor in this country getting a reasonable return for the money he invested in a particular concern.  But the consumer in this State, as in every other State, is surely entitled to some protection.  It is little wonder that we find that our development, no matter what phase of activity we pursue, is retarded or obstructed by the cost-of-living figures as we find them to-day. There is a wrangle to-day about wages or something else, and very naturally, for I maintain that although we get statistics from the Department showing the index figures as to the cost of living, they are not quite accurate as they work out in practice.  If any Deputy or any other person wishes to take me to task upon that particular matter, I invite him, particularly if he <Col N="1675" /> is a married man, to take up the home budget for a month or two, and find out by practical experience the purchasing value of the pound.  If he does he will come back to this House assured and reassured that the index figure for practical purposes is of little or no value.</P>
    <P>What exactly is my purpose in raising this question to-night?  It is to obtain, if I can, some information from the Minister as to what he proposes to do with the recommendations contained in the Food Prices Report. These recommendations apply generally not only to bread, but also to articles of general consumption.</P>

      <P>The men sitting on that Tribunal were men of some standing.  They went exhaustively into the whole question, and gave us a very splendid report which has cost some money to produce.  They have made certain recommendations which are the very best we can procure at present.  That Report was presented in October, 1927, and we find the complaint regarding the cost of living up and down the country to-day.  I contend, therefore, that it is time the Government took action, and that a Prices Board, such as is suggested, that would stand between the consumer and the trader, should be set up immediately by the Minister.  This Report cites the case of Queensland, where a Prices Commissioner has been appointed. This Commissioner has certain powers and works in with the departments. After investigation, he fixes prices, and no trader is allowed to exceed the prices fixed.  I submit that this is at present a cancer in our whole social system, and that we have reached the stage when such a Board or Commissioner should be appointed to investigate wholesale and retail prices and fix prices, and so save the consumer from the obviously excessive charges that are being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of the arguments which have been advanced by the Deputy.  It is up to the Government <Col N="1676" /> to take some action to prevent profiteering in bread.  It has been shown by this Report that in every town visited by the Tribunal, with the solitary exception, I think, of Limerick, they found that the price of bread was in excess of the price which would give a fair return to the bakers.  They also found, although they did not mention it specifically, that wherever a master bakers' Association was in existence the price of bread was excessive.  It appears to me to be decidedly objectionable that anything in the nature of a ring for the purpose of fixing prices of essential foodstuffs should exist.  One useful reform which could be instituted would be the enactment of legislation designed to prevent associations for the purpose of price-fixing, particularly in foodstuffs.  The existence of these associations is one of the principal reasons for the delay referred to by the Deputy in a reduction in the price of flour being reflected in the price of bread.</P>
      <P>There is urgent need to tackle this matter, and it is up to the Government to take action.  We must remember that they have refused to give to the flour-milling industry the protection which they asked for, and justify their refusal by saying that it would result possibly in an increase of a farthing in the price of the loaf.  In view of the fact that that was the main argument on which they relied to refuse protection to the flour-milling industry, we maintain, and I think it will be generally maintained, that they can find no excuse for failing to take action, if and when it is shown, as it has been shown by the Tribunal, that the price of bread is excessive at present.  If the Government will not accept the recommendations of the Tribunal in connection with a permanent Prices Board, we trust that they have been considering the matter, and will be prepared to put before the House a recommendation for the establishment of some other machinery which will achieve the purpose.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Prices Tribunal, I am extremely surprised that Deputies Lemass and Hennessy have actually read the Report. I was under the impression that it was <Col N="1677" /> a secret between myself and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a possible accessory after the fact.  Certainly one of the greatest problems we had to tackle was the fact that the price of bread in Cork&mdash;and I assume Deputy Hennessy is speaking with some knowledge of his constituency&mdash;was always apparently a halfpenny in the quartern loaf higher than in Dublin, although the Cork bakers got their flour rather more cheaply.  Deputy Anthony will, no doubt, say that was the entertainment tax, that the privilege of living in Cork was worth paying a halfpenny in the loaf more for.  Other people more jealous might say that it accounted for the remarkable mobility of Cork men, and that they were urged by hunger to seek a cheaper loaf.  Certainly, it is remarkable; it is as remarkable as the fact that when a reduction in the price of the loaf is made in Dublin it takes four months for Cork to hear of it and make the reduction.  I suppose the transport facilities for returning to Cork are less satisfactory.  Deputy Hennessy referred to the fact that the Tribunal on Prices had discovered these remarkable facts with regard to costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That again is a case of defective communication, obviously. I want to come now to the definite recommendations of the Tribunal.  A definite recommendation was made that the Prices Board should prepare a table of prices of standard-grade, straight-run flour to which the maximum price for the delivery of bread should correspond (page 53).  I do not know that it is necessary to have a Prices Board to prepare that.  I think it could be done by the Statistical Branch of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  There is no Expenses Table drawn up by the British Food Council.  Although that Council have not the powers that I should like to see a Prices Board enjoying, and though, no doubt, their figures would require to be adapted to local circumstances here, <Col N="1678" /> their figures would form a certain guide, and I think it would be possible for the Ministry to draw up a table of that character, so that the people might know what they ought to pay for bread, what was a reasonable price, and might know, when there was a reduction in the price of flour, how much the loaf should be reduced.  That would be of some advantage to them, and would not require legislation or any delay in the matter.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider, or consider again, his decision not to set up a Prices Board.  It need not be an expensive Board.  It would consist, as visualised by the Tribunal, partly of civil servants, a representative of the Statistical Department, a representative of the Department of Agriculture, and two or three honorary members; possibly one Deputy, one Senator, and one other gentleman, who would act without remuneration. A small Board of that character would, I believe, be very valuable in educating the public mind and, if they were given statutory power to obtain information, I believe they would do a great deal to make the position clearer. The Minister is justified in saying that there is a lack of interest in this matter, that people do not try to buy as cheaply as they might, and do not give evidence before Tribunals.  But the process of education is a slow one.  I believe that the Tribunal did something to educate the people, and I would be very sorry if its work ceased entirely and if nothing further was done.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Hennessy raised this matter.  I recognise that the Minister will have only a few minutes in which to reply so I will not take up too much time. Deputy Cooper's contribution is a tribute to the discrimination of the Cork people's taste, in the matter of their bread at any rate.  It is generally admitted that the Cork loaf is the best loaf in the world.  There is no question whatever about that.  I want to say this much, that as far as prices are concerned I understand that the conditions are that even though the price of flour may fluctuate that would not make any difference whatsoever in the price of the loaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be very brief, at any rate <Col N="1679" /> I do hope that the Minister will in his reply indicate that he will do something in the way of setting up a prices board or something like that so that the price of the loaf would bear some relation to the price paid for the flour.</P>

      <P>It might, but I did not come here prepared to give any decision on the question of a Prices Board except what I gave in April, and it is quite unsound to expect me to give such a decision now.  With regard to the relation of the price of bread to the price of flour, the answer to-day stated that I did not consider that at the present moment a <i>prima facie</i> case was made out against the master bakers on the matter of excessive charges for bread.  If we take the figures quoted by Deputy Hennessy as the price at which flour was listed and the price at which it was bought, then the prices <Col N="1680" /> quoted by Deputy Hennessy are quite in line with what is set out in page 33 of the Report of the Food Prices Tribunal. If the Deputy is taking merely the Food Tribunal Reports and taking the present prices of bread and the figures he quoted for the price of flour for a period of months, and taking further what they say in the Report, that the decrease in the price of flour must be in operation for some time before the decrease in the price of bread may follow, then he will find that there is nothing to complain of in the price of bread in the Saorstát at the moment. I am not speaking of Cork particularly. If the Deputy had proved to me that there is an average of ninety-four loaves out of the 280 lbs. sack, he would have gone a step further in the matter of investigating than what the Food Prices Tribunal was able to go.</P>

      <P>As I say, the figure quoted by the Deputy did not take into consideration the sliding scale in page 33 of the Report.  The present <Col N="1681" /> prices of flour and bread are such that there cannot be said to be a case made for excessive charges for bread by the master bakers.  The cost of living figure has been brought into this.  Possibly though it is not more than ordinary special to this case, it might be giving education to the public in this matter to say that the cost of living and the cost of living figures are too distinct things.  There is no relation between them.  It is no such simple relation, at all events, as people believe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hennessy said that if you take the ordinary family in a household, consider their circumstances and see what quantity of food is bought in the week, one must naturally look to the increased prices, and people will take the view that the information supplied by the Statistical Department is not accurate.  I said that at that moment I would agree with him, but my view would be contrary to what Deputy Hennessy's view is.  The cost of living figure in this country is a fictitious figure.  It represents not what the British cost of living figure represents, namely, the present price for a certain group of articles as compared with the price of those same articles in 1914.  That is what the British figure gives.  Let us see what our figure gives.  Let us take a family in certain circumstances and see what it was living on in 1914.  Take, then, the changed conditions in 1920 and 1921 when the standard had risen considerably, and then take the present prices as compared with 1921.  It represents not merely the cost of living increase, but the standard of living increase, and the things are entirely different.  When our cost of living is compared with the British cost of living, that has to be remembered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further thing to be remembered. If one were to take merely the British conditions and consider the peculiar ratings of certain items in our lists, the difference would be diminished by about five points.  If one gives to the same ratings the British values of certain items, the cost of living figure is almost identical with the British figure.  These items are not at all understood, and the British cost <Col N="1682" /> of living figure is mentioned simply as some measure with regard to living now as compared to 1914.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with the portion of the Report which touches on the 1925-26 cost of living figure, when the flour used by the Dublin Master Bakers was costing an average of 49/- per sack?  It is pointed out that when the flour used by the Dublin Master Bakers is costing an average of 49/- per sack the price of elevenpence per quartern loaf is equitable and would be equitable as long as the price of flour remained between 47/- and 51/- per sack.</P>
