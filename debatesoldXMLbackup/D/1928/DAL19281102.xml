      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long in the discussion of this Estimate.  But there is one point I would like to raise upon which I would like to have some information from the Minister.  In reply to a question which I put down regarding the raid upon Roebuck House recently, the Minister admitted that Roebuck House had been searched by a party of police under a warrant at 10.30 a.m. on the 25th October.  He then went on to say that the officer in charge, having notified Madame Gonne McBride that they were about to raid the house, and having been informed by her that Mrs. Despard had met with a very serious accident on the preceding night, the party carried out the <Col N="1433" /> raid without interfering in any way with Mrs. Despard and that, as a matter of fact, the ambulance did arrive and Mrs. Despard was removed while the party of police were in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Madame Gonne McBride has made a statement to me regarding this occurrence and part of it at least is in direct conflict with the statement which has been made by the Minister. The Minister stated that the raiding party had already arrived and were engaged in carrying out the search when the ambulance which was to bring Madame Despard to the hospital reached Roebuck House.  Madame Gonne McBride, on the other hand, states: &ldquo;When the ambulance drew up at my door, I went out to give the doctor's instructions to the attendants. I then saw twenty men emerge from the trees near the gate and run over the grass to the ambulance.&rdquo;  Now there is a very important conflict of statements there.  It is important, if we are to ascertain what was the real motive and the real reason that inspired this raid, to know if the raiding party were in the house before the ambulance arrived, or, if the ambulance reached the house first, whether the raiding party directed their first attention to the ambulance?  That is a point upon which I think we are entitled to require some proof from the Minister that his reply was founded upon fact.  In view of the fact also that the Minister said that the search was carried out upon a warrant, I should like to know under what Act that warrant was issued, to whom was it issued, by whom was it issued, upon what ground, and the date and the hour upon which it was issued.  It certainly seems more than a coincidence that that raiding party should have arrived after the ambulance had reached Mrs. Despard's house.  We have the Minister's statement, on the one hand, that the raiding party reached the house first.  On the other hand, we have Madame McBride's statement that the ambulance reached the house first.  It is very pertinent to the ascertainment of the motive for this raid to determine which of those statements <Col N="1434" /> is correct.  If the ambulance reached the house first, if the raiding party arrived afterwards and directed their first attention to the ambulance, what was the conclusion that was to be drawn from that?  What was the suspicion that actuated that raiding party and what were the grounds of their suspicion?  Were they acting upon information that the St. John's Ambulance, the official ambulance, had been ordered to attend at Roebuck House at 10.30 on the morning of the 25th October?  And if so how did they receive that information?</P>
    <P>We were told in this House recently that the Post Office did not interfere with private correspondence.  We were very sceptical as to that fact, and I think some information was afterwards placed before the House which, at any rate, made the statement that correspondence was not interfered with open to doubt.  I should like to know whether the same supervision which is exercised over the mails is also exercised over the telephones, and whether the fact that a telephone communication had been sent asking that the St. John's Ambulance should be sent to Roebuck House at 10.30 o'clock on the morning of the 25th October was the information upon which that party of police acted?  And, if so, why did they act in that manner?  What were the grounds for that raid?  Was it a deliberate act of State persecution?  This lady is an elderly lady who has secured worldwide regard for her work and sacrifices in the cause of humanity.  She came to Ireland in the days of the trouble here, and notwithstanding the fact that all her family affiliations were on the other side, espoused the cause of the people in Ireland and nobly served it.  She met with an accident, and surely the least that lady is entitled to expect from the people whom she has served to the best of her judgment and to the utmost of her ability is that she should be treated with common humanity.</P>
    <P>One of the things which we want the Minister particularly to direct his reply to is to explain to us, or to prove to this House, first of all that that raid was not intended to harass and persecute her in the hour of her suffering; and, secondly, that it was not inspired <Col N="1435" /> by an unjust suspicion that the ambulance was intended to remove some other person.  If the Minister had suspicions that that ambulance was to be used for any other than its ostensible purpose, to remove the injured lady to hospital upon medical instructions, then I think he is entitled also to show to the House upon what grounds he suspects the St. John Ambulance Corps of being a party to such a proceeding. The ambulance was either there to remove Mrs. Despard or some other person, or some other thing.  I think that the Minister is entitled to disclose to the House the grounds upon which this raiding party, when it reached Roebuck House, directed its attention, not to the house, but to the ambulance.</P>
    <P>I think we are further entitled to demand of him that he will prove to the House that the statement which he made in his reply is correct&mdash;that the ambulance arrived while the search party were already engaged in raiding the house.  In order to do that, I submit that the Minister must disclose to the House the Act under which the warrant with which that search party was armed was issued, the grounds for that warrant and the date and hour upon which it was issued.  I think we are entitled to know that, in order that we may be able to satisfy ourselves that this warrant was not issued in virtue of something which was communicated to the Minister by some person who had access to the records of the Telephone Department.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I wish to deal with, and that is the statement which was made by the Minister for Agriculture.  I regret the Minister is not in his place, because we on these benches are beginning to acquire a certain affection for the Minister.  We regard him as one of our most effective speakers.  He is a delight to listen to and a delight to follow.  But he made a statement in the course of this debate upon which I would like to have the opinion of the Minister for Justice.  In the course of the debate on the Army Estimate, the Minister committed himself to the statement that this Government was raising the sum of £1,600,000 odd in order to ensure that certain <Col N="1436" /> people would have the right to do wrong.  He was so pleased with the <i>bon mot</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister was so pleased with the <i>bon mot</i> that he repeated it in the course of this debate, and he said, though this time he was slightly mixed, that one or other of these forces is maintained in order to ensure that certain people will have the right to do wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Power to do wrong. There are some things which will bear repetition; there are other things which will not bear repetition.  I suggest that that statement of the Minister for Agriculture is one of these.  It has been twice repeated from the Government Benches, and I wish to know whether the Minister for Justice endorses that statement.  It seems to be an authoritative one, but it may have very serious consequences in the country.  The Minister for Justice is charged with the effective administration of certain laws which the Minister for Agriculture has put before this House.  There is a Forestry Bill, for instance, which the Minister for Agriculture has introduced and which imposes certain very stringent penalties upon people who venture to cut down their own trees without a permit from the Minister for Agriculture.  So severe are those penalties that in the other House, I believe, an amendment was introduced limiting the power of the courts to impose penalties in this regard, and limiting the amount of those penalties to £100, I think, in the case where it could be proven that the thing was not wilfully done with knowledge. What would be the position of an individual who finds himself penalised to the extent of £100 under an Act introduced by the Minister for Agriculture as a result of a prosecution presumably initiated by the Department of Justice, who has in mind the statement twice repeated from the Government Benches, and presumably endorsed by <Col N="1437" /> the colleagues of the Minister for Agriculture, that this Government is spending something like one million and some odd hundred thousand pounds of the people's money in order to ensure that the people shall have the right to do wrong?  I am sure the unfortunate individual who is fined £100 for cutting down trees without the permission of the Minister for Agriculture will feel that after all he is getting very poor value for his money and is securing a very small share of the benefit of that one million and some odd hundred thousand pounds if he cannot in a minor way, to the extent of cutting down his own trees, exercise this power to do wrong which the Minister for Agriculture has informed him is secured to him by the expenditure of public money to the extent of one million and some odd hundred thousand pounds.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself was unable to define which of the forces was securing to the people the power to do wrong; but either the Army or the Guards, according to the Minister, have secured that power to the people, and one or other of them is costing the State and the people £1,600,000 or £1,800,000.  I think we are entitled to have from the Minister for Justice either a clear endorsement of the Minister for Agriculture's statement or a clear rejection of it.  He must either accept it or reject it.  Apparently the Minister for Agriculture at the present moment is in so little favour with his colleagues in the Government that even they refuse to take him seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the Labour Party upon these Estimates is a peculiar one. We are entitled to have a little further information from them, I think.  A few days ago this House was discussing a motion in the name of Deputy Tadhg O Murchadha asking this House to express the opinion that provision should be made for pensions and allowances for widows and orphans. The Minister for Finance asked the House to reject that motion upon the grounds that in order to make it effective it would be necessary to provide £750,000 from the public purse.  It is quite clear from the revenue returns for the past eight months that it is not <Col N="1438" /> possible to secure that £750,000 required to provide pensions and allowances for widows and orphans except by imposing increased taxation upon the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>If those pension allowances are to be granted by this House, they can only be granted as a result of corresponding economies which must be made in the public services. Yesterday the Labour Party voted in support of Vote No. 10 for the Office of Public Works, and by doing so they endorsed the principle that one man is entitled to hold two jobs and to receive pay from two sources for carrying out work which can only be done in the time of one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party must face up to facts in this matter. If they want to carry out their social programme there must be corresponding economies made in the public services, and those services in which public money is being wasted must be curtailed and drastically overhauled. There is no other way out of it.  If we want to provide pensions for widows and orphans, then we have got to save some of the money that, we contend, is at the present moment being squandered wastefully.  There is no middle way.  You cannot impose another penny of taxation on the backs of the people.  You have got to reduce the staffs in your public services by cutting out, and dispensing with, every inefficient and useless man.  Now there are, and there must be, a considerable number of useless people in the Civic Guards.  That must be the case, because, according to the statistics&mdash;and they cannot be controverted&mdash;it takes almost twice as many policemen to preserve law and order in the twenty-six counties of Ireland, per head of the population, as it does in England and in Scotland. If you consider those figures it is obvious that there is great room for retrenchment in regard to this particular service.  If that retrenchment can be carried out&mdash;and the statistics show that it can&mdash;and if we can reduce the <Col N="1439" /> strength of this force to a figure comparable with that of the police force in England and Scotland, then I think that any Party which takes responsibility for putting before this House a motion asking the Minister for Finance to make provision for pensions and allowances for widows and orphans is bound to vote against this Vote, and to see, or declare at least, that it is their wish that economies will be made which will provide the money to enable them to make their social programme effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance started a bad precedent yesterday by telling a story.  If the House does not mind, I am going to give a quotation. Taking one consideration with another, &ldquo;a policeman's life is not a happy one.&rdquo;  That used to be the case some years ago.  I am sure there is no Deputy in the House who will admit that he has not read Kickham's book &ldquo;For the Old Land.&rdquo;  Deputies who have read the book will remember in it the story about the seizing of the pig.  It has been known to history since as the Glenmoynan pig.  The bailiff whose job it was to seize the pig took one of the guards in his day to do the job for him. I think Joe Sproule was the name of the guard, and anyone who has read the story will remember his agonies in driving the pig to the pound.  In those days a policeman's life was not a happy one.  The bailiff's life would seem to be a more happy one, like Murty McGrath's in the story.  This is apropos of the cost of such seizures now.  I have had brought to my attention the case of a poor man in the County Roscommon who was in arrears in the payment of his annuities to the Land Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I will show that in one second.  I hope to satisfy the Minister, too.  This cow was seized and sold for £6.  Only 12/6 out of the £6 went to pay a share of the man's debt, because the full amount realised was almost entirely eaten up in paying the Guards' expenses.  Amongst the Guards' <Col N="1440" /> expenses was the cost of a motor car. That was one item in the bill.  Their expenses reduced the amount realised so much that only very little was available to meet the man's debt.  I kicked up a row with the Land Commission about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Abair aris é ma's é do thoil é.  I did not read it at all.  I was told it by a responsible official in the Land Commission.  At all events, all that was available for this unfortunate man after his cow had been sold for £6 was 12s. 6d.  When Joe Sproule seized the pig he had to foot it with the pig to the pound, but these gentlemen get motor cars, the expenses for which are taken off the unfortunate people.  I see in the Estimate that transport expenses are estimated to cost £56,500.  I admit that I have not gone very carefully through the Estimate. Surely the amount taken off the unfortunate man that I am speaking about for the cost of the motor cars for the Guards must be over and above what is provided in this Estimate for transport.  Therefore I put it that the expenses should not be charged twice. A somewhat similar case occurred in Connemara, where an unfortunate man had his cow and calf seized to meet a decree.  The animals were seized by the bailiffs, but this man, instead of having 12s. 6d. credited to him, had only 7s. 6d. credited to him to meet his debt to the Land Commission.  The police were the main cost of the expedition in that case too.</P>

      <P>Since those days the working men, when they wanted to refer to a man having a good job, said: &lsquo;Oh, he has a bobby's job.&rdquo; That is the last word with ordinary Dublin working men when they want to describe what a really good position would be.  At all events, this sum of £56,000 odd is something to go on with.  I was told the other day by the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1441" /> when I put a question to him that the 250 Civic Guards who went to Rome paid their expenses out of their own pockets.  My information was to the contrary, but I suppose I must accept the explanation I got and that they did save the money themselves.  I made a certain statement with regard to the C.I.D. during the prisoners' debate in this House some time ago.  I said then, and I still say, that this force was never intended for a police force.  It was got up for one purpose alone, and that was to make sure that the civil war would not be allowed to die out.  I say it was got up for no other purpose.  I had occasion to bring up the case of a friend of mine, Peadar O'Donnell, as to the way he was treated.  The Minister at the time had no explanation to give in regard to that case.  But I believe he had as much then as he has now.  He simply got out of the case by what I suppose would be called parliamentary astuteness.  I think that is the correct word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fact remains that cases like those of Peadar O'Donnell and Mick Noonan, and others too numerous to mention, are proof that this Government have done all they could to ensure that civil war would not die out.  It is in spite of any efforts of theirs if it has done so.  The ordinary policeman here is, I believe, as good as the ordinary policeman in any part of the world. At least, that is true of any I have met. They do their duties as well as the policeman in any other country.  I do not begrudge them having a bobby's job.  I do not think that it is fair to include in the police force these other people&mdash;the irregular police who are the real authors and the continuers of the civil war.  I remember well that the first public case they had was a very badly framed-up bank robbery charge in Arklow.  In that case the Dublin magistrate had to reprimand the officers concerned.  That was in 1922. The Minister for Justice at that time, I suppose, was only just beginning to have some incipient ideas of what he might come to himself.  He is only just <Col N="1442" /> beginning to feel his way in the political world, I imagine, and he may not be familiar with the case to which I have referred.  That was the position when that section of the police started, and they have kept up that practice. That charge does not apply to the ordinary police.</P>
      <P>I now come to the question of the number of Civic Guards and Civic Guard barracks.  When I was speaking on the Vote for the Office of Public Works I was told this was the proper Vote under which to raise the matter. I think a good case could be made for reducing the number of Guards in sparsely populated places.  I admit that in big centres of population, owing to the increased traffic and the various duties the police have to perform, you want a good number of Civic Guards, but in the country districts with the transport facilities modern science has provided there is no occasion for so many barracks.  We will be told there might be irregulars, or people like the gentlemen referred to last night, who have to be hunted, but the special squad of the C.I.D. are engaged in that work.  If any disturbance occurs in those areas a good telephone service has been provided by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, so that the police can be immediately summoned, and they have motor cars to take them to the spot where they are needed just as quickly as if they were stuck in those out-of-the-way barracks.  There could be a considerable reduction in the number of these smaller barracks, and that would also mean a reduction in the number of Civic Guards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are barracks where there are only two Civic Guards, and as I suppose one of these must be in charge of the other, that means in barracks of that type you have a sergeant.  By doing away with these, good economy could be effected.  There are places in the country where there may have been barracks in the remote past, but certainly not for a good many years before the Great War occurred.  I have heard of a number of instances, and I am sure Deputies on the other side know of some also, where barracks have been put up in outlandish places.  In one instance the only reason that occurred <Col N="1443" /> to me for putting up barracks was that in that particular area during the last fighting a column was able to keep on fighting.  That was simply a matter arising out of war, the area being suitable for that type of fighting, but this is a peaceful area, and there is no occasion for putting police there, except it might be for the purpose of fanning the flames of civil war again.  There is no occasion whatever for a police barracks in that district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KILLILEA</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words more or less in reply to remarks made yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture.  He said that only for the Civic Guards he would not be able to address public meetings, and, of course, he told us the Army was here to see that people had a right to do wrong, and that the Civic Guards were here to see that the people had a right to do right.  I think he cannot have it both ways.  If the Minister for Agriculture goes out and starts calling people rubbish and weeds he cannot be surprised if the people turn around and say things back to him.  If it is the duty of the Civic Guards to prevent people making remarks in answer to him, then it is the duty of the Guards to stop the Minister when making remarks of the kind I have mentioned to the people.  I would mention an incident that happened in Ballygar. One night Deputy Broderick was addressing a meeting there.  An innocent chap was standing outside his own door.  After the meeting was over a number of C.I.D., who were, as they say, &ldquo;half jarred,&rdquo; went around the town. This chap who was standing outside his own door was delicate, and he had not been outside his house for six months before that.  He was the only man they saw.  I admit that the meeting was a bit rowdy.  They went over to this chap and they kicked him for two hundred yards along the street.  We called at Deputy Broderick's place to see if he could do anything, but he was not seeing anybody that evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another incident, even worse, happened at a Labour meeting in Woodford. I had an experience myself in a place called Creggs.  I was making an attempt to address a public meeting <Col N="1444" /> there.  One of the principal hecklers tried to make a bit of an attack on me. I do not know whether it was in his favour or not, but he did everything possible I believe, but he did not do anything creditable to the Guards or C.I.D. at that meeting.  Of course, there is nothing about that.  I had occasion to waste £1 3s. on the day of the election in sending wires regarding the conduct of the Guards at different polling booths.  There was nothing about that.  Those men were never checked for it.  As a matter of fact I could not get a reply to any of the wires I sent.  A short time ago I raised the question regarding a mail car raid in a place outside Tuam.  The houses of prominent supporters of ours were raided, not once or twice or three times, but the raids went on for months, and there was no raid on any of the houses of the Government supporters.  The Minister said, of course, that the Guards did not know what the politics of these people were.  We asked the Minister to give us the names of even one supporter of the Government whose house was raided, or one instance where a house was raided that was not the house of a Republican supporter. Of course, he said that was not his duty.  Personally, I have nothing to say about the Civic Guards.  I am one who does not care a whole lot about them. I will admit that frankly.  They have duties to perform and they should carry out those duties.  But in outlying stations we have Civic Guard barracks with three or four men in them.  In these places there is no danger of the people going wild&mdash;they are quite calm. The only little bit of excitement would possibly be during election time.  If the Minister for Agriculture gives the people an idea of his policy, or shows that he is inclined to help the people, they will not say anything to him.  But if he and I start abusing the people, we deserve to get whatever comes to us.  I support the plea put forward to reduce the Gárda, and I hope the Minister will keep a closer eye on the way they carry out their duties.</P>

      <P>I also am opposed to this Vote on the grounds that the amount of money asked is altogether <Col N="1445" /> too large, as we can do with a smaller force.  Like Deputy Boland, I know of country districts where there are as many barracks as in the old R.I.C. days, when the country was particularly unsettled as a result of the land agitation.  I refer particularly to County Galway.  At that time, around Athenry, the country was dotted with police barracks, which were of course necessary owing to the land agitation. But the land question is practically settled.  There is a certain amount of dissatisfaction still, but nothing like the dissatisfaction of that time, when the agitation was against the landlords. They were very plentiful in Galway at that time&mdash;a lot of them have left since. Notwithstanding that, in practically all these places there are Civic Guard barracks to-day.  Around Athenry, practically every R.I.C. barracks is now occupied by Civic Guards.  That, to my mind, is not at all necessary.  There are Civic Guards stationed in peaceful districts where there is never any disturbance. They are unnecessary, because, as has been stated, there is splendid telegraphic and telephonic communication to centres like Ballinasloe, Athenry, Tuam, Galway, etc., and the outlying country districts do not need Civic Guard barracks.  The Guards have very little to do in these places, and a considerable reduction could be made, and ought to be made, particularly in view of the statements made on the Army Vote.  It was made plain from both sides of the House that the Army for defensive purposes was practically useless in case of invasion and that it was more or less a police force. We do not want a second police force. I believe that those who said that the Army was practically useless as a defence force spoke honestly.  Certainly if any Power attempted to invade the country it would be very easy to beat five or six thousand soldiers.  If the Army is only a police force, as was stated, there should either be a reduction in the Army or the Civic Guards, and, as we are discussing the Civic Guards Vote, I press for a reduction of that force, as the present number is not necessary, especially when it is claimed that the country is peaceful.  As far <Col N="1446" /> back as twelve months ago we were told of the peaceful state of the country. At election meetings I heard very prominent people say: &ldquo;Who gave you the right to walk freely about the country; to go to a fair and come home with your money safe without fear of anyone taking it from you?  We have established law and order and everything is quiet and settled.&rdquo;  If conditions are quiet and settled, we ought to be able to do with a smaller force than was necessary to bring about that condition.</P>
      <P>I do not like harping too much on the statements of the Minister for Agriculture or making too much &ldquo;bones&rdquo; about them, as they say in society circles.  The Minister for Agriculture stated that he received valuable assistance from the Civic Guards, and as a result was able to address election meetings.  He is quite right.  He certainly did receive valuable assistance. He received so much assistance from them, and he was so &ldquo;stiff&rdquo; as a result of that assistance, that he could stand up and slander people at election meetings. I am sorry he is not here now. I hope he will come in before I finish. I should like to tell him of something he did say.  The Minister for Agriculture, with Deputy Broderick, was addressing a meeting in Athenry during the September election and made a statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Agriculture said that, as a result of the assistance received from the Civic Guards, he was able to address public meetings.  He is quite right.  I want to point out the difference between what occurred in his case and what occurred in mine.  When he was speaking he slandered me, and I state here definitely that he got his information from Deputy Broderick, who is at present in the House.  Under the protection of the Civic Guards the Minister was able to make that statement in my absence.  When I reached Athenry I heard of the statement, and afterwards wrote both to the Minister <Col N="1447" /> and Deputy Broderick to come to the next meeting that was being held under the auspices of the Fianna Fáil Party and make the same statement, if they were able to prove it.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the most important point.  I issued that challenge off the platform.  I said if the Minister did not prove the statement I would not allow him to hold his meeting&mdash;that I would go on his platform. A C.I.D. sergeant from Ballinasloe, named Harmon, who was in the crowd, stated in the presence of another man that if I attempted to do it he would take my life.  That is what the C.I.D. and the Civic Guards are for.  It is nothing to laugh at.  We know what election times were, if other Deputies do not.  Some of them, like the Minister for Agriculture, could go round and say what they liked, but we could not.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the prejudiced action of the Guards. Deputy Broderick was present when a Civic Guard assaulted a man at a meeting.  The Guard was not reported. He was considered to have done his duty because he was protecting Government speakers and keeping them in power&mdash;&ldquo;The right to do wrong,&rdquo; from our standpoint, anyhow.  We know very well what they are capable of.  If there was less money available, there would be less of this kind of work.  The Gárda should realise that they are the servants of the people, and that everybody in the country has to pay for their upkeep and their maintenance; they should not be allowed to do things such as I have described. I suggest there should be an investigation held into the conduct of the Gárda on these occasions.  If the <Col N="1448" /> Government want any information I am quite willing to supply names and the particulars of the actions of which they have been guilty.  I ask for a reduction in this Vote, because we are told that the Army is only fit for police purposes.  We do not want two police forces.  We have an Army or we have not, and as long as the Army is described as a useless force which would be no use in the case of invasion, I suggest that the Civic Guard force should be very much reduced.</P>

      <P>I wish to put a matter to the Minister which I would like him to deal with when he comes to reply.  On the 17th October, I addressed a question to him in connection with the regulations governing the storage of petrol.  As a result of inquiries made before putting down that question, and since, I am satisfied that there is grave neglect on the part of the Gárda authorities in this matter and that petrol is being stored in tenements in this city with a consequent danger to life.  Of course I am not so much concerned about property.  The lives of the individuals who occupy the tenements should be the concern of all of us, although apparently the only light in which they are considered useful is in so far as they can produce the amount to pay the rent.  I think it is a disgraceful thing that the Gárda Síochána should have to wait for orders from local authorities before taking action in this matter.  The Minister undertook to supply a list of the number of prosecutions under this head.  I received this morning the following letter:</P>
      <P>With reference to the question which you asked in the Dáil on the 17th ult., regarding the regulations for the storage of petrol, I am directed by the Minister for Justice to state that a report has now been received from the Gárda Síochána from which it appears that the local authorities have not availed to any great extent of the services of the Gárda in enforcing this Act.  Only one prosecution has been instituted by the Gárda on behalf of local authorities since the 1st January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> I submit that that indicates clearly there is great looseness on a matter of vital importance, and I should like the Minister to explain or endeavour to defend that action.  Here is a commodity from which a substantial amount of revenue could be gained, but, as a result of this looseness, revenue is lost to the State.  We have excellent activity on the part of the Income Tax people where workmen are concerned. There is no question of their being able to evade the responsibility for income tax, but the people who store petrol in every hole and corner of this city certainly evade their responsibility.</P>
    <P>These are the two points which I wish to put.  I did not, as a matter of fact, intend entering into this discussion, and were it not for the fact that I received this letter, I would not have done so; but when I received this letter I thought it my duty to bring this matter to the notice of the House.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Gárda Síochána, as a whole, so far as the uniformed force is concerned, I think as a body they are certainly, in the main, a fairly decent type of police force.  But &mdash;as some other Deputies have stated here&mdash;there is that auxiliary corps known as the C.I.D., and I think it would be well for Deputies and the people of Ireland generally if some light could be thrown upon the policy and the object for which that force is being maintained.  I believe&mdash;and I am sure I voice the opinions of my colleagues in this matter&mdash;that money is being spent lavishly on this force, not for the purpose of detecting or preventing crime, but for the purpose of furthering the interests of a political party in this country, and for the purpose of keeping alive political strife. The Minister smiles; but I honestly believe that; and from what I have seen of the activities of this force, I certainly think they are operating not for the good of the community.  Deputy Jasper Wolfe was good enough to stand up here last night and adopt the rôle of defender of the police force in all its works and pomps.  But the memory of the Irish people is not so short that they cannot recall that Deputy Jasper Wolfe, as Crown prosecutor, <Col N="1450" /> was proud to defend the predecessors of this force at the time of the murder of the late Lord Mayor MacCurtain.  I think it would be just as well for the Gárda, or the non-political element in the force, that Deputy Jasper Wolfe should reserve his encomiums for something else.  It is not a credit to the force to have a man with the record of Deputy Jasper Wolfe paying them tribute.  These are the two points upon which I would like the Minister to give me some information&mdash;first as regards the petrol regulation; and, secondly, with regard to the necessity for maintaining this secret service establishment at such a huge cost to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my quota to the appreciation, by certain Deputies, of the work of the Civic Guards.  I think the country should be thankful to the Guards for the work they have done.  In 1922, when they were sent out to the country, they had what appeared to many people a formidable task.  The country was in an absolute state of chaos.  The robber and criminal had a free hand, and the people of that time were of the opinion that the country would never settle down again.  I think that a general tribute should be paid to the Guards because of the state of affairs we are living in to-day.  Every Deputy in his constituency receives complaints about slight abuses by the Guards.  I know there is hardly a week goes over but I receive some kind of a trivial complaint from people in my constituency.  I find they can all be adjusted by approaching the superintendent in my area, and I believe if that were done generally the state of affairs which the Fianna Fáil Party wish to bring about would be reached sooner than by criticism of the Guards in public.  They compare the strength of the police here with those in England and other countries. Might I suggest to them that if there were less public criticism of the Civic Guards we would have better appreciation of their work by the people and, in consequence of that, in a very short time probably less Guards would be required to keep peace in this country? I would not have taken part in this <Col N="1451" /> debate at all were it not for the statement of Deputy MacEntee this morning. Deputy MacEntee is very difficult to follow at times, but this morning his imagination seemed to have led him very far afield.  He stated that he cannot understand the attitude of the Labour Party, the spokesman of which introduced a Bill asking the Minister for Finance to provide pensions for widows and orphans.  I can understand that.  Deputy MacEntee does not, and never will, understand the attitude of the Labour Party.  He is not in touch with the facts that the Labour Party are.  It is a lot easier to understand the Labour Party voting for Estimate No. 10 than Fianna Fáil voting against No. 11, which provided £600,000 for badly needed work in the country. If Estimate No. 11 were defeated yesterday it would mean that drainage works all over the country would be stopped.</P>

      <P>You ought to know, because you practise it such a lot. Complaints have been made about the number of Guards.  I pointed out a way by which that force could be reduced. I think it should be taken into consideration that the Gárdai have been provided with a great deal more duties than the old R.I.C.  Every man knows that there is a greater demand to-day for regulation of traffic.  A few years ago any kind of traffic regulations were unknown outside Dublin, Cork and Waterford, but we know that there is a general demand to-day for police to guide the traffic.  We also know that in consequence of the Street Trading Act, passed some time ago, that police are required in that direction. <Col N="1452" /> There is also a great deal to be done by the Gárdai in connection with school attendance.</P>
      <P>To come back to Deputy MacEntee's statements again, he suggests that in order to provide money for pensions for widows and orphans, the Labour Party should vote against this Estimate. I cannot see why this should be done.  The Labour Party are not, at the dictate of Deputy MacEntee because he says the police force costs too much, going indiscriminately to cut everyone down.  As I said at the beginning, I want to add my quota to the appreciation of the Guards, and I believe, if there were less public criticism of them, they would have the help of our people to suppress crime.</P>

      <P>I desire to emphasise what has been referred to by Deputy Davin, that the Guards should pay more attention to their functions as inspectors of food and drugs.  There is another matter of very great importance. In my area we are entirely dependent for our bread supply on the City of Derry, and it is delivered by rail or by motor vans.  I suggest it is the duty of the Guards, as inspectors under the Food and Drugs Act, to test the weight of the loaves sold and to see that people are supplied with four pounds and two pounds in each loaf.  I have already spoken to the local officers of the Guards, but they have not paid any attention to this matter.  I consider it is a very important matter for the people in our county, who are supplied with machine-made bread from the City of Derry, that they should get the weight that they are paying for.  I ask the Minister to see that directions are sent to the various officers throughout Donegal, for the whole County of Donegal is dependent on Derry for its supply of bread, to see that the loaves are tested.</P>

      <P>I have just a few remarks to make on this Vote.  Enough has been said already on the Civic Guard Vote, and I do not think there is anything for me to mention.  I wish to ask for the assurance of the Minister that in future there will be no victimisation of any guard or sergeant who <Col N="1453" /> acts impartially during an election or at any other time in discharge of his duties.  A lot has been said of the partial attitude of the Guards during the late elections in September.  I know of two instances of two station sergeants who refused to take any part in the election or to co-operate with the local Cumann na nGaedheal leaders. Word was sent round that these men were to be dismissed.  It was known in the villages that these men were to be victimised in some way because of their attitude in the election generally.  On the day of the election both station sergeants were confined to barracks, and afterwards one was moved to the midlands and the other one hundred miles away.  I know these men were impartial and took no part in the election. I hope in the future when station sergeants and others stand out and act fairly towards each party that they will not be victimised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my views also as a protest against this Vote.  I remember a few years ago that in our national organisation at the time we aspired to have a largely reduced force if we obtained what we were fighting for, namely, national freedom, which we are now told we have got.  In my experience in the country, however, the police force has not been reduced to any appreciable extent.  I know a place where there never has been a police barrack at any period but where they are now building one at a cost of £1,450.  If we assume that there will be a sergeant and four Gárdaí in that barracks their salaries will approach £1,000 a year. The locality is a poor one and I know that if that money were capitalised and invested in the district it would be a great boon, such a boon, in fact, that the people never aspired to having.  Why a police barracks is placed in such a position I cannot understand, because the people there have been exceptionally law-abiding. If it is with the idea of establishing block-houses, such as we had when the <Col N="1454" /> R.I.C. were here, I think we can all admit that they would be of even less use than they had been to the R.I.C., so far as their services of protecting a Government that would be in power or any party that would have to use them during a fight.  It is utter folly to use them and to distribute them, as they have been, throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In the Estimates which I have before me and, of course, they are the same for every Deputy, that for the Gárda is for £2,000,000 this year, all but £46,672.  Why £1,000,000 has been harped on by almost every speaker I cannot understand.  If it is a mistake on my part I would like it to be explained. I think it needs some explanation, that is, if my figures are correct as against the sum quoted by the Minister and others of £1,631,000. During the debate I also found that the services of the Gárdaí have been generally boosted for their heroism. We do not deny that they are of great service in the country, but I hold that their services have been boosted to a large extent.  I know that in my town there was a fire and although there were five or six Guards in the locality it was almost over before they came on the scene.  They never gave any service in extinguishing that dangerous fire in which a lot of goods were damaged.  According to the Press, however, the Guards were the only people who gave their services. As a matter of fact, some young men risked their lives in extinguishing the fire but they got no credit for it.  I have heard cases before about the heroism of the Gárdaí, but they were really not entitled to credit.  Boosting them in that way is not right.  They should get what they deserve but not more credit than they are entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to item N.&mdash;&ldquo;Telegrams and Telephones &mdash;£14,600.&rdquo;  I believe it is unnecessarily high, and I know that one of the reasons that it is so high is the extraordinary activity on the part of the Gárdaí in tracing people who are travelling through the country, people of a particular view.  I discovered that quite accidentally when going to West Cork three or four weeks ago. When I arrived at my destination I <Col N="1455" /> was told to my surprise by the proprietor of the hotel where I was stopping the name of every village through which I passed on my journey.  What particular interest the Gárdaí took in my journey I do not know, but I was definitely told that in each village that I passed through the Gárdaí phoned to the next village, and in that way my peaceful journey was notified to the police.  That is not the only thing. When I arrived at my destination there were two gentlemen in plain clothes waiting for me.  I do not know what the Minister would call them but the proprietor of the hotel informed me that they were awaiting my arrival. As it happened, I had some trouble with the car and my journey was unnecessarily prolonged.</P>
      <P>I may say that this statement is purely for the information of the Minister and is not intended by way of carping criticism.  These two gentlemen were in the hotel drinking until after 1 o'clock in the morning.  The proprietor informed me that that occurred almost every night.  He said that he had great difficulty in getting these men out of the bar, and that as long as they were there there were usually others along with them, although it was a breach of the law. I am merely pointing that out for the Minister's information.  I would like him to investigate the question of telephoning calls from from one village to another.  If the Gárdaí at my destination had asked me where I came from and what villages I passed through I could have given them the information. From my experience it strikes me that any person of any political party, outside Cumann na nGaedheal, is traced very minutely throughout the country.  That would be some explanation as to why telephones and telegrams cost the country £14,600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Gárdaí themselves, I am not going to join those who have generally complained about them.  Rather would I join with Deputy Boland in saying that so far as I personally am concerned&mdash;and I said it at the termination of the elections&mdash; the Guards are quite impartial.  I am <Col N="1456" /> not saying that because a certain tone has been introduced into the debate, but because I made that statement publicly at the close of the elections in County Dublin.  There is just a small point to which I would call the Minister's attention, namely, item M, in reference to the escort of children going to industrial schools.  I have been approached on this by the Brothers in Artane.  They asked me to raise the question of sending uniformed men as an escort for these children.  This, of course, will not affect the Vote in any way.  They suggested that perhaps the Minister would be able to arrange to send an escort in plain clothes.  It is purely out of consideration for the parents and children that the suggestion is made, and those in charge of industrial schools consider that the presence of a uniformed escort is unnecessary.</P>

I could not raise the matter yesterday as there was no time for Private Deputies' business.  I am reported in yesterday's &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; as having referred to &ldquo;Kingstown&rdquo; harbour. The word &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire&rdquo; was purposely taken out of my question and &ldquo;Kingstown&rdquo; inserted in its place.  I protest very strongly against the action of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; in persistently going to the trouble of changing the official name of Dun Laoghaire to Kingstown.  It certainly speaks very badly for those who criticise us, when we speak about the Irish language and other things, and who call us cranks and extremists, when they deliberately go out of their way to change the word &ldquo;Dun Laoghaire&rdquo; to &ldquo;Kingstown.&rdquo; I also consider it as grave disrespect <Col N="1457" /> towards the laws of the Free State, because the Free State Government actually went to the trouble of officially bringing in a Bill which included a change to this name Dun Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday I ventured to put before the House a few reasons why this Bill should have unanimous support, on the grounds&mdash;First, of its desirability rather than its necessity; and, secondly, that a competent knowledge of the Irish language can be used as a machine by which ability can be tested just as well as any other subject which is or is not compulsory.  As a matter of fact, ability to learn a language is in itself a test of intelligence.  On that occasion I asked that Deputies who would vote for this Bill should not feel that they voted for it because they would thus prevent what a previous speaker called the return of the British Empire.  It is desirable that we should forget all those things which existed before the English left this country. We are in quite a new position now; and the fact that we can sit here to-day, debating whether or not in a certain number of years persons who enter a certain profession should have a certain knowledge of the Irish language, is proof, if proof were needed, of the change that has come over the country.  In that respect I hope it is not improper to refer to a report that I saw in a newspaper published outside the area of jurisdiction of the Saorstát, according to which an important and responsible person in the Northern Parliament is alleged to have said: &ldquo;What is this Legal Practitioners Bill but another attack on the Protestant religion?&rdquo; I want to say that it is not an attack on the Protestant religion.  The very fact that some of the ablest leaders and supporters in the language movement belong to that persuasion is, perhaps, itself a sufficient answer, but there underlies and exists as a corollary to <Col N="1458" /> that the idea that, if persons in this country raise any matter of a popular nature, it is at once meant as an attack on Protestants.  I think Deputy Teirney referred to raw material for persecution with regard to these people.  Protestants living within the area of the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann must not look upon themselves on every occasion as raw material for persecution.  I am sure they do not, and that the Minister in Northern Ireland who made that remark would really serve the Protestants of this State better, and possibly of his own, if he refrained from referring to the system of government and the treatment of the minority here, until at least he and his Government give to the minority in that part of Ireland the freedom and equality which his co-religionists get here.</P>
      <P>This question of compulsory Irish has nothing to do with religion.  It is only a few weeks ago that I was speaking to a parson in Toronto.  I am not quite sure what particular brand of Protestantism he preached, but we spoke Irish.  He learned his Irish in Trinity College, Dublin, and he told me that he was very pleased to see that when the Irish people got the opportunity of restoring the language they availed of it. He said that notwithstanding the big difference between the two of us in matters of religion, in matters of tradition, and matters of association generally, there was one thing in common which nobody in the room&mdash;and there were several hundred people in it&mdash; appreciated, and that was the Irish language.  The restoration of the language as a means towards unity is a thing which should not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Thrift who referred to the desire of the world to get from the Tower of Babel idea, and the necessity as a result of the conquering of distance to remove other barriers.  I think the fact that space is conquered, and that travel between nations has become so easy, as well as the introduction of the cinema, and the reproduction in this country of pictures made, I do not <Col N="1459" /> know where&mdash;especially, I would say, in America&mdash;instead of being arguments against this Bill are arguments in favour of it.  We still hear an attack on what was called Anglicising influences. I believe that there is, even in this country, a danger of being over-Americanised. Even the people in England themselves fear that.  Much more should we, and the study of the Irish language would be one barrier against over-Americanisation.  So that Deputy Thrift's argument with regard to the Tower of Babel is entirely the other way.  As distance is being conquered we must put up barriers to protect us against the evils of that conquest of distance.  The other chief argument against the Bill is the fact that neither of the two professions were approached when it was being introduced. I think the proposer of the Bill explained the cause of that.  He said he was not quite clear as to who was responsible for the education of the students, and I am sure he can tell the House that when this Bill goes into Committee both professions will be accorded the respect which not only he but every member of the House wishes to give them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill, which is, to my mind, a plain, straightforward measure in compliance with the general policy of this Government and with what is likely to be the general policy of any future Government. First of all, we must recognise the fact that Irish is the official language in this country.  That fact seems to have been overlooked by most of those who spoke in opposition to the Bill.  Other reasons given against the Bill were that the two bodies concerned &mdash;the Benchers and the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;were not consulted before the measure was introduced; that it may inflict hardship on the parents of budding judges; and also that it may affect the general education of the boys and girls of the future.  I fail to see that the first objection is an argument against this measure.  I am long enough in public life to remember that certain people have always closed their eyes to what was happening around them, that they adopted what I might <Col N="1460" /> call an ostrich attitude to new movements that came along, and in every instance that that policy has been adopted by those who at the moment were in power, they found it to be the wrong line, and they failed to see that it would afterwards swamp themselves. I do not know if that was so in this case, and I would be unjust to the Incorporated Law Society and the Benchers if I said that they adopted that policy.</P>
      <P>But at first glance it would appear that, if that is not their attitude, they have failed up to this to recognise the importance of the language.  That fact is emphasised by a document I have in my hand.  Since it started to legislate this House has printed its enactments in Irish; this House has actually supplied to the Incorporated Law Society and the legal schools textbooks that are supplied to no other profession, by which those who are going on for the legal profession have at their hands, without the expenditure of one penny, the means which will enable them to become proficient in the language of the country.  They go into the Law Library, they have the books there, any student who has a groundwork of Irish can follow them, and while he is reading and learning Irish he can also be learning the law.  That is an argument that, I think, the Benchers and the Incorporated Law Society cannot resist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the objection on the head of hardship on the parents, I fail to see that there is anything at all in that objection.  One subject is to be prescribed by the State for our future Judges, and one subject only, and the study of that subject will mean a competent knowledge of the language of the country.  I fail to see why any parent should object to that who intends to send his son to the Bar, and so far as I can see that argument is a very poor one to put forward.  I do not like introducing religion into any debate, here or outside, but Deputy O'Sullivan quoted a Minister in the North of Ireland as having said that this was an attack on Protestantism.  That is not so, and if I might follow that up, without touching on religion, I will say that those people who are strenuously opposing the Irish language, whom I <Col N="1461" /> might call the last ditchers&mdash;men who fight to the last&mdash;when they find that their opposition is unsuccessful will be the very first people to see that their sons and daughters are proficient in the Irish language, because it will mean jobs and preferment for them in the future, and they know the road.  No hardship will be inflicted on these people, but, as I said, they are last-ditchers who will fight to the very last against anything that they dislike, but when they are beaten they will see that they are in for the plums of office when the time arrives.  As to the hardships which this will inflict on the law schools, I have heard a good deal of talk to the effect that the law schools will be depleted, that the students will go somewhere else.  That cannot hold water.  But what hardship will be put on students in the law schools, of whom presumably at least 90 per cent. will have got a fundamental knowledge of Irish before they go to read for the profession?  No hardship will be placed on them, and it is not at all likely that the law schools will be affected by the introduction of Irish as a compulsory subject.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this case, and it was brought home to me very forcibly during a recent visit which I paid to one of our courts.  I happened to drop in when a rather interesting case was being argued, and it brought home to me very forcibly the necessity for the members of the Bar to have a working and a competent knowledge of Irish.  This case turned on the spelling and pronunciation of the language, and I venture to say that there were not two&mdash;perhaps not one&mdash;of the men engaged in that case who had a rudimentary knowledge of that language.  If that is so to-day, before Irish is a compulsory subject, what will happen in the future?  These cases will frequently be coming into the courts, and it will be absolutely essential that our lawyers should at least understand the Irish language so that when points arise they should be able to put them clearly to the witnesses, the judge and the jury.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, in his very admirable speech, gave us some little <Col N="1462" /> idea of what exactly is expected from a student entering the Kings Inns.  He said it is not even essential for the student to know English, but that what is really required of him is the study of law.  He did say that it was necessary to know a little Latin.  Possibly, for example, it will also be necessary for him to know that it is not good form to eat peas with his knife or to take soup with his fork.  That is also one of the subjects that are necessary to get him to the Bar.  But what hardship is going to be inflicted on this learned profession, who have only to know a little Latin and then study law, if they be required to possess in addition a knowledge of the language of their own country?  I fail to see how there is any hardship imposed on them.  There can be no objection to this Bill so far as it deals with the Bar.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Incorporated Law Society.  The students who intend to qualify and practise as solicitors must pass an examination which, according to this Bill, must be set by the Incorporated Law Society.  What objection can there be to it?  True it is that the Chief Justice is final arbiter as to whether they ought to be admitted as solicitors or not.  I think it was Deputy J.T. Wolfe who strongly objected to such a power being left in the hands of one man.  As the Minister for Justice said, that man does not ask for that power, and I am sure he would be very sorry if it were handed over to him. But somebody must decide.  The Incorporated Law Society have it in their own hands and, without anticipating events, I would say that it would be quite reasonable for the Chief Justice &mdash;if the section is to remain in the Bill placing that duty on the Chief Justice &mdash;to say to students seeking admission: &ldquo;You can pass the examination which the Incorporated Law Society have prescribed, and that will satisfy me as to your competent knowledge of Irish,&rdquo; provided always that the Incorporated Law Society deals with this as a serious question, and sets a standard which will enable lawyers to have what is described in the Bill as a competent knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say any more on the subject, except to compliment <Col N="1463" /> Deputy Conlon and Deputy MacFadden on introducing this Bill.  I also hope that although this is a private members' Bill we will find that it has very strong Front Bench support.  There is another aspect of this measure on which I would just like to say a word.  This is a private members' Bill.  It is my first experience in dealing with private members' Bills or in speaking of one of them that ever had a ghost of a chance of succeeding in this House. This Bill is setting a new example to private members to seek out matters of this kind.  Even if some sections in this Bill were objectionable&mdash;and there is not one that I would call objectionable &mdash;I would still consider myself in every possible way bound to support it because it is a private members' Bill.</P>

I <Col N="1464" /> do not know if he represents any portion of it, but I think as to the figures that he has given in connection with the Gaeltacht that I will be prepared to dispute them.  He says that in Donegal there are 52,000 and some odd hundreds of Irish speakers.  I suppose that figure is got from the census.</P>

      <P>I do not like to say much about the Gaeltacht Commission. The mildest form in which I can put it is that they were a band of enthusiasts who went down there to find a certain thing and they found it. Where did the Gaeltacht Commission get their figures of Irish speakers in Donegal?  I think I know as much about Donegal as any Deputy here and I defy any man to produce 52,000 Irish speakers or even 52,000 Irish speakers who can say anything more than &ldquo;Goidé mar tá tú.&rdquo;  That is about the extent of their knowledge of the Irish language, or the knowledge of those people that I came across during the last census.  I filled dozens of census papers and I asked the people did they speak Irish and they said they did.  I questioned them again and if they knew the expression for &ldquo;good-morrow&rdquo; or &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; in the Irish language, that is all they did know, and that is about all the Irish most of them have.  If those are the people who want Irish-speaking barristers and solicitors the whole thing is reduced to a farce.</P>

      <P>At the time I was interrupted, I had reached the stage of saying that the Gaeltacht Commission were a band of enthusiasts.  I would not go so far as to say that the dice were loaded before they went down there at all, but I would say this&mdash;that they were determined to bring in a strong recommendation such as they did bring in, and that they were determined to, and did find grounds for it. We know that when people go to look for a certain thing they will find it.  My experience&mdash;I do not give way to any member of the House in my knowledge of the Gaeltacht&mdash;has been that the Gaeltacht native speaker, the man who can speak no English, is almost impossible to find.  We are told again and again what a hardship it is on those unfortunate people to have to come into court and not be able to get a solicitor to interpret their wishes and to understand the fine points they make.  Well, the only occasion on which I have seen a witness sticking to Irish when it was known that he could speak English, and when it was afterwards proved that he knew English well and better than the Irish, was for the purpose of defeating the ends of justice, because the opposing side had no knowledge of Irish whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, I would like to refer to Deputy O'Hanlon's remarks about the Law Courts in Dublin.  Does the Deputy mean to say that the knowledge of Irish that would be necessary to enable <Col N="1466" /> a student to pass an examination to be called to the Bar, and to practise in the High Courts in Dublin, would put that barrister in a position to interpret the difficult and fine points of the meaning in Gaelic?  I do not think that knowledge would ever be acquired by members of the Bar in conjunction with their legal knowledge.  I think it would be impossible.  Matters of that sort have to be referred to very eminent scholars.</P>
    <P>As another instance of the difficulty of finding a native speaker, a good many members of the House receive invitations to various functions printed in Irish.  I have received several invitations of that kind, and I am very sorry and I take this opportunity of apologising for my neglect in not answering them.  I could not find in a hurry, within a reasonable distance, anybody to interpret them in parts of Donegal, and on occasions, when I have found interpreters, they have told me that the modern Irish is not Irish at all&mdash;that it is a mixed language. And yet we were told by a Deputy the other day that this is one of the purest and oldest languages in Europe.  If it is, then the others must be pretty mixed.  I took up an Act of the Oireachtas and I observed one side of the paper printed in Irish and one side in English.  Without any knowledge of Irish, I could certainly tell what the Act was about, because it seemed to me that fifty per cent. of the words are modern words borrowed from the English language and simply Gaelicised. Yet we are told that this is one of the oldest and purest languages in Europe.  I heard the other day of an invitation issued by a high dignitary in this country in Irish, and he invited his friends to a garden party. That particular invitation was translated. To show that the modern words are very largely put into use in the Irish language of the present day, the translation by a native speaker of the invitation indicated that it was to a meal in the other man's cabbage garden. That proves that thousands of words have to be made up in order to meet modern requirements.  Of course I quite agree with some Deputies that we should not have garden parties, because <Col N="1467" /> we are getting away from the spirit of the nation by having them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to a conversation that he had with a Protestant clergyman in Canada.  I had a conversation with a Roman Catholic clergyman in this country, an Irish priest who had been forty years in America.  The question of compulsory Irish cropped up, and he was very strong on the point that we should not persist in compulsory Irish, and his reason was that, for all the wrongs that ever Ireland suffered from England, she is more than compensated by giving the Irish peasant the English language when he goes to America.  He is there put on a level with the American citizen right away, and he does not lose ten years in acclimatising himself and learning the language of the country.  Another Deputy stressed a point which seemed to me ridiculous. He said there were arguments for the commercial use of Irish.  It always seemed to me that the strongest argument against the Irish language was that it had no commercial use outside this country.  It certainly has a commercial advantage in this country in the sense that it has a bread and butter use, and it is used for a bread and butter purpose more than it is used from the point of sentiment.  The day of sentiment has passed, but the day of bread and butter has come, and when a Deputy gets up and advocates that if we would be able to send out our invoices in Irish the exports of the country would increase enormously because of the fact that we would be recognised as a distinct nation, and that we had a language of our own, I think he is altogether on the wrong line.  The fact is that nobody outside of this country would be able to read the invoices.  The actual custom observed in other countries is quite the reverse.  The Germans send out their invoices to this country in English, and the English people send their invoices to other countries in Spanish, or in other languages, as the case may be.  If they did not do so they would not do very much trade.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to deny or confirm that statement.  One Deputy spoke in a rather bullying way to those who would dare to offer any criticism on the Bill.  It was what I might describe as a toe-the-line speech. I do not think that anyone now cares for that type of speech.  The day for that is gone, and well gone.  I think the time has come now when any man in this country, if he has a fair case to put up, should have freedom in order to put it up, let him be right or wrong. I would like to come to the cost of this compulsory Irish.  I am not in a position to say what the cost of compulsory Irish is, or the cost of the enormous amount of printing done.  I am not in a position even to estimate what it costs.  I would like to point out, however, that a very big lot of money is involved.  We had the other day from the Labour Benches a strong plea, which I would like to support, for pensions for widows and orphans.</P>

      <P>The amount of money that we are spending on this subject would help to bring relief in respect of <Col N="1469" /> many social services.  I can speak with authority on this, because I live near the Border.  It is constantly cast up to me by my neighbours that we can spend thousands of pounds on the Irish language, and yet there are many social services that are more needed.  They often ask me how it is they cannot get certain facilities and the people on the other side of the Border can.  It is very difficult to explain. If I said to them that we have to pay for the teaching and training of the children here in the Irish language they would probably point out to me how much more necessary the money was in other directions.  The fact remains that there is no red herring about this problem.  It is a solid fact that the money spent on the teaching of Irish would, if applied in that way, put the social services of this country in the position that they would not be behind the social services in neighbouring countries.  The people along the Border feel more concerned about some alleviation of the conditions there than they are with the teaching of Irish. They would prefer to see an alleviation of conditions connected with the Border. They would benefit far more if the money were spent in that way than they can benefit in spending the money on the teaching of Irish.</P>

      <P>A long and sad experience has shown me that no Bill ever comes up to the hopes of its supporters or to the fears of its opponents.  During the past week I have heard panegyrics upon this Bill which would be reasonably adequate to the achievement of Catholic Emancipation.  I have heard jeremiads which would possibly be exaggerated if applied to a penal code of the 18th century.  So moderate a speaker as Deputy Sir James Craig, with whom I find myself frequently in agreement, talked of this Bill as tyrannical. That may be a proper epithet to use, but only as the same word might be used with regard to about three-fourths of the activities of every modern State.  For the life of me I cannot see why it is more tyrannical to require of a law student that he should have a knowledge of Irish than it is to compel unfortunate children to spend long hours in school.  Personally, I am <Col N="1470" /> one of those eccentric people who, like Bernard Shaw, think that to imprison children for hours every day, especially children who are hungry, cold and wet, in our schools every day, is a monstrous interference with liberty.  In that perhaps I am eccentric, but where I am not eccentric is this: if I point out that in every other direction the State takes up the duty, rightly or wrongly, of interfering.  The State tells us what we may eat and what we may not drink. It is about to tell us, if a certain Bill passes, as I suppose it will, what, with the gracious permission of the Minister for Justice, we may be graciously permitted to read.</P>
      <P>I know that I shall be told that this Bill interferes with the rights of certain learned bodies.  I hope that I have a proper respect for a profession of which I am a humble member and with which I have a certain very dear hereditary connection, but I do not see how the State can accept, without reservation, the idea of imperia in imperio.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has already pointed out that this Bill does not dictate to those learned bodies what they are to do in the matter of legal education. What it does do is to say to the barrister or solicitor using our courts, &ldquo;You shall not practise in the courts unless you fulfil certain conditions as to a competent knowledge of Irish.&rdquo;  Therefore, it becomes a question not of what is lawful but of what is expedient, and we have Apostolic authority for saying that these are two very different matters.  Expediency is governed so surely by what is practically reasonable.  The position here is that I find myself disposed to be very doubtful about the case made by the promoters of this Bill.  What does seem to me is this, that one of two things must inevitably happen.  Either the standard of competence in Irish will be set so high as to make it practically impossible to attain or, on the other hand, so low as to become merely an ornament to the individual attaining it and of very little practical value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my friend Deputy Cooper, in the days when Irish was not so universally popular as it is to-day, I made a really strenuous and honest attempt to learn something of the language.  If I <Col N="1471" /> remember rightly, I struggled as far as the Fifth Book of O'Growney.  When I had reached that remarkable point, if I saw a lady coming down with an empty can in the direction of the well I was able to say to her in an execrable accent, which I suppose she did not understand, &ldquo;An bhfuil tú ag dul chun tobair?&rdquo;  And even to this day, when I find myself in a really crowded fair, with cattle charging in sixteen different directions, with the drover trying to anticipate them going into sixteen different places at the one time and attempting to prevent the cattle preceding him into sixteen different public-houses in the village, I say to the harassed man in a bland and endearing fashion, &ldquo;Tá an bhó óg.&rdquo;  But I am sorry to suggest that this remarkable attainment of mine would scarcely enable me to cross-examine an Irish-speaking witness in the courts.</P>
    <P>In my own district where I live, where, perhaps, unlike Deputy Myles, there are a large number of real Irish speakers than in his, I find it almost impossible very often, without the aid of an interpreter, to learn what some poor old man or woman is trying to tell me for the subsequent enlightenment of the Minister for Local Government on the subject of his or her old-age pension.  These are people who, whether they speak English or Irish, are only anxious that one can understand them.  Imagine the position of an ordinary young gentleman bred up on O'Growney and faced with an altogether unwilling&mdash;I have the greatest liking and respect for our Irish speakers, but I would not say that they are always entirely innocent of guile&mdash; witness in the courts and attempting to cross-examine him.  Of course, I may be wrong.  That may be because I only studied O'Growney.  Perhaps a course of study in one of the summer colleges or institutions where the living tongue is used might enable a young man, in a relatively short time, to obtain such a real acquaintance with the language as would enable him to make real practical use of it in his profession.  If that is so well and good.  If not, then it appears to me the thing will be simply a snare and a delusion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> I am not greatly impressed by the arguments of my friend, Deputy Cooper, that this Bill would inflict any great hardship either on young men or on their parents.  Quite apart from the provisions of this Bill, if I were a young man beginning life in this country and intending to live here. I should, in my own interests and quite apart from any higher consideration, certainly endeavour to obtain a competent knowledge of Irish.  Now this Bill is for good or evil.  Personally, I think it is for good.  This State is going to be at any rate a partially Gaelic State.  That is the declared intention of the Government, and of any Ministry that is likely to follow the present Government.  I am not going to follow previous speakers into a general consideration of the value or otherwise of the compulsory teaching of Irish in the schools.  <i>A priori</i> I should say that a bi-lingual child is likely to be more intelligent than a uni-lingual child.  I think that all experience, as well as theory, goes to show that if you awaken the intelligence for one purpose you awaken it for all purposes.  I am quite certain that the man or the woman who knows French and English is likely to be more intelligent and more awake to various aspects of life than the man or the woman who knows only one language.  I cannot for the life of me see why the same thing should not apply to Irish and English. Now, there are thousands of words, associations and habits which are hidden from us, or, at any rate, are only with difficulty comprehensible by those of us who are ignorant of Irish. I, personally, cannot help thinking that even a barrister or solicitor is likely not to be less efficient in his profession if his studies have spread themselves a good way beyond the strict narrow limits of an ordinary legal education.</P>
    <P>It may be that, having arrived as I have, rather slowly and in opposition to my first inclination, at the conclusion that I have personally no sufficient ground for opposing a Bill introduced by two esteemed colleagues, and which is in consonance with the general policy of this Government and of any Government likely to succeed in coming after it, I am influenced by <Col N="1473" /> the fact, sad and undoubted, and I am afraid too open and evident that I am myself over sixteen years of age.  I am therefore, able to take the impartial and detached view of the matter which was attributed by a poet some years ago on a certain famous occasion to an eminent writer, Mr. George Moore, when he came out in favour of the Irish language:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I've puffed the Irish language, and I've puffed the Irish soap, I've tried them on my nephew, with the best results I hope, For with this older, dirtier George I have no heart to cope.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Like some more eminent characters, whose names, if I recollect, were Tweedledum and Tweedledee, I can be assured that the rain will not fall on this umbrella.  I have, I hope, succeeded in my purpose in moderately annoying all the combatants in this discussion.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of this Bill, and although I am not it does not mean that I in any way wish to be-little the Irish language, or to pour cold water on those who are enthusiastic in fostering it, but I do not think compulsion is the proper way of fostering the language. Instead of fostering it, it may kill it. My views are largely those of Deputy Thrift, and I do not propose to have these re-stated.  There is something about this Bill which seems to me very curious.  When, as it is proposed, in six or seven years' time there will be many young barristers and solicitors with a competent knowledge of Irish appearing before a court, naturally these young men will be anxious to air their knowledge, but there is no provision whatever as to making those who are to hear them know the Irish language.  I think comparatively few of our judges and magistrates have a competent knowledge of Irish.  If there were a really sincere purpose in the Bill I think the proposer should have put some section in it making it compulsory that every judge and magistrate in six years time should have a competent knowledge of Irish, as otherwise I fail to see that justice can be properly administered.  I think <Col N="1474" /> Deputy O'Hanlon said that Irish was the official language of this country. That may be so according to the Constitution, or by an Act of the Oireachtas, but, and Deputy O'Hanlon knows that as well as I do, although Irish may be the official language it is not really the language of the country, and all the business of the country and of the Dáil is conducted in English. When I was seeking election for the Dáil a number of my constituents objected to any compulsion in the matter of the Irish language, and, therefore, I would not be doing my duty here if I did not express those views on the subject.</P>

      <P>I feel some diffidence in addressing the House on this subject, because I happen to have been a member of what Deputy Myles referred to as a band of enthusiasts.  Whether one is an enthusiast or not, one does not like to appear prominently in that capacity before the public.  I got some consolation from the latter part of what Deputy Myles said, for he went on to describe the difficulties in the fostering of the Irish language under present conditions, as the people are mainly interested in bread and butter. He will admit that I am at least a bread and butter enthusiast on this subject.  I must confess I feel neither a great deal of enthusiasm nor dismay about the whole question, because, like Deputy Law, I have some doubts as to whether this Bill will achieve all that its promoter apparently sets out to achieve.  On the other hand, I believe that the people who complain about the principle of compulsion in this whole matter are aiming their blow in a wrong direction, are fighting a battle already lost, and would be much better employed in devoting themselves to other aspects of this question of Irish in schools and Irish in general.  What I am afraid is likely to happen under the Bill is that you will get a situation in regard to the legal profession very much like the present situation in the universities.  Irish will be a compulsory subject for entrance.  Every entrant will have to pass a qualifying examination, but that examination will <Col N="1475" /> by no means ensure that the person who has passed it has a good spoken knowledge of Irish.</P>
      <P>Sometimes I find myself astonished at the attitude of mind of people like Deputy Myles, and perhaps even Deputy Law, who seem to think that a competent spoken knowledge of Irish is practically impossible.  They remind me of a famous Canadian humourist who joked in that strain about Greek. He said a friend of his used to read a page of Thucydides every night before he went to bed.  This humourist was very much offended at the boast, and he said he did not believe any one could read a page of Thucydides.  It looks as if Deputy Myles were in that position about Irish.  I do not see that the question of the number of Irish speakers there are in any part of the Gaeltacht has very much to do with this subject.  Even if there were only a few Irish-speaking people left in the Gaeltacht, it would still be the duty of any Government who had the interest of the country at heart to do all it could to foster and spread the Irish language.  As long as there are even half a dozen Irish speakers left it will be the duty of whatever Government is here to see that more speakers of Irish are turned out, and that everything possible is done to prevent the language dying out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opponents of this Bill make the statement that speakers in the Gaeltacht do not want Irish, and that there are not so many speakers of Irish in the country as there are supposed to be.  They are talking in a completely irrelevant manner.  The struggle on behalf of the Irish language will and must continue as long as there are half a dozen Irish speakers left in the country.  Apart from that, I fail to see what injustice is done to anybody by asking that he should have even a competent reading knowledge of Irish acquired in school.  That is what I am afraid this Bill will bring about in the case of lawyers, that though they will have acquired a reading or written knowledge of Irish, they will not be able to use the language in the Law Courts in the Gaeltacht.  Although it would not be more than half <Col N="1476" /> the full object of the Bill, still I would regard that as a very valuable achievement, for suppose Irish were to die, it would be still well worth holding that everybody in this country should learn Irish in some way or other as a written and spoken language.</P>
    <P>Except we are prepared to throw away all our history, and everything that has happened in this country up to a hundred years ago, I do not see how we can look forward to a system of education that will not include, as a compulsory part of that education, even a written knowledge of the Irish language.  This Bill will probably not succeed, for a long time at any rate, in doing any more than bringing that about; but I consider that would be well worth bringing about in the case of lawyers.  On the other hand, I am inclined to think that it would be possible to go still further than this Bill goes in regard to the Irish-speaking districts, and that we might even from the present time try to secure that in certain courts, in certain districts, no one from now on will be allowed to plead&mdash;I mean no lawyer who is at present beginning his education, I do not mean lawyers who are at present practising&mdash;that, after a certain date, no one will be allowed to plead in these courts in certain districts like Galway, and parts of Donegal, and Mayo, without being able to show that he had not only a competent written and reading knowledge of Irish, but a competent speaking knowledge as well.  In that way we would achieve a double object which I am afraid will not be achieved by this Bill.</P>
    <P>While I am all in favour of seeing that Irish is taught properly in the schools, even as a written and spoken language, it is more important to see that everything possible is done to keep the language alive where it is alive at present.  Except for the Church, and perhaps medicine, there is no activity which is of so much importance in this respect as the legal profession, because it is not only what actually happens in the courts that matters, but the fact that a great deal of what people read consists of reports of what takes place <Col N="1477" /> in courts.  If the business of these courts was carried on in Irish, it would mean that the news which people read in Irish-speaking districts would be, to a considerable extent, more in Irish than it is at present.  In that way you will be giving very valuable encouragement to people who have had no great reason for keeping the language alive, and who undoubtedly are not always enthusiasts in the matter, to do what they can to keep it alive where it is still alive.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole question of compulsion, as I said, those who deal with this matter always as a matter of compulsion are aiming their blow in the wrong direction.  There is no really sound logical argument against compulsion in the case of Irish, any more than in the case of mathematics or Latin.  It can be argued, just as in the case of mathematics and Latin, that compulsory Irish in the schools only achieves in most cases a very small result; that if it is not very well taught you only get a written and reading knowledge&mdash;you do not get a spoken knowledge.  If those who are opposed to compulsory Irish on alleged educational grounds will give up talking about compulsion and confine their attention to the methods by which it is at present being taught in the schools, and how far these methods may be improved, how far even a better written and spoken knowledge of Irish can be given, how far the cultural materials that exist in the Irish language can be used for educational purposes, they will be doing a great deal better work for the people whom they represent as well as the country generally. I have always believed, and I think I can speak with a certain amount of knowledge on the subject, that if Irish were properly taught in the schools, apart from the question of spoken Irish, it could have a greater value for the Irish people than French, German, Latin, Greek or any other cultural subject, except perhaps English. Even those who disapprove and think that at present things are going too fast, even those who have misgivings on the whole question, will be better employed in devoting attention to seeing that what Irish is taught is properly <Col N="1478" /> taught, that where, for instance, as is generally the case, it is not possible to get a perfect and competent spoken knowledge of the language from the schools, at least some educational and cultural value will be got out of the language.  My own misgivings have always been in that direction&mdash;that even yet we are not getting the fullest educational value that we might out of the language.  I do not think there is anybody to blame&mdash;I think the circumstances are purely to blame.  I believe if we could come to an agreement on that question we could leave the whole question of compulsion aside as being irrelevant, because we already compel people to do all sorts of things and we do not do them any great harm.  We could come down to discussing the methods by which Irish is taught, the results we are trying to achieve, and how far the methods we are using are successful in achieving these results.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this Bill somewhat supplemented, to see more attention devoted to the districts where Irish is still spoken, because I believe that the knowledge of Irish which will be achieved by the Bill will, unless great care is taken, be of very little use in Irish-speaking districts.  I do not say that out of the Bill it will not be possible, if care is taken, to get a spoken knowledge of Irish as a qualification, but what I am afraid of is that, as time goes on and the thing becomes more and more familiar to people, a standard qualifying examination will be set up which hundreds of students will pass every year and which will require another examination afterwards, and a much more rigid and stringent examination, to find out whether any of these students has a competent spoken knowledge of the language.  For that reason, we would be doing better, if we want to secure a spoken knowledge of Irish which can really be of use in court, if we added to this Bill some provision that in certain courts in certain areas a competent spoken knowledge of the language will be required after a certain time.  Even as the Bill stands, I am prepared to support it as a reform in our educational system, and in that respect I cannot see that the <Col N="1479" /> legal profession or its authorities have any complaint.  They have had five years in which to bring their legal education into line with the rest of the country in the matter, and if they have neglected to do that, it is high time that some other authority should bring them into line.  For that reason I support the Bill as a reform in education, and I hope either that it will be extended in the direction I suggest, or else that, when it is in operation, attention will be paid to secure that nobody will be allowed to practise after a certain date in courts in Irish-speaking districts unless he has not only a competent knowledge in the writing and reading sense, but also a competent spoken knowledge of Irish.</P>

The proceedings of a Special Committee are identical with the proceedings of the whole Dáil.  Amendments may be <Col N="1480" /> moved by members of the Committee.

      <P>I am opposed to this Bill.  I think it is born of enthusiasm and that it is likely to issue in mischief. I do not want to be unjust to Deputy Conlon, but I quote his words he said: &ldquo;I am not a legal man and I do not understand very much about law.  I am not concerned with the technical and the legal sides of this question and I am not concerned with the legal profession as such.&rdquo;  That is a confession that perhaps may disarm criticism to some extent, but it does not relieve him of the responsibility of introducing a Bill dealing with the most technical and thorny subject, the education of the lawyers.  There were many points in this debate on which I was tempted to rush in and talk.  The arguments surged to and fro, and it is very hard even now to find something like a secure anchorage, some point from which one might start.  I thought, perhaps, at one time that Deputy Anthony had conceived the situation as it presented itself to me. But I think the best analysis, an acute, deft, professional analysis, of the Bill was given in the speech of the Minister for Justice.  He touched upon two points that are not in the Bill and which make the Bill to me an undesirable measure at the present moment to introduce into this House.</P>
      <P>It was the Minister for Justice who pointed out so clearly that this Bill involves a new principle.  &ldquo;It is different,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from any other measure that has passed through this House because up to this compulsory Irish has always been associated either with a grant of Government money or with employment, the remunerations of which comes out of public or semipublic or local funds.&rdquo;  Again, the Minister pointed out that the Benchers could not make Irish compulsory. &ldquo;They do not educate in languages at all; they educate in law.&rdquo;  These two facts have been lost sight of in the whole of the discussion and I do not think that we ought to lose sight of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> We have been asked to look at the logic of the situation.  I admit that the logic of the situation is on the side of the supporters of this Bill.  By our Constitution Irish is the national language, but logic is a very bad rule to apply to life.  Logic often leads to disastrous legislation.  We should look not at the logic of the situation but at the facts, and at the facts in the present-day Ireland.  One speaker invited us to look at Bohemia, or at CzechoSlovakia or Esthonia.  I only want Deputies to look at Ireland, and it is a fact that at present in Ireland Irish is <i>de jure</i> the national language, but <i>de facto</i> English is.  I am not shutting my eyes to the fact that it is the aspiration and the intention of the Irish people to bring back Irish, but I urge that we should proceed in a reasonable and in a decent way.</P>
    <P>In a very enthusiastic speech that carried him away, however, Deputy O'Connell suggested that the opposition to this Bill comes from an environment of hostility.  Now, that is certainly not true of the people that I claim to represent; they do not live in an atmosphere of hostility to Irish as such.  I am an Irishman myself, and to me everything Irish, and particularly anything old in Ireland is very dear.  I am not a man to stand by and listen to anything Irish being sneered at, especially the Irish language; I never have. But I dislike, as an Irishman, anything like compulsion or intrusion, or any attempt to bully.  That tone is in this Bill, and I do not like it.  Even that tone entered into the speeches of some of the Deputies who have spoken.  The Minister for Finance indiscreetly, if not improperly, talked of forcing the hands of the benchers.  Another Deputy jocosely talked of this Bill as a piece of judicious persuasion.  I resent that. I think any Deputy in this House would resent that.  Another speaker went so far&mdash;I am sure, if he thinks over it in cold blood, he will be sorry&mdash;as to say: &ldquo;We all remember how Irish was killed in this country.&rdquo;&ldquo;Persecution&rdquo;&mdash;he used that term&mdash;it was that led to its disappearance, and he said he would go so far as to employ the same methods, even persecution, to restore it. That is not the way that a party of <Col N="1482" /> Irishmen should discuss this Bill, and think about it.  I do urge that Deputies have forgotten that this is a new Bill to deal with an ancient institution &mdash;I shall call it that&mdash;which deserves well of this country, and deserves at least, from the legislators of this country, a little courtesy.</P>
    <P>For the Inns of law we have are very old institutions, and old institutions have a little pride.  They are perhaps a little slow, a little touchy, but if they have done their work well they deserve a little regard, which I hold the promoters of this Bill have not shown them.  Irish jurists are known, and have been known, as competent and distinguished far beyond the shores of this country.  The Inns, as a teaching body, have done their duty, and their reward has been largely the good name of their corporation.  They have been proud because they have brought credit on this country by those great traditions. Some years ago I was in a building not in Ireland, and with some particular pride I saw four statues of the great jurists of that institution.  Three of them were Irishmen, who came from the Inns of Dublin.  It made me proud and, I think, would make every member of this House proud.  I think, to an old institution of this sort, one should show a little regard.  If the promotors of this Bill were so anxious that Irish should be part of the education of the future lawyer&mdash;it is inevitable it will be, because there is compulson of facts at work&mdash;so anxious that the Inns should take note of this fact, they might have proceeded in a more courteous and, I hope I am not wrong, in a less demonstrative and advertising fashion.  The Inns are an old institution.  They may be a little behind the times, but I think that the promotors of this Bill have not gone the right way about setting the works right.  They have acted, I think, like the watchmaker at the mad hatter's tea party.  The mad hatter discovered that his watch was two days wrong and he protested to the March hare, &ldquo;I told you butter would not suit the works.&rdquo;&ldquo;It was the best butter,&rdquo; the March hare said meekly.  &ldquo;Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,&rdquo; the hatter grumbled.  &ldquo;And you should <Col N="1483" /> not have put it in with the bread knife.&rdquo;  I am sure Deputy Conlon put the best Irish butter into the works of this Bill, but he put in a few nasty crumbs with it, those of compulsion, and he put them in, not with a bread knife, but with a bludgeon.  I do not think the results will be good, either for the Inns or the country.  What we should remember is the Inns are there to provide us with good jurists, to insure that we will have good lawyers.  I am not going to enlarge on what has been put before you by some lawyers.  They have shown you the damage that will be done to the schools by the fact that you will lose a great number of foreign law students who still come over, to my knowledge, a far larger percentage than the ten per cent.  Deputy O'Hanlon talked of.  To have a good school it is essential that you should have numbers, because the standard is set as much by emulation, rivalry, and contests of wit between the students themselves as by the lectures of their teachers.  The bigger the school, with certain reservations, the better the teaching and the higher the standard. You are going to diminish your law schools now by the departure of any student who might possibly think of getting the degree of Barrister-at-Law with a view to practising, not in this country, but probably in South Africa, or Australia, or who might want it for some professional purpose.  There was some talk of why we should educate men for emigration, but you are doing worse; you are going to make Irishmen emigrate to get education.  Our students, who will look for a bigger market, for a wider field, perhaps, will go to London or Belfast to get their legal training.</P>

      <P>I do not like compulsion. I do not think this compulsory Irish is going to be the foundation-stone on which you are going to build a united Ireland.  I know if you want to teach a person anything, you make him want to learn it first.  It is this element of compulsion that makes the subject distasteful to some inhabitants <Col N="1484" /> of the Free State.  You may say that it is from ignorance, that they do not know Ireland.  I admit there is a certain amount in that.  Teach them Ireland first; teach them their local history; then they will take a wider interest in things Irish; they will want to learn the language, and then you will find Irish going ahead.  Compulsion is not the cement of society or State.  It is good-will and understanding.  Those are the things I would like to be able to introduce into this country, and if it could be done by a private Bill I would be very glad to sponsor it myself.</P>

      <P>I listened with very considerable interest to the speech delivered by the learned Deputy, Professor Tierney.  He suggested that solicitors practising in the Gaeltacht courts should have a thoroughly practical knowledge of Irish.  I agree, and say it is most desirable that in the Irish-speaking districts of the Gaeltacht the people interested in law cases should have Irish-speaking advocates.  I go further and suggest to the promoters of this Bill that they should incorporate a clause or a section making it obligatory that the Land Commission processes for service in the Gaeltacht would in future be issued in Irish.  I am perfectly sure that if that suggestion is incorporated in the Bill it will bring great consolation to the inhabitants of the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I have certain views with regard to the provisions of this Bill.  It is necessary, and I am sure that it will be necessary.  I do not think it is going to impose very severe or extraordinary hardships on the young men studying for the legal profession.  It is very desirable that the native language of the country should be propagated.  I always held and maintained in this country that steps should be adopted for the preservation of the national language as have been adopted in Wales.</P>

      <P>The speeches against this Bill could be divided into classes.  There were speeches which those of us who are in favour of the Bill could listen to with considerable attention and considerable sympathy in an endeavour to understand the outlook of the opponents of this measure.  There were, however, other speeches of which we had one or two disgraceful samples and which only tended to breed resentment and perpetuate the differences which divide this nation.  We listened, I did particularly, with a good deal of sympathy to the speech of Deputy Sir James Craig.  We know that the outlook of him and his colleagues is very different from ours.  They have a different tradition behind them and they do not, for that reason, attach the same importance to the language question as we do. We are conscious of a great mutilation of the Irish language.  Though we are compelled by ignorance, and sometimes by want of practice, to speak in English in this House, we on these Benches, and, it is quite clear, the great majority of those on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, regard Irish as their native tongue.  From the point of view of language especially, we are typical of the great mass of the people who sent us here.  We do not speak merely as individuals.  We speak for the overwhelming proportion of the citizens of this country. We feel that in the past a great wrong was done to us and our nation and that that puts upon us the duty of doing our utmost to redress that wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in pursuance of that, and not because we wish to nullify one wrong by perpetrating another, that we feel that every encouragement must be given to restore the Irish language to its proper position.  We want to see our children growing up and learning the language of which we were deprived. We want them to be able to use it in every walk of life as their native tongue.  Therefore we do not desire that any section of the citizens, which by virtue of the statutes of the State enjoy a monopoly of certain <Col N="1486" /> things within the State, should be absolved from the obligation which, we feel, rests on every citizen in Ireland to make himself in all things a perfect Irishman.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this Bill is an attack upon the privileges or prerogatives of certain of the learned professions.  The professions enjoy a privileged position in this country.  They have a monopoly of power to do certain things but, as that monopoly has been granted to them by the State, the State is perfectly entitled to attach certain conditions to the exercise of such monopoly.  There is no undue compulsion therefore upon the Benchers or the Law Society if we in this Dáil decide that in the future the governing bodies of the legal professions in this country will accept in a practical way the fundamental principle of the laws of this country, that we are a nation and should have all the characteristics of a nation, and that therefore no man will be competent to practise one of the learned professions upon the citizens of the State unless he accepts to the full the implications of that citizenship. That is our position.</P>
    <P>Another argument has been used, namely, that, if Irish is to be made compulsory our people who are compelled to go abroad will suffer a severe handicap.  I do not know upon what ground that argument is based, but certainly the results of the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations during the past year do not in any way bear that out.  There we had the remarkable spectacle, so far as the Intermediate examinations, at any rate, were concerned, that practically all those schools in which instruction was given entirely through the medium of Irish headed the list in every case and secured practically 100 per cent. success in the case of all pupils presented.  There is no school in the Saorstát which uses English as a medium of instruction able to equal that record.</P>

That is the one thing that appealed to me when listening day after day to the statements that the enforcement of the rule concerning Irish was detrimental to education in this country.  Apart from that, I think the answer that we have to make to those who say that we are imposing Irish upon our children and that it is going to be detrimental to them when they go abroad is this&mdash; Why should we educate our children for export?</P>

      <P>Mainly, and chiefly, particularly in a country whose population has diminished from 8,000,000 to a little over 4,000,000 in two generations.  We are not overpopulated in this country by any means.  Italy is, possibly, a case where <Col N="1488" /> the growth of population exceeds the capacity of the country to maintain it, but I wonder what sort of shrift Mussolini would give to Deputy Byrne or Deputy Good if they went to Italy and addressed to him an argument similar to that which they are using here?  If they said to Mussolini: &ldquo;Ten per cent. of your people go abroad each year in order that they may be able to earn their livelihood in the United States where English is universally spoken. You must base your whole school curriculum upon the principle that every child in Italy has to be made an English-speaking Italian&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will leave that side of the question now and come to another matter.  I said there were two classes of speeches against this Bill, those which we could listen to with sympathy, and the arguments which we could attempt to controvert.  There is another class; there is the speech, for instance, which we heard from Deputy Wolfe.  Now, Deputy Wolfe has adopted an almost unique attitude towards this Bill, because he did not base his opposition to it upon mere utilitarian grounds, as Deputy J.J. Byrne or Deputy Good did; he took the matter to a far higher plane.  It was the ethical consideration that moved Deputy Wolfe.</P>

      <P>I am opposing this Bill because I believe it will not achieve the object it sets out to achieve&mdash; namely, the restoration of the Irish language.  I oppose it because I believe it is an absolute waste of time, and an unnecessary expenditure of money, to bring in any Bill of this nature at present.  I am one of those who believe in the restoration of the Irish language, and I am not going to do anything by word or act outside this House that would prevent the progress of the language. I know that Irish is the official language of the State, and that being so, it naturally follows that Irish is being taught in all the schools in the Free State.  We must, therefore, reasonably hope that within a period of, say, five or six years&mdash;the period set out in the Bill within which it will be necessary for students to have a competent knowledge of Irish&mdash;every boy and girl in the Free State will have a fairly competent knowledge of the language. That is why I ask what is the necessity of introducing this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposing the Bill because I believe that one of the greatest mistakes we make in Ireland in connection with anything we take up is over-enthusiasm.  We have not that perseverance which is essential to follow up a thing to the bitter end. We will simply pass this Bill, as far as I can judge by an overwhelming majority, and very little more will be done to encourage the use of Irish throughout the Irish Free State by any <Col N="1494" /> of the Deputies in their own constituencies. I oppose this Bill also because I resent with all the force at my command the taunt that the people opposing it belong to the West British type.  I very much resent that insinuation, because if I am a West Britisher in opposing this Bill there are, at least &mdash;and I emphasise this fact&mdash;7,000 West Britishers in County Louth at the present time who are prepared to support me in my attitude.  I believe there are thousands of Irishmen in the Free State who are as anxious as I am for the preservation of the Irish language, who will be opposed to this Bill for the simple reason that it means compulsion. Compulsion never succeeded in Ireland, and never will.</P>
    <P>I am more or less opposed to the Bill also because I think it is being introduced, not for the purpose of seeing that clients will have solicitors who will be able to converse with them in Irish, but simply as a measure of political expediency, with a view to future elections. Everybody knows&mdash;and they are slow if they do not&mdash;that the chief Opposition in this House are making progress as a result of making the restoration of the Irish language one of the chief planks in their programme, and as one of them very aptly remarked, the child of to-day will be the citizen of to-morrow.  I go further and say that the child of to-day will be the voter of to-morrow.  That is really the idea behind this Bill&mdash;nothing more or less than to clip the wings of the chief Opposition Party in the progress they are making throughout the Free State as a result of their advocacy of the Irish language.  Now, that is not a very honest way of meeting a big question like this.</P>
    <P>If, as is laid down in the Constitution, Irish is the official language of the State, it should have been the duty of the Government to bring in this Bill, and they should not have allowed it to devolve on a private member of the Government Party.  Am I to understand that the position is that certain prominent members of the Government Party who could not possibly hope to secure election without the aid of these West Britishers, as they are termed in this House, when the next election <Col N="1495" /> comes, can say, when they are twitted as regards their support of this Bill: &ldquo;You cannot criticise me.  It is not a Government measure, because it has only been introduced by private members of the Party,&rdquo; and when the same members are being taunted by enthusiasts as regards the restoration of the Irish language they can say: &ldquo;See now what has been done by members of our Party for the preservation of the Irish language.  Not long ago you criticised us for our delinquencies in regard to the restoration of the Irish language&rdquo;. That is not an honest way of dealing with such a very important subject as the restoration of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am out for the restoration of the Irish language.  I believe that the teaching of the language in the schools will not retard the educational progress of the children in the schools. It might be of interest to Deputies to know that I myself have spent five years in the study of Irish, and have at the moment a fairly competent knowledge of the Irish language, in addition to other languages.  The study of Irish is not retarding the progress of any child attending school.  I do not agree with those who opposed the Bill when they advanced that argument. The fact of the matter is that it more or less improves the education of any child to have it bi-lingual.</P>
    <P>I do say that compulsion will not secure the restoration of the Irish language.  The language will only be restored by long-continued efforts on the part of those who, by virtue of the position they hold, are the only people who will restore the language, and those are the teachers in the national schools, the Christian Brothers' schools, the secondary schools, and the great educational establishments that are scattered over the whole Free State. It will take time.  A lavish expenditure of money will not restore the Irish language.  It will take years and years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise the matter of the congestion that exists in the Ballinrobe district. My reason for raising this matter now is due to the answer that I <Col N="1497" /> received yesterday from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  I refer to his reply to Question No. 11 on the Orders of the Day yesterday.  In the course of his reply, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that no congestion existed in the townlands of Kilkeeran, Cloonliffen and Cloneagh.  I have here a list of the small holdings in one of the townlands in that area, that is, in Cloonliffen, and I will read it for the House.  The first is the holding of Tom Cusack, who has land in fifteen divisions. Before I go any further, I wish to say that the highest rental does not go beyond £5, and the total amount of land in the possession of any individual is small.  Here are the other holdings: Tom Madden, who has his land in 14 divisions; W. Killeen, 17 divisions; Michael Madden, 12 divisions; Pat Hession, 16 divisions; John Walsh, 22 divisions; B. Madden, 11 divisions; B. Killeen, 14 divisions; Kate Hogan, 9 divisions, and B. Feerick, 17 divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us why he stated that no congestion exists in that area.  Why did he say that the tenants have refused to accept land, or why did he make the implication that they refused all reasonable efforts made by the Land Commission in the striping of this land?  The Parliamentary Secretary did not state for what reason the tenants refused to sign the purchase agreements, but he practically stated, in the course of his reply, that nothing would be done for those tenants, and that their cases would not get any attention.  Would it be true to say that one of the tenants was refused any addition of land because it was thought that a relative of his would leave him another small farm?  This happened about ten years ago, and the relative from whom he was supposed to get the farm has not yet died.  The case in this particular area is very typical of the state of affairs on a lot of estates throughout the County Mayo.  The Land Commission have had several estates on their hands for years, and nothing has been done with them.  The tenants have not had their lands vested, the congested problem has not been dealt with, and no attempt is being made to meet the needs of the people. <Col N="1498" /> I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to answer straightforwardly why these lands have not been dealt with. Why has an exception been made in this particular district, while most of the portions of the Knox Estate in other districts have been, or are being, dealt with?  Is the statement I have made about the W. Killeen case true? The statement I have made about that case was that he was refused land on the grounds that the relative from whom he is supposed to get another holding is still alive.  This reason was given ten years ago.  I am happy to say that there is no immediate reason to think that this man will not live for another ten years.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us why he should say that no congestion exists in that area when I have read out such a list of appalling conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three cases in the other townlands on which I expect the Parliamentary Secretary will concentrate in his reply, while he will ignore the position of the majority of the tenants who have small valuations. He will concentrate on the large holders in the other townlands.  That is why I drew attention in particular to those cases.  He should investigate the position of affairs in that townland, and even in the neighbouring townlands, and he should state definitely the reason why a settlement of the land question in that particular area has been held back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in my reply yesterday to Deputy Walsh that there was no acute congestion on this estate. As a matter of fact, there is not any acute congestion on this estate.  This particular portion of the Knox Estate originally embraced some 7,000 acres, approximately.  All that land has been dealt with except the portion in the three townlands referred to in the question. The townland of Cloonliffen was striped about eight years ago, and the tenants have been approached on at least three occasions to accept the striping arrangement prepared by the Land <Col N="1499" /> Commission and sign agreements, but they have refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>They probably had a good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no reason whatsoever.  They admitted to the inspector that the striping arrangements were satisfactory, but they did not want to part with their present holdings. In the course of a supplementary question yesterday, Deputy Walsh said that a great deal of this land is in rundale lettings, and in order to give the people compact holdings it was the intention of the Land Commission to prepare a scheme to do away with the rundale lettings.  The tenants on three occasions have refused to accept the offer of the Land Commission, and until they are agreeable nothing further is going to be done for them.</P>
      <P>At present the land is let in grazing to smaller tenants in this particular townland and actually at the present time even the valuation of the smallest tenant in the townland exceeds £11. The tenants in the other townlands to which the Deputy referred in his question yesterday have valuations ranging approximately from £50 to £5 15s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>How many acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Two men in the townland of Kilkeeran have valuations of over £40, three over £20, three over the £10 standard, and all the others have valuations exceeding £5.  The land in this area is also let in grazing and I think it has been so let for the last six years.  These people have no grievance. Similarly in this instance the tenants have refused to agree to a scheme prepared by the Land Commission and until they do agree no further action will be taken.  The very same thing applies to the townland of Cloneagh.  A similar striped scheme was submitted and the tenants refused to agree to it.  It was submitted on three different occasions.  On the first occasion the tenants suggested certain alterations and amendments.  These were finally accepted by the Land Commission and when the scheme was again submitted to the tenants on two occasions they refused to have anything <Col N="1500" /> to do with it.  In addition to a scheme of rearrangement and subdivision the Land Commission offered very great inducement to a number of the smaller tenants in this townland to migrate to a neighbouring estate.  One man with a valuation of less than £11 in the townland of Kilkeeran was offered a holding with a valuation of £25 in the vicinity of the holding that he was asked to relinquish, but he refused to accept.  Similar offers were made to other tenants in the neighbouring townland and they also refused to accept.  In the circumstances what grievance can these tenants have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty tenants would scarcely refuse all the offers of the Land Commission if those offers were as good as the Parliamentary Secretary indicates.  The average tenant farmer in County Mayo is not a fool, and he knows when he gets a good offer; he knows whether it is good or not. Neither is he unreasonable, in my experience. I am quite convinced that when these men refused the Land Commission offers they did so for very good reasons.  If the case of the tenants was put side by side with the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary, I am quite convinced that the tenants would not suffer by comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to many other estates in County Mayo and other counties, too, where the Land Commission put forward schemes of rearrangement.  The tenants want to hold on to their present rundale lettings and they are not prepared to accept rearrangement schemes which would give them compact holdings.  We insist on the tenants accepting our schemes.  The Deputy and other Deputies also have pestered us over and over again to endeavour to get tenants to accept such schemes or go ahead with our rearrangement schemes.  The whole point is that the tenants want to hold on to the present rundale lettings.  We are not going to allow them to do that.  Until they accept our schemes that were submitted years ago, there is going to be no alteration in the present condition of affairs.  If the Deputy has any influence <Col N="1501" /> with the tenants he should approach them collectively or individually, and advise them to accept the Land Commission scheme.  It is the only way out of the difficulty.</P>

His claim was duly authorised for payment of 25 days' benefit in respect of the 25 contributions standing to the credit of his account with the Unemployment Insurance Fund and he was paid benefit in respect of the period up to and including the 3rd October.  It then transpired that Mr. Bradley was in receipt of home help and it was necessary, therefore, to make certain inquiries with a view to adjustments required by Section 14 of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1922 to be made between my Department and the Home Help authority.  The matter has now been settled, and Mr. Bradley will receive payment of all the unemployment benefit due to him at an early date.</P>
