      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether he is aware (1) that in the case of a recent local appointment in County Monaghan, where two of the three candidates belonged to the district, three local persons were appointed <Col N="1904" /> to act as a Selection Board; (2) that the people of the county, while satisfied that the Appointments Commission should make the choice, were utterly opposed to any local Selection Board; and whether, to secure greater confidence in the system of selection, other than local persons will in future be appointed to act on Selection Boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative; the Selection Board consisted of two medical practitioners with a chairman, all residents of Monaghan.  It has been the practice to arrange the venues for Selection Boards so as to suit as far as possible the convenience of candidates; and for such appointments as nurses and midwives it would be undesirable to confine the venues to the cities.  The Local Appointments Commissioners are satisfied that in all cases the work of the Selection Boards, local and central, has been carried out with the utmost impartiality. They agree, however, that where possible boards should not consist wholly of local persons, and consequently they will endeavour to secure that, outside the city venues, no board will consist exclusively of residents of the district in which the vacancy exists.</P>

      <P>The initiatory steps to put the section in force would be a matter not for me, but for the Dublin Union Commissioners, the County Council and the Corporation.  The operation in Dublin of Section 13, as <Col N="1908" /> has repeatedly been stated, has been shown by practical experience to produce much confusion and demoralisation and to react unfavourably in cases really deserving.  I am informed that in the administration of outdoor relief the existing machinery is sufficiently wide to reach all genuine cases of destitution and that efforts are made to investigate and deal promptly with all applications.  Some delay is inevitable if due caution is to be observed in the investigation of means and in distinguishing between deserving and undeserving cases.</P>

      <P>As we indicated at every stage of this Bill, we intend to oppose it.  Our main objections have been stated at length, and I do not know that any good purpose would be served by repeating them at this stage. From our point of view, the electors of the Seanad, if they are not to be the people &mdash; and we indicated why we thought it right that a change from that should be considered &mdash; should certainly not be more than one step removed from the people.  We were prepared to abandon, if you like, the method of election by the people, provided that the election of Senators, if you are going to have a Seanad, was going to be by those who were directly representative of the people.  Now, the Dáil could be regarded as the country in miniature; with the exception of one section of the people, the electors would be represented here, and, therefore, if we had an election by this House, we might expect that the results would closely approximate to what would be the results if the election were by the people as a whole.  But that principle <Col N="1913" /> is immediately destroyed when you allow Senators themselves to vote. When you remember that the Seanad consists of sixty members, and that the quota at an election would be somewhere about eleven, you realise that the Seanad is capable by itself of electing some five to seven Senators.  Then we object to it particularly because of the fact that the Senators who may themselves be candidates, could, as is proposed in one of these Bills, be allowed to vote at their own election.  We think that the number in the Seanad, if we are to have a Seanad, is much too large, and the fact that you are maintaining a large number is going completely to destroy the idea of having the Seanad representative of the people by election through this House.</P>
      <P>We tried, by various steps in other Bills, to get the Executive Council to modify its attitude with respect to the number in the Seanad and with respect to some of the points that I have just mentioned, and it has been in vain. Therefore, there is nothing left for us to do, seeing that our efforts to amend this Bill have all been without fruit, but definitely to vote against it.  That we propose to do.</P>

      <P>We want to make it quite clear what the position of the Labour Party is in regard to this matter.  I think that our attitude has been quite consistent.  We object to this Bill, as the Fianna Fáil Party are objecting, not only because the Seanad has the right to vote but also because the right of electing the Seanad is being taken away from the people. Deputy de Valera said that his Party would be satisfied if the power of voting were restricted to members of the Dáil, as you would get substantially the same results as if it were an election by the people as a whole.  We do not hold that view.  We think that there is a much greater principle involved in this question than that touched upon by Deputy de Valera.  It seems to us that it is quite wrong for this House to take away from the people what we regard as a fundamental right.  Our view is that so long as there is a Seanad it should be elected by the people, and not by the Dáil or by the Dáil and <Col N="1914" /> Seanad voting together.  For that reason we oppose the Bill at every stage.</P>

      <P>This is one of the series of Bills which have been introduced, as the President said, to implement and regulate the Constitution.  It is a bad Bill. It was, in the first place, carelessly drafted.  It was a hash and a mess, as the Minister for Local Government described another Bill.  It was patched up on Report Stage by trivial amendments, the necessity for which was overlooked in the haste in which the Bill was drafted and rushed into this House.  It contains a number of bad principles.  In so far as it proposes to take from the Seanad the obviously false claim which they could have heretofore advanced to represent the people, or any section of the people, it is not so objectionable as it might be in other matters.  Deputy Morrissey made some reference that the Bill is designed to terminate the method by which the Seanad is elected by the people. Deputy Morrissey knows that in the one example we have had of a Seanad election no such claim could be advanced as that the Seanad was in fact elected by the people.  There is certainly nobody in the Seanad who could claim to represent any substantial section of the Irish people.  The entire number of members elected on that occasion were elected on a 25 per cent. poll and under conditions which cast very grave suspicion upon the whole method of election.</P>

      <P>And the people indicated what they thought of the Seanad by refusing to come out and put people into it.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The same might apply in a number of cases.  The fact remains that if we can learn any lesson from the election that did take place it is that 75 per cent. of the people did not want to elect the Seanad, and if <Col N="1915" /> the Government were anxious to implement the will of the people they would introduce, not a Bill of this kind, but one to abolish the Seanad entirely. The attitude of our party has been made clear, namely, that if there is to be a Seanad it should be one which will not occupy a false position in relation to the people, but it should be a Seanad closely held by this Dáil and subordinate in every way to it. If the system of popular election is abolished, there should be a system by which Senators would be nominated and elected by the Dáil.  The proposal which gives to Senators the right to nominate and vote for their own successors is fundamentally bad.  The Seanad consists of people who, as I said, cannot claim to be representative of the people.  The majority of them were nominated and the remainder were elected from a nominated panel by a small minority of the people. They include amongst their numbers members of an alien Parliament, and to give a body of that kind the right to exercise considerable influence in the election of members to that body is something which no democrat, or anyone with any respect for democratic institutions of government, would tolerate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is contained also in the Bill the principle of secret voting in the Seanad election.  Not merely are members of the Seanad and Dáil to elect the Seanad, but they are to do so in secret.  The people are to get no indication as to how their representatives vote.  They are to be left in the dark.  If there is to be an election in this Chamber for the Seanad it should be by the open votes of Senators and Deputies.  They should be forced to come forward and indicate clearly for whom they are giving their votes. While there is, of course, adequate justification for secret voting by the people there is no justification for secret voting in this House.  We are supposed to come here as representing the people, as representing our constituents, and we should not be asked to do anything in secret.  Knowing as we do that this Seanad is getting increased powers and is being put into the position of being able to hold up <Col N="1916" /> for a long period Bills passed by this House, we should hesitate to have men put into that position of power as the result of a secret ballot.  The Bill will, no doubt, pass.  It has already gone through three stages and the same majority which put it through three stages will put it through the fourth. It will pass and subsequently it will become law if the Seanad are satisfied with the bargain.  We should clearly recognise that the Seanad are in the position of dictating their terms in relation to this measure.  The Seanad can, if they choose, hold up the Bill until an election on the present system takes place.  Thus we are not free agents in the matter.  This Bill has been offered to the Seanad as part of a bargain, the other part being the increased powers which are given to that Chamber.  As I say, the Bill will become law if the Seanad are satisfied with the bargain.  It does not matter what we think about it.  It is for the Seanad to be satisfied, and if they are satisfied, the newly constituted Seanad will be elected on the very undemocratic system provided in the Bill.  If the Seanad were a real live institution serving a useful function in the State there would not be a single voice raised on this side of the House to object to its election on a popular system.</P>
    <P>It is because the Seanad is nothing of the kind; it is because that in the Seanad are entrenched the standardbearers of Imperialism in this country; it is because the Seanad is intended to act as a brake on any national legislation introduced here, that we think that a strong case can be made out to justify the abolition of the system of popular election and the substitution for that system of a system which we approve of, election by the Dáil, but certainly not the system which is mentioned here.</P>
    <P>No doubt if the Minister for Finance says anything in conclusion&mdash;he said nothing in introducing the Bill&mdash;he will tell us that this Bill has got to go through as all the other Bills which were introduced here a few weeks ago have got to go through.  The Constitution has been strained; Standing Orders have been strained, all for the purpose of getting this series of Bills <Col N="1917" /> enacted by this House.  The motion which we had the other day in relation to Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, declaring it to be necessary for the preservation of the peace and safety of the State, was justified on the same grounds that the guillotine motion in respect to this Bill is justified. As the Minister for Finance said, having started upon these Bills, we have got to put them through.  He said it would be better never to have started them if they were not prepared to push them through by every device which suggested itself to them.  That is a phrase of which the Minister for Finance is apparently very fond, because I happened to be looking up some old debates in this House, and he used the same phrase on another occasion&mdash;on the 17th November, 1922, when there was a debate on the subject of the first executions.  He said: &ldquo;It would be better never to have begun asserting the will of the people if we were not prepared to go through with it.&rdquo;  Having begun asserting the will of the people in 1922, he made up his mind to go through with it, but something happened, which was not revealed to this House, and which resulted in asserting not the will of the people, but the necessity for enthroning an unrepresentative oligarchy in a position of authority in this State.</P>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera said, it is too much to hope that some ray of light will penetrate into the abysmal darkness of Cumann na nGaedheal in this discussion.  It is too much to hope that even at this late stage they will get a lucid interval, and it is probably no use in appealing to them or arguing with them.  The only thing they rely upon is weight of numbers in this House.  Having carefully weighed up the situation, they find themselves in a position to put the Bill through, irrespective of any arguments, and they find that there is no necessity to justify it. Relying upon weight of numbers, they are steam-rolling it through the Dáil. I notice that at some future date we will have a discussion upon a motion which deals with decorum and decency in this Dáil, but I do not think it is treating the dignity of this Dáil decently to have a Bill of this nature steam-rolled in this manner through it. If members opposite thought that this <Col N="1918" /> was a representative body, that this was a body to which the ultimate authority of the Irish people was delegated, they would not treat it in this manner.  They would attempt to advance some pretence of an argument before thrusting such a very serious constitutional amendment as this down the throats of Deputies.  I hope that those who realise that they are not bound hand and foot to the Cumann na nGaedheal chariot, and who are elected to come here as the upholders of the Constitution to the last comma, will do what they were elected to do on this occasion.  If they were not hoodwinking the people when they were elected, I think they have now an opportunity of upholding the Constitution in a particular item.  Surely they did not qualify their statements to the people and say that they would only uphold the Constitution in respect of Articles which were also being upheld by the Executive Council.  They qualified their statements in no way.  If they did not mean that they were going to uphold the Constitution, if they meant that they were going only to uphold those sections of the Constitution which all honest Irishmen are ashamed to read, let them say so the next time they are seeking election from the people and they will get their answer on that occasion. But if they want to uphold the Constitution, realising that they have the balance of power in the House and that they can defeat the attempt to tear up the Constitution now, they can do so, and I have no doubt that their constituents will be anxious to see how they vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very much touched by the appeal made by Deputies on the opposite benches, and by Deputy Lemass in particular, and I take the earliest possible moment to respond.  His appeal on the ground of constitutionalism comes home very deeply to me.  I think I am one of those who spoke a great deal on platforms about this matter.  I have had the advantage of listening with considerable care throughout the series of debates upon this and other allied Bills, and I notice that throughout certain theories underly the arguments from the opposite benches, no matter what the Bill or motion may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> Among others, Deputy Lemass has just indicated one.  There is the suggestion that when we speak of supporting the Constitution, we mean that the Constitution is therefore something fixed and sacred which can never in any sense or in any comma be altered.  The people whom we addressed must have known, and did undoubtedly know perfectly well, that one of the features of that Constitution itself was the freedom which the Oireachtas had left to itself for altering the Constitution within eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that throughout these debates there is an abstraction continually in the minds of Deputies opposite which is sometimes called &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nationalist forces,&rdquo; sometimes called &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; sometimes called &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo;  Now I really do not know what these things mean, if you are going to separate them from the individuals who make up the Irish nation, and if you do not separate them from the individuals who make up the Irish nation, then the Seanad itself is as much a part of the Irish nation as any of the rest of us.  I notice another assumption in these speeches&mdash;Deputy Lemass seemed to be abandoning it in his last speech, but it ran through all the other speeches &mdash; that somewhere or another there is in the people a passionate desire that they may be allowed to vote for this very body which Fianna Fáil wants to abolish.  I had the pleasure of listening to Deputy Hugo Flinn the other day, and in the attitude of the Emperor Napoleon, in the manner of a later Chatham, he told us that <Col N="1920" /> somewhere, somehow, some time the wrath of the people would vent itself on those dastardly creatures who were thwarting the will of the people, and that these forces would arise and slay us.</P>
      <P>I am sure our blood will curdle.  I suppose it is because I am an old, impenitent politician that I remain cool. I could not help remembering, in particular, what Deputy Lemass has just confessed with extraordinary frankness, that this passionate desire on the part of the people to be allowed to elect Senators was shown up at the last election when less than twenty-five per cent. took the trouble to go to the poll. This is the right which they value so highly that because we propose to take it away they are presently to arise and slay! Finally we are told that all Second Chambers are bad, but a Second Chamber not directly elected by the people is worse than bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going briefly to examine these two or three propositions, not in the light of the study, but in the broad daylight of practical experience.  I have already dealt with the suggestion that there is this passionate resentment on the part of the people against the removal of this particular provision.  I will say no more about that.  Let me take for a moment the other one: That a Second Chamber must be bad and that a Second Chamber not elected by the people must be very bad.  As to a Second Chamber being bad, that is purely a matter of opinion.  I can only say that I entirely disagree with Fianna Fáil Deputies about that.  I believe that in every country, and not least in this country, a strong, impartial, independent Second Chamber is of first importance to the good government of the State.  If there is to be a Second Chamber how are you going to get the best kind of Second Chamber?  I pay Fianna Fáil the compliment of supposing that if there is to be a Second Chamber they desire that it should be a good one.  Although some speakers left us in a good deal of doubt, I am sure that represents the more general view, and I am sure it is the view of Deputy de Valera.  If there is to be a Second Chamber, how are you going to get a good one?  I would lay this down to thinking men as axiomatic: <Col N="1921" /> Whatever is to be the character of the Second Chamber, there is one thing it ought not to be, and that is a mere replica of the First Chamber because it will be either of two things: If it is a weak Second Chamber, it will be subservient, and therefore useless; if it is a strong Second Chamber, being at the same time a replica of the Dáil, then it will be a dangerous rival. There are these two obvious difficulties about any general form of popular election for the two Parliamentary bodies in the State.  The Second Chamber will be either one or the other.  I do not think, as a matter of fact, that there is much fear of the Seanad here ever being, under our Constitution, a serious rival to the Dáil.  I cannot think that anybody can believe that.  There is a very real danger&mdash;there certainly would be a growing danger&mdash;if the present system were to be continued, lest the Seanad should become a weaker copy of the Dáil, in which case, to my mind at least, it would serve no useful function.</P>
    <P>I heard the other day a eulogy of the American Senate from one of the Deputies opposite.  I have not a great knowledge of the American Senate and I do not know how far that was deserved. At any rate, it is obvious that we cannot reproduce anything like the American Senate in this country, so that I am content not to reveal to the House where I myself would place the American Senate in the list.  Again, on the point of theory and practice, I dare say I shall be regarded as very reactionary if I say that I think that in practice, as distinct from theory, probably about the best Second Chamber for its work in the world is the British House of Lords.  There was never such a clash of theory and practice. In theory a more absurd body than the House of Lords could not be got.  A man sits in that assembly&mdash; nominally sits in it, probably does not go near it &mdash; but is entitled to sit in it either because he is the son of his father or more probably, the son of his grandfather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or else because he is a rich man who has bought his way there.  That, of course, has been furiously denied, but that really about represents the position.  A more absurd system could never have been invented out of Bedlam.  Never out of Bedlam was there anything so absurd as these qualifications for sitting in a Second and Revising Chamber.  But how does it work?  The House of Lords has about 600 members; two-thirds, probably five-sixths, of the members never go near it.  What is the result?  What remains are probably the most experienced, the wisest, the most judicially-minded, the most disinterested body of public men you can find.  Why?  Because what are left are men who, with rare exceptions, either served in great Cabinet offices and have all the accumulated weight of the experience of great office behind them, or have been heads of the Civil Service, or men who have administered great territories, or great soldiers, or, to a lesser extent, men at the head of great businesses. In practice, as distinct from theory &mdash; believe me I speak from some knowledge of it, because I have watched the proceedings of both Houses for a very considerable number of years very closely and have attended debates in both&mdash;the result is a House which, on the whole, I do not believe, except in moments of great passion&mdash;and that is a time when no Second Chamber is likely to be at its best &mdash; is probably the best revising Chamber in the world. Had we need, I am so reactionary that I should not shrink from establishing the old House of Lords in this country, but it is not practical politics, and we may leave it aside.  Do we not need some body, however we can get it, of people who have got the detachment, the experience, the knowledge, the disinterestedness, to revise our work?  Will Deputy Lemass, for example, suggest that all the legislation passed here in the Dáil is perfect?  Are we so impeccable, are all our Bills so admirably drafted, are all our Ministers, in Deputy Lemass's opinion, such supermen, is the vote of the majority in this House so conclusive on all equities, that there is no need at times for revision in another place?  If we have that need, as I have already suggested, we shall <Col N="1923" /> not get the best people by popular election.</P>

      <P>Yes, if you like.  The constant visits to constituents, rattling about over bad roads in motor-cars, travelling backward and forward, the daily post bag, the long hours, and all the rest of it, there comes a time of life when they can no longer face that. It becomes too irksome, and later on impossible.  There may be amongst such men&mdash;even Deputy Lemass will grow old, and even his youth and vigour may fail to continue such work &mdash;but it would be very sad that the Saorstát should be deprived in another place of the growing experience and knowledge which Deputy Lemass will then have.  Surely it would be very unfortunate if the mere chance of popular election were to deprive the State of such services.  I venture to suggest we should try the plan suggested by this Bill.  As to whether it is the best possible plan for creating a second Chamber, I do not know, but it seems to me to be a great improvement upon the first, and therefore with that tempered hope and reasonable scepticism proper to a person of my age and of my temperament, I shall continue to support this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Law has treated us to a very instructive address.  The only thing is that Deputy Law seems to have completely forgotten or left out of account what we on this side regard as essential in <Col N="1924" /> the consideration of this question.  That is the fact that this country is neither united nor independent.  As soon as we get to the position where we are both united and independent, I think we will then be in the position to discuss&mdash;and I hope we will have adequate knowledge at our disposal and better advice than we have had from this Committee&mdash;what exactly ought to be the principle upon which a Second Chamber ought to be elected.  As a matter of fact&mdash;although Deputy Law has done his bit at bye-elections, as I have myself&mdash;he contending that on the one side lay the supreme mandate of the will of the people, and that there was no alternative to that but anarchy, desolation and civil war, and I do not know how many other things&mdash;although the Deputy has stressed that outside he now finds himself in the extraordinary position inside this House&mdash;where, as I have already said, you have practically all parties represented and where you have typified a certain stage of stability and security that you have reached outside&mdash;Deputy Law is not in a position, or at any rate I have not gathered it from the remarks he made, to make up his mind or to state the arguments upon which he made it up, that this right to elect the Seanad ought to be taken away from the people and given, not to the Dáil itself, but to the Seanad also.  Now, arguments will be advanced, of course, with regard to the position in other countries.  I think the fact that the country is partitioned, that it is not independent, and that you still have those oath-bound clauses which Deputy Law told us we cannot change, means that no change at all except one that is absolutely urgent and which all parties in the House can be agreed upon, ought to be made in the Constitution for the present.  All this gives me the idea that the Government Party are now, with great hurry and great rush and great make-believe, and with nothing at all behind them in the form of analogies or parallels, or precedents or arguments of any kind, that, in spite of their lack of efficiency in all these matters, they are simply trying to rush through everything in the hope of securing that a certain state of affairs which they cannot secure in other ways is put in the way they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> They are asking the Irish people to sign their name to a cheque and they will fill up that cheque.  Why do they not leave these questions open while it is painfully evident that we cannot have unity upon them?  Why cannot the Government Party be satisfied with the way things are progressing?  Why are they not satisfied to work with the support and the co-operation of all members on this side of the House in the schemes of economic revival and reconstruction that we have heard so much about?  Why are they in such a hurry to rush through all these Constitution Bills at this juncture? I shall be delighted if some members of the party opposite give us proof that the history of the peculiar circumstances of this country are behind the Government.</P>
    <P>The only excuse I can find is that they do not want a general election to settle this question.  They do not want the straight issue of the Seanad or the Constitution to come before the people. They have taken away the right to do that by means of the Initiative and the Referendum.  They talk about their general mandate upon the question of the will of the people.  Deputy Law says the people understand the Constitution. The people do not understand the Constitution.  It would be interesting to know exactly how many printed copies of the Constitution are in existence in the country, to find out to what extent in the colleges and schools the primary elements of the Constitution have been examined and studied.  It would be interesting to find out how many members of this House could give a verbal explanation of the Constitution and its chief clauses.  I submit the country does not understand the Constitution, nor has the Constitution been put before the country in a proper manner.  It was put before it on a certain date in 1922 and since that the Government Party have taken every opportunity they have got to say &ldquo;the people are with us,&rdquo; and then to come along and say, as Deputy Law has said, &ldquo;The people do not desire a certain thing.  We know that the people do not want to elect this Seanad. We know the people so well and what they want that we are going to step in between the people and those people <Col N="1926" /> who follow Deputy de Valera, lest the people should still be misled and deceived.&rdquo; I submit the people do not understand these issues, that the proper way to make them understood by the people is to have a constitutional committee in which everybody can have confidence, which will examine the whole question and consider it in a spirit of judicial detachment and which will have in view the whole question of the unity and independence of the country.  This Committee will in other words take for granted that there are certain aspirations which the party on this side of the House represents, that there are certain traditions in the Irish nation and that you cannot wipe out these things in one moment and say that just because a Seanad election is pending you must rush this thing at all costs; that there must be no discussion about it as time is too precious. In the name of goodness did anybody ever hear of the Government of a young State setting out on a difficult task of building a national policy by rushing through this difficult question without giving any arguments to support it, and by remorselessly using this machine of the guillotine and closure to carry it?</P>
    <P>Now the American Senate is the Senate of a large country.  It fulfils a special function&mdash;that is, it fulfils the function of the Federative principle of America.  It brings together the representatives of all the States, and it is absolutely necessary, therefore, to knit up all the different State interests of America and to give the country some central control.  Therefore the United States Senate is a body of extraordinary importance in the history of the country, and is elected, as far as I understand, by the people. Now we have the other extreme&mdash;the British House of Lords.  If we had the old aristocracy here that we had at the time of Grattan's Parliament, I think Deputy Law's arguments would have some force.  We have not that old aristocracy.  They were not prepared to accept the principles which the common Irish people sought and which they struggled and fought for.  Because they did not accept those principles they are gone.  They are not coming back.  If they had been here and had <Col N="1927" /> participated in our fight they would have been of immense value to us. Their talents and attainments have gone to build up the British Empire in other directions, but they are not here. If they were here they would have the special training which would entitle them to special consideration.  They would have in addition the fact that they were residing in the country, but whatever remains of them and seeks position in the Seanad to-day has behind him or them only the melancholy history that at all times in the stages of the country's struggle towards freedom they were out against it.  Then, when they discovered disunion in the ranks of the common people they thought they would climb into power on our backs.  They are not going to do so, not at least without a severe struggle from this side of the House.  They have no sympathy with the traditional aspirations of the Irish people.  They are out to thwart them, and if they get this new power I have not the slightest doubt but that they will continue to do what they did in the past.  Their pitiable and mean little attitude yesterday evening in Dublin indicates that this spirit of slavery we hear so much about is more dominant in them than in any other class of the Irish people. They cannot rise to an occasion.  Are we now to place power in their hands, they who have been the hereditary antagonists of our race through all time?  Furthermore, in the English House of Lords they have an aristocracy trained in diplomatic work for generations.  They are acquainted with the problems of the Empire and conditions in other countries.  They are of immeasurable value to the British Empire in that way.  Furthermore, the English House of Lords has certain judicial functions to carry out which the Seanad of the Irish Free State has not.  In England, for that reason, for the reason that it was brought more up to date, its powers curtailed, new blood introduced and the law lords brought in to strengthen it, in connection with its special legal function, the English House of Lords is on a different plane from our Seanad here.</P>
    <P>If there are to be changes I submit those changes ought to come after a full and frank discussion when every <Col N="1928" /> member of the House is satisfied that his constituents understand the question thoroughly and that on each particular Bill a Deputy is able to get up and say that he has discussed the matter at issue with his constituents, that his constituents have given him a certain mandate or that at any rate he understands their view-point: he may or may not accept it, but at present our constituents do not understand these questions at all.  I cannot understand why a better procedure could not be adopted: the Government had full experience of the last Seanad election, they knew the people did not turn out and that there were certain defects in the method of election. They had a right to make an arrangement to remedy the defects for the ensuing election.  Instead of that, they take advantage of the opportunity to appoint a committee, and because that committee which we, on our side of the House at any rate, would not regard as having any special qualifications or knowledge which would enable them to deal with the matter from the point of view of the common Irish people brought in a certain verdict in accordance with the Government's policy and, I suppose, largely governed by the wishes of the Government in this matter, we are simply asked to take the results of that committee without consideration, without any argument being advanced in favour of them and to pass them here simply as if we were parts of a clockwork machine.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of the method of election, apart from the fact that you are giving to the Seanad certain powers to elect their own members, that in particular you are giving to the nominated members, who have no speak whatever of popular sanction or democratic election behind them, the power to elect themselves, you are in the position in this Bill that you do not know exactly what Senators are going to participate in the election. Can we regard legislation as being serious, well thought out, or as being conceived with the best interests of the country in view, when it is not specifically stated whether or not outgoing members of the Seanad are going to have a vote?  If they are not, why is it not definitely stated in the Bill?  As far as I can remember, the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="1929" /> in a previous stage of this debate was asked the question whether the members of the Seanad who are outgoing this year would have the right to participate in this election.  I am not clear on the question, and I submit to the House that it is really nonsense to pass a measure of this character when we do not know definitely who are the persons who are going to participate in this election.</P>
    <P>There is also the point with regard to useful public service and the panel. I admit we would have reason to modify our views on this side of the House if we could foresee how the panel of candidates is going to be selected, or if we could see what interests in the country are going to be represented there or what persons will be deemed to have had useful public service. If we could foresee that, if we had before us now some idea of what the panel will be, some idea of the candidates, from which we will have to select future members of the Seanad, I agree we might modify our policy, but we are being asked to give to the nominated members of the Seanad the right to elect their own members in the future (as well as giving that right to this House) without even knowing where the candidates are coming from, who is going to select them, or what the basis of their selection is going to be.  In the very same way as we have had all those Constitution Bills dumped upon us and rushed through in the most unseemly manner, we are going in a few weeks more, perhaps before the session closes, to have dumped on us in the same way a certain panel of candidates selected by whom I do not know.  A panel of names will be put before us; we can discuss them as long as we will as we have done in the case of the Bills in connection with changes in the Seanad, but the majority is there: it does not matter what arguments or appeals are made for unity in the country the Government majority will sit stolidly there and at the end of it all will pass this thing through.</P>
    <P>If you are going to do that, you are not going to give the Party on this side of the House the feeling that they have a real voice in the selection of the Seanad.  You are giving them the feeling that although they have advanced <Col N="1930" /> to meet you, although they have come in here and proffered their advice and co-operation in schemes and measures for the general benefit of the country, when it comes to a question of whether the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is going to hold its present majority and to remain in office for as long as it will, the Fianna Fáil Party can expect no fair play whatever; that once the question of the right of the Government to stay in office looms on the horizon, then no argument is going to count; it is simply going to be a Party question. Governments will change and must change, and in all this matter you are setting very dangerous precedents; you are doing things which a future Government may do.  It may harp back on your action now; it may say that you did certain things, that by the force of your majority here, in spite of the fact that you had no clear mandate from the people, and that the Opposition did not and could not accept the principle of nearly all these Bills, and in spite of the opposition of the Labour Party as well as of the Fianna Fáil Party, you rushed them through.  Will not that be a precedent for a future Executive?  Will it not be in its power as well as it is in the power of the present Government to try by means of subterfuges of that kind, by appointing committees and then by rushing through decisions of these committees with a party majority, to create again in the country that feeling of instability and insecurity which the Government Party claim they have put an end to? If there was any spark of statesmanship or of national feeling or even of democratic feeling on the opposite benches; if the members of the Party opposite could only see themselves for once as representatives of the plain people of Ireland, who have got so far and want to go further, if they could only recollect what all parties who still hold national aspirations stood for a few years ago, I venture to say that they would not be dominated by this thought of getting Government measures through as quickly as possible and by means that would not be adopted by any assembly that was really conscious of its dignity or that really felt it had the power of the people behind it.</P>

      <P>Again, sir, I would like to give way to some member of Cumann na nGaedheal rather than to speak myself.  I think that has been the habit of all members on these benches throughout these debates, to attempt to get other portions of this House, silent and apparently moribund, to come out of their grave clothes. However, we did have Deputy Law. He took the earliest possible moment! How long have we been discussing these constitutional amendments that this is the earliest possible moment in which Deputy Law can get up to say what he did say as one who is anxious to advocate constitutionalism?  He rose at the earliest possible moment to advocate constitutionalism, but&mdash;his whole speech is in the but&mdash;he was prepared to advocate constitutionalism, but&mdash;it is all buts&mdash;he will not advocate constitutionalism in any manner which will interfere with the permanence of possession of power by the party to which he belongs.  He will rise at the earliest possible moment to advocate constitutionalism, but, to use his own words, he will do it with reasonable scepticism.  No wonder it took him so long to find the earliest possible moment to advocate constitutionalism. Will he and the other members of his Party go down among the plain and common people of this country and advocate constitutionalism with a reasonable scepticism?  Was it the reasonable scepticism that deluged this country with blood?  For which of the &ldquo;buts&rdquo; were all these millions of money poured out?  To advocate what kind of constitutionalism and in what kind of a hurry were blood and treasure poured out with reckless extravagance in this country?  A reasonable scepticism ! That is the spirit.  Reasonable scepticism! The scepticism that Deputy Law is in a hurry at the earliest possible moment to advocate is the informing principle of constitutionalism in this country.  If this House takes that as the standard of decency and honour in discussion it has had a very good exemplar in Deputy Law.  If the people want representatives who will come to the discussion of their constitional questions with reasonable scepticism they have a perfectly good representative.  But if they want men <Col N="1932" /> who will regard constitutional questions in this country as matters of importance, matters which affect their ordinary lives and which may influence the whole lives of their children, I certainly do not think that they want them to come to the examination of it in a spirit of reasonable scepticism and dominated by &ldquo;buts.&rdquo;  Take a specimen of the reasoning that is offered you.  The House of Lords is perfect because it is absurd.  Make the Seanad absurd so that it may be perfect.  That is what your representatives are sent back here to say in the face of the Dáil.  I do not think the Press will quote that in that exact form, and that is the exact form and meaning in summarisation of all that Deputy Law said in favour of the House of Lords.  The fewer people that attend the more perfect ! If you want a good Seanad make it perfectly absurd and you are going to have it absurdly perfect. &ldquo;It is axiomatic,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;whatever else may happen, that your Second Chamber should not be a replica of the First.  Therefore, get the First elected on principles of proportional representation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Except in so far as it is made worse by being infiltrated with its own opinion of itself, it is going to be, under this Bill, a replica of itself.  If his principle is right, his reasoning is wrong.  If he is to be taken as a good and sound reasoner, if the axiom he puts forward in favour of this Bill is right, he should vote against the Bill.  He speaks of the lack of a passionate desire on the part of these people for reform.  Are the desires for reform so passionate that we must put off all ordinary legislation that was laid down for us?  Is the desire so passionate that we must throw over the Estimates until the Autumn; that we can leave good and important Bills undiscussed; in order that we should stay up all day and all night? We were willing to stay up more nights than they were, in order to discuss those matters.  There is no desire, he says, no sign of a desire, on the part of these people for constitutional reforms.  That is the reason why we are taking them. I suppose.  A reasonable scepticism as to Deputy Law's belief in the things he professes to believe in is a reasonable <Col N="1933" /> inference from the speech of Deputy Law.</P>
    <P>At a very early stage in this Bill we asked the question which is again being asked by Deputy Derrig&mdash;where is there an indication in the Bill as to who shall elect the Seanad?  That question was not answered the first day we asked it.  We were insolently and ignorantly refused information on the matter.  It was refused ignorantly and insolently by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health when he was asked during the stages of the Bill to give that information. That information is refused now.  It is a matter for the lawyers to decide afterwards who shall elect the Seanad. It is a matter for the lawyers to decide what is the meaning of the Bill that we are passing through the Dáil in such a hurry.  Three or four words would make it clear if they chose to make it clear.  That is typical of a good many Bills.  It is not the slightest use to ask those men what their intention is, because this House at the present moment is trying to push through a Bill which failed to carry out the one thing which it was declared it was intended to do.  That is the Mutual Insurance Bill.  It is not the slightest use going to them for inspiration.  We are entitled to have the plain meaning of these Bills written upon their faces. Either through incapacity, through plain insolence or through a desire to hide the truth and to leave it to the probable and sympathetic consideration of the lawyers, this Bill has been left in this inchoate fashion.  We are leaving a Bill now as regards which we do not know&mdash;there is no means except the assurance, for what it is, of the Ministers opposite&mdash;whether twenty outgoing Senators are going to vote for themselves before they go out.  As far as I understand it, that is the intention of the Government.  These twenty outgoing Senators before they go out, or in the process of going out, or after they are gone out, are to be competent to vote that they shall stay in.  It is a bad Bill from the point of view of drafting.  It is a bad Bill from the point of view that it deliberately sets out to hide from the people what their representatives do with the authority which has been given to <Col N="1934" /> them.  It is laid down in this Bill, and the only thing that is clearly laid down as far as I can make out, is that this nominated Seanad and this Dáil shall from a panel which has not been selected, set up on a principle which has not been decided, made up of men whose qualities have not been defined, will, by a secret ballot, select a Seanad. Why should my constituents not know whom I am voting for?  Why should the constituents of the dumb-driven cattle on the back Benches of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party not know for whom they are voting?</P>

      <P>That would not be an official record.  I want to know why should this information be kept from our constituents, whose authority we are using?  Why should they not be told for whom we cast our votes?  Why should that be kept from them?  When the Seanad is reconstituted to contain the elements of evil from the point of view of the ordinary people in this country, why will not the people be in a position to know what Deputies put in those key-men of national evil? Perhaps it is not, save in a spirit of reasonable scepticism, we may regard it that our constituents are not concerned with what we do with our votes once we are given them.  It is all part of the game, part of the pretence, part of those long years of pretence in which the Front Bench opposite, and their faithful supporters, have advocated one principle and followed another. They profess one belief <Col N="1935" /> and have shown another practice. They profess to believe in the liberty of the ordinary man in this country to govern the country.  They profess to believe in the importance and sacredness of the Constitution which they have upheld, while in reality they have advocated it with a reasonable scepticism without the slightest regard for the liberties of the people or the sacredness of the institutions which they profess to honour. This Bill is a rotten, badly-drafted Bill, because its principle is beneath contempt, because it is intended to fit into the bad old system which this Dáil was supposed to be created to destroy, because it fits in perfectly with the whole of the other ten Bills which are now before the House, to tear out of this Constitution everything that is of value in it that they can lay hands on, to tear out of that Constitution everything that was in it that was of value to the liberty of the ordinary man and the possibilities of national development in this country.  For that reason every man who is not merely a cipher, who is not merely a voter in the lobby, every man who has any regard whatever for the purpose for which he ought to be here, in an assembly of Irishmen, will vote against this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Flinn and Deputy Derrig I feel that sufficient justification has not been given to the House for the passing of the Report Stage of this Bill.  It has been claimed by the Government on many occasions that the Seanad is an important, essential and powerful component of this Constitution and of the system of Government which has been established under it.  If that is so the method of electing that Seanad must be equally important and equally vital to this people.  This Bill proposes to deprive the people of the power of electing that Seanad directly, and instead to entrust it to a joint sitting on which the Seanad, largely a nominated assembly, will have equal rights and equal franchise with the members of this House who have been elected by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think that a change of that description, a very far-reaching <Col N="1936" /> change in this Constitution, should at least have some solid argument advanced from the Government Benches in support of it.  The only argument given by the President in introducing the measure was the old argument that the Bill was to implement the decision arrived at by a Committee sitting in secret, whose whole proceedings were secret, whose discussions were secret and whose conclusions were pre-determined by its very composition.  This Bill is not the result of any deep political thought.  It is the result of a political bargain, a shameful bargain entered into by the Government, professing to be the servants of the common people, with the Seanad, directly and originally constituted not as the instrument of the common people of Ireland but as the instrument of the ascendancy which had privilege here under the old regime. It is in virtue of that bargain, and not in virtue of any advantage or benefit which the people will receive from the change, that the Government have introduced this Bill and now propose to put it through.</P>
    <P>What argument have we heard in support of it?  The only argument was put forward by Deputy Law, and I suppose we ought to be very grateful for the speech, even though the things he did say were not very substantial, not very cogent, and, I take leave to believe, not very sincere.  The only argument he could advance for the change was, that as we could not bring back the old aristocracy which sold this country once, and I am quite certain would be perfectly capable of selling it again, we could take a little plate powder polish&mdash;that was Deputy Law's plea, a plea for a little plate powder&mdash;in order to make the Seanad a little more ornamental since it cannot be made a little more useful.  Hungering after the House of Lords, the Deputy, with a little reasonable scepticism, as Deputy Flinn has already explained, pleaded for a Seanad.</P>
    <P>Now, the question of bi-cameral Government in our present circumstances is altogether beside the point, at least so far as we are concerned, because we are not here to discuss the merits or the demerits of that system.  We are here to make our <Col N="1937" /> position plain in regard to the Seanad. We are anxious to change this Constitution fundamentally.  We realise the Seanad was put there to make the change more difficult.  We agree with Deputy Law that in those circumstances it would be fatal that there should be two organs of Government in this House claiming to derive authority directly from the people.  It would be fatal in view of the future to which we look forward, to the time when some day or another the people electing the representatives to this Dáil will declare by their votes that they wish this Constitution to be changed in every essential element&mdash;to be changed in regard to those Articles which, at the present moment, the President denies this Dáil has power to change or alter.  We are looking forward to that day and we are anxious to bring about that change with the least possible civil strife and confusion. We believe that, so far as our policy is concerned, it is essential, if there is going to be a Second Chamber in this country and under this Constitution, that it should derive its authority from and immediately through the elected Deputies, so that if the need for it arises we can deprive it by our votes in the Dáil of that authority and we can carry through speedily, expeditiously, and quietly the changes which the people have shown by their votes they desire to be made in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>What justification has the President for the proposals that he now puts forward?  Under this Bill there are to be two factors, two sections, taking part in this election to the Seanad.  We have first of all the representatives of the people who are seated in the Dáil and who derive their authority from the people. At least we claim that by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution which states that all authority, legislative, judicial and executive, is derived from the people.  They have in view of that a certain right to endow in the name of the people another body, if they care to, with authority.  But what is the position of the other factor in this <Col N="1938" /> election?  You have the people coming from the Seanad who never faced the voters at an open election; you have a nominated element taking part in this election, a nominated element which does not derive its mandate from the people.  That element is to have equal rights, an equal franchise, with those who do derive their authority from the people. Is not that a perpetuation of privilege under this Constitution?  Those people who never have faced the electorate and who have been appointed by nomination possibly because they happen to be friends of some person who is a friend of the President, and certainly not because they have any particular special merit, are to have equal rights with the people's elected representatives. The nominated element is going to have equal privilege in the election of a Seanad with those who were directly elected by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, as I have said, is a perpetuation of privilege.  Those Senators who toil not and who do not spin are, under this Bill, now to be endowed with the regenerative faculty of an oyster.  They have other characteristics of the oyster as well.  You have only to look at the reports of the Seanad, that little slim, flimsy volume of two or three pages which we get at rare intervals; you have only to look at the number of Senators who attend in the Seanad and who try to exercise the functions with which they were normally charged under the Constitution to realise, as I said before, that Senators have more than one characteristic of the oyster. They sit quietly with their shells open and take their sustenance, which the tide of the Constitution washes to their maws.  They take £360 a year, every single one of them, and up to the present they have lamentably failed to discharge a single duty entrusted to them, or a single obligation imposed on them by this Constitution.  The ostensible justification for them is mainly that by checking, impeding, retarding, criticising, they can hold up and amend legislation hastily conceived and passed with indecent expedition through this Dáil.  When, in any single constitutional crisis which this State has faced since 1923, when the rights of the subject under that <Col N="1939" /> Constitution were taken from him, when Article 6, which declared the liberty of the citizens to be inviolable, was suspended, when, at any moment when the rights of the common people required to be defended as against the aggression of the Executive Council, did the Seanad ever exercise that power of retarding, revising or criticising the hasty legislation which emanated from this House?  It is true that on one occasion, or possibly two occasions at any rate, during the debate on the Public Safety Bill one Senator urged that in view of the changed circumstances, in view of the fact that there was coming into this Dáil another Party, it might be called on to support an alternative Government to the Government whose only weapon of government was that of repression and coercion, there seemed to be some possibility that the Executive Council would henceforth be constituted by men who desired to govern by conciliation and forgiveness, the Vice-President who now proposes to endow that Senator with an additional faculty said that he was suffering from senility.  The other Senators who ought to have resented that insult, and ought to have had the manliness to stand up in defence of him betrayed the fact that they themselves were sensible of their own deficiencies.  These men who, by their passive acquiescence in that insult, admit that they are now senile and effete, but they are to be endowed with additional power, with further privilege, by the Bill we are now considering.  With regard to the drafting of the Bill, we had to-day to accept an amendment, introduced on Report Stage and at the last moment, to make the Bill read sensibly.  That amendment was introduced as a result of the criticism levelled at the Bill from these benches.  It was an amendment which proved that the members of the Government who introduced it never even took the trouble to read their own measure.  Otherwise they would have seen that the omission of that little particle, that little definite article, from a particular line made it quite possible that, whatever the intention of the Government may have been, it could be held that only a certain section <Col N="1940" /> of the Dáil would be privileged to exercise the franchise in electing the Seanad.  That is the Bill which the Government introduced.  This is the defective malformation.  It was introduced to this House by a Government that never attempted to justify it by a single argument, and, from the circumstances which I have related, it is proved that they did not take the trouble to read it.</P>

      <P>There is a further point, and I think we are entitled to an answer upon it before the Bill goes. through.  I know it is going through. The Government have long ago thrown aside any pretence that they govern or legislate here in the interests of the people.  They legislate avowedly in the interests of a Party, and, because the purposes of that Party can only be served by maintaining in power and by endowing with additional powers the ascendancy class who compose or constitute the majority of the Seanad, and because the votes of that ascendancy class in this Dáil are essential to the Government to enable it to remain in office, we know that the Government have thrown aside all pretence that they are governing for the people. They are now legislating for their Party and are determined to rush through this Bill no matter what arguments are adduced against it.  Before the Minister does that, I think, at any rate, that the dignity of this House and honour, truth and justice entitle us to demand from him an answer to the question addressed to him, not only to-day, but on every Stage of the Bill &mdash; First, Second and Committee Stage &mdash; and to ask him whether or not it is intended to permit the retiring Senators to vote in this election or whether it will take place after the vacancies have occurred.

      <P>I take leave to doubt that.  The total electorate would be 212.  There are a number of electors who will not be available.  The quota will be roughly about 10, even if all the electors are available.  Therefore, if some electors are not available, and if the fifteen retiring Senators are available, because they have more than half the quota necessary to elect a second Senator, they could elect at least two.</P>

Could we ever expect anything from the Government in relation to the national position but the worst?  Therefore we are entitled to expect the worst now.

Is it not quite possible that some of the originally nominated members can be appointed for the rest of their lives by virtue of this Bill and by virtue of this method of election, and can continue to remain as Senators without having their names placed before the people or without seeking the people's mandate?

      <P>I am perfectly clear about it.  I can see how it will operate, and, because I see that, I say that this Bill is an attempt to create a specially privileged class in this country&mdash;people who would never receive the confidence of the people, whose sole claim to special treatment is that they were coercionists, rack-renters, place-hunters, or in some way or other the tail of the British régime in this country.  That is why this Government, which professes to be a democratic Government, which professes to make operative the will of the people, five or six years ago plunged the people into war, spilt Irish blood and wasted Irish treasure, all in the name of, and for the glorification of, the Irish people, and as the result of it six years afterwards we find the same Government doing everything to bolster up and enthrone in perpetual possession the old ascendancy gang against whom all efforts were directed in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had said all I intended to say on this Bill on Second Reading and in Committee, but I find that Deputies whose Party voted in favour of this same Bill in a Committee now come into the House to criticise the Government for introducing it.  I cannot understand exactly what their attitude is.  It is a remarkable fact&mdash;it may be a coincidence&mdash; that Deputy Ruttledge, who voted in the Committee for the motion that it was not desirable that the people should elect the Seanad, has not been in this House since the Bill was introduced. He, I think, could throw a little light on the attitude of his Party towards this measure.  Why the Fianna Fáil Party went into a Committee to vote that this election of the Seanad should not be entrusted to the people and why they come into this House afterwards to criticise the Government for bringing in a Bill in accordance with the report that they themselves, through their representative, voted for, is a situation which I <Col N="1944" /> may be too old-fashioned to understand. This Bill is an amendment of the Article dealing with the mode of election to the Seanad, but there should be another Constitution Amendment Bill introduced to deal with Article 2, which says that all powers are derived from the people.  If all powers are derived from the people and if by this Bill we are going to take the power to make laws out of the hands of the people, the first step should be to introduce a Bill to deal with Article 2 of the Constitution as well as the other Articles which we are going to alter.  It would, I think, be no harm to read Article 2 again, because, as far as I can see, Deputies who have been opposing this Bill so far were really talking to the gallery.  It reads: &ldquo;All powers of Government and all authority, legislative, executive and judicial, in Ireland, are derived from the people of Ireland.&rdquo;  How does this Article read when we take from the people the election of the Seanad?  That Article will have to be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee says that he knows that this Bill is going through.  Knowing that this Bill is going through, knowing that his Party voted in favour of the Bill being produced, he comes into the House and in the shelter of safety, in the shelter of the majority Party, he has put up a mock opposition to taking away the rights of the people by saying that they are prevented from doing anything.  There is, however, a consistent method by which the Fianna Fáil Party, after voting in favour of this in Committee and after encouraging the Government to introduce this Bill, can ascertain whether public opinion is against them.  There is a very simple method.  Will they say, when it comes to an election after this Bill is passed, will they have the manliness to say: &ldquo;We will refuse to vote under the circumstances, we will not vote in the election of a Seanad&rdquo; Will they say: &ldquo;We will have neither hand, act nor part in the election of a Seanad which is to be elected only by the Dáil and the Seanad.  We, as a Party, will abstain, as we do not want representation on this effete body&rdquo;?  That is the consistent attitude for them to take up.  I <Col N="1945" /> am sure we would admire that attitude, but I have grave doubts that they will adopt it, because they, as a Party, know very well that the system of election which they voted for themselves&mdash; taking it out of the hands of the people&mdash;worked out mathematically gives them a much larger representation than if they went before the people.  That is the sum and substance of the mock opposition to this Bill. There is no sincerity in it.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill because I believe in the will of the people.  Parties and Governments have fallen, and will fall again when they forget the people. Parties will fall in this country, and perhaps sooner than they think, and perhaps Governments, when they take away the rights of the people.  I have been before the people many times and the people have rejected me many times, but the will of the people prevailed and I accepted it.  I stand for the will of the people to be accepted by everybody and that the people should have the power and the right to authorise us as an elected body to make laws.  If that power is taken from the people, then the people will find another method of dealing with both the Dáil and Seanad in the near future.</P>

      <P>You may take it for what you like.  You will know it when you go before the electors next. Since I voted on this measure in the first instance, I have consulted with many of my constituents, and not in one case did I find one to tell me that I did wrong.  I believe that if Deputies had consulted their constituents since the introduction of the Bill they would find that it is a most unpopular measure.  Very possibly the Opposition Party have found that out, hence their peculiar attitude in voting in Committee for this change in the Constitution and coming to the House and absolutely voting against it.  I voted against this Bill because it proposes to take away the rights of the people.  I hope the Fianna Fáil Party will adopt the suggestion I made and not soil their hands by voting for Senators when they do not believe that the <Col N="1946" /> Seanad is wanted and when the people have no right to vote on their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The people have an ample opportunity of asserting their authority.  I am talking about principles and not about this House, because the will of the people at present is not represented by the Government Party.  But, generally speaking, the legislative House is the one House which represents the sovereignty of the people for the time being, and that, together with the Referendum, gives all the expression of sovereignty which the people can derive from representative government.  There are more direct forms of government where you have not representative government, but government direct by the people.  There you have the people exercising their authority as masters in their own house all the time.  But, under representative government, you have a House which is the legislature, and the Seanad is not essentially the legislature.  Powers are not taken from the people so long as the powers of legislation are not taken from the Dáil.  That, I think, is a fair answer.  I am sure that I am closer to Deputy O'Hanlon's point of view than he thinks, and he will find that most of the members of this Party are just as anxious to see that the Irish people are masters in their own House as he is.</P>

      <P>It does not require any repudiation on my part.  Deputy Ruttledge has been ill, and if he were here he would be able to explain the current of the discussion at that time, <Col N="1947" /> and he will be able to explain the matter, of which I am not cognisant, as I was not present at the Committee. Anyone who is not present at a particular Committee is not in a position to explain any particular attitude taken up.  It is in this House that a Party will declare its policy, and it is by the conduct of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House that we know its policy.  I believe Deputy O'Hanlon wishes to be fair to us, but it is not a fair thing for him to say that we put up a mock opposition to this Bill.  We are as anxious to have a good Constitution as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speeches made from these benches this afternoon have been listened to by only a small proportion of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  If they were really anxious for the country's good, they would have shown in one way or another that they appreciated what had been said from this side of the House.  They seem to be in the condition of people suffering from insomnia.  They are in an uneasy state of wakefulness.  They are not sufficiently awake to exercise their minds upon the serious problems before us.  Whatever the mystery of it is, they are not trying to think out the problem, and this afternoon's proceedings are a good example of how this assembly is not a deliberative assembly working for the benefit of the people.  If the Whips were taken off and the question was discussed, not from a Party angle but from an angle in which each one would think out for himself what would be the best thing for the country, you would get a very different atmosphere. Recently it was pointed out in another country that Party government had destroyed a certain assembly as a place where any real statesmanlike thinking could be done because of the way in which the Party tyranny was exercised. The same is true here.  A very reasonable proposition has been put from this side, that the whole Constitution should be submitted to a special Committee to try and arrive at the very best Constitution possible for this country, taking into consideration the traditions of the people, their aspirations towards freedom and unity, and, if you like, the fact that there is an element in the <Col N="1948" /> country which is not yet assimilated into the nationality of Ireland.  It is only through such a Committee, appointed with the good-will of this House, and on the basis of agreement, that you ever could carry or establish a Constitution which will be binding on the country.</P>
    <P>The very essence of a Constitution is that it should in some way or other represent a basic agreement of all parties, that it should be out of an agreement coming from all parties that its permanence should arise, and not because it is forced from above down on us.  You have only to look at the way that this Constitution has been imposed upon us.  We have been told, time after time, that&mdash;and we know it &mdash;there are certain elements in this Constitution that have been imposed from outside.  If after the war, let us suppose, a Constitution was imposed upon Germany by France and the Allies which had in it certain clauses binding them to give allegiance to a British scheme would anybody consider that that was really the national Constitution of the German nation? So, too, here not only have we this clause imposed upon us, but we have an element introduced into our national life and given an importance wholly out of proportion to its numbers and to its value to the State.  I am not against a Seanad in a free Ireland, with expert knowledge placed at its disposal and which will be a body rather advising than a body with a veto, and that it will be able to give us the benefit of its knowledge and experience. But I am not in favour of the present Seanad, which was originally a concession made to the reactionary elements in this country, and which is being maintained by the present amending Bill upon the same basis.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to argue that there will be only a small number of non-elected members left in the Assembly after the next election.  The Minister for Local Government has argued that there will be only one or two non-elected. But in connection with the Constitution you must look at the principle.  A vitiating principle is a matter that should not be in any constitution. The matter of mathematics is only a very minor one; the important <Col N="1949" /> question is the question of principle. Deputy O'Hanlon is hardly consistent when he urges the Fianna Fáil Deputies to refrain from voting at the Seanad elections.  I do not know whether we will vote or not at that election.  But certainly I can say he has not convinced me that he is consistent in his attitude that he represents the will of the people, because he ought to say that if he cannot get the kind of election he wants the next best thing is that those who really represent the people should take as full a part as possible in the election in order that to that extent the people should be represented.  This Bill just exemplifies what is being done in all these matters.  A line is being taken by the Government of trailing its coat in this country in order to create dissension. Instead of looking for agreement it looks for disagreement.  Its purport in doing that is to impose its will upon the country and upon this House, to keep down that element of nationalism represented by the aims and objects of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Executive did not consider the question I raised here on the last occasion, namely, that of dividing the period into two parts.  The Bill, as it stands, allows the Seanad to play with a Bill for a period of eighteen months without giving any indication whatever of what its final attitude towards the Bill is to be.  I consider that is altogether wrong, and that there should be a definite time, say about four months, within which the attitude of the Seanad towards a Bill should be definitely declared.  That is altogether beside the main question on which we object to the Bill.  We object to the Bill because it gives the Seanad powers that the Seanad has not got up to the present.  It makes it possible for the Seanad to delay a Bill in practice for a period that may run from twenty months up to thirty months, and the period is sufficiently long to compel an Executive that wanted to get its work done to dissolve Parliament. That is a power which the Seanad should not have.  The Seanad's power ought to be restricted to that of revising and making suggestions.  It is possible to defend a small Second Chamber provided it confines its activities within that scope, but to give, as is proposed in this Bill, the power to a Chamber, such as the Seanad is likely to be, of making an Executive that has been elected on a definite issue abandon its programme and go again to the people is, in my opinion, absurd. If there was a Seanad that was elected by the people, or a Seanad that was elected even by the Dáil, there might be some reason for giving them powers of that kind, particularly if the scheme of things was such that the Seanad was elected by the people and intended by them to have powers of this character, but when the Seanad is elected, in no small measure, by its own vote, to give them power like that, when they will never have to come before the people directly to account for their stewardship, is absurd, in my opinion.  I have pointed out in Committee <Col N="1954" /> how the powers that are given to the Seanad could be used to block an Executive that intended proceeding with a programme which the Seanad might, for one reason or another, object to.  The period of nine months, in practice, has worked out to be sufficiently long, and why that period was extended by the Executive Council is something I cannot understand, except on the basis that it was given because the Seanad were likely to have the same political views.  The present Seanad, anyhow, are likely to share, in a large measure, the political views of the Executive, and would be a second line of defence for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, just as the House of Lords played a traditional part in being supporters of the Conservative Government.  The effect of it is going to be that a Party which will represent the people will not allow the Seanad to stand in its way ultimately, and that giving powers like this is heading for a constitutional crisis of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not believe that the Seanad is doing anything that would merit the spending of the sums of money that are being spent at the present time or that would merit keeping it there at all. Consequently, as far as we are concerned, we shall always ask the people to put an end to it, and doubly so for the reason that we have here, because the powers that are given to the Seanad are definitely intended to favour one political Party and one political programme. It is a very strange thing that the only case where the Seanad is left the power of appealing to the people is when it is a question of moving forward.  If the people can be threatened, if they can be intimidated, then the Seanad has the power of referring the question back to the people in order that this intimidation may have its full effect.  But if there should be any question of advancing, the Seanad has no such powers.  It is only as a check and as a block that they are allowed to operate.  As I have said, a period of four months would have been quite sufficient to give the Seanad an opportunity of discussing any Bill and putting in amendments upon it, to indicate their attitude upon it, and send it <Col N="1955" /> back for reconsideration by the Dáil. There would be a period after that in which the Dáil could consider what was going to be its attitude in the light of the circumstances in which the Bill was sent back, and that period would work out probably at from two to three months.  A further period of two months is provided for which on the whole would work out to be a period such as was in the Constitution, a delaying period of nine months.  But this has changed that to be a period of close on 30 months ordinarily.</P>
    <P>I heard in the last debate surprise expressed at our attitude on these Bills. I cannot understand why anybody should in anyway be surprised at our attitude.  It has been quite consistent. Time after time, I have indicated on behalf of this Party, what that attitude was.  In the Joint Committee our representative indicated that attitude and he voted as I would have voted had I been there.  He voted in accordance with the deliberate decision of our Party that election by the people was undesirable, in view of the fact that we believe that there was another method of election which was more desirable and which could only be considered when that first question was disposed of.  When it came to that question and when it was proposed that the election should be not by the Dáil alone&mdash;the representatives of the people&mdash;but by the Seanad as well, then, of course, we had to choose between what we regarded as two evils and that choice was made definitely.  When we saw all the facts before us, both as a party and as individuals, in Committee, we made that decision and it is wrong to say that we voted for the Report.  We did not. That Report was a majority Report and it will be found if anybody cares to examine it that in practically every division in which there was any principle involved other than the principles we stand for here, and which we have advocated here, we voted against it or dissented from these majority decisions, so that there is no excuse for any member of the House not understanding exactly what our position is.  I believe they do understand it and it is mere pretence to affect not to understand it, or to think that our attitude was inconsistent. <Col N="1956" /> As I have said, at the start, I regret that the Executive did not, at least when they were going to persist in this period of 18 months, consider the advisability of dividing it into two periods, a period of four months or so within which the Seanad would have to indicate definitely its attitude and the remainder of the period which would be allowed to run as the period of suspension. I see a member of the Executive Council here.  Perhaps now, he may be able to give us some reason as to why they definitely decided not to break the period up into two.  It seems to me that it was a very natural and reasonable division to make.</P>
    <P>The other parts of the Bill are, of course, purely consequential and they call for little or no comment from me. What I have said to-day I have already stated on another occasion.  That summarises very definitely what our objections to this particular Bill are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. BOLAND Mr. G. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>What occurs to me and to most people on this side is that this amendment has been introduced for one purpose alone and that is to forestall the next Government.  The tide is definitely rising.  That is well known to the Government and they have brought in this Bill, giving these extra powers to the Seanad, in order that they may embarrass a future Government.  There is no other explanation of it.  They want to give the Seanad powers which it has not had up to this, a Seanad of their own choosing and which is going probably to be composed of the type of people who ignored the national will last evening, that is the old Unionist crowd in this country, who were objecting because the Union Jack was not floating when the Bremen fliers came to Dublin.  These are the people who, apparently, are to be confirmed in power in this country, confirmed in power that they have no right to whatever.  As I said, the power they have had up to this was quite sufficient for them.  They were able to hold up Bills for nine months.  Now it is proposed to give them power to hold them up for 18 months with a possible addition of two and a half months. That is the only excuse there is for bringing in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I can add any more. <Col N="1957" /> I want to make it clear, however, that that is my opinion and the opinion of most people on this side.  When the facts become known to the country it will also be endorsed by the people in the country.  The provisions contained in this Bill make it, I think, one of the most important of the whole lot.  Whatever you may say about the Referendum and the rest of it, this is the Bill that will give real power into the hands of a reactionary body in this country and it is the Bill which should be most carefully watched.  We will take every means we possibly can to let the people see what is being done.  We will endeavour to show them to whom the power is being handed.</P>

      <P>The Deputies on the far side reiterate their objections to a suspension period of eighteen months and I do not know that anything further can be said to what has already been said.  If that period of eighteen months is to be there, I do not see any particular virtue in dividing it into two periods, as Deputy de Valera suggests, and having a position by which inside the first four months the Seanad must say something definite. I do not know what the Seanad can say about any Bill that it gets in except to go through it in the different stages and let it pass through in the fashion in which they would like to see it passed through.  Then that Bill would go to the Dáil.  The suggestion would mean that the Seanad was under a particular obligation to carry out a certain discussion in four months and the four months might not be a reasonably long enough period to have the discussion carried out in.  At any rate, it is introducing a rather arbitrary point into a period of suspension.  No matter what the length of the period of suspension would be, I do not see any reason for introducing an intermediate point with regard to something which would happen.</P>

      <P>In public life and in watching public discussions&mdash;and this has particular reference as between the Dáil and the Seanad&mdash;we do not live in such water-tight compartments as that we do not see what the position is with regard to the attitude of the Seanad on a particular Bill.  We are proposing what we consider is a reasonable time for the purpose of letting certain sections in the Dáil make up their minds as to what issues they are likely to be faced with as a result of any action or opinions in the Seanad. It is, perhaps, really more effective that we would depend upon watching such <Col N="1960" /> discussions as do take place in the Seanad for the purpose of finding out the general trend and attitude of mind in the Seanad towards Bills which they have before them.  It is better that we would depend on that as a guide for the purpose of letting us see what issues we are to be faced with when a Bill comes back, rather than have the Seanad, in some particular way which to me is not quite clear, indicate that they hold this, that, or the other opinion with regard to any particular part of a Bill.</P>
      <P>The position is quite clear under this Bill.  Between the time at which a Bill leaves the Dáil and the time when it returns from the Seanad, there will be ample scope for consideration.  A period of eighteen months' suspension shall be allowed in case the Seanad does not pass the Bill with such amendments as the Dáil will agree to.  Certain arguments have been put forward against giving this power to the Seanad.  They were brought forward here just the same as arguments were brought forward on the last Bill, on which I had not an opportunity of speaking.  It has been said that the Seanad is a reactionary body.  One of the principal statements was, according to Deputy Fahy, that the Seanad was Comhacht Sasana &mdash;that the might and the power of England will be kept here as long as the Seanad can be kept here.  We have been told that it is largely a nominated body and under the Bill that was before us on Report Stage we are going to have the perpetuation of privilege here.  We have been told that people who were the nominees of certain persons&mdash;we do not know who they are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that certain people are being put into a position in the Seanad in which they can perpetuate themselves indefinitely, according to Deputy MacEntee. The position in the Seanad is that there were eighteen persons elected by the people in the last election.  There are fourteen going out in 1931.  They were elected by the Dáil in 1922.  There are fifteen persons who were nominated by the President <Col N="1961" /> in 1922 going out this year and there are nine persons who were nominated by the President going out in 1934.  There are four casual vacancies filled by co-option under present arrangements. Exception is taken to the Seanad, while at the same time we are told that we are not discussing here the question of a Second Chamber at all.  We are told that if we had a free and united Ireland a Second Chamber would be, perhaps, a good thing, but that because we are now labouring under certain difficulties nationally here, that we should do without those institutions that are good and proper things in order to carry out our ordinary work.  The objection that is taken here against the Seanad being given those powers is that they are a reactionary body.  Deputy Fahy has found out that some of them have riches and possessions.  There is a further objection against giving people who have riches and possessions power to act as members of the Second Chamber for the normal and general purposes that a Second Chamber carries out.</P>
      <P>As I said before on this particular Bill, the Deputies on the far side have a constitutional complex of some kind or another.  They cannot understand at all why we should take an interest in what type the Seanad should be, how it should be elected and what kind of powers it should have to make it an effective body for the purpose for which it as a Seanad should exist.  If the Deputies cannot see anything in our intention with regard to the Seanad than an attempt to build up institutions here that will be an obstruction to them, then nothing we can say will cure them of these delusions at the present moment and we can only get them to live out of them.</P>

      <P>I think we on this side of the House should welcome this Bill. It is going to be extremely useful for those who desire to see the abolition of the Seanad.  I do not think, even if <Col N="1962" /> the vitality of the country sank a great deal lower than at present, it would ever sink so low as that when the position that is contemplated by this Bill is explained to the people, they will agree to accept it.  I think it is going to make the Seanad so unpopular a body that the very oldest of us will see its death and burial.  If it were explained to the people of a certain town where one of the sitting Senators has during the past fortnight failed to get twenty-five votes in an election for the urban council of which he was an outgoing member&mdash;if it were explained that notwithstanding that vote of no confidence in him, the same man and a whole lot more of the same sort of men were to have the power to hold up urgent legislation passed by the Dáil and demanded by the people, for a period of twenty months, I do not think that town would be too patient in its attitude either to the Seanad or the Government that is giving the Seanad such power as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About an hour ago I heard a gentleman who is regarded, and perhaps rightly regarded, as one of the best minds in the Seanad discussing this matter and talking about the Referendum that it was proposed to abolish and the compensation that was to be given. He ridiculed the Referendum as being a thing of no use, and said it would never be used by the Seanad; that it was a worthless instrument.  He used a whole lot of strong adjectives towards it; he said it was an absolutely worthless instrument.  That was how he described it.  Yet, because that worthless instrument is being taken out of their hands, the power of holding up legislation for a period of twenty months is being given to the Seanad; that is double the power they already had.  I think it is worth while to quote the President's words on the subject: &ldquo;That right will now be taken away from the Seanad if that Bill becomes law&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the power of the Referendum.  &ldquo;The compensation which is offered in respect of that particular right which is being delivered up is that they get eighteen months, or at most twenty months, as against nine.&rdquo;  Again, he said later on: &ldquo;They are giving up a considerable amount, and some consideration must be reticula <Col N="1963" /> stored for the consideration that is being surrendered.&rdquo;  Yet even an hour ago a gentleman who is always regarded as one of the leaders, if not the leader, of the Party for whom the Seanad was really built up, that is to say, for whose safeguarding the Seanad was really intended, described, in my hearing, the original provision for which this great compensation is being given as being an absolutely useless thing for the Seanad.  That is rather a strange matter.  It shows that the President is at least generous to one of the Houses that forms the Oireachtas. He has not shown the same generosity to this House.  But no one can doubt, in face of these two statements, that his generosity to the other House is unbounded. The Minister for Local Government has just denied that there is any idea behind this new proposal of limiting the power of any Government that may be formed at any time from this side of the House.  He said that that was not the idea behind the Bill. Then what is the idea behind the Bill? When another stage was being discussed I ventured to speculate as to what would be the dangers in the way of very rapid or radical legislation to be anticipated in this country in the future.  Are there signs at the moment that there is a Communistic movement, for instance, in the country, or is anarchy developing very rapidly in this country?</P>
    <P>Is there any country in the world where the bulk of the people are more conservative than in this country?  Is there a sign that within our generation there will be any fierce desire to rush legislation that will interfere with the interests even of the very privileged class for whom the Seanad exists?  I cannot see any sign and no attempt has been made by any Minister to show that there are such signs or that there is need for this check on legislation approved by the Dáil.  So far from that, I think it may be expected that if a Second House were needed it would be a House that would spur this House towards more radical legislation than it is at present inclined for.  The bulk of the House represent as conservative a people as probably there is in the <Col N="1964" /> world, and, naturally, they share the sentiments of those people.  That we should invent a House of Lords at this hour of the day, that we should confirm a House that has already more than enough power, that we should double its powers to interfere with legislation by the people's assembly, is indeed a mystery, and it is not one that could easily be explained if the people ever manifested a desire for information on the point.  I do not think that one would be able to offer any explanation that would be convincing to the people.</P>
    <P>When it was being discussed previously a private Deputy on the Government Benches said that, of course, if the Dáil found that the Seanad is holding up its legislation, if it is interfering too much, it could easily go to a general election.  That is a rather curious suggestion to come from the Government side.  A general election is very expensive and is by no means a desirable alternative in such a matter.  We were told by the Minister only the other day that the people were tired of elections, that they were tired of all these constitutional squabbles, and that they would be glad to see an end to them.  Yet, a leading Deputy on the other side suggests that one way out might be to hold a general election if a Bill is held up unduly long.  It is evident that there is no use in arguing on this Bill.  No case has been made for it.  It has been put forward for reasons that have not been explained to the House, and, while one cannot hope that it will not pass at least we may hope that in its passing it will cause such a reaction as will quickly bring about a change that will upset not merely this legislation, but other legislation which is no less evil in its tendency.</P>

      <P>This, along with the other Bills that have been rushed here, seems to be panicky legislation and seems to be actuated by spite and by an endeavour to gain temporary political advantage.  The Minister for Local Government spoke about the Dáil being arbitrary towards the Seanad and urged that they should get this double power.  If the Seanad should be anything it should be the creature of the <Col N="1965" /> Dáil, auxiliary to the Dáil, something that would be helpful, something in the nature of an Economic Council, something that would not hold a sword over the head of the Dáil for an unnecessarily long period.  If they want to hold up legislation which is very necessary from the national point of view, they can do so, and they are the very gentlemen who will do it.  The Minister explained the composition of the Seanad and tried to put a gloss upon it. These gentlemen do not change their spots any more than the leopard.  Every informer and every slayer of the Irish people in Irish history are heroes to these people, and Emmet and Tone are traitors.  They send their sons to England to be educated.  You do not find these gentlemen in any forward Irish-Ireland movement, and you never will. They always have been, and ever will be, up against everything national, from the teaching of Irish in the schools to Gaelic games.  Deputy Fahy rightly said that these gentlemen were here to see that English interests were served, and that the English domination and English ideals shall be maintained all the time.  As Deputy Boland pointed out, they successfully boycotted the national demonstration of appreciation to the Bremen fliers, and you will see them displaying next November Union Jackery and in other ways insulting our national spirit.</P>

It is a costly instrument in comparison, say, with the Second Chamber in Belfast, where they are only paid a guinea a day and their expenses when they sit. Here you have a Seanad which, to all intents and purposes, is just an arbitrary <Col N="1966" /> instrument for retarding progressive legislation.  Though it involves too great a cost to the nation, it is proposed to give it double legislative powers under this Bill.  It strikes me that this is one of the Bills which have been brought about by a political bargain for the political support of Cumann na nGaedheal by the old Unionist gang.  It may achieve a certain amount of financial support for the time being, but it is one of the Bills which will open the eyes of the people to the surrender which the Executive Council have made to the gang which insults this nation at every possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>This debate is very dull and I hope it will soon conclude. There are, however, one or two remarks which were made by the last speaker and which, in my opinion, should be answered.  He conveyed the impression that the Seanad represents Trinity College.  That is not the case.  Trinity College is also represented in this House.  He was quite right in drawing attention to the fact that Trinity College, through some oversight or, perhaps, mistaken lack of courtesy, did not show any signs of rejoicing yesterday.</P>

      <P>So far as the present composition of the Seanad is concerned, it contains the only prominent political personages who take any interest in aviation in this country, particularly in relation to the flight of the Bremen, whereas the only interest displayed by the Party opposite has been in flights of imagination.  On the Committee Stage I made an earnest appeal to members of Fianna Fáil to support the Bill.  Apparently, however. I converted only Deputy Moore, who said in the beginning that he welcomed the Bill, but I am afraid he is going to vote against it.  Again, I urge the few members of the Fianna <Col N="1967" /> Fáil Party who have shown sufficient interest in the Bill to remain in the House, to change their opinion and to vote for the Bill in the interests of their own Party.  I drew attention to the fact, and it has not, so far, been contradicted, that the passage of this Bill will in no way endanger the carrying out of the economic policy of Fianna Fáil if they get a majority in this House.  I pointed out that nearly all the main proposals in that policy could easily be brought within the terms of a Money Bill, whether it be simply a question of tariffs, or prohibition on imports and exports, or the grant of bonuses.  All these methods by which Fianna Fáil propose to stimulate industrial activity in this country would come within the terms of what is known as the annual Finance Bill or the annual Appropriation Bill, which are declared under Article 55 of the Constitution to be Money Bills.  The matter was not disputed in this House, but, unfortunately, somebody in Cork has become anxious on the question and thinks that even if the Opposition Party should introduce such legislation it would be held up for eighteen months under this Bill by the Seanad on the plea that those Bills were not Money Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the question is quite clearly set out in the Article of the Constitution which defines a Money Bill as a Bill &ldquo;which contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation&rdquo;&mdash;in other words the Finance Bill&mdash;&ldquo;the appropriation receipt, custody, issue or audit of account of public money&rdquo;&mdash;that would include Appropriation Bills.  Within those two types of Bills&mdash;the Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill&mdash; practically the whole of the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, as far as economic matters are concerned, could be brought into operation.  I sincerely hope however that that will not be the case.  I only intervened in this matter from a purely historical point of view but I may say that the prospect of that Party ever being in a position to introduce a budget is I think outside the realms of possibility and with every <Col N="1968" /> week that passes, that possibility becomes more and more remote.  I do not think that any Deputy in this House can expect that, in his lifetime at any rate, he will see that Party in power, but if there was ever such a possibility there is nothing in the Bill which prevents the Party from taking advantage of their position as the majority party in this House.  As I have already said most people are making up their minds that such a possibility is out of the question.  I think it was Thomas a Kempis who, hundreds of years ago, accurately described what is practically the unanimous opinion of the Irish people when he said that &ldquo;no man securely governs who has not first learned to obey.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this measure to extend the powers of the Seanad, one has to ask himself what is the reasonable cause of, or the justification for it.  Knowing as we do from the debate that has taken place here, of the anxiety of the Government to consolidate a body of people in office in that Seanad, who we know quite well have nothing in common with the plain people of the country, for whom this Party speaks, we view with great anxiety the extension of powers to that Chamber.  We know quite well in what direction these powers will be used. I believe the people of the country have bitter experience of the sort of assistance and consideration that they will ever receive from the Party that has been enthroned in the Seanad. Reference has been made by the Deputy who last spoke as to the impossibility or the improbability of this Party ever getting into power or being in a position to formulate a budget.  I expect that he speaks on behalf of the class which he refers to and that in his case the wish is father to the thought.  Whether he is a true prophet or not, we tell him and we feel that if the Government were not afraid of that change there would be less anxiety and less urgency in forcing through these Bills than they have displayed.  They know perfectly well that in passing this Bill they are handing over to a Party control which will enable that Party in the Seanad to stand in the way of progress when the plain people in the country find themselves <Col N="1969" /> in a position to speak and act in this House.  That is the sole object of this measure.</P>
      <P>We are told that in this House we have democratic government, government derived from the people and we are told through all the inspired speeches and pronouncements from the press and platform, of the great powers and liberties which the Constitution has given to the people of this country.  We are told of the sacredness of defending these rights and liberties and we have had experience of the extremes to which the Government has gone in defending them.  If these things are sacred, if the people of the State are supreme, why not leave them that democratic power, even in a measure in which it exists to-day, and not deprive the people of these rights and liberties? Why this retrograde action of taking all democratic power from the people and handing back to the aristocrats, our old enemies, that power which we were told they had lost and which had been handed over to the people?  If there has been any retrograde action more than another which the present Government has openly displayed anxiety to follow, if there was any measure of democracy they have endeavoured to destroy more than another, it is that which this particular game has made patent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have no consideration for democracy. They have flouted it at every turn, and in these Bills now they have certainly shown their hand and, as far as the plain people are concerned, they can no longer be in any doubt.  It is clear that when a Party comes into power in this House, other than the present Government, they will be obstructed at every turn when they attempt to move along the way to economic or national progress.  It is only as that Party consider it safe from their point of view that a Government other than the present Government will have power to proceed.  Will anybody say that national and economic reform is not very pressing at present? Will the Ministers and Deputies opposite say even that the present trend of affairs can go on continuously? Will they claim that it is possible for <Col N="1970" /> the country to retain even its present very unenviable and precarious condition economically?  Will they say that they can safely confine themselves nationally to the present status of this country and continue to govern?  I am sure that they do not seriously conceive it possible for the country to go on in its present jaunty fashion driving fast to economic destruction.  Bankruptcy stares us in the face, and, unless something very radical takes place quickly, I have no hesitation in saying that this country will end up very suddenly.  No economic reform to deal with the present situation has been attempted by the Government, and none will be attempted, and any pressing reform that will be undertaken by any alternative Government will be obstructed by the present powers which are being handed over to this autocratic body.</P>
    <P>These are instances of how economic reform will be retarded.  We need not mention the fact that the national progress will always be retarded by the people who are receiving these additional powers from the House.  I am sure that there are people here who are very glad that they have forced the Government into this action.  There are people backing them because they are tied to them like lackeys and have not the courage to assert their own independence. I know they have a cringing spirit, and that it is with great reluctance they respond to the Whips and vote for these measures.  They represent a class that have nothing in common with the people into whose power their liberties are being handed over.  These people will have grave hesitation in going back on this issue to the people who elected them and asking for a mandate.  They know that they received no mandate from the plain people for this, and for that reason they would be very much afraid to go back and ask for such authority from their constituents.  If they are honest, they will assert their independence and refuse to vote away the liberties of the plain people to the ascendancy party, whose position, as far as we are concerned, has always been very well known, and we know that there is no change in it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde dealt with the point that certain matters on the programme of the Fianna Fáil Party will not be impeded by the powers given in this Bill from coming into force because they would come under the head of Money Bills.  The particular instance that I gave at another stage of this discussion was that of the Fianna Fáil Party if they were in power seeking to establish a State bank.  That would not come within the terms of a Money Bill, and the establishment of that bank, if it were done within the first two years, would be delayed for two years, and might be delayed beyond the period when the necessity for which it would be set up would have worked its worst evils on the country.  Then if it were taken during the last two years, if we take the average life of a Parliament at four years, it would come into force just at the time of the dissolution, and it would be another Parliament that would have the bringing into practical life of the measure created by the earlier Parliament.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Esmonde had seen our printed programme he would know that we are committed to the establishment of a central bank. There is nothing very radical in it. Most countries in Europe have already established central banks.  That is one case which shows the Stone Age elements that are being introduced into the Constitution.  We had a general argument in favour of another measure from Deputy Law, who argued that the English House of Lords, because it was such an absurd body, and was constituted in such a Stone Age way, worked out as a perfect institution.  I suppose that his argument was that the more stupid our Constitution is, and the more stupid the basis of our Seanad and the greater the powers given to the Seanad, the more likely it is to produce good results.  Of course, if one goes legislating on these lines one is at a loss to know whether one should use any intelligence in legislation at all. There is no doubt that if you are going <Col N="1972" /> to delay legislation for two years and set up such machinery as to hand over to a Stone Age Seanad the possibilities of holding up legislation for two years, you are going to render the real legislature, the Dáil, inefficient and of no use to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth emphasising again the contrast between the slowness of the Government in dealing with economic measures to save the country and the rush tactics in connection with measures like this Bill.  Is the giving of these powers to the Seanad going to save the country?  Is it going to decrease unemployment, raise the purchasing power of the people, lower prices, reduce emigration?  Is it going to have any healthy effect on the really serious issues affecting the country?  These are the terrible questions which are cutting into the life of the people.  Is it going to help the farmers out of their difficulties with their debts with the banks or with their annuities, which are due? Is it going to help the finances to be collected?  If not, why all this hurry? We on these benches would be the first to assist in rushing through any legislation that would help to maintain and to raise the economic vitality of the nation.  Here we have rush tactics adopted to such an extent that a whole Party is called upon to vote that black is white, that this country is in danger of a state of disturbance when it is in a perfectly peaceful condition and all for the purpose of getting through what?  A measure bearing on the Constitution, but which has nothing whatever to say to the economic crisis with which the country is faced.  The President to-day got an indication when he paid a visit to the other House as to how feeling is going in the country and how a conservative feeling is expressing itself in certain speeches even in that other House.  I hope, at this late stage, he will allow himself to be impressed by those who spoke in that other House; by those who never had association or were in sympathy with our Party, and who have been referred to by the President himself as antique furniture.  At the same time, these people are sufficiently alive to the principles of Government to see the deplorable condition to which the President and his <Col N="1973" /> Party are bringing the country and the demoralisation they are bringing upon the deliberative Assembly.  They are turning this place into something &mdash;perhaps I had better not follow up that line of argument&mdash;but the facts speak for themselves, and the facts do not add to the dignity of the House. We might as well be assisting at a prayer meeting as to hope that speech from any part of the House is going to influence the Government in the attitude they are taking up upon this Bill. The position was well indicated when the Minister for Finance said that the mistake the Fianna Fáil Party was making now was the mistake they made in adopting certain tactics on previous occasions.  He said when the Republicans went into the Four Courts they made the same kind of mistake as they are making now.  In other words, the implication was that as they blasted people out of the Four Courts so they were going to use parliamentary methods here which would blast us out of our position irrespective of the principles we represent and our attempt to use every parliamentary method so as to get a better mode of procedure and a better method of governing the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde, I think, more or less anticipated Deputy Little in trying to turn this Chamber into a place of prayer when he quoted Thomas á Kempis.  The quotation I think very apt.  I think it was: &ldquo;No man can rightly rule who has not truly learned to obey.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I hope I will not be in the position to argue back later from the particular to the general.  Deputy Esmonde argued that we would have no cause of complaint if, as he put it, in the remote possibility, we at one time became the Government.  He said we could bring in practically any of our suggested reforms as Money Bills. I know Deputy Esmonde has a good knowledge of the Constitution, and he certainly did not say that in ignorance. But he must be aware that we would be up against two Articles of the Constitution if we wanted to bring in anything as Money Bills.  First of all, suppose we say such a thing is a Money Bill, I think it is two-fifths of the members of the Dáil that could object to that ruling and have it referred to arbitration.  It is set out in Article 35 how that arbitration is to be composed. It is to be presided over by a senior judge of the Supreme Court.  We might not be able to pass that barrier, first of all.  Very likely, if we did not make a good case, we would not.  If it was not obviously a Money Bill we would not. Before we could come to that we would be up against a more serious Article, 37, of the Constitution.  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Money shall not be appropriated by vote, resolution or law, unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by a message from the representative of the Crown acting on the advice of the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>So that before we could bring in any reforms we must first convince the representative of the Crown that it is a Money Bill, and, what is more, that it is a proper Money Bill for the Oireachtas to pass.  Suppose, for example, and probably it would be a part of our programme, that we proposed to delete Article 37, would anybody expect that the representative of the Crown, if he has any sense at all&mdash; and I suppose he is a sensible man&mdash; would authorise that on the advice of the Executive Council and say that it was a proper Bill to bring in.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The real purpose of that Article is that money can only be voted by the Executive Council.  If that Article were not there it would be open to any member of the House to put down a motion to vote money. The Deputy will understand what difficulty would confront any Executive Council that would have to collect the money.  They are responsible for the imposition of taxation and for the collection of it.  The Deputy, who has some experience of administration will understand that it would be open to any member in any assembly to propose to spend money and there must be some limit or restriction in that connection if there is not going to be national bankruptcy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but I would like to give the President a little advice upon the question.  The President on a former occasion dealing with the constitution of the Seanad&mdash; and these are the people who are going to hold up legislation for twenty months&mdash;indicated that as a result of the bargain made between the two countries, it was undertaken by this side to give the minority representation in the Seanad for I think twenty or thirty years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to a different point now.  We are therefore in this position, that if, in the remote possibility that Deputy Esmonde referred to, a Bill were brought in by some other Government, because it is not likely to arise with the present Government, or that the present Government would be up against that particular section in the Seanad, you would have to get it through those people, and they have power to hold up a Bill for twenty months.  That particular section of the Seanad are admittedly nominated by the Crown in this country, and again and again, outside at any rate, we have pointed out that it is a defect from the independence point of view in this country to have our Bills signed by the King and the King's representative.  We have been told that it is merely a formal matter.  If it be a formal matter there is no necessity for it or anything else as long as the Government has its members in the Seanad to hold up Bills for twenty months.</P>

      <P>One does not like to be personal.  Supposing a new Government whatever it may be, get over that barrier and supposing after the eighteen months the Bill is brought up again and finally goes through the Seanad you then have to go to the final barrier and have to get the signature of the King's representative.  I admit that that under present circumstances is merely a formal matter, but suppose we were to come up against a question of depriving the King's representative or the King of certain powers which he holds under the Constitution, I do not know if the matter would be formal and then if the Government were to take a <Col N="1979" /> strong attitude on that matter they would in all probability not be joined by the Seanad.  I think that on the whole we are handing powers over to the Seanad which are hardly under any conceivable circumstances going to be used for the advancement or betterment of this country, but in all probability they will be used if this country attempts to make any advance towards a more independent national status.  The argument I believe which has been the most reasonable one we have heard for this Bill was that certain powers were taken from the Seanad under the Bill which has passed through this House and gone to the Seanad and this is more or less making up to them by giving them further powers than they had under this particular Article of the Constitution. I think it has been fairly well pointed out&mdash;I do not know if everyone has been convinced but it seems a rather convincing argument at any rate that by losing the Referendum the Seanad in fact lost no powers whatsoever because they were not likely, under any circumstances, to use that Referendum and because it is most likely that the Seanad would disagree with this House on a thing which was popular in the country and which the Seanad, being a conservative body, would try to hold up or prevent going through if they could at all.  Therefore, by having a Referendum on the question the Seanad would almost certainly be beaten on their objection to a Bill going through.  So that by losing that particular power the Seanad, as at present constituted, are not losing anything.  If the Seanad was composed of more advanced people nationally, industrially or in any other way and were likely to refer certain measures to the people that would be likely to meet with popular support, you would be taking from them a real power; that is the Referendum.  But in this particular case where you have a more conservative body in the Seanad than you have in the Dáil you are not taking any power from them.  Therefore, there was no necessity to compensate them for a power that they were not going to use when it was not going to be to their advantage.  You are giving them instead a power to hold <Col N="1980" /> up Bills for twenty months.  It is quite evident that this power is not going to be used either to hold up Bills of the type of the Public Safety Act as we know from experience.  The Bills that would be likely to be held up would be Bills giving more power, nationally or economically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this thirteenth stepping-stone to a Republic I hope it will prove to be the unlucky one for the Government.  I was very much intrigued by Deputy Esmonde when he spoke of our Party never coming into power.  Speaking as one who has had his fingers on the pulse of the electorate for the last few weeks I must say that our stock is rising by leaps and bounds.  In the recent elections I found that a number of people who, a few years ago, shook their heads and said they could not vote for us, either remained at home or came to vote for us.  There is nothing more ridiculous than increasing the powers of the Seanad for the reason that was given. It is ridiculous to say that doing away with the Referendum was taking power away from the Seanad, because probably in a short time the Referendum would have been used to do away with the Seanad, and it would be done with the blessings of the whole people.  I do not believe that one-sixteenth of the people at the present time want the Seanad.  The idea of giving the Seanad power to hold up legislation passed in this Dáil for eighteen months shows very clearly that the President realises what way the country is going. I may tell him that the country is heartily sick of the manner in which this Dáil is carrying on.  It is sick of seeing us for weeks and months here arguing about the Constitution which nobody wants while there is unemployment and starvation in the country.  It is ridiculous to be wasting the time of an Assembly that should be doing something to help the people.  If the President wants to get the whole country behind him let him place all the Articles of the Constitution here on the floor and burn them.  In that way he would be doing something that would at least unite the people.  Instead of taking one little Article or another let him pack the whole lot back <Col N="1981" /> to Georgie.  In that way he would be doing something creditable.  There was too much trouble in this country for the past two centuries in trying to wrest power out of the hands of these gentlemen to be now handing it back to them again.  Lives were lost in trying to get it out of their hands, and it should not be given back to them now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I have to make a complaint against the President in regard to this Bill, that he has not justified the proposal contained in it. What is the purpose of this delay? When the provisions for the Referendum were still contained in the Constitution there was some justification for giving a body or a section of this Dáil, or another body, power to hold up legislation passed by this House, but now that the provision for the Referendum has been practically excised from the Constitution what purpose is going to be served by permitting legislation to be held up?  If the legislation is good legislation, if it is going to be profitable to the people, why not allow it to be enforced at once?  If, on the other hand, it is going to be disadvantageous, if its effects and consequences are going to be evil what virtue is there in deferring that evil or suspending it for a period if at the end of that period it automatically begins to operate?  Surely the President must have had some principle of public good in his mind to which he wished to give effect when he drafted this Bill.  There must have been some principle of government operating.  Or did he draft it in the dark and conceive it in a moment of mental aberration and simply come along and say: &ldquo;I have been inspired, whether by heaven or the nether regions I do not know, and the fruits of the inspiration I put up to the Dáil and they have got to pass them whether they be for the good or for the bane of this country.&rdquo; What purpose, again I ask, is to be served by holding up legislation if it is good, and what benefit if it is bad if at the end of the period of suspension it comes automatically into force?  If a section of this House, or if the Seanad thinks legislation is bad surely it ought then be referred immediately <Col N="1982" /> to the judgment of the people.  If there is no machinery for so referring it then what does it matter whether it is held up or not?  Would it not be better, if it is going to be ultimately evil, to let that legislation come immediately into force so that the people, experiencing the disadvantages and the ill consequences of it, should compel the Government which introduced it and which was responsible for it to repeal it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community as a whole are not going to derive any benefits from the proposals contained in this Bill.  Who is going to derive any advantage?  Can the President tell this House or answer that question&mdash;who is going to derive benefit or advantage from the proposals contained in this Bill?  A certain House is going to have its powers extended. If it could hold up legislation previously for nine months, now under this Bill I think it can have power and will have power to hold it up for twenty months.  Who is going to reap the advantage of that?  The House which can hold up legislation is going to have its position strengthened in respect to this House.  It is going to be put into a better position for bargaining and God knows, as experience in the past fortnight has shown to us, that position with respect to this Executive Council does not require to be strengthened because that particular Executive Council is under the control of that Seanad and the section of the people who are represented there in greatest strength.  And the President who entered life as an Irish Nationalist, as a spokesman for the people. as a democratic representative, now when the exigencies of his political situation in this House drive him to it. he makes a bargain by which he strengthens and increases the influence of those who stood against the Irish people in the past, and under this Constitution endows that particular interest and class with a privilege which is already beginning to be denied to them in Great Britain.  By what right of intellect, by what right of public service, by what right of personal merit or private character are those who compose the Seanad entitled to that special privilege?  If it is given <Col N="1983" /> to them again I say what public advantage or benefit are the people of this Nation as a whole going to reap as a result of that transaction?  I think that before this Bill goes through we are entitled to have from the President some explanation, some justification for the proposal contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde, in concluding his speech, I think, said: &ldquo;They cannot rightly rule who have not truly learned to obey.&rdquo;  The President is proving to those who keep him in office, and whose votes are essential for his majority in this House, that he is entitled rightly to rule the Irish people since he has learned truly to obey them.  The President is entitled to pretend to rule, to play the public pretence of ruling the Irish people because he has learned to obey those who speak for imperialism in Westmoreland Street, in Trinity College and every other citadel of the old imperialism in this country.  That is his claim for office.  That is his justification for this Bill, to show that he has truly learned to obey; and it is because he is willing in his obedience, because he is always amenable to their discipline, that, as was avowed today in another place, those people are tearing out of this Constitution, by their votes, the safeguards which they themselves devised for their own position, because they find that other people are turning to the use of the Irish nation the instrument that was originally forged and originally intended to prevent us from reaching the goal which we had set out to reach. Though they are doing that, though they are tearing out of the Constitution Articles 47 and 48, they are driving a bargain.  They are good commercial politicians.  On the pretence that they are giving something which they themselves have already realised is of no value to them, but of great value to the Irish people, on the pretence that they are surrendering these rights and safeguards embodied in Articles 47 and 48, they are securing in this Bill and under other similar Bills which the President has introduced here, further powers and privileges for themselves. They are entrenching themselves more surely here, in order to defeat what the <Col N="1984" /> President himself must know &mdash; because he is, after all, of the people and sprung from the people &mdash; what are after all the indefeasable aspirations of the people.  Now I am anxious, if I can, to hold the President's attention, because I would like him really to give us a reasoned argument in support of this proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We do not know what were the great reasons that compelled him hurriedly, in the months that should be devoted normally to the consideration of the country's finances and the general administrative services &mdash; we do not know what inspired him to come here to us and say: &ldquo;Here are nine Bills to amend the Constitution &mdash; you must pass them.&rdquo;</P>

Bills thrust on the Dáil in the very months when we should be engaged on the consideration of the finances of the country on the one hand, and the administrative expenditure on the other hand, and, as my colleague reminds us, there are the claims of the farmers and the business community, to make hay while there is any sun shining in Ireland, to be considered. We have these things thrown at us, and we have to stay up day and night to consider them.  We never sat up a night to consider the problem of unemployment, and we never sat up a night to consider how the Minister for Finance might lighten the burden of taxation on the people instead of having to impose upon them an extra million.</P>

That is our great objection to them. They have come to us fresh from the brain of President Cosgrave, but without one single word of explanation to expound or justify them.  In view of that we are entitled before this Bill goes through &mdash; I say goes through very advisedly, because I know that the majority in the House will be whipped as usual into the division lobbies in support of it &mdash; we are entitled to have some explanation and justification for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose the principle contained in Section 5, and we are doing it by an amendment to delete sub-section (1) (a).  On the Committee Stage we tried to and succeeded in deleting what then was sub-section (b), but we failed to delete sub-section (c), so, in order to get rid of what we considered a wrong principle in this Bill, we are now attempting to delete sub-section (a).  To refresh the minds of the House I will just read the section again:</P>
      <P>(1)  In addition to the jurisdictions conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal by Section 34 of the Principal Act, the Court of Criminal Appeal or, on appeal, the Supreme Court shall have the following jurisdictions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Court may notwithstanding that they are of opinion that a point raised in an appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were glad to see the House taking up an independent attitude at the earlier stage of this Bill, and that after careful consideration it rejected the point of view of the Minister for Justice and deleted a clause which contained a principle, which the House rightly considered was a faulty innovation, an innovation into the law which was dangerous to the subject <Col N="1989" /> and was giving too much power to the judge to the extent of ousting, or, at least, usurping the jurisdiction of the jury by curtailing the chances of clemency which might accrue to a person who is being tried.  We argued this matter before, and I hope when we argue it again that the House will take as open-minded a view of it as it did before, and form its own judgment, and delete sub-section (a).  We argued before that the machinery of the law is there against one man, that the whole forces of the State are there against one single individual, that prosecuting counsel has had ample opportunity of drafting the indictment properly, that the judge has had ample opportunity of charging the jury properly, and that, therefore, there is no reasonable excuse for the jury making what amounts to a purely technical mistake.  It is merely to prevent the person charged from getting the benefit of a technical mistake that this clause is here at all.  In most cases a mistake made by a jury will be made on the ground of error, either by the prosecuting counsel or by the judge.  It will not occur very often, and, when it does occur, we consider that it would be a worse evil to give a judge power to assume the position of a jury than even if one criminal were to escape.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice seemed to be dissatisfied that when we had our own way on one sub-section, we did not agree then to the other sub-sections, but it is necessary to point out that we did not agree to sub-section (b). In general, we considered that it was not a proper principle to apply.  When we consider the Bill as a whole from the point of view of criminal proceedings, this is the most important principle involved in the Bill apart from the question of the Irish language.  It is what you might call a sort of omnibus Bill.  It deals with what the Government considers to be defects in the original Bill.  It is not a Bill containing one principle and carrying out the consequential results of that principle. <Col N="1990" /> It is a Bill dealing with various matters.  A most important principle from the purely legal point of view is contained in this Section 5.  If Section 5 is passed as it stands, we naturally object to (b) as much as we did to (a) but we cannot delete (b) because we were defeated on the Committee Stage.  So in principle we consider the whole Bill as wrong and from that point of view we are opposing it and we are opposing, in particular, Section 5 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was rather struck by one expression used by Deputy Little in his remarks, and I propose to confine myself to that aspect of it.  He said that it is to prevent a person getting the benefit of a technical mistake this section is here at all.  Is it Deputy Little's position that a criminal should be allowed to escape punishment because of a technical mistake? No machinery is perfect and we must contemplate that now and again in the course of the administration of justice a technical mistake would be made.  Apparently, Deputy Little's position is that if such a mistake is made and that when a person who has admittedly and obviously committed a crime has the luck to have such a mistake made, in the conduct of the case against him, he should be allowed to escape.  That is an argument I think which will not commend itself to any Deputy on any side of the House.</P>

      <P>Amendment 3 and that part of amendment 8 which deals with Justices of the District Court are outside the scope of the Bill.  They deal with the qualifications of judges generally, and an amendment was already ruled out in Committee dealing with the question of the age of judges.  Amendment 7 is in order, as it deals with assistant justices only.  The Bill actually creates the office of assistant justice and sets out some qualifications.  Amendment 8 can, I think, be put in order by deleting from it the reference to Justices of the District Court, so that it will read &ldquo;shall be appointed by an assistant justice.&rdquo;  The question of the qualifications of judges generally cannot be raised on this Bill.  I am disposed to allow amendments 7 and 8 to be debated together.  They are alternative propositions referring to assistant <Col N="1994" /> justices only.  I take it that would meet the wishes of the Minister and Deputy Fahy.</P>

      <Col N="1995" /> The following amendments appeared on the Paper:</P>
    <P>7.  In page 5, line 1, Section 13, to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) After the 1st January, 1935, no person shall be appointed as assistant justice unless the Minister shall certify under his hand that such person has a competent knowledge of the Irish language.&rdquo;&mdash; (Proinnsias O Fathaigh.)</P>
    <P>8. In page 5, line 21, before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No person admitted to practise as a barrister or admitted a solicitor after the passing of this Act shall be appointed a Justice of the District Court or an assistant justice unless before he is so appointed he satisfies the Minister that he possesses a competent knowledge of the Irish language.&mdash;(Aire Dlí agus Cirt.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally admitted that neither the benchers nor the Incorporated Law Society have been notorious for Irish-Ireland proclivities or tendencies.  Even in the Gaeltacht Report it is admitted that the law courts have been one of the great instruments for Anglicisation and an obstacle to the re-Gaelicisation of the country, and every opportunity should be availed of to force the hands of the two branches of the legal profession.</P>
      <P>I know they are hedged round with charters and privileges of all kinds, but the Dáil has an opportunity here of doing something towards the Gaelicisation of the department of law.  We are supposed, on both sides of this House, to have the ideal of a Gaelic State.  We can now take a step towards the realisation of that ideal. As amendments 7 and 8 are to be taken together I might state that I am pleased to see this amendment put down by the Minister for Justice, and I would like to understand the implications of it.  It is usual, I believe, to, appoint to such posts only barristers who have ten years' practice.  I do not know if the same rule obtains as regards solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure of the exact words, but <Col N="1996" /> I think that it is six years for barristers and ten years for solicitors.  That is my recollection.  The Deputy will not take me as being completely accurate. I know there is a limit of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean that for one branch of the legal profession this amendment would be of no value for six years and for the other branch for ten years.  It cannot become operative until after these periods, and even after these two periods there would be no compulsion upon the Minister to see that the assistant justice selected could conduct the business of his court in Irish, because he would be left a wide field of selection of present practising barristers and solicitors to be selected from.  I have an objection to the Minister's amendment, which applies equally to my own amendment, and that is that it might be better to say: &ldquo;Unless the Civil Service Commissioners are satisfied that the candidate has a good knowledge of Irish and can transact the business of the court through Irish,&rdquo; rather than leave it to the Minister.  In practice, I suppose that is how it would work out.  I do not know whether the Minister himself would take on himself to judge if the candidates had sufficient knowledge of Irish, but if the Minister would add that to his amendment he would expand it in some way so as not to leave a mere minority, as they would be even in six or seven or ten years' time, qualified to do the business in Irish.  In fact, it might be a small minority, or only a minority of a minority might take up the study of Irish. I do not know if the Minister could make Irish compulsory for the examination of the two branches of the profession; it would be much more effective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid so, because I know such things were considered before, but if the Minister would add &ldquo;no person admitted to practise as a barrister or admitted a solicitor after the passing of this Act shall be appointed an assistant justice unless before he is appointed he satisfies the Minister that he possesses a competent knowledge of the Irish language.&rdquo;  I <Col N="1997" /> do not see why the amendment such as I have suggested could not be added to that, and that after the 1st January, 1935, no person should be appointed an assistant justice unless the Minister or the Civil Service Commissioners shall certify that such person has a competent knowledge of the Irish language. I wonder would the Minister consider adding that to his amendment?  We would have something effective then, because although it is good to see the Minister's amendment, and it goes somewhere towards Gaelicising the courts, it would have very little effect, I am afraid, inside the next twenty years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fahy that his amendment and the amendment I propose are not all inconsistent.  But I cannot accept Deputy Fahy's suggestion that the two should be put into one for this reason: that it would be limiting too much, in my opinion, the field of choice.  The main object of appointing a District Justice is that he should be competent to carry out the duties of his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me?  I would like to draw his attention to the fact that we were speaking only of assistant justices here and that they will be a very small minority of District Justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only four, but an assistant District Justice must be competent to carry out the work of his court.  Every person who becomes a litigant in the courts is entitled to have a competent judge to decide between him and the other person with whom he may be engaged in litigation.  The competence of the justice in his judicial capacity is the first thing that we must look for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not <Col N="1998" /> sufficient optimism as to our national language as to hope that by 1935 he could get four lawyers with sufficient knowledge of the Irish language to conduct the business in Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to make my point?  Possibly I may be able to answer him and he may not have to put these questions if he allows me to proceed.  The first thing I said we must look to is competence.  It is not everybody who is called to the Bar or everybody who is admitted a solicitor who is competent to act in the humblest judicial capacity.  The assistant justices now have a great deal of work to do.  They have a great deal more than the old Petty Sessions work to do.  They have to do a great deal of civil work as well as administering the ordinary criminal law.  They have to administer the law of contract, for instance, up to a very substantial figure. They must be men who have a very competent knowledge of law.  This amendment only deals with four particular positions.  There are only four Assistant District Justices, and there may not be another appointment between this and 1935.  I do not know when there will be another appointment. No one can say.  After 1935, or for that matter before 1935, if competent men have applied for vacant posts, if this Party is in power, the men who have a competent knowledge of Irish will get the preference.  But if no competent man with a knowledge of Irish applies, what are you to do? Either to leave the post vacant or to appoint an incompetent man?  I would ask the Deputy just to consider the real history.  The Deputy, I think, is on the eve of joining the profession himself and he knows a good deal about this profession.  I would ask him to consider that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very few men at the Bar and very few solicitors who do know Irish at present.  Where are they to come from? Also the Deputy may say some will set to work and learn Irish now but it is not easy to acquire a spoken knowledge of Irish and I think it would be rather a catastrophe if a judge were hearing in Irish who was <Col N="1999" /> not really a fluent Irish speaker; he might easily make a mistake.  He would have to be very good at Irish or not hear his cases in Irish at all.  It is very difficult for a man say of thirty-nine to acquire a really correct accurate knowledge of spoken Irish.  If such a man is produced no doubt he will get preference from any Government which is in office, as far as we can see the likelihood of what Governments will be in office after the year 1935.  I would suggest to the Deputy that he should be content with the amendment I have put forward. Sometimes mistakes may be made by going too fast.  You may sometimes defeat your own aims by going a little bit too fast.  You may do harm where you would like to do good if you speed up too much.  If you do the first lap of a half-mile race too fast you may be beaten long before you reach the winning post, and we have a very long and difficult course to run before we manage to make this country an Irish-speaking country, and we may do ourselves a considerable amount of harm if we speed up too much in the beginning. I would suggest to the Deputy that that motion of mine which I believe will make the majority of persons at the Irish Bar and the majority of Irish solicitors take up seriously the study of the Irish language would be far more beneficial to the Irish language than the Deputy's motion and I would ask the Deputy to be satisfied with the suggestion I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister be prepared to accept the suggestion of Deputy Fahy with respect to replacing the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; there by the words &ldquo;Civil Service Commissioners&rdquo; and also adding &mdash;&ldquo;competent knowledge of Irish&rdquo; is very indefinite &mdash;&ldquo;a knowledge of Irish which would be sufficient to enable him to use the Irish language in the performance of his duties.&rdquo;  What is meant by a competent knowledge of Irish would be made more explicit by a statement that it is a knowledge which would enable him to use the Irish language in the performance of his duties, to use the Irish language exclusively, if such were needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>

      <P>I think we could devise now a form of words to that effect, but I do not like the suggestion about the Civil Service Commissioners, that is to say, about the mere holding of an examination.  I think, after all, that whoever is the Minister for Justice can be trusted to satisfy himself.  I do not like entirely this idea of an examination for judicial appointments.  It is a little, if I may say so, retrograde.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the examination.  We may have the same idea, and we do not want to quarrel about words.  I am talking of the same kind of examination as the Minister has in mind.  The examination of mine is the examination conducted for the specific purpose of finding out whether the applicant or person about to be appointed had in fact a knowledge of Irish sufficient to enable him to carry out his duties properly.</P>

I would not know amongst solicitors undoubtedly, but then I would immediately make it my business to see that an official of my Department &mdash; and there are excellent Irish speakers in my Department &mdash; had a conversation with the proposed District Justice.</P>

      <P>The Deputy understands me when I say that.  The status of a judge ought to be different from the status of a civil servant.  In public opinion I think that is so, and if judges were pressed to go in and pass examinations I do not think they would have exactly the same status in the country that they have; and status, I submit for the consideration of Deputy de Valera, is an important thing.  This is only for assistants at present, but I ask the Deputy on behalf of his Party to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>A different question of responsibility comes in for those appointments, and I think the Minister ought to be made to accept responsibility for appointing the proper person.  Suppose we find a man appointed who had not a competent knowledge of Irish, it may rest with the Minister for Justice to divest himself of the responsibility for the appointment and try to put it on to the Civil Service Commissioners.  I think it would be better from the point of view of Irish that the responsibility should be definitely put on the Minister, who would be answerable directly to the <Col N="2002" /> Dáil if that were done.  I am just throwing that suggestion out.  It would be preferable from the point of view of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point arising out of Deputy O'Connell's suggestion.  The suggestion to put in anyone else except a Minister is constantly made.  When responsibility is placed on a Minister definitely in a statute dealing with this or any other matter the Minister may always be questioned about it in the House.  The matter is always capable of being raised in some way in the House, whereas if it is not fixed on the Minister he may not be questioned on it. For example, in one particular measure the Chief Justice was given certain powers instead of the Minister.  The Minister later refused to answer questions on it, and quite properly refused and it was impossible to raise the matter here.  If it is left to the Minister he may, by some process in the Dáil, be made to answer in these matters.  We are discussing now only the appointments of four assistant district justices.  The important thing is amendment 3, which has been ruled out of order, and which contained the main principle.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister from introducing that principle into an appropriate measure. The particular amendment before us is dealing with a much smaller thing.</P>

      <P>No, it is what is in the Bill.  We are discussing something that is not in the Bill at all. In the Bill that is before us there is nothing about the qualifications of judges as such.  There is something about assistant justices, and in that way Deputy Fahy's amendment is completely within the scope of the Bill. The principle contained in amendment 3 is a wide principle applying to a different kind of judge altogether.</P>

      <P>I agree with you, A Chinn Comhairle, that the main principle is really contained in amendment 3.  Nevertheless I feel bound to say that I regret very much the introduction of this amendment by the Minister. What I have to say, no matter what Deputies may think, is not prompted by any anti-Nationalist feeling whatever.  In fact, I could have used almost the identical words of the Minister himself in proposing his amendment in saying what I have to say against the amendment.  I do not believe that this kind of policy will secure the object which is aimed at. I believe it will actually militate against that object and militate very strongly.  Whether that is the correct view or not, it may be said that time alone can tell.  Personally, I am convinced that that will be found hereafter to be the truth.  But, as the Minister himself said, the most important thing in connection with judicial matters is to get the man who is the most qualified from the legal point of view for the particular post that he is asked to fill.  The essential thing for the common people and everyone else in the country is that the law should be administered by the best people.  If it were a case, as the Minister said, of two men who were equal in other respects then, by all means, apply a condition like this.  If it were the case that the District Justice or the Assistant District Justice had to administer the law in an Irish-speaking district, then the man who could not speak Irish, obviously, would not be as well qualified for the work as the one who could, but for the great good of the people of the country the essential thing is that the law is administered in <Col N="2004" /> the best way.  Therefore, I regret this very much.  I believe when the time to which his amendment refers comes to operate he will be curtailing too much the sphere from which he can make his selection for such appointments as will then have to be filled.  I feel bound to express that regret and, if it were any use, I would go so far as to carry my protest into the lobby and vote against it.</P>

      <P>I would like to supplement Deputy Thrift's remarks. I think the Minister is now narrowing down the sphere of these appointments to the South of Ireland.  This amendment will cut out any law student who may come from the North of Ireland, and a very considerable number come from the North, to practise in the Free State even at present.  I do not think that is wise.  Personally I am very anxious that the work of spreading the language should proceed in a thorough and scientific way, but I think this will more or less be another line of division between the Irishmen of the North and the Irishmen of the South.  I am sorry that this rule should be made absolute. I think <i>caeteris paribus</i> when you have two men of equal judicial standing and experience the Irish speaker should get the preference.  I would extend that principle to other appointments than the Bench.  But to make it <Col N="2005" /> absolute I think is at present inadvisable.</P>

      <P>I wonder does Deputy Alton understand the meaning of this particular amendment that we are discussing now.  I do not think he does.  He thinks it has a much wider application than what Deputy Fahy would say it has.  It is merely giving a warning to anybody who comes into the legal profession, either as a solicitor or a barrister, not that he cannot practise in an Irish court, but that he need not look for an appointment as an assistant District Justice after this date.  That is all the amendment means.  It does not mean very much indeed, but such as it is I welcome it from the Minister.  It does not seem to me to limit the field very much, and possibly it will act as a slight encouragement to young men coming into the legal profession to take up the study of the language.  It will have that object and, in so far as it has, it will do good.  I do not think anybody can argue that it limits, to any great extent, the field of selection for these appointments.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Fahy could speak with more authority on this subject than I could, but I imagine that unless a boy had a very early training in Irish he would not have much chance to obtain a competent knowledge of the language so as to enable him to act as a District Justice using the language daily in his courts.  Deputy Fahy, perhaps, could enlighten me on that point.  I think the boy who does not take up Irish at a very early age would not be able to acquire a competent knowledge of it. That is what I, a priori, think.</P>

    <P>This is simply bringing the powers of the District Court into line with the powers which the Circuit and High Courts have in the matter of ejectments. In the High Court and in the Circuit Court there is no power to bring an ejectment unless there is a year's rent due, and this is making it clear that the District Court shall have the same power.  Of course when there is less than a year's rent due there is always a remedy for getting possession of your house by serving a week's or a month's notice to quit.  But the actual ejectment does not lie with the High Court, and therefore, as Deputy J.T. Wolfe put it, should not be in the Circuit Court either.</P>

The District Justices have the same power now in Dublin as they have outside.  It was designed that the Statute of Limitations should be the same in Dublin as outside, but it was pointed out that possibly the Petty Sessions Act would not apply to Dublin unless there was a special section making it apply; that is to say, if they deleted the old Dublin statute and did not make the Petty Sessions Act apply, then there might be no limitations at all, so in case that might be a sound argument I am <Col N="2010" /> moving this amendment to make it perfectly clear.</P>

    <P>When land is bought by the Land Commission and vested in the tenant purchaser, after vesting it is registered under the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891.  Of course, there are a very large number of holdings registered <Col N="2013" /> every month.  Every farm purchased under every Act since 1903 and vested has been registered.  The aim of the Registration of Title Act was to simplify land tenures.  It was realised that the land of Ireland was passing over from the owners, who held under all sorts of tenures, fee-farm rents, fee simple, long leases and so on, and was being passed to the tenants under a tenure which was fee simple.  It was provided under the Act of 1891 that, after vesting, the title should be registered under the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891.  The effect is that if any farmer whose land was vested wanted title he got his solicitor to write to the Registration of Title Office and got the folio, which set out that the land was situate in such a place and that it was of a certain acreage, and it also set out any charges which were registered subsequent to the vesting. Take a case where there was no such charge, where the tenant purchased the land and it was vested in him in fee-simple, and where there were no dealings in the land since purchase. The folio in that case would set out the area of the land and the description of it.  That document, known as a folio, is evidence in any court.  There is attached to it a map, which sets out the exact boundaries, easements, etc.  If a tenant had a dispute with his neighbour as to a right of way or as to a portion of a field, all he has got to do is to get a copy of the folio, hand it to the judge in court, and it must be accepted for what it sets out on its face.  It is final and conclusive.  It was realised that all sorts of rights might possibly attach to lands which were vested.  In the case I mention, the simple case of a tenant purchaser who purchased his land under any Act since 1903, and whose land is vested and registered in the Registration of Title Office, it is realised that various persons might have claims on that land.</P>
    <P>The tenant purchaser's father might have died five years previously.  There might be two of his brothers in America, one in a shop in the town, and another somewhere else in the country. The father might have died without making a will and all the sons are entitled to claims on the land.  It was <Col N="2014" /> rightly considered at the time that it would be impossible to investigate all possible titles.  They got over the difficulty by having the lands registered subject to equity.  The idea was that fee simple was a graft on the tenancy, and any claims existing against the tenant should be put against the fee as registered under the Local Registration of Titles Act.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has been in operation for some time and has received a large number of applications for loans. In all the circumstances they can only take one form of security from small farmers.  That is a mortgage on the land.  The applicants generally are people who hold land in fee simple. The Corporation, when they get applications for such loans, apply to the owner for title.  He sends up a copy of his folio and the Corporation then find, for instance, that the applicant is registered subject to equity.  The position for them is that they have either to take a mortgage on that land and register it on the folio as security, or they must ask the owner of the land, the tenant purchaser, to discharge equities and to show that there are no prior claims which existed on the land before it was purchased and vested.  In the case of a small farmer it takes anything from £5 to £7 to discharge equity and it takes a couple of months to complete it.  Searches have to be made, deeds have to be investigated, and so on, and it is found, as a result of that experience, that it is not worth while for a small farmer to go to the trouble and expense of discharging equities to get a loan.  That difficulty is holding up the operations of the Credit Corporation.  They are in a position to make a large number of loans if they get the security they want, which is a first mortgage on the land against which there are no other claims.  While that note as to equities remains on the folio they do not know what claims may be against the land. It is provided by this Bill that a mortgage in favour of the Credit Corporation shall take priority not to other mortgages registered on the land, but to equities.  That is the effect of the Bill.  It is an important provision.  It will mean that if it is passed speedily <Col N="2015" /> the Credit Corporation can begin operations almost on a wholesale scale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have explained that.  I should suggest that Deputies read it afterwards in the light of my explanation.  A is the registered owner of land.  He was the tenant when the land was purchased. The land was vested in him.  He got it from his father who died intestate five or six years before the land was vested and there were two other sons as well as A.  These two sons are elsewhere. A is the tenant who fell in for the land and it was vested in him. He gets a loan from the Corporation after this Bill is passed.  Under the terms of the Bill there is a mortgage registered by the Corporation.  It takes priority over the equitable claims of his two brothers, who have claims against the land, as they are equally entitled as well as he, owing to their father dying intestate.  That loan was got, say, for the purchase of stock or for some casual purpose &mdash; a purpose entirely to the advantage of the registered owner.  It is only right if the land comes to be sold that the interest of A., the registered owner, the man who got the loan, should be made first liable in respect of that loan.  It is only right, if the loan has to be paid to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, if the lands are sold, as the result of proceedings taken by the Corporation and the loan paid off out of the purchase money, that the man who got the money, A. and who was living on <Col N="2016" /> the land, should be liable to his two brothers, so far as his special interest in the land is concerned.  Take, for instance, a farm worth £300.  A, B and C have each £100 interest.  That is their equitable claim to the land, because their father died, and they are equally entitled to that amount in the event of the land being sold.  Suppose that the Credit Corporation has given a loan to A of £70, and that the land is sold and fetches £300.  The Corporation gets the £70, but A's interest in the land must first of all pay off his liabilities to his two brothers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is in the case of a loan for a casual purpose, but if it is got for permanently improving the land, then it is felt that the loan is made to increase the productivity of land which is made more valuable for selling, and that there should be no distinction as to equities as between either A, B or C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that explanation was given because it makes that section very plain.  I am not under any misapprehension about this Bill.  I believe the Bill as far as it goes is a good one.  There might be some small amendments suggested but I am not under any great misapprehension as to what it is going to do for the farming community.  I believe the farming community at the present time is scarcely in a position to pay interest on loans &mdash; in particular farmers are scarcely in a position to pay 6 per cent. We would have been more gratified if some of the other defects in the original Act were dealt with when this Bill was being introduced.  I know there are great difficulties in reducing the interest but there were suggestions made for instance that something could be done about speeding up the deposits that should be made with the Corporation so that they could give out money at a lower interest, or that something should be done about speeding up the creation of credit societies so that deposits could be obtained from these societies eventually. That point of the rate of interest seems to be of more importance to the farmer at the present time than <Col N="2017" /> the point of equities because I believe there are very few farmers at present who can make farming pay or get capital at the rate of six per cent. in order to start farming or revive it as the case may be.  However, as far as the Bill goes it is all right and I am only finding fault with how far it does not go.</P>
      <P>There are just a few points which we might ask the Minister to reply to when concluding.  There is one point in reference to the sum of £200.  I do not know why £200 is introduced.  It is an arbitrary sum and as we all know, giving a loan to a man whose valuation, taking buildings and lands together, is not £10 is quite a different thing to giving a loan to a man whose valuation may be £200.  I thought when this Bill was introduced that some sort of sliding scale might be instituted and that a man might be given a loan according to his valuation&mdash;perhaps eight or ten times the valuation, instead of £200, because it does appear that a man with a large valuation, and 80 or 100 acres of land, can easily be allowed a loan of more than £200 while a man with a small valuation and a very limited amount of buildings, would not be entitled to £200.  Of course, I know there is no difficulty in getting any sum below £200 because the Corporation can exercise a discretion in that matter but it is limiting them to the amount of £200 where they could give more&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a man could be asked to discharge the equities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the answer, that if a man is entitled to ask for a loan of £500 he can afford to discharge the equities, but there may be great difficulty. I have been informed of a few difficulties which seem reasonable. There is delay.  There is the cost, which may not be very heavy.  It might be £20 in cases of that sort, but there are also some very difficult cases, where it would be nearly impossible to find out definitely about relatives in America and that sort of thing.  There is also another point arising out of Section 4, line 56, which I would like to hear explained.  It seems that minors and lunatics, as the case may be, are at a disadvantage under this Bill.  In all other cases, as far as I can learn, where <Col N="2018" /> a person has a claim, he has an unlimited time to make that claim, but in the case of a minor he must make the claim before he reaches twenty-five years of age.  I do not know why he should be at a disadvantage in that way.  That is all I wish to say on the matter.  The Bill is not very difficult and not too long, and if those two small points were cleared up and we were satisfied on them, I think the Bill would be very satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Dr. Ryan in welcoming this Bill.  We are all aware that there has been considerable difficulty in the operation of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. So far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we are only too anxious to help as far as we can. There are a few points in connection with the Bill to which I would like to call attention.  The first is in connection with the defects of the original Act.  We are looking forward to the time &mdash; and I hope the Minister will be able to give us some indication that he is looking into this matter &mdash; when the Act will be adjusted in such a way that it will be possible for small farmers as well as large farmers to take advantage of it.  The first matter that requires attention is the question of getting cheap money.  I fail to see how the Minister for Agriculture can be hopeful that he will succeed in financing agricultural operations with profit, even if he succeeds in putting the creamery industry on a very sound basis, if he charges interest at the rate of six per cent.  In England, they have advanced a certain amount from Government sources, and if deposits are not forthcoming from Credit Societies, perhaps the Government would imitate the example of the British Government in making a certain amount available free of interest for a certain time, at least until such <Col N="2019" /> time as the present period of depression has passed.  The trouble is that the farmers who are down and out can see very little hope of getting any assistance at present, even if they are able to pay the interest. They are, perhaps, up to their necks in difficulties with banks, and these farmers are not in a position to have their applications considered.  I think that some provision should be made to deal with that aspect, and the best method would be to make the money as cheap as possible.  Then a barrier is set up between the applicant who is looking for a loan less than £50 and the applicant who is looking for a greater loan.  The smaller man has to look for a loan through the local Credit Society.  We read in the newspapers a few weeks ago that the Registrar had wiped out fifty of these societies.</P>
      <P>It is a most extraordinary thing that at this juncture these very organisations which are so necessary in the poorer parts of the country, if benefit is to be derived from the Act, are being wiped out in this manner.  It is four years ago since the Free State Agricultural Commission recommended that there ought to be more power given to the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and that the whole question of the organisation of these societies by the I.A.O.S. ought to be looked into.  We would like to have some intimation from the Minister as to whether he proposes to take into consideration this whole matter of co-operative societies and putting them on a definite footing in the near future, as we have been expecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then with regard to the question of priority, I agree with Deputy Ryan that if ten times the poor law valuation were taken, instead of £200, it might perhaps be fairer, seeing that it would mean that every farmer would get a certain proportion of the value of his land, rather than having an arbitrary figure.  There is also a point with regard to the claimants.  Are we to take it now definitely that there is to be no provision in the Act, or that it is not necessary, in view of the fact that permanent improvements are excluded, <Col N="2020" /> to make any provision whereby objections might be made by equitable claimants to the charges being made against their interests on the land?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>While I thoroughly appreciate the objects to be served by the Bill, in so far as it facilitates farmers in securing loans, I am not entirely satisfied that it covers the ground fully.  I am afraid we will find when this new Bill is in operation that there will be certain inconveniences arising still that will prevent farmers from getting the benefit of the loans in a way which will suit them.  This Bill aims at eliminating the necessity for the farmer discharging equities, but it sets up certain difficulties which will be discovered when it comes to be operated.  We are told, for instance, that in taking priority over equities it will have the effect of lessening the claims of certain claimants to the property. What I fear is that the Credit Corporation will take that and keep it in mind when they are dealing with applications.  The Minister quoted a case of a farm valued for £300, not having equities discharged, and with three members in the family &mdash; A, B and C, A being the registered owner living on the farm and the other two living off the farm.  Therefore if A gets a loan of £70 that comes to within £30 of the total amount of his portion.  If equities are not discharged and the number of the family is, say, ten, instead of three, the value of A's portion of the farm would only be £30.  I fear the Credit Corporation will keep such a fact before their minds and that it will react very unfavourably on the person who has not discharged equities. Perhaps it will not, but I am afraid it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I do not see any necessity for taking a mortgage, in the first instance on land as a security.  If the farmer requires money for stocking his land, it will be quite enough to take a chattel mortgage on the cattle purchased.  That would eliminate the necessity for looking into equities or for having a mortgage on the land.  It would also get rid of the point that you are cutting across the rightful claims of the other members of the family.  The matter must be dealt with in a broad spirit if <Col N="2021" /> the Credit Corporation is to have any effect at all for the purpose intended. The Government should realise that the present condition of the farmers is the result of circumstances outside their own control, and that the essential thing for the farmers is credit at such a rate of interest as will enable them to carry on their business.  The present rate of interest charged by the Credit Corporation is far beyond the farmer's means of paying, and the conditions surrounding the granting of credit are far too unreasonable to expect farmers to make use of it.  If the Government would widen their outlook, realise better the problems they have to face, and which if they do not face some other Government will ultimately have to face, if they will have more confidence in the farmers with whom they are dealing, I am satisfied that the State could work this Credit Corporation on such a basis as would give cheaper money to the farmers, that they could give such terms as would make it possible for the farmers to avail of the loans immediately and in that way make the Corporation of practical use.  Even with this new Bill, if the interest remains at the prohibitive rate of 6 per cent., the farmers will never be able to use the money with profit.  I am not satisfied that this Bill gives all that is required, and until a wider view is taken of the whole matter it cannot be said that the Government has made any honest attempt to deal with the question of agricultural credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. LAW Mr. LAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very glad if the Minister would do what Deputy Derrig asked and give us some further particulars of the manner in which the Government and the Agricultural Credit Corporation propose to deal with the question of loans to small farmers, particularly to that characteristic product of the congested districts which the Minister himself told us of the other day, the man with a valuation of 30/- or £2.  All we know at present is that these people are to be dealt with, if at all, through local co-operative credit societies.  I have some little experience of the working of those societies, as I was instrumental in forming two or three many years ago.  I know of the very useful work they were able to do <Col N="2022" /> in those days.  I also know, unfortunately, that for one reason or another very many of them have had to close their doors in recent years.  I also noticed the announcement which Deputy Derrig called attention to, and I should like to know what steps are to be taken either by the Department of Agriculture, the I.A.O.S. or any other body, towards the restarting on a sound basis and the spread of those societies. My own feeling is that if this provision is to be really useful, especially in the poorer districts, further consideration will have to be given to the basis upon which these societies are to be formed, particularly the joint and several liabilities of the members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally in the old days I was an advocate of what is known as the Raffeisen type of society which had a joint and several and unlimited liability upon all members.  In these days we were dealing as a rule &mdash; I speak of the society I know best &mdash; with a total liability perhaps of £150, of which, I think, £50 represented a loan from the old Congested Districts Board, and, I think, £100 represented the deposits put up by the members, chiefly the members of the committee.  Therefore, the very worst that could happen, in such a case as that, would be if every borrower defaulted and the whole of the money came due, some one individual would be shot at for £150. That of course is bad enough, but still not an impossible proposition.  In most of the societies you get people to come on and join and undertake the liability, but now it is rather different and one has to face the possibility and probability of small loans, but still in the aggregate loans amounting to many hundreds of pounds.  I am doubtful that you will easily get people, in those circumstances, to join societies and to undertake that liability.  While I have no absolutely fixed opinion on the matter I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.  I am sure that the matter has been considered, but I would like to know what the view of the Government is.  If this thing is to be put in use in the congested districts very definite steps will have to be taken to reorganise these credit societies all over the country.  That is <Col N="2023" /> all I wish to say.  I would like the Minister would deal with that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it would appear that the Act which has been already passed is practically a dead letter.  I think we will all agree that what is wanted in this country is unlimited credit for agriculture, and when agriculture is on a proper basis, with the credit of the State behind it, because it is agriculture that keeps the State going, we will have a much better chance of rectifying our trade balance and putting the country in a sound financial position.  With regard to credit societies some of them have been started, I know there are difficulties. But there is one thing I would like to suggest to the Credit Corporation in the starting of those societies, and that is that they should not get a political brand and that credit societies should not be grafted on to any particular party.  I am not going to instance any case, but I have had complaints myself that certain people who are very active, politically, were the people who were canvassing for, and starting the credit societies.  If we are going to give credit to agriculture it must be credit given impartially.  It must not allow any farmer to say: &ldquo;I cannot go to this society because it is practically a political organisation.&rdquo;  Credit societies must be based on the giving of credit to the whole district and not that of any particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that is most important, and that is that all these questions of agricultural credit should be kept within the control of the Dáil. At present if we pass this Bill we pass <Col N="2024" /> it to what I may call some irresponsible body.  There is a directorate set up.  I am not saying anything at all about the personnel, but I am saying that the Dáil is losing control.  This question of credit for agriculture is one of such vital importance to the country that it should not be left in the hands of a selected few to deal with.  It should be open to criticism in this House on all occasions.  If that is not done I see no future for this Credit Corporation or any other.  If it is handed over to a few individuals the whole credit of the State is taken out of the hands of the elected representatives of the people. Those who handle this Credit Corporation or the money of the State for the purpose of financing agriculture should be here to be criticised in this House if criticism is necessary, and there should be no stone wall built up between such money and the people administering it. I do not wish to merely criticise.  I welcome this Bill if for no other purpose than that it enables the Act already passed to come to life instead of being practically a dead letter as it would appear to be at the present time.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when he comes to answer, to say if he is fully informed of the activities of the Credit Corporation and if they have abandoned the idea of giving loans on chattel mortgages.  It would appear that that is so.  A thousand pounds is a small sum for this society to have given up to date, or, at all events, up to the middle of June.  If there is no money being lent on chattel mortgage it may as well be eliminated from the Act altogether. I agree with Deputy Maguire many of these loans could be given on chattel mortgage.  That is one of the principal things in the Act, and one of the best features of it.  If this is going to be a dead letter then there is no use deluding the people.  I have seen forms sent out for chattel mortgages.  We are told that if the sum is under £50 you have to go to a credit society.  Many small farmers have the idea that to ask for a hundred pounds is out of the question.  They want a hundred pounds, but they are afraid to ask for it.  If they ask for £50 or anything under that they are referred to credit societies, which are not now in existence and possibly never may come into existence <Col N="2025" /> in their particular locality.  It is the small farmers that want the money. Under present conditions, I do not think that any bank or State would put up to people who would want to borrow money the conditions put up to farmers on the forms that they are required to fill. Any man who could fill this form qualifying for a loan does not require a loan. The people who require a loan could not possibly satisfy any corporation on the form that is provided.  It must be simplified. I am not in a position to state what the actual cost of obtaining a loan is.  I fear the expense of obtaining a loan in addition to the high rate of interest will preclude farmers from availing of it.  One thing we cannot lose sight of is the importance of credit for agriculture in this State.  The State will go to ruination unless agriculture has unlimited credit and unless the farmers have some hope of getting some credit in the very immediate future.  I would not like to be in the Minister for Finance's place when he is budgeting next year, because there will be no such thing as getting money for anything.  I welcome the Bill, and I hope it will be the means of speeding up the giving of agricultural credit, and that we will find that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will not have the excuse of saying we cannot give loans except under certain conditions; that this will clear the air, and that the people who want money, and are disappointed that they have not got loans, will be given some relief in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not fear.  I am not going to say anything outrageous.  He will have plenty of time to quarrel with what I say.  I am very anxious that this Bill should go through, because I am anxious that something should be done in the way of getting money circulated through this Act.  I do not know where Deputy O'Hanlon got the information he gave us, because several Deputies have been trying to extract similar information from the Ministers with very little success.  As a matter of fact, some of the information he gave may be described as inaccurate. In a supplementary question, I asked if there were any intention of introducing amending legislation.  The Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;I do not think it advisable to introduce legislation for this purpose.&rdquo;  We did not even get accurate information on that occasion.</P>
      <P>What I want to know now is whether there is any chance of making the money cheaper?  One per cent. to small farmers is a great deal.  Is it due to the difference in administration? Does it mean that the cost of setting up this Agricultural Credit Corporation is to put on an extra one per cent.? Would not a grant-in-aid be more reasonable and cheap on the money by one per cent., which would mean a great deal to the small farmer, who is in need of getting cheap money?  There is another matter, that is the term or number of years in which it is to be paid back.  We have seen no attempt to make the term longer.  Five years is a short term within which to pay it back.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture, as a man who knows the country, that ten years ought to be the minimum.  There is another matter.  Deputy O'Hanlon stressed the point that in the main a great many people were getting money who might be able to carry on without it.  I have cases where people were refused money simply because they owed half a year's annuities and only owed them for a month or two.  I suppose the Land Commission have a first mortgage on all things on the land, but it is unreasonable to say that a man who owes his land annuities for a couple of months will not get a loan unless he secures a collateral security.  I understand that a chattel mortgage is not sufficient unless a collateral security is got.  As far as I can see, and I have come in contact with a good many farmers who seek this loan, the Agricultural Credit Corporation lends money only to people who will get it from the State banks&mdash;the ordinary joint stock banks.  I mentioned State banks, and had in my mind what Deputy O'Hanlon said.  I was glad to hear him advocate State banks.  That is what he suggests.  I was glad to hear him, and hope that he will press that suggestion forward until he gets the Minister to agree with him also. The people who get money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation are people who would get it from the joint stock banks.  That is no benefit to the ordinary small farmers.  So far as the forms are concerned I agree with Deputy O'Hanlon that one would want to be a qualified barrister or solicitor to fill them in.  What the age and sex of a man's children has to do with the granting of a loan is a thing I cannot understand.</P>

      <P>The discussion upon this Bill has been a prolonged and in some aspects at any rate an extraordinary one.  We have had members of this House talking about a Bill, and sometimes talking not about a Bill, talking at the Bill and around the Bill, and in such a way as to make it clear that most of them had not taken the trouble to read the Bill.  Then we had other members assuming extraordinary roles.  I remember a stock joke in some of the comic papers, depicting a gentleman generally with a black eye and a red nose trotted on to the stage at temperance meetings as a horrible <Col N="2029" /> example of intemperance.  We had Deputy J. Wolfe holding himself up as a horrible example of corruption on public bodies.  We had Deputy Gorey confessing in some way, whether he was directly or indirectly I do not know, that he had such knowledge as would make him an accessory before or after the fact of instances of corruption widespread and rampant and very serious on the part of public bodies. As against that Deputy Bennett got up, repudiated the allegations of Deputy Gorey and defended the public bodies in the same way as every man who believes that the Irish people are normally honest people, that Irish public men are as honourable as any public men in any quarter of the globe, should defend those who are the elected representatives of the people whether elected to local authorities or this Dáil does not matter.  As I was saying many extraordinary things happened during the course of this debate, and I think the most extraordinary one was the change of front manifested by the Government.  The Minister for Local Government who opened the attack on this Bill criticised it on the grounds of bad draftsmanship.  It was a bad Bill incompetently drafted.  We had the extraordinary spectacle of the Minister for Education getting up on Wednesday last, turning round and telling his colleagues sitting in the same bench that after all the Bill was bad, but not bad because it had been badly drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh &ldquo;merely.&rdquo; Possibly the Minister may have used the qualification merely, but I say if he did that he spoke in a voice that was very small and in a tentative fashion at any rate.  He did not emphasise the incompetence of those who drafted this Bill.  He did not use his usual ponderous, elephantine method of emphasising a point.  He glided from that gently and said: &ldquo;I do not want to let my colleague down on that ground.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Our principal ground of attack is not on the score of bad draftsmanship.&rdquo;  That I take it is the Minister's point.  Then he proceeded, and I do not see in the whole <Col N="2030" /> of his speech anything that would show me that he read this Bill at all, and compared it with the original Act. I think in justice to the Bill we ought to say in what way the principles and provisions of this Bill conflict with or are antagonistic to the original Act. We have first of all the principle in Section 6 of the Bill.  It states this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided that in the case of a vacancy for an executive office under a local authority the person appointed to such vacant office is a person who held a pensionable office for not less than five years on the clerical staff of the said or any local authority or any two or more local authorities and that such person shall have passed a qualifying examination conducted according to regulations made by the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the principle the Deputy says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>What does Section 5 of the principal Act say?&mdash;</P>
      <P>That any person who held a pensionable office under the said or any other local authority or any two or more local authorities the duties of which related to matters the same as or similar to which the duties of the vacant office relate may be appointed by a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In does not matter in what circumstances the person who held that office was compelled to retire on pension or to resign.  He may have been compelled to retire on the ground of incompetency, but there is no provision in Section 5 of the principal Act which would prevent a public body from appointing a person who did retire ostensibly on pension because, say, he had reached the age limit or for some other reason, but who really was compelled, caused or urged by the local authority that formerly employed him to retire because he was really incompetent. Any of us who has had any experience of public life knows that there is a general tendency on the part of public bodies to let their officials down lightly. You very seldom hear of a public official being dismissed for incompetency. <Col N="2031" /> They are generally allowed to retire on pension.  Yet the officer who is let down easily in that way and permitted to retire on pension under the principal Act, which in the eyes of many of the Deputies is the acme of perfection, can be appointed by the public authority, but under the Bill such a person cannot be appointed by a public authority because he would have passed a qualifying examination at least five years previously.</P>

      <P>Section 6 gives the Commissioners power to recommend two or more persons.  The amending Bill stipulates that the Commissioners shall submit a panel of persons qualified. Already it is admitted by the Act that there may be circumstances in which it would be advantageous to submit more than one name.  Section 7 of the Bill states that in practically every case it would be advantageous to the local authority to have more than one name submitted to them. What is the great objection to that? The Minister for Education admitted that the recommendations of selection boards in certain matters may be disturbed by three considerations.  First, he said, a slight preference is given&mdash; he emphasised the slight preference&mdash; for a knowledge of Irish.  A preference may also be given for local knowledge.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that a preference was given for a knowledge of Irish, and that a slight preference was given for local knowledge, and that health, general moral character, age, and so on, also carried their weight with the Commissioners. Consider the case of any appointment, say, to a dispensary or to any important position under a public board&mdash; the position, say, of an engineer.  As a general rule, you get about twenty applications, and as a general rule every one of them possesses the required technical qualifications.  Some of them, perhaps, have more experience than others.  Will anyone tell me that there is such a difference between the first three candidates out of these twenty applicants that any serious injustice would be done if any one of the three of them was appointed by the local body.  Take any appointment for a dispensary doctor. an assistant surveyor. a borough surveyor, in which the qualifications were prescribed by the Commissioners.  Would any serious injustice be done to the ratepayers if, instead of one name being sent down, the names of the three candidates who were best qualified and had the required practical experience were sent down to the local board to select from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is better qualified to judge the candidates on the score of local knowledge, health, general moral character, age, and so on, than the local people who are about to make the appointment?  Then, when these three names are sent down these additional qualifications are canvassed <Col N="2033" /> by every member of that body. Some of the people are more intimately known to the members of that board than they ever could be known to the members of the Selection Board, whilst to the Local Appointments Commissioners they are comparative strangers. When it comes to weighing up these secondary but very important qualifications, I suggest that the members of the local authorities, who have got to make the choice in the full light of day and not behind closed doors, like the Local Appointments Commissioners, are going to make a better choice than the Local Appointments Commissioners. They have got to make the appointment in the light of day, knowing that their appointment is going to be the subject of criticism.  I say on these grounds of health, local knowledge, moral character, age, and so on, which have got to be taken into consideration, that Section 7 of the Bill, which stipulates that the three best candidates out of 20 applicants shall be submitted to the local authorities, is very much superior to Section 6 of the Act, which allows the local Commissioners to send down the name of one person as their choice to the local authorities and compels them to appoint him to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Principal Act states that the Commissioners &ldquo;shall, with the consent of the Minister, prescribe the qualifications as to age, health, character, education, training experience,&rdquo; and so on.  I think it is very important that the Bill so far does not propose to repeal any single section of the Principal Act, that in fact it proposes to extend it in some cases and remove the disadvantages and defects which every person who has had any practical experience of this Act knows, and it secures that everything that is done will be done in the full light of day, and give to the local authorities who, after all, have the responsibility for the local administration, the right of selecting, within certain circumscribed limits, the officials to whom they will entrust that administration for which they will themselves have to accept responsibility before the people who elected them.  Section 7 of the Act gives the Commissioners power to <Col N="2034" /> prescribe qualifications, and Section 8 of the Bill requires that the qualifications prescribed by the Commissioners for every position will be laid before this House, will be submitted to this House.  It proposes that &ldquo;the Commissioners shall present copies of the qualifications prescribed under this section in respect of all offices comprised in any particular description, class or grade of offices to which this Act applies before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after the qualifications are so prescribed.&rdquo; What is the defect there?  What is the disadvantage?  What evil consequences will ensue from that?  I would like the President to answer me.  I would like him to deal specifically with that, and show what harm is there in it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, what advantage is there in withholding from the House the qualifications prescribed for any position?  What advantage is in that? Is it the fact that it makes it easier for the Local Appointments Commissioners to perpetrate a job when it is in the interests of the authority to do so?  If this House has official knowledge of those qualifications, then it would be easier for the people in this House to criticise the Local Appointments Commissioners when they make appointments which we think are not justified.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Principal Act states: &ldquo;Subject to such exceptions... the Commissioners shall select every person to be recommended by them to a local authority under this Act solely by means of competitive examination conducted according to regulations made by the Commissioners.&rdquo;  Is the criticism against the Bill that it proposes to make that pious aspiration contained in the Act a practical reality?  We heard a good deal from the Minister for Local Government about stern morality.  His whole speech was a eulogy of the stern morality of the Public Appointments Commissioners.  We wish to make certain, at any rate, that since the Government have accepted the principle of competitive examination&mdash;and I know there is a great deal to be said against it, and Deputy Sir James Craig advanced very cogent reasons why it <Col N="2035" /> should not be made a determining factor&mdash;but since they have accepted the principle we want to see this: that the person who sits for that competitive examination and comes first will have his name sent down to the local body for appointment. We wish to make the Government stand on that principle that they have embodied in their own Act. What is the objection, what is the fatal defect?  What grounds are there for corruption?  All the attacks on this Bill were largely based on the grounds that it would incite, encourage or promote corruption in the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I ask you to remember the speeches and arguments advanced by Deputy Gorey and Deputy J.T. Wolfe against the Bill.  The latter has come back and sits here as a horrible example of public corruption in Ireland.  I ask you to remember the speeches he made and read Section 9 of this Bill.  In what way would a provision in the Act making it compulsory upon the Local Appointments Commissioners to submit to the local authorities the person or the candidate who is placed first in the competitive examination, promote or encourage public corruption in Ireland?  Section 9 of the Act states that whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend a person for appointment to an office to which this Act applies and the Commissioners with the concurrence of the Minister are of opinion that having regard to <Col N="2036" /> the nature of the duties of that office, the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of those duties, and the qualifications prescribed under this Act for that office, the person or persons to be recommended for appointment to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination, the Commissioners may dispense with the competitive examination required by this Act. That is the principle contained in the Principal Act, that where a situation arises in which the Minister thinks that the candidate most favoured by the local branch of their political organisation has no chance at all, if there is a competitive examination to be held, then the Commissioners, with the concurrence of the Minister, may decide to dispense with the competitive examination. That is the principle in the Act.</P>

That suspicion, whether well founded or false, is not a thing, at any rate, that is good for the country, and is not good for the public life of this country.  It is important that that suspicion should be dissipated once and for all by securing that the public appointments should be made in the light of day in such a way that it will be made clear and manifest that a person is not sent down simply because he happens to have certain political opinions.</P>

      <P>Anything but Cumann na nGaedheal, that hated and detested label.  I do not want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily. I was pointing out that Section 9 of the Act gives the Commissioners power to dispense with competitive examination, with the concurrence of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think you will agree that Section 10 of the Bill does give an additional safeguard to the local authority.  It will give them some protection against political patronage, which they rightly or wrongly at the present moment believe to exist.  I am not going to argue that it is of undue importance in all public appointments.  Section 10 of the Bill states:&mdash;&ldquo;Whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend to them the names of a person or persons qualified, for appointment to an office to which this Act applies, and the local authority, in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Minister is of opinion that having regard to the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of the duties and qualifications prescribed under this Act for that office, the person or persons to be recommended as qualified for appointment in that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination, the Commissioners with the sanction of the Minister may dispense with the competitive examination required by this Act.&rdquo;  I ask you to examine that.  The Minister may dispense with competitive examination. <Col N="2039" /> The Bill makes this stipulation that it is only upon the initiative of the local authority that that competitive examination can be dispensed with.  That is, that the people who have got to pay the piper should be entitled to call the tune and, if the people who are to make the appointment, it is only when they make up their minds and desire that competitive examination should be dispensed with, that competitive examination, with the consent of the Minister, may be dispensed with.  What is the grave defect in that?  Will the President criticise that section of the Bill proposed from those benches?</P>

      <P>It is a great pity that the Government, now that their case against the Bill has been torn to tatters and, their Act having been analysed in this House, that case has been found to be weakening, have not a spokesman left in the House to defend their case.  The President is tongue-tied. He has already spoken in this debate. Surely there are other Ministers who have not spoken.  We have not heard the Minister for Finance, we have not heard the Minister for Justice, and we have not heard the Minister for Fisheries.  Now surely if there is anything in the case they made against the Bill from the beginning they ought to be able to get up now and justify their case against the Bill.  I ask them in particular to make clear to this House the defects and disadvantages under which Section 10 of the Bill labours as opposed to Section 9 of the Act.</P>
      <P>In one case, as I said before, the Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister, can dispense with competitive examination. That is the principle involved in Section 9 of the Act.  But, on the other hand, competitive examination cannot be dispensed with unless the local authority who are making the appointment on their own initiative request the Commissioners to dispense with that competitive examination; competitive examination cannot be dispensed with unless the Minister sanctions that dispensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are the two provisions.  Which of them better safeguards the ratepayers of the country against jobbery? <Col N="2040" /> Is it the one which allows the Commissioners, who are in immediate contact with the Minister and who are appointed by the Minister, to dispense with the competitive examination that is going to give the ratepayers of the country protection against an undue exercise of political patronage? Against that you have the Bill that leaves the question of dispensing with competitive examinations to the initiative of a local authority.</P>
    <P>This Bill of ours is perfectly justified. It does not propose to repeal any particular section in the Principal Act. The only thing it does is to make the pious aspirations contained in the Act a reality by compelling Ministers to practise what they preach.  The Bill provides in the case of a competitive examination that the three candidates who come first on the list will be sent down to the local people, and those people are going to be the final judges in the matter of qualifications; they are the people who will make the final appointments.  There will be, say, 20 of them sitting as a jury, and they will be representing the townspeople who have elected them and who hold them responsible.  That public authority will be sitting as a jury upon those three candidates.  Those candidates will be accepted as fully qualified and fit for the post by the Local Appointments Commissioners, and their qualifications, other than the professional and technical ones, will be read by the jury in the light of day, a jury responsible to the townspeople who elected them, and they will decide which of the three candidates is best qualified upon moral grounds and as having local knowledge.  I submit that this Bill is a distinct improvement upon the original Act.</P>

The salient features of this Bill appear to be, firstly, the suggestion that a selection board must put forward three names, and not one name.  It would have been very interesting if Deputy MacEntee had told us a little more on that point.  I have heard&mdash;I may be wrong; my information comes through the public Press, which is sometimes misinformed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I understand the Selection Board consisted of two persons&mdash;one a person who had local knowledge and who knew the needs of the district, and the other Deputy MacEntee.  After carefully and scrupulously examining the credentials of all the applicants, the Selection Board recommended two people.  Of course, the Bill had not then been drafted, and the Selection Board made the mistake of recommending only two instead of three people to the local authority.</P>

      <P>I do not quite know what the Deputy means by &ldquo;light of day.&rdquo;  I do not suppose his selection board held public meetings.  Certainly the result is announced, I think, under the Act which it is now sought to amend.  I wish to give the Deputy all credit for having made an honest recommendation which the local authority did not accept.  If Deputy MacEntee had put forward three names, including one of a person whom the local authority wished to appoint, then we should have had the result intended to be arrived at under this Bill. Deputies on this side of the House stigmatised the old system of appointment as corrupt.  It is nonsense to say that all local bodies were, or are, corrupt; also that local considerations and family considerations did not enter into certain appointments in the old days. I think that almost every Deputy knows that a local man is generally preferred. We have it asserted on one side that under the old system there was nepotism.  Deputy O'Kelly stated that there was more nepotism under the new system, that the selection boards under the new system were guilty of nepotism. What the Fianna Fáil Party propose is a compromise which includes the evils both of the old and the new systems.  They propose to retain the Selection Board in Dublin on which, according to Deputy O'Kelly, there is nepotism and in regard to which influence can be used to put forward not only one name but three names, and when the three names go before the local authority you then get canvassing and then the local pull begins to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local people then discover that so-and-so's aunt was married to a man in the county, and that he is therefore more of a county man than the others. In my view it would be better to go back to the old system and make the councils face their responsibility, and make them, at any rate, take the odium for a bad appointment when they make a bad appointment, rather than to take the middle of the road system by which a council can put the responsibility on <Col N="2043" /> the Appointments Commissioners, and by which the Appointments Commissioners can say: &ldquo;It does not matter what three names we send down, because the local authority is bound to appoint a bad one.&rdquo;  I have heard of people trying to make the best of both worlds, but this is the first occasion on which I have heard of people, as is proposed in this Bill, making the worst of both worlds.  The advantage of the present system which the Bill proposes to destroy is that it sets up, possibly somewhat vaguely and roughly, a definite standard, but if you send three names to each council there is no definite standard at all.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing some years ago of an appointment of a dispensary doctor in County Roscommon.  The Local Appointments Commissioners sent to the County Board of Health the name of a doctor whom they recommended. The County Board of Health became indignant because the name was that of a doctor who was also a lady.  They said that no lady could possibly undertake the hard work of a dispensary doctor in that area, and that no lady could realise how difficult the task of a dispensary doctor was.  It did not, apparently, matter to them that that particular lady had extremely high technical qualifications, and that she was the daughter of a dispensary doctor in an adjoining county.  It did not matter to them apparently that she helped her father for more than a year in his practice, and did a good deal of the hard work required of a dispensary doctor.  She was out of it.  They wanted somebody else.  They did not want her, and they protested against her selection by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Almost simultaneously in County Westmeath, not fifty miles from Roscommon, another Board of Health were protesting that they must have a lady doctor, as only a lady doctor could do the work properly. I suggest that we want a definite standard and we want people in the medical profession to know where they are and what chance they have of getting an appointment.  If it is the considered opinion of the people in this country that no lady doctor should get <Col N="2044" /> an appointment as a dispensary doctor, let it be known, and lady doctors will know where to seek for appointments, but if it is to be left to the caprice of a local authority to go through three names, two of which may be those of ladies, and if they decide that they must give the appointment to a man, you then get a state of uncertainty and discouragement which is not going to be to the benefit either of the medical profession or of the patients whom these doctors have to attend.</P>
    <P>I think there is a good deal too much local feeling in all this talk about appointments. Deputy O'Kelly said quite frankly that whenever he had a chance he would try to get a Dublin appointment for boys and, I daresay, for girls who won scholarships in Dublin, and he would give them preference.  I think we ought to get out of this way of thinking of ourselves as Dublinmen, Sligomen, Corkmen and Galwaymen, and that we should think of ourselves as Irishmen and Irishwomen and give a fair chance to anyone who belongs to the State and who has the necessary qualifications.  Deputy Doctor Hennessy spoke about a doctor who, I think, is in the area in which I reside, and who was condemned because he was a Kerryman.  That doctor came as a stranger to the district, and I admit that I should have preferred a local man.  I was a member of the local authority at the time, and we had to make a temporary appointment.  We appointed a local man whom the people believed to be a good man, and who certainly had many things in his favour. So far as I was concerned, he had served in the British Army, and I was possibly prejudiced in his favour.  The Local Appointments Commissioners however, brought in a stranger, and I have not heard from people whom he attended anything but praise.  He is a good doctor.  The people like him and he treats them well.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the argument in regard to moral grounds.  Deputy MacEntee spoke of morality.  Deputy Dr. Ward spoke at great length about moral grounds.  The local authorities are to be the judges of morals.  Urban district councils, county councils, county boards of health, and so forth, <Col N="2045" /> are to be the arbiters of morals.  Now I know why some people get on local authorities.  It must be because they are judges of morals, as they have no other qualification whatever.  I think it would be better if we deprived the local authority of this moral judgment and put on efficient men, without regard to their capacity of judging the morals of others and deciding whether a man is or is not a Pharisee.  I do not believe that they are any better judges of morals than this Dáil.  Deputy Matthew O'Reilly, who always speaks with sincerity, impressed me with his sincere plea.  We often heard of the proverb, &ldquo;The devil you know is better than the devil you do not know.&rdquo;  His plea, however, was, &ldquo;The devil you know is better than the angel you do not know,&rdquo; that you should appoint a doctor you know, even though you know his faults, in preference to a man whom the Local Appointments Commissioners send down, though he may be a better man in every way.  I do not believe that local authorities have any more power than we have to judge on moral grounds.  I do not believe that this House is qualified to judge on morals. I do not believe that we are qualified to fill appointments.  It is being suggested that it is an inherent right in democracy that county councils and boards of health should be able to choose their own officers, even though they are technical officers, and though the local body have no particular powers of judging technical qualifications.  We have not that power, yet we have power to rule the State.  I should be sorry to see the day when every Civil Service appointment had to be tabled in the House, and when a motion to the effect that Timothy Kelly should be appointed junior clerk in the Ministry of Local Government and an amendment from a Cork Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not suggesting that there is any such proposal in the Bill, but I am suggesting that it is a similar proposal, that the proposal that it is undemocratic for a county council and a board of health to be deprived of the power of making appointments could be paralleled by the suggestion that it is undemocratic to have appointments made by the Civil Service Commission and not by the Dáil.  I am glad that Deputy MacEntee does not approve of the suggestion that we should do that.  I am glad at least that there is one Parliamentary heresy which Deputy MacEntee has not adopted, but I am not sure that those on the back benches would agree that they should not have the right to appoint their own man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking of Deputy Corry.  I will leave Deputy Corry to Deputy MacEntee.  Deputy MacEntee has repudiated the slander that his party would bring appointments in the Civil Service before the Dáil.  Deputy Dr. Ward put forward the proposal that this Bill, which I have read, would satisfy local feeling.  Would it?  What is going to happen if the Local Appointments Commissioners sent down three names instead of one, and that none of them is a name which is wanted locally? Local feeling will be as annoyed over the three names as over one.  It will be equally furious, resentful, and equally capable of passing resolutions denouncing the Government, the Local Appointments Commissioners and the parties which sponsored this Bill.  You will never satisfy a particular type of local feeling.  I do not believe that it is general or representative.  There is a certain type of local feeling that feels that if there is anything going a local man should get it, and that if there is anything going they should have a finger in the pie.  They will not be satisfied with the sending down of three names instead of one unless the Local Appointments Commissioners are responsive to that type of local feeling and send down one name that is wanted.  This Bill seems to me to mean <Col N="2047" /> the revival of canvassing.  I do not suppose that there is any Deputy except, perhaps, those representing the universities who does not know what an evil canvassing is.  There are people who think that a Deputy has the power of appointment to every post, even to a commercial post outside the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry gives forth words of wisdom but I am afraid I do not catch them.  The second point in the Bill, with all respect to Deputy MacEntee, is the substitution of the Civil Service Commissioners for the Local Appointments Commissioners. That is almost a change without a difference. Two of the Civil Service Commissioners are Local Appointments Commissioners.  With regard to the Local Appointments Commissioners, Deputy O'Kelly said that he would not take their word for anything.  Now he proposes in this Bill to take a majority of the gentlemen whose word he would <Col N="2048" /> not take for anything and make them a majority of the Civil Service Commissioners. They are already a majority of the Civil Service Commissioners, and the only result of the passing of this Bill would be that the one Civil Service Commissioner who is unwilling to act as a Local Appointments Commissioner would probably retire and the existing Local Appointments Commissioners would become the Civil Service Commissioners, so that you establish the identical body whose word Deputy O'Kelly would not take for anything both as Appointments Commissioners and Civil Service Commissioners.  It may be a gain, but I confess I am not subtle enough to understand it.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, we are indebted to Deputy O'Kelly.  I am sorry to have to make so many references to him while he is unable to be here owing to illness, but his speech really elucidated the Bill more than the speech of anyone else, because he made quite clear what the object of the Bill was and that the Bill had a wrong title.  The real object of the Bill is to secure that members of Fianna Fáil get a reasonable share of local appointments.  If the Bill had been introduced under that name, I think it might quite conceivably have been accepted.  We on these benches do not want to have politics in local government more than we can possibly help.</P>

I am not prepared to believe that civil servants, who are aloof from politics, who are not directly concerned in politics, would allow the politics of an applicant to bias them. Therefore, I believe this Bill is a backward step, and that the machinery which has been set up by the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;though it may have worked badly in certain instances, and very possibly it may have, because it is new machinery, and all new machinery is liable to make mistakes&mdash;is moving in the right direction, away from the local pull and the local influence, in the direction of getting the best man for the job, wherever he comes from, provided his qualifications are right; is moving in the direction of a service similar to the Civil Service, where the man who makes good may count on promotion, where a man need not stay in his own county where he has the local pull, because if he is efficient he will be able to reach to the highest posts.  For that reason I oppose the Second Reading.</P>

I say this without any reflection upon my old brethren, the old guardians, because I believe they were honourable men, being an honourable <Col N="2050" /> man myself.  I voted for a cousin at one of these elections, at one time, because he was the best man.  His wife told me, anyhow, that he was the best man, and as it so happened, he was the best man and gave great satisfaction; no doubt about it.  I remember a few weeks ago listening to my friend Deputy Lemass making the charge against the Local Appointments Commissioners and against the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in general that a Free State Army doctor was bound to get a position.  I can flatly contradict that.  I know of a case in which two Free State Army doctors went for a position of dispensary doctor in my own district, and the doctor who was not a Free State Army doctor&mdash;a decent man&mdash;secured it, and the two Free State Army doctors were turned down.  So much for the Local Appointments Commission.  The Government has nothing to do with the selection.  I can be corroborated by another member in this House when I state that a Cumann na nGaedheal doctor&mdash;whether Cumann na nGaedheal was an addition to his professional ability or not, I do not know&mdash;was appointed by a Cumann na nGaedheal Board, the Local Government Department would not accept him.  There were two names sent to the Local Appointments Commission, and they appointed another man who was not Cumann na nGaedheal.  I think that ought to nail Deputy Lemass's charge against the Government.  If you send down three names to any of the Boards of Health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he has given authority to the General Prisons Board to prevent a prison officer acting as agent for the &ldquo;Prison Officers' Magazine&rdquo; at Cork Prison; and whether he is aware that this magazine has circulated in all Irish prisons, and in the prisons of England, Wales and Scotland, and many of the Dominions for nearly 20 years.</P>

      <P>On the 5th ultimo the Governor of Cork Prison reported to the General Prisons Board that a written order issued by him to the staff of that prison had been communicated to some member of the public contrary to the prison regulations and had been published in a magazine called the &ldquo;Prison Officers' Magazine.&rdquo;  All the officers on the prison staff denied responsibility for the publication of the order referred to.  In accordance with the instructions of the Board the officer who was known to act as agent for the sale and distribution of this magazine was asked by the Governor to state whether he desired to continue to act as agent for the circulation in public print of confidential orders connected with the <Col N="1912" /> government of the prison.  He replied that he did not desire to do so, and he subsequently informed the Governor that he had ceased to act as agent for the magazine in question.  I fully approve of the action taken by the General Prisons Board in this matter.</P>
