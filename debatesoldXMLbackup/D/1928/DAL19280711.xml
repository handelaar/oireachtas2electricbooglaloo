      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE (for Seosamh O Cinnéide)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that Mr. Bernard P. Fitzgerald, Athlone, was assessed for the years 1924-25 and 1925-26 in respect of income tax; that Mr. Fitzgerald did not appeal against these assessments within the statutory period, owing to illness, and that as a result he was unable to submit statements as to his income; and whether, in view of the hardship resulting from the enforcement of the assessments, an appeal in the matter will be entertained from Mr. B.P. Fitzgerald.</P>

      <P>I cannot enter into details in answering questions concerning the assessment to income tax of individuals. The answer to the last part of the question is that I have no power to cause an appeal to be admitted.  Taxpayers must avail of the ordinary means of redress which the law provides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the law extremely severe in that matter of the time limit for the appeal?  There seems to be no way of giving power to the administrators of the law to extend the time for any reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the special Commissioners can extend the time given for appeal or allow appeals to be heard after the lapse of the time on such a ground as illness, if they are satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a great many complaints of extremely severe administration of that law and I think the Minister ought to take notice of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not discuss it at length now, but I have had occasion to examine a great many cases, and in many cases I found that the taxpayer was only pleading illness or something like that as an excuse without having actually been ill.  In other cases, there was the most gross neglect on the part of the taxpayer.  I have not really seen a case where there was real hardship, such as severe illness or something like that, preventing notice of appeal being given, and of the special Commissioners refusing to admit it, even after the lapse of the ordinary time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that on the 31st day of January, 1928, in an action of Henry Sheil v. the Attorney-General.  Mr. Justice Meredith delivered judgment declaring Mr. Sheil entitled to the sum of £200 as compensation for loss of office, and directing that that sum and the taxed costs of the action be paid out of funds to be provided by the Oireachtas; that the costs were subsequently taxed at the sum of £91 16s. 8d; and, if so, what steps, if any, he has taken or proposes to take to raise and pay to Henry Sheil the said sum of £291 16s. 8d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the first two parts of the question are in the affirmative.  Provision will be made in connection with this and other similar cases in the legislation on the general question of Article 10 of the Treaty which, as I have already informed the House, it is my intention to introduce as soon as practicable.  Meanwhile, I do not propose to take any steps of the nature indicated in the concluding part of the question.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this case has nothing to do with the question of the bonus or the cost of living, both of which were subject matters for decision in the Wigg-Cochrane case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There were other matters in question in that case.  The question of justiciability was also one of the points raised in that case.  The Supreme Court here decided that these cases were not justiciable.  The Wigg-Cochrane judgment, of course, was a reversal, in so far as it was capable of reversing that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), page 2, line 42 to delete the word &lsquo;and&rsquo; and to delete paragraph (e).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a rather important amendment and will require some explanation. The section as it stands provides that where a person is the registered owner of land, where it is subject to a note as to equities, where such person gives a mortgage to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and where such mortgage is registered and where it is the first mortgage it shall have priority.  In other words, where a mortgage is given to the Corporation and where it is the first mortgage it shall have priority.  Once land is registered, any dealings in respect of such land must be registered on the folio.  No assignment, mortgage or charge can be put on the land after registration unless it is registered on the folio.  That is the whole scheme of the Local Registration of Title Act. The idea behind that Act was to simplify titles in regard to land and to prevent any dealings in land unless they are registered on the folio.  This section as it stands provides that where a mortgage is given by a registered owner to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and where it is the only mortgage that appears on the folio, it shall have all the advantages provided under the Bill.  In other words, it shall have priority over equities.  When we came to examine the question, the Registrar of Titles, <Col N="171" /> who knows the administration of the Registration of Title Act inside out, made a certain point which we thought was quite sound.  After vesting and after first registration it often happens that a father assigns his property to his eldest son on his marriage and that there is a clause in the deed of assignment that the mother shall have the right to a room in the house or that an uncle shall have £20 a year while he lives.  That deed of assignment is registered and it contains that small charge, but, as the Bill stands, that charge would have to be regarded as a mortgage on the land, and, in such a case, the charge of the Agricultural Credit Corporation would not have priority over it.  That, of course, would prevent the Corporation from lending.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary case, where there is a genuine mortgage, a really important mortgage, a mortgage involving big sums of money, appearing on the folio, the Agricultural Credit Corporation would not lend in any circumstances but there is a very large percentage of the cases that come to the Agricultural Credit Corporation where there is no mortgage on the folio and where the land has been transferred from father to son, on marriage, after vesting, and where there is a very small charge on the folio set out in the deed of assignment in favour of a mother, sister, aunt or uncle&mdash;the right to a room in the house or something like that.  As the Act stands, in view of the fact that that must be regarded as a charge on the folio of the lands, the Corporation could not lend and it could not get priority over such a mortgage.  In fact, it could not lend at all, because the principal Act provides&mdash;it is a very fine point and Deputies would want to grasp it very thoroughly&mdash;that where land is registered, where the registration is subject to a note as to equities, where the registered owner gives a charge in favour of the Corporation, where such a charge is a first charge, then the charge by the Agricultural Credit Corporation shall have priority over any charges which are preserved as a result of the note as to equities.  If that Section as it stands were allowed to go through, then the Agricultural <Col N="172" /> Credit Corporation could not make a loan in any case where there was an assignment by a father to a son and where in that assignment there was a small charge in favour of an uncle, aunt sister or someone like that. Remember, when we delete this section, the mortgage of the Agricultural Credit Corporation will not take priority over the charge in favour of the aunt, uncle, sister or whoever it is, because the mortgage of the Agricultural Credit Corporation only takes priority over charges which are preserved by the note as to equities.  Such a charge is not preserved by the note as to equities.  It is preserved by the assignment which is registered on the folio and the mortgage of the Agricultural Credit Corporation will not in fact take priority over such a charge.  The charge is there and is quite good and it beats the mortgage of the Agricultural Credit Corporation because, after taking out this particular section, the position will be that the Agricultural Credit Corporation can give a mortgage and that mortgage will have priority as to equities but it will be what is technically known as puisne.  In other words, it will not have priority over any other mortgage registered on the folio; so in order to enable the Corporation to make a loan in cases where there is a small charge such as a room in the house or a charge of £10 or £5 in favour of an uncle, it is decided to take that out.  That really does alter the fact that that charge has still priority over the mortgage of the Agricultural Credit Corporation but the Agricultural Credit Corporation charge has priority over the equities.  I think I have made that point clear but perhaps I should explain it further.  Supposing the section were left as it stands and that a case came up before the Agricultural Credit Corporation in which a man owned land value £400, and that that man held the land as the result of an assignment from his father on his marriage and that there was a charge in the deed of assignment in favour of the father to a right to a room in the house, that would be regarded as a charge on the land and if the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="173" /> lent £100, for which there was ample security, and registered it, as they could register it, as a mortgage on the land, what would the position be? The position would be such as was never intended.  It was always intended that that charge in favour of the father would have priority over any other charges but, in addition to that, there would be the position, because of that particular section, that the charge would not take priority over the equities, because the mortgage did not conform to the conditions laid down in the section, one of the conditions being that it shall be a first mortgage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>The following amendment stands in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to add at the end of paragraph (e) the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and to insert after that paragraph a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is not pending in any Court in Saorstát Eireann a suit or other proceeding commenced by a person entitled or claiming to be entitled to an equitable claim against lands affected by such charge for the purpose of enforcing such equitable claim or in which the title of the mortgagor to the beneficial interest in the said lands is called in question and of which suit or other proceeding notice in writing shall have been given to the Corporation by or on behalf of such equitable claimant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to call the attention of the Dáil to the necessity of embodying some provision in this Bill by which the equitable claimant would at least have the right of making an objection. We have considered the question in detail, and it seems to us that a way out of the difficulties which are, to some extent, in contradistinction to the <Col N="174" /> principle of the Bill, is not easily possible. I do not wish to impose any additional burden on the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or to put them to any additional expense, but we are of opinion that allowing for the fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will be, of course, exercising their own discretion, and that, in actual fact, they will, when discussing these cases, do what the amendment proposes to do&mdash; that is to say, they will not, where legal proceedings are pending, grant loans&mdash;there will be no great harm, in view of the possibilities of the injustice already alluded to, to insert some such provision as we have here: that is, that if proceedings at law are taken for the purpose of enforcing such equitable claim or in which the title of the mortgagor to the beneficial interest in the said lands is called in question, and of which suit or other proceeding, notice in writing shall have been given to the Corporation by or on behalf of such equitable claimant, the loan will not be given.  I do not think that there is any great necessity to dilate on that matter. I am of opinion that the form of application for the loan might be changed in some way in order to enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation to get further particulars regarding the persons who may be claiming they are equitable claimants on the land.  This is a provision to enable them to make an objection.  It does not put any additional work upon the Corporation.  It puts upon the claimant himself the task of taking legal proceedings if he has a claim, and, in the second place, it puts upon him the necessity of advising the Agricultural Credit Corporation that he is taking proceedings in law.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation probably will do that, but we want, if possible, to safeguard the equitable claimant in some small way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest an alternative to that.  I discussed this matter with the draftsman.  There are objections in detail to the amendment as it stands, but there is something in the idea behind it.  My suggestion is to add another clause (f) to amendment 8, which I am proposing.  Such clause to read:&mdash;&ldquo;Where no <i>lis pendens</i> is entered in the register against such land.&rdquo;<Col N="175" /> That is not quite the same as Deputy Derrig's amendment.  That means where there is no pending suit entered on the register against such land. Deputy Derrig's amendment does not go quite so far.  It refers to the case where the Agricultural Credit Corporation gets notice in writing to the effect that a suit, in fact, is pending.  I carry it a step further and say that is right, but it really ought to do this, to add these words, &ldquo;Where no pending suit is registered on the folio.&rdquo;  There is a very simple procedure.  The solicitor for the plaintiff registers for some slightly nominal fee what is known as a <i>lis pendens.</i>  That is a warning to all concerned, including the Registrar of Titles, that there is an equity suit pending, and that he should not deal with the land until such time as the administration or such other suit as may be pending has been dealt with.  I suggest that is a better way of doing it.  Deputy Derrig speaks of a pending suit.  That means a suit that has been begun.  So that you are not dealing with an ordinary citizen who knows no law and does not know his legal rights.  You are dealing with a citizen who has legal rights and has the advice of a solicitor. This is a case where the suit is actually begun.  Every solicitor knows what to do in such a case.  The solicitor will know the law&mdash;at least he ought to know the law.  There will be absolutely no difficulty from his point of view in registering a <i>lis pendens.</i>  There is no red tape; it must be registered by the registrar and the fees are nominal. There is not much difference between this amendment and the amendment in my name, amendment 8, which provides for the registration of a &ldquo;caution.&rdquo; That is a simple procedure also.  If there is a caution on the folios, what happens?  There is no priority, so that from that point of view there is really no difference between amendment 5 and amendment 8.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that amendment 8 covers my point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but not quite. So far as it does not cover it, the additional amendment that I suggested a while ago covers the point that is in your amendment, but not in mine.  So far as the pending suit is concerned, in <Col N="176" /> connection with equities a solicitor might as well register a caution as a <i>lis pendens.</i>  He might as well register a caution as give notice to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  There is this great advantage that so far as there are any dealings of any kind with registered land, the registrar should have notice.  The whole point of this is that there is one man in the country who is in charge of all land titles.  He has a simple way of finding out what is the title to land.  Titles to land cost more money and ruined more people than any other form of litigation, and it was to obviate that that the Registration of Title Act was passed.  The registrar has the folio in front of him and he knows that no one has any rights over the land, direct or indirect, except what are given in that folio&mdash; except in so far as they are preserved by that note of equities.  He knows that there could be no rights registered unless it was there on the folio before him.  Now, if Deputy Derrig's amendment is carried, it will mean that there will be rights against the land which the registrar has no knowledge of. They may turn out to be real or to be spurious later on, but of these the registrar has no knowledge.  But we should preserve the point of view that in dealings direct or indirect any claims of rights or objections to other persons claiming rights against the land should go on the register; and I suggest that the Deputy would agree to an amendment to this effect, which is simply the same as his own, except that instead of giving notice to the Corporation they give notice to the registrar, where no <i>lis pendens</i> is entered in the register against that land.  Then the sub-section would read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where&mdash;(a) a person is registered in a registrar of free-holders maintained under the Act of 1891 as full owner of land, and... where no <i>lis pendens</i> is entered in the register against such land.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister says that the people down the country are well acquainted with this question of land registration and that they know well how to proceed.  I am rather sceptical about that, but I believe that the method is the best one.  The only question then is the length of time and the costs.  Although the method of lodging an objection with the Agricultural Credit Corporation may not be the best in the long run, it would be less costly. The whole trouble of registering is that I fear it would take too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mistaken. I do not say the layman knows the law in regard to registration of title, but the Deputy is trying to protect a claimant who has actual proceedings commenced.  He has a solicitor and is actually defendant or plaintiff in some proceedings.  The individual does not, perhaps, know what to do, but it is common form for his solicitor. Registering a <i>lis pendens</i> does not delay the matter one day.  There is no difficulty about registration, because the process has been simplified.  The solicitor has to apply to the registrar and sends him, perhaps, a fee of 5s. and the <i>lis pendens</i> is registered.</P>

This man is the plaintiff or defendant in an equity suit and the cost to register a <i>lis pendens</i> is a very small fraction of what the unfortunate man will have to pay before the proceedings are over.</P>

      <P>Amendment 8 is meant to deal with people who have entered equitable claims.  Deputy Derrig's amendment would mean more than that.  It would deal with a man who has a claim because, let us say, there was a fraudulent deed registered on the land previously.  It is wider, and it is only right that such a man should protect himself.</P>

      <P>I do not think that was the idea of the amendment, because there is an obvious way to protect.  This amendment was obviously drafted by a legal man, and he referred to a pending suit.  I took it for granted that Deputies had considered that the way to protect a person who had not a suit pending was by registering a caution. That is provided for in amendment 8. But in the case where there was a pending suit, as in amendment 5, you had in view where a writ was issued or proceedings had been commenced.</P>

There was also the idea that that particular way would be taken by anybody who wanted to protect his interests, and who knew a certain loan was about being obtained.  That was, to our mind, the best way of doing it.  A simple notice might not be fair because it might be purely from the point of view of obstruction.</P>

      <P>Where a suit is not pending the caution is the best way. Amendment 8 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where, at the date of an instrument creating a charge on registered land which would on registration be entitled to priority under this section, a caution under section 69 of the Act of 1891 appears on the register in respect of such land and such caution was lodged by a person claiming to be entitled to an equitable claim as defined by this section in respect of such land and such equitable claim is at any time after the registration of such charge registered as an estate or interest in or burden on such land, the relative priorities of such charge and such equitable claim shall notwithstanding anything contained in this Act be determined as if this Act had not been passed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That provides the simplest possible machinery, because all a claimant who has not a pending suit need do, is simply to register a caution.  The expense is practically nil.  He need do no more at any time afterwards&mdash;in one, two or three years.  After that, he can prove his caution and translate his equitable claim into a charge on the land.  Then the mortgage of the Agricultural Credit Corporation takes no priority.</P>

      <P>It is for that reason that the caution is being adopted.  I can imagine a family quarrel where there is some person living in the house and that person may be an old person of 70, with a right to £10 a year or a room in the house, or some very small equity.  All that may lapse in five or six years, and, even if liquidated and capitalised, it amounts to nothing.  The caution is registered and all the caution does is that it makes the Agricultural Credit Corporation privy to the fact that there is an equitable claimant there who says that he or she has rights and it will then be for the Corporation at their own risk either to give a loan and chance it or investigate the matter. Where they investigate it, possibly they will find that the old woman will die in a few years time and the caution is obviously vexatious.  Then they will give the loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that question is in order in connection with the whole Bill.  They cannot.  At the present moment I or anybody could register a charge on the folio against land and it would defeat any debt of any kind. This Bill does not affect the problem that the Deputy has in mind.  At all times there were two ways of protecting <Col N="181" /> a debt.  One was by securities of one kind or another and the second was by a mortgage.</P>
      <P>If a debtor such as a shopkeeper gives credit on the security of the character or liquid assets of their customers which is what they always do, then that could always and at all times before the Local Registration of Title Act be defeated by the debtor going to somebody else, borrowing money from him and registering it against the land.  It could be defeated so far as the land is concerned.  That is the reason that people who wanted to make assurance doubly sure took mortgage as well as personal security but this Act does not affect that position. If this Bill were never passed and I, say a customer of a shopkeeper, ran a bill of £200 or £300, went to the local bank, borrowed £200 and gave them a mortgage on my land, the shopkeeper is defeated as against the land; that was always the case.  It is in the nature of the case.</P>

      <P>Sometimes shopkeepers take a deposit of a deed as against the land.  Are they defeated by the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be. There are no deeds in a case of registered land.  When land is registered, the title is simply a folio and the deed of registration is kept in the office of the local Registrar of Title.  Nothing but fee simple land can be registered. If a tenant's holding become fee simple, the first step is that the Land Commission acquaints the Registrar of Title.  &ldquo;We have now vested the fee simple of this land in so-and-so.  We enclose a copy of the land certificate.&rdquo; That is the original deed of title. Thereupon the registrar keeps the land certificate in his own office and registers the title.  That land certificate is not available for pledging and is not available as an equitable deposit. Moreover, if afterwards the man who has been registered as owner assigns his interest to his eldest son on his marriage the deed is kept in the Registry of Title and is not available as an equitable deposit.  So that an equitable deposit of deeds would <Col N="182" /> only affect deeds in connection with the land prior to the registration. For instance, if it was a tenancy prior to registration and the tenancy went from A. to B. by sale and the assignment was by deed.  When B. became owner of the tenancy he had his title deeds and might afterwards hold them and pledge them with the nearest bank as an equitable deposit.  They are not in equity.  At the same time the bank has these title deeds.  They belong to the land before the land was registered. They are of some value because if such a man went somewhere else for more money he would be asked for the deeds but could not produce them.  In that way there is some protection but we meet the case by the caution.  Next we provide by this system of cautions that where anyone claims equitable rights to lands registered arising before the vesting of the lands they may register a caution on the folio and where such caution is registered then the mortgages under this Act have no priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends whether the sale was a sale made by an owner before vesting.  The case Deputy Leonard and you put up is the same. While the land was a tenancy the tenancy might have been mortgaged before vesting; the owner may have made a will giving the land to A and certain rights to B.  These rights might never be enforced, but may have been registered in the Registry of Deeds which is a different thing from the <Col N="186" /> Registry of Title.  Afterwards B, becoming the vested owner of this land, should register, but there is no note in the Registration of Title about these rights.</P>
      <P>They are all equities and are postponed to the mortgage of the Agricultural Credit Corporation unless the mortgagee enters a caution.  But I may say there are seldom or never such cases.  If a man makes a will administration has been taken out, and if a man goes to the trouble of registering a mortgage in the Registry of Titles that mortgage is kept alive.  He is dealing with the land the whole time; he is trying to get his money out of it.  I could hardly imagine a case where a man would have long before the lands were vested a mortgage on a tenancy and where part of the money was not paid off.  I could hardly imagine such a case arising, if the mortgagor, having a caution of some kind on the folio, thought there was any danger whatever from the registered owner.  It is the same case.  That is in equity the same as a family charge.</P>

      <P>I said that the Corporation would decide whether the caution was frivolous, in answer to a question by Deputy de Valera, when he asked was there not the danger that vexatious cautions would be registered. I will tell you how they would decide. A man applies for a loan.  They get a copy of his folio and see a caution. They would write back: &ldquo;We are not giving you the loan&mdash;there is a caution &mdash;unless you discharge it.&rdquo;  His aunt is living with him.  She is an old woman who has a small equitable claim&mdash;she has a right to a room.  She knows the law.  She has been learning it a long time to give him a bad time.  She has registered a caution.  He writes back and says: &ldquo;This is my aunt.  Under my grandfather's will she has a right to a room in the house until her death.&rdquo; She has an equity, such as it is.  The question is what is it worth or is it worth anything?  Of course the Agricultural <Col N="187" /> Credit Corporation will verify that she is an aunt who is old and has only the right to a room.  They will say: &ldquo;Yes; that does not interfere with the security of the land one iota. £20 would buy her out.  She is not likely to live to a hundred years of age.&rdquo;  On the other hand, if the man writes back and says: &ldquo;It is my brother who has registered that caution. He is the only brother.  The father died intestate and the brother has a half share.&rdquo;  They will say: &ldquo;You will have to settle it with your brother before we can do anything for you.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The amount by which the estate and interest of the mortgagor shall be insufficient to satisfy a priority charge which is not a permanent improvement charge shall as between any equitable claimant who is residing with the mortgagor at the date of the registration of such charge, other than a person having an equitable claim who has not attained the age of 21 years or is a person of unsound mind, and other equitable claimants be deemed to be charged on all and every (if any) estate and interest in such land to which such equitable claimant so residing with the mortgagor is at the date of the registration of such charge as a burden affecting the said lands or becomes at any time thereafter beneficially entitled in indemnification of all equitable claims against such lands by equitable claimants other than such equitable <Col N="188" /> claimants so residing with the mortgagor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment, stripped of parenthesis, means that the interest of an equitable claimant who resides with the mortgagor should be liable for whatever part of the priority charge is not covered by the interest of the mortgagor.  I quite understand that you legislate for the general as a rule, and try and fit in the particular under the law.  But the Minister will appreciate that cases might arise which would require an amendment of this nature to be put in the Bill.  You might get somebody of a spendthrift nature who got a loan and instead of applying it to the purposes for which it was obtained cleared out with the money or something like that.  I submit that an amendment of that nature might be worth considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that amendment carefully.  The effect of the amendment is, as Deputy Fahy states, that it is an attempt to make the equitable claim of a person who resides with the owner liable for whatever part of the liability the owner is liable to a third party who is not living in the house&mdash;for whatever part of the liability the registered owner's share is unable to meet.  Of course you will find a case undoubtedly where a brother or sister has left the house for some reason or another and has been out of the house for a great number of years. At the same time let me say they have an equitable&mdash;I use the term in the moral sense as opposed to the legal sense&mdash;claim.  In all fair play they should have a certain claim.  Of course it is a fact that they are not in as good a position to find out whether the land is being mortgaged or charged as a person who is living in the house, and hence they are not in as good a position to come to a conclusion as to whether they should not register a caution. That is all true.  But such a case as that is the very big exception.  The exact opposite is, in practice, the case that will always arise.  There would be something to be said for them if we were dealing now with big estates, but remember as the Bill stands at present the only mortgage that can take priority is a £200 mortgage.  That is <Col N="189" /> brother or the sister of the registered the sort of loan that is being made to a man whose valuation lies between £10 and £30.  If you were dealing with people whose valuation lies between £100 and £200 or between £70 and £150 there would be more in Deputy Fahy's point.  Rightly or wrongly, you have to take the facts of life into account. So far as the small farmer is concerned generally two or three of his sons go into the Guards or go to the nearest town, at the age of 22 or 23 years, and do not expect very much out of the holding.  A brother or two are left working on the land until they are 27 or 30 years of age.  They have greater claims against the holding because they have put more into it than the brother who is doing well or badly in the local town.</P>
      <P>So far as the bigger land owner is concerned, whether he is a tenant or owner in fee, a man with a valuation between £150 and £200, his mode of life is different.  There is £10,000 or £6,000 worth of property, and the sisters and brothers, whether they are gone or not, whether they are doctors, solicitors, or have entered convents, have certain equities.  There would be very much more reason for protecting the interests of such equitable claimants. Examine in practice how that would work out.  Take the case of two brothers and a sister.  Their father has died.  One brother has left.  He has joined the Guards or has started a shop or has gone to America.  It does not matter whether he was a hardworking fellow or not.  He left at the age of nineteen or twenty years and may be doing fairly well somewhere else.  He left the sister and brother at home.  The brother is the registered owner of the land and the sister has her one-third share.  She has been working there from seventeen years of age until she is twenty-five or twenty-six years of age.  They are in excellent circumstances, and with her consent the brother goes to borrow from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  She will not stop him by registering a caution. She is all in favour of this.  He borrows and uses the money wisely. She works on until she is about thirty and there is some question of her getting married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> The boy who is in the Guards comes home and says, &ldquo;You have got to pay me back and, if you are not able to pay me, my sister's share must pay me.&rdquo;  The equities you have really to look after in this Bill are the equities of the women folk.  The men are generally gone away and have not much equity.  It is the equities of the sisters that have to be, as a general rule, looked after.  The others are fairly well able to look after themselves. Take the case of two brothers, one of them married with four or five sons and a daughter, and one unmarried, 70 years of age, with a better holding in the next parish.  The youngest son goes to live with the uncle and it is understood that he is to get the farm.  The father dies.  The son who has left the house for years and is to get a better holding makes a claim for his equities against the only sister.  On balance this would undoubtedly work the gravest injustice. Generally speaking, the man who has gone away has not anything like the claim of the people who remain there and have been working the farm for years.</P>

      <P>The Minister ought to try and protect the people who are in the farms in a different way from bringing it in in a Bill of this kind.

      <P>You must apply the circumstances of any Bill.  I am making the point because Deputy Fahy introduced an amendment to give protection to the brother who is away.  He raised that principle himself. I agree that the question of finding work for the three brothers and four sisters is a totally different thing.  This Bill does not raise that point and you cannot discuss that in connection with the Bill.  He raised that particular principle.  He said that there are certain equitable claimants who should get special protection.  I put it to him that if anybody should get special protection it is not the brother or sister who has gone away but the owner living in the house.  I have not <Col N="191" /> raised this question at all.  As the Bill stands, all equitable claimants have the same rights and the same way of protecting them, namely, the caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is going away from the point altogether. Those who are resident with the person who asked for the loan, it is assumed&mdash;the Minister indicated it quite clearly&mdash;will have the means of protecting themselves.  But the absent people will not know about this charge being put on the land and will have no means of protecting themselves.  It is assumed that the people residing with the person who is getting the loan know about the loan and approve of it&mdash;in other words, will not take any steps to prevent the loan being given.  These people are able to protect themselves, and protection is afforded them, but the persons who are absent and whose interests are being interfered with owing to the fact that they do not know anything about this loan being raised are the persons to whom you want to give protection.  If there are injustices of a different kind, if there are injustices due to the fact that one man goes away and leaves his farm, that has nothing to do with the Bill.  We ought not to try in the Bill to remedy things which are of a different kind altogether.</P>

      <P>All right.  It is a question of equity.  It is admitted that under this Bill&mdash;in fact, any Bill&mdash;you will have a certain amount of injustice. That is perhaps putting it too far.  Let me take the Bill as it is.  It is possible to do injustice under a Bill.  It follows that you weigh up the advantages and disadvantages and strike a balance. That is the whole principle of the Bill. Of course, you can save your conscience formally by saying that you provide machinery under which anybody who has any claim can safeguard himself and can go on to say &ldquo;<i>Ignoratio legis neminem excusat</i>,&rdquo; which is the fundamental maxim that all countries must <Col N="192" /> adopt in connection with legislation, so that formally we are in the right.  We are discussing now, if you like, the question of equities.  As a rule, the people who are away do know.  The Deputy is thinking of a man living in Dublin not in touch with his brother, who is a farmer in Mayo, or a man living in New York not in touch with his brother, who is a farmer in Mayo.  But that is not the general case that will arise under this Act&mdash;a man living in Dublin or New York will not go back to Mayo to look for his equity.  The case that generally arises is amongst people who are living in the same barony and who visit each other on Sunday.  One of them is living with an uncle, and so on.  Another girl is married out of the house.  That is the case that happens under this Act, and in that case the people out of the house have a very shrewd idea of what is going on.  They are much freer in one sense to register the caution, because they have no interest in the future of the holding.  If the holding does well, they will get something out of it; but if the man living on the holding goes bankrupt, they have their own places and their own houses.  They are much freer to register the caution, if you look at it from that point of view.  The person who is not free to register the caution is a sister living with a brother who helps to work the farm and does not want to prevent him from getting a loan.  She has all the equities really. In odd cases, the principal equities will be the other way about; but I put it to Deputies who know the small farmer very well, and who know his condition of living, that this will work more injustice than otherwise.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister with regard to Section 3 if he is satisfied that it is not necessary to protect equitable claims in respect of permanent improvement charges.  Of course, I know we cannot in any Bill attain absolutely what is desirable.  I think we should not be satisfied that every loan for a permanent improvement is going to be a loan that will add to the value of the farm.  I pointed out on Second Reading that it would be easily possible to show that a loan of £300 for the building of a house or the improvement of a house would not mean that the selling value of the farm would be increased by £300.  The Minister may have since considered that.  I do not know whether it would be worth while forcing an amendment or whether it would be practicable to amend the Bill at all in that respect.  If the Minister is satisfied that such a case does not require any special legislation I am satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is undoubtedly a fact that apparently a loan could be made for drainage that might be a failure or for buildings such as stables.  I am not sure that loans can be given to improve a dwelling house or if the Corporation Credit Society have power to do so, I forget for the moment, but the loan must be for some purpose in connection with the farm.  There will be cases where loans are given for permanent drainage which might be a failure, and in that case the permanent value of the holding would not be improved very much.  But that would be a very rare case.  As a rule drainage of a farm <Col N="194" /> does improve it.  Equally there will be loans given to put up a cow byre which may not permanently improve the farm to the amount of the loan. Then again, the whole situation of course is full of difficulties, because it is very hard to say whether the price which is fetched by a farm put up for public auction, is an indication of how much the farm has been improved because, of course, the price varies with the times.  But as a general rule a loan made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation such as a loan for drainage or the building of a house will improve a holding up to the full amount and for this reason: Remember the loan will only be 50 per cent. of the value of the holding and, at the maximum, of course, they never would give the full 50 per cent. for drainage or for building.  That is the maximum. Remember the Agricultural Credit Corporation is in an unusually good position to see that the money is expended for the purposes for which it was borrowed.  The Act contains a provision that makes it a criminal offence, that carries with it a punishment of imprisonment for a borrower to expend the money in any way except that stated in his application.  Therefore, you have the position that the loan will be a small one, that it will be well &ldquo;vetted,&rdquo; that it will be for permanent improvement, and that the money must be spent on permanent improvement.  On the whole, I think there is good reason why a distinction should be made in regard to permanent improvements. There is good reason why the owner, the mortgagor's interest should not be entirely or specifically mortgaged for permanent improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take drainage.  Where the money is wisely expended the holding is permanently increased in value.  Any farmer knows that people buy farms of land in bad heart.  They buy land that has been neglected or grazed or meadowed for years and years.  They buy big acreage of land for cheap money.  Any farmer knows that when he comes into a large portion of land which is in bad heart he has to spend fifty or sixty per cent. of the purchase money he paid for the land to get it into good heart.  The difference between  <Col N="195" /> 200 acres of land that is properly worked, where the drains are being kept open, the buildings kept right, and where the land has been kept in good heart, and the same acreage of the same quality where the land has been allowed to deteriorate is enormous.  When you get cheap land, no matter how good the quality, even if it be the best county in Ireland, in the County Meath, you cannot get any bargain if the land has been neglected.  You do not spend a lump sum, but you have to spend, this year and next year, and it takes six or seven years to get it back again into heart. That, of course, is the reverse side of the story.  On the other hand money well expended on land undoubtedly permanently improves it.  It would be very harsh indeed in the case of a farmer if the money he borrowed and genuinely spent on permanent improvements which, in fact, increased the real value of the land for anyone who agrees to buy it, should be earmarked against his interests in it.  You will get injustice on the other side, but, on the whole, I am satisfied you do less on this.</P>

      <P>It does not give much, but it gives a little by an alternative method.  I shall read the section:</P>
      <P>(1) Where registered land is subject to a priority charge which is not a permanent improvement charge and a person entitled at the date of the registration of such charge to an equitable claim against such land is at the date of such registration under the age of twenty-one years, or of unsound mind, such person shall be entitled at any time after such registration but, in the case of a person under the age of twenty-one years at the time of such registration, not after he attains the age of twenty-five years to obtain from the Circuit Court an order that the mortgagor do, by giving security, lodgment of money in court or such other means as shall be approved of by the Court, give to such person an indemnity which in the opinion of the Court adequately protects the equitable claim of such person against the said priority charge and that in default of the mortgagor giving such indemnity within three months after the date of such order the said registered land be sold by the Court and the proceeds of such sale be applied according to law and that in any event the costs of such person in relation to such order, the application therefor and all proceedings thereunder when taxed as between solicitor and client be paid by the mortgagor.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The rights and benefits conferred on any persons by this section shall in addition and without prejudice to any other rights or benefits to which such persons may be entitled under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The layman will say there is a certain amount of that section eye-wash.  You may say it is idle to ask the borrower for such security; that if he was in a position to give such security to anybody he would not be in the necessity to borrow money; that was my view on first blush.  But there is this to be said on that: A man with a sixty or seventy-acre farm worth £1,000 will want maybe £100 on a long term loan.  He will not get the money on long term <Col N="197" /> loan from the bank.  He might want it for drainage.</P>
    <P>The great value of the Corporation is that it can give long-term loans.  That man wants a loan for drainage purposes for twenty-five years.  He wants £100 in that way, and does not want to be under a compliment to the bank by signing a bill.  Supposing he wants £200, he gets it, and his brother, who is a lunatic or whose affairs are being managed by a committee in Lunacy, or, in case his brother is dead, his son, being under twenty-one years of age, and having an equity in the case, registers a caution.  Perhaps he only threatens to do so, or he is being advised by somebody to make trouble, perhaps rightly so, to make sure that his rights are safeguarded.  He does not want to be put to the expense of an administration suit, which is very expensive, and, moreover, minors have not the same rights or remedies in administration and equity suits as those who are not minors.  They have to take proceedings which are very expensive in order to get their shares.  This provides a simple alternative.  He can go to the man and put it up to him, or he can get the court to order him to lodge securities that will cover the claim for £200.  Such a man can do so, and is in a position to go to the Corporation and say, &ldquo;I borrowed £200 on land which, as you know, is worth, say, £1,000.  My nephew, who has an equitable claim, insists on my giving him security.  Have you any objection to my giving a mortgage for £200?&rdquo;  No one would object. The minor would be satisfied, as he has ample security.  That is one important point.  There is another important point which I am not prepared to go into at present.  I have discussed this with an equity lawyer and it is a highly technical question, namely, protecting the equities which a minor may have. It is desirable to give a man a simpler way of safeguarding his claim than he has by way of an administration suit.</P>

      <P>I would like to take them now.  Before they are moved, may I say that I suggested that they should be postponed to the end, as my idea was to have a discussion on the other amendments, so that Deputies could clear their minds about the rights and wrongs of equitable claims.  It is clear that we must have some of this sort of legislation, but the less we have of it the better.  We are to some extent interfering with the rights which are there between persons.  If we have to interfere with them&mdash;of course, every Act of Parliament does interfere&mdash;I think the less we interfere the better. I think Deputies can see for themselves, because this Bill has been considered very carefully, that it is, as far as possible, advisable to limit this particular procedure.  I pointed out previously in regard to a point which Deputy Fahy made that this Bill will do far more injustice if applied to a big holding than if applied to a small one, because very real equities are attached in the case of farms of fifty, eighty or a hundred acres.  After all, the real injustice consists in taking away what a man always thinks he is entitled to get; a man who does not expect anything has no real grievance.  The real grievance is making people alter their whole mode of living.  You are taking away the rights which people thought they always would get, and in respect of which they lived in a certain way and on a certain scale.  You might not do any great injustice in regard to small holdings in respect of this Bill, but when you go on up to a £500 loan you might do injustice. A man who wants a loan of £500 should discharge equities.  A man who is security for a loan of £500 has a farm worth at least £1,000 and should discharge equities.  I put that to Deputy Gorey in respect of a loan of £800, that a man who is security for a loan of £500 and has £1,000 worth of land ought to discharge equities and that we should not be asked to take risks by applying this Bill to a man in that position.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (c), page 2, line 40, to delete the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We approach this subject, first of all, from the direction of fixing the figure at so many times the poor law valuation. We saw in that many objections which were raised by the Minister.  If you make the figure ten times the poor law valuation and leave out the limit of £200 you would be creating a certain amount of injustice to possible equitants on larger holdings.  It might also be mentioned, if you take the poor law valuation, that the holding generally has a higher market value compared with the poor law valuation as between smaller and larger holdings. In that way you would be unjust to claimants looking for loans who have small rather than large holdings.  When you come to look at it from the point of view of enlarging the £200, I do not think there is much injustice done in raising the amount from £200 to £500. I think the Minister mentioned that the danger would be where there are real equities on farms with an acreage of from seventy-five to a hundred and fifty acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even taking the value of that farm of 75 acres at a somewhat lower figure than Deputy Nolan would put it, it might be worth say £1,000.  Anything over 75 acres might be worth more than £1,000.  Therefore there would not seem to be a great danger to any claim within the £500.  The point is that the limit of £200 enables the Agricultural <Col N="200" /> Credit Corporation to deal with a person whose farm has a market value of £400, but then there is a gap in the case of farms value from £400 to £1,000, or £400 to £800.  I know that on these farms, in the case of County Wexford at any rate, loans would be required just as urgently as on small farms and in some cases the equities cannot be discharged.  Those who oppose this amendment I know will say: &ldquo;If a man is able to give security for a loan of £500 why does he not discharge the equities?&rdquo;  How can he discharge the equities?  In some cases it is absolutely impossible.  As far as I understand it, the land is registered subject to equities and possibly the claimant cannot be found.  Possibly the claimant may be a first cousin who is supposed to be in America, whether alive or dead the owner does not know. Yet that man may urgently require a loan of £400 or £500 in order to improve his holding.  He may be able to give very good security apart from this possible equity.  The Minister has tried to make the case that relatively there is not so much injustice in giving a loan of £200 on a £400 farm as there would be in giving a loan of £500 on a £1,000 farm, but I cannot see that. I do not think there is anything in it. I agree with the Minister that when we are legislating on a point like this we ought to legislate not perhaps as little as possible, but as certain as possible so that the Corporation may not have to come back again to have the limit increased to £500.  We ought to do it now.</P>

      <P>The reason I mentioned the sum of £400 in my amendment was that I recognise that at the present time £400 does not represent much money with regard to the purchase of land.  It certainly represents considerably less than six or seven years ago, while probably it represents more than it did before the war.  I inserted £400 in the amendment because I thought it would be more acceptable than the existing figure, and would be fair all <Col N="201" /> round.  Of course, I am more or less in the hands of the Minister.  If the Minister is prepared to accept £400 or £500, or a compromise between the two, I am perfectly satisfied.</P>

      <P>I want to remind Deputy Dr. Ryan that there is nothing to prevent the Corporation from lending a man who has a farm worth £1,000, a sum of £300.  It does not fellow that because he has a farm worth £1,000, he wants half the value of the land.  I put it to him that taking the ordinary farmer in County Wexford a loan of £350 is as much as would be good for him, without discharging equities.  The reason I suggest £350 is that the difference between £200, the present limit, and £500 the amount which Deputy Dr. Ryan suggests is £300.  I suggest that we should split that amount, that is £150, and add it to the present limit, making £350.  That is as big a loan as such a man could reasonably ask for without discharging equities.  I would prefer myself to say £300, but I suggest that £350 is at the outside sufficiently large to give to such a man.</P>

      <P>I think that £300 is quite enough but it is a matter for the House.  I suggest that £300 is enough to give without asking a man to discharge equities.  Remember that those who have farms each worth six, seven, eight or nine hundred pounds can get a loan of £300 without discharging equities.  I am quite willing to leave it to a vote but I put it to Deputies that in a case like this £300 should be the maximum.  £300 is a big loan and a man with 70 or 80 acres of land can get £300 without discharging equities.  I had intended putting it to the Dáil that £300 should <Col N="202" /> be agreed upon but I want to divide the difference between the amounts in the amendments and that stated in the Act.  Of course it is an arbitrary figure but it is very hard to know how much should be given.  I think that £500 is too much and that £400 is too much.</P>

I pointed out that under Section 13 it is provided that there shall be no unlicensed creameries or factories dealing with milk products established without <Col N="203" /> the consent of the Minister.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to erect, establish, or acquire any creamery unless such creamery is erected, established or acquired under and in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister under this section and it shall not be lawful for any person to maintain a creamery which was erected, established, or acquired in contravention of this section.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant to any person a licence to erect, establish, or acquire a creamery at such place and subject to such (if any) conditions as the Minister shall specify in such licence.</P>
      <P>(3)  If any person erects, establishes, acquires, or maintains any creamery in contravention of this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding ten pounds for every day during which such offence is continued.</P>

      <P>If Deputies will turn to the first section they will find the definition of &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;  I think that is one of the most important sections, and it is certainly one of the most essential sections, if we are to prevent redundancy arising again.  Deputy Moore's point is, what about a creamery that wants to establish a cheese factory?  The very same thing arises.  Our programme is to hand over the manufacture of all milk products to the farmers themselves. At the present moment there is only one condensed milk factory and butter factory in the country.  There is little cheese being manufactured.  Butter, condensed milk, cheese, casein and one hundred and one other things from milk products can be manufactured.  It is our policy equally to hand over that to the suppliers of the raw material.  If any creamery wants to start making <Col N="204" /> cheese or any other milk product there is nothing to stop it.  But there is one thing we will not allow.  Suppose there is a condensed milk factory taking all the separated milk over a certain area&mdash; all the separated milk that can be turned out&mdash;and there is a row in the factory amongst the members of the Committee.  We will assume that the milk factory is owned by the Co-operative Society and there is a split; one half of the members want to set up another condensed milk factory or a casein factory, or a proprietor wants to come in and set up another factory in competition, the object being to compete for the milk.  That cannot be allowed, because it would be redundancy all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather glad to hear the Minister last night when he was explaining his Bill, and he went on to expound some interesting principles with regard to the keeping out of foreign capital in the creamery industry and preventing it from being allowed to come into the country again.  We only hope that the same principle may be applied in other directions.  We have heard complaints from time to time of the deal made some eighteen months ago with regard to the taking over of certain proprietary creameries.  We only hope that if there are any such transactions in the near future, and if the Government is going to make regulations with regard to those transactions as they are under this Bill, that they will try to remedy those grievances. The principal grievance which it was impossible to remedy in all cases was the site of the creamery which was selected to remain.  There were big complaints that certain farmers did not get fair play; that they were compelled to bring their milk a long distance and it amounted to a charge of favouritism when one creamery was retained as against another.  Secondly, there was a complaint that certain employees taken over in the creameries were not treated very fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point about the distance which milk is brought to a creamery, I would like to know if the Minister has considered&mdash;I am sure there are difficulties in the way&mdash; whether there could be a uniform price <Col N="205" /> given regardless of distance.  The farmers who would have to send milk over a distance should be compensated for the length of transit.  I have been inquiring from people interested in the creamery business whether there is any check on the cream contained in the milk, whether anybody has any check on the manager of the creamery, or whether his figures have to be accepted on all occasions as the correct figures. I believe, as regards the inspectors sent round by the Ministry or by the I.A.O. Society, neither of them makes any attempt, as far as I know, to check the figures of the cream content which is returned by the creamery manager. Some farmers do believe that the true figure is not given in all cases.  Would it be possible to provide any system whereby the figures could be checked, or could there be a surprise visit from an inspector?  Perhaps they could collect samples from time to time to see if the figures are correct.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained the Bill very fully, but even with that explanation there are points somewhat involved.  Section 9 (1) sets out that &ldquo;it shall not be lawful for such society to take any supply of milk from such person so long as such refusal or neglect continues.&rdquo;  That is, that the society cannot take milk from the men who refuse to take shares in the society.  If I understand the other parts of the Bill correctly, that society has nevertheless to pay the company from which it took over.  It has to pay the selling society for what it got. I want to know how is the taking over society to pay the selling society if a large number of farmers who are supplying do not take shares in the taking over society?  There would naturally be a difficulty to see where the money would come from.  Section 13 (2) sets out: &ldquo;The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant to any person a licence to erect, establish, or acquire a creamery at such place and subject to such (if any) conditions as the Minister shall specify in such licence.&rdquo;  Is it necessary to have power to grant to any person a licence to carry on this trade?  I thought it was the policy to confine this industry in future to co-operative societies.</P>

      <P>Section 14 deals with the prohibition of unlicensed maintenance of certain creameries and sub-section (4) says the section applies to any creamery erected or established between 1st January, 1928, and the day immediately preceding the passage of this Act.  That seems to me to be very unfair.  It is certainly unfair because there is nothing to compel the Minister.  Suppose a creamery is commenced within 4 or 5 months.  There is nothing to compel the Minister to give a licence to that creamery, and as far as I can understand this Bill, they could be compelled to close down actually; that is, any societies started since 1st January could be so closed. Then Section 15 deals with inspection of the records, etc., of creameries.  I am not sure of the full meaning of that section.  Does it mean that this inspection is to be carried out as long as the negotiations are in force, or does it mean that this is a permanent inspection of creameries?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchasing company shall accept the title of the company to the premises, milk supply, and goodwill without search or inquiry as good and sufficient in all respects, and <Col N="207" /> shall make no objection or requisition in respect of the same on any point or matter whatsoever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really what nearly always happens in a title which follows a sale for full market value. That is almost a common form in a deed of assignment which follows a previous sale for the full market value. That would be serious if it were not for the fact that usually a solicitor will begin his title with the previous sale for full market value.  A sale has taken place for full market value of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland and the Newmarket Dairy Company, and so we are really beginning our title on that sale for full market value.  That is a common form.  They have their solicitors on the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand that. I thought this was the first purchase. Certainly, if the Bill would do what the title itself sets out I suppose it will do a whole lot.  It is to make provision for the more effective regulation and control in certain respects of the dairying industry and persons and co-operative societies engaged therein with a view to the better reorganisation of that industry and for other matters connected with such reorganisation.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is able to carry out what the title tells us the Bill is for, I think we will have done a good day's work in putting it through.  It is a very involved Bill, but we cannot complain on the question of time.  We had a good while to examine this Bill before the Second Reading came on, but though I have read it three or four times I do not understand the Bill nor the full import of the Bill.  Perhaps it is only when we reach the Committee Stage that we will probably understand it.  I would like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to put through the Bill this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Ryan when he mentions that this Bill is very complicated and very involved.  I read the Bill fairly carefully, and I presume I know something about the dairying industry <Col N="208" /> and the situation which led up to this Bill, but I find it extremely difficult to understand the Bill.  We had a good deal of criticism recently as to a certain type of legislation going on the Statute Book, legislation which sometimes the judges on the Bench found it difficult to interpret.  I hope that this is not legislation of that kind, and that this Bill has been drafted as simply as it could be drafted, taking into account the necessity of the situation which necessitated its drafting.  I sometimes wonder if it would not be possible to devise a more simple and a more easily understood form of drafting Bills of this kind, because as far as the ordinary non-legal mind can judge, a Bill of this kind may provide ample opportunities for lawyers at a later stage to make more money out of the farmers when it comes to a question of deciding what the intentions of the Bill were.</P>
      <P>As to the general intention of the Bill, I regard it as a culmination of the legislative measure which is to conclude a series of transactions in connection with the co-operative and proprietary creameries in this country.  I personally happened to be in touch with the situation which has led up to this final Bill, which brings to a conclusion the difficulties which arose in connection with the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland. And while I regard this Bill in the circumstances as essential, and while I recognise that there was practically no alternative for the State in the situation that had arisen but to step in and take the action they have taken in connection with the reorganisation of the creameries of Ireland, still at the same time I cannot help regarding the situation in a sense as another tragedy of lost opportunities for the Irish farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the situation which has arisen in connection with the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland would not have reached the present stage and would not have been so expensive to the State and to the farmers who are members of the Co-operative Societies in Ireland if in 1922 these farmers had been so well organised that they could have stepped in with <Col N="209" /> the Co-operative Organisation in Ireland&mdash;could have stepped in and with the help of the State obtained the control of these creameries in connection with which this legislation is now finally implementing the position.  I say that because I am convinced that in 1922 the creameries which are concerned in this legislation could have been acquired by a co-operative organisation of Ireland for a very much smaller sum than the sum at which the State was eventually obliged to pay. I was personally in touch with the situation which arose at the time and I had in mind at the time the possibility of the co-operative societies acquiring the creameries of the Condensed Milk Company.  I recognised that eventually it would become necessary in some shape or form, if the co-operative societies were to exist and to hold their own that they should make some attempt to acquire those creameries. In 1922 the creameries were practically derelict.  They were derelict in the sense that they were not doing any work at the time.  At that time they could have been acquired at a lower price if there were any organisation of the farmers sufficiently strong and sufficiently well financed to undertake their purchase.  Unfortunately, as one connected with the organisation of the farmers, I must say that the situation was lost, because the farmers were not well organised and were not well financed enough to do so, and the political situation was such that the farmers were not able to step in and acquire those creameries which have since been acquired for them by the State.  This Bill is now finally to implement and validate the situation that has arisen in connection with those creameries.  I sometimes wonder if the Dáil recognises the importance of this legislation. Some of us who have been accustomed more or less to the doctrine of laissez faire, the doctrine that a man has a right to do what he likes with his own must recognise that in this Bill which we are considering to-day and which will presumably pass through this House there is an immense interference with a man's right to do what he likes with his own&mdash;with the old <Col N="210" /> accepted idea of a man's right to do what he likes with his own, and the accepted idea about the freedom of the subject and people in regard to private business, freedom and enterprise.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent I regard that as not as desirable as it should be.  I think it is a tragedy with regard to the organisation of the dairying industry in Ireland at present that the State has been forced to take such a prominent part.  I am convinced it would be much better for the farmers of Ireland and for the agricultural industry in Ireland if the farmers themselves could have been induced and were in a position to do a great deal of the work which has been done by the State.  I am convinced from the connection I have had with the farming community and the community in general that there is a persistent idea that every advance which must be made in regard to agricultural and industrial development in this country must be made by the State, and that the ordinary individual can stand up in every case where help is needed and say what can the Government do?  On the other hand, in regard to every situation which arises in connection with the general interests of agriculture in particular and in connection with industrial interests, when someone makes a complaint that things are not quite as they should be, the common form of exclamation is &ldquo;what is the Government doing?&rdquo;  This is another instance of what the Government has had to do.  Because of the circumstances which have arisen and which exist, if we are to take our steps in proper time amongst the ranks of the countries which are competing for the market for agricultural produce, and if we are to hold our own with regard to the quantity and quality of our produce, it is necessary that steps should be taken without delay.  For that reason the State has to step in. This Bill is not perhaps the last one necessary in connection with the organisation of the farmers.  We understand there is another Bill on the stocks.  I am hoping that when these Bills are passed the burden of carrying on the work in connection with the development and improvement of organised agriculture in the country will be placed on the shoulders of the <Col N="211" /> farmers and that they will carry it, improve, act with initiative and independence. The very idea of State control is in my opinion opposed to and contrary to the spirit of co-operation. The two are not really compatible, and if this situation of State control is to continue and is persisted in to any very considerable extent, I am afraid it will have a bad effect and will prevent a co-operative spirit from developing in the way it ought to develop.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill itself is concerned, so far as I am able to understand it, it does something to serve the purposes for which it is intended.  It is intended to validate what was, I think, a situation which was not, strictly speaking, legal and had arisen in connection with the purchase of the creameries. It so regulates things that every contingency which has arisen in connection with the purchase of those creameries is provided for.  I do not intend to go into the different sections, because they have already been explained by the Minister, and it is not my business nor am I in a position to enter into any further explanation.  It seems to me it does do what is intended by the Department, but I am wondering whether it does it in the best possible way.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the Bill is very elaborate and complex. The particular drafting of the Bill may be necessary to meet the situation which has arisen, but if it could be drafted in a simpler fashion or made more easily understandable I think it would be desirable.  I suggest that the Minister, at an earlier stage if he thought of it, in regard to this Bill might have followed the idea, introduced I think in the case of another Bill by the Minister for Justice, of attaching an explanatory statement to it. I think Deputies who have no legal training who are interested in Bills of this kind ought to be placed in a position of knowing that the Bill which they are passing serves the purpose for which it was intended, and that there is not concealed in it any intention beyond what was obvious and plain on the face of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general principles of the Bill I have nothing to add.  The <Col N="212" /> details will probably emerge more clearly as we come to the different sections in Committee.  I think it is due to the Dáil, and I hope the Minister will meet us in that regard, to have a full and ample explanation of every section of the Bill as we go through it.  Again I express the feeling, while recognising the necessity for State intervention in this matter to implement and complete the legal position which has arisen in connection with State intervention that it is a pity that such intervention has been necessary.  I think it is a pity that opportunities have been lost, and that because of that the farmers of Ireland have been placed in a position whereby they will have to pay through the means of their association for the co-operative creameries a price for the creameries of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland which need not be paid if the farmers were in such a position in 1922 that they could have handled the situation themselves and have prevented the intervention of outside capital.  As Deputy Dr. Ryan puts it, although it is difficult to identify capital, the parties did not serve any useful purpose beyond carrying the situation over a certain period of time and did not add materially to the wealth in the concern, but of course, because of their intervention, they have probably improved their financial position.  Interveners of this kind usually do it, not for the good of the State but for that of their own pockets.  It would have been better if the farmers themselves had been able to take advantage of the opportunity to do the work which is now being done by the State.  I am hoping that the organised farmers may, by the example which has now been shown to them by the State, begin to recognise the possibilities which they have overlooked, that they will be awake to the possibilities of the future, and that a similar situation will not be allowed to arise in connection with any co-operative movement in Ireland.  I hope that the farmers of Ireland, now that the State has intervened, will advance in the organisation which is necessary for them if their products are to take the place in the world market that they ought to take and if they are to be what they ought to be, coming <Col N="213" /> from this elimate and soil, namely, the best products of their kind in the world market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Heffernan that it is most advisable that we should not have too much State control in the development of the co-operative movement in this country.  Deputy Heffernan's knowledge of the co-operative movement, as was pointed out here the last day, is perhaps not of an expert character or he would understand that it is inevitable that some steps should be taken to put the movement on a better business footing than it has been on. I think that this Bill, in a sense, will be perhaps more important than the Co-operative Bill, because under the Co-operative Bill which it is proposed to introduce we will be discussing circumstances and developments of which we will not have full knowledge. We will be legislating for something that may happen in the future and it will be almost impossible to foresee these developments.  This Bill comes very aptly and very properly before the Co-operative Bill.  We are discussing transactions which have already taken place. As Deputy Heffernan has pointed out, the House is not in a position to understand this Bill clearly.  I think that is not on account of the way in which the Bill is worded or the inclusion of the schedules at the end, but because of the fact that the Minister has not seen fit, up to the present, to provide the House with the details of this whole transaction.  At the time we were discussing the last Supplementary Estimate for the purchase of creameries we, on this side of the House, pointed out that there ought to be a Committee to inquire into the purchase. The Minister seemed to regard that as a vote of censure on the Government. He refused to accept it.</P>

      <P>In any case it was not accepted.  It was suggested that everything in connection with the purchase and transfer of these creameries had been well done.  Nothing more could have been done and on the last <Col N="214" /> day when I asked the Minister whether the farmers had complete cognisance of and had given their agreement to all the steps that had taken place he said they had.  I have the details here of a creamery near Carrick-on-Suir, a central creamery, which was closed down in spite of the opposition of all the members of the creamery.  The name is Ahenny; it is near Piltown.  Deputy Heffernan was present, as a matter of fact, when the resolution was passed by that creamery society against the proposal to close down the creamery.  The creamery was in existence since 1891.  It had 316 cows.  It had a peak supply of 3,000 gallons.  It was run so well that it had actually been turned into a joint stock company, and was carried on until 1918.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case these were the figures that were given to me. The point is not so much the number of gallons or cows, but it was a central creamery that had been run efficiently by the local people and there was no reason for closing it down.  It was closed down against the wishes of the people.  It is not the only creamery in the country which has been closed down when the suppliers were forced to go to other creameries and societies that they did not want to go to.  We have had no opportunity of discussing these matters. I quite realise that the Department could not possibly suit everybody's convenience in these matters.  It would have helped us considerably in the discussion of this Measure if we had a detailed statement as to the number of redundant creameries which were closed down and as to the areas which had been reconstituted&mdash;if we had some particulars as to the principle which the Department had in mind when they were taking suppliers from these redundant creameries and compelling them to go to others.  It may be that there is nothing whatever in all these grievances and arguments, but there is an important point for which there is no provision in this Bill.  While it is a series of validations of agreements in order to <Col N="215" /> help the Government, and there is no proof that the Government may not have made a bad bargain, we are called upon now to sanction these agreements and say they are good bargains, and the support of the House is to be given to one side of these agreements, while the suppliers would be called upon, in the course of time, to make these moneys good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to give the House detailed information as to the basis of his calculations in regard to the amount he is putting upon the suppliers.  He is charging them, for example, five and a half per cent. interest. A pound a gallon or £3 per cow. How are these figures arrived at?  Are they based purely on the recent transfer of the Condensed Milk Company's creameries or have they any relation to the erection of new creameries, or is it entirely a question of milk supply and experience in the past in running creameries?  This new figure that has been fixed is in excess of what has been the custom in the past, and the point I want to get at is that those people who supplied milk to redundant creameries and are now compelled to go to other creameries&mdash;in some cases they have to go six miles away&mdash;those people who at considerable loss kept the old creameries going until they were finally closed down feel that they have lost a great deal by their devotion to the co-operative movement.  They stuck to their co-operative concerns and did their best to keep them going during difficult times.  Finally it was impossible to keep them going, and those people lost a considerable amount of money.  They now naturally question the right of the Minister to come along and fix what seems to me, at any rate, an entirely arbitrary figure upon them in order to cover his outlay on these purchase agreements.  It is all a question, of course, of whether the Minister made the best bargain or not. Supposing he made the best bargain. There is no check whatever in this Bill on behalf of the supplier.  He will see that the conditions of repayment will be made as easy as possible.  It is all a one-sided affair, in my opinion.  I think, as I said, that the Minister should have given us a great deal more information <Col N="216" /> in regard to how this whole business has progressed.  There is, for example, the point as to the assets and debts which were taken over.  To what extent have they been realised?  Does the Minister think it fair that the face value of these assets, the value that his expert valuers put upon them, and the face value of these debts should be put upon the supplier without any further examination by this House.  If the Government have paid too much for the creameries and taken over these debts and assets.  I think we ought to consider very seriously whether the suppliers may not have too much inflicted upon them in the repayment.  The matter perhaps, would be made a good deal clearer and the path would be more open to us if he could have told us how the Central Marketing Board is progressing.  I think that Deputy Ryan's point in that connection is very important.  If production could be levelled up and the prices levelled up so that the supplier would get the same return, and that the suppliers who are a distance away from the creameries would not be under any disadvantage as compared to those who are near, it would be a very important matter.</P>
    <P>He says that the whole thing is working out very well, and when the whole scheme is working it will undoubtedly be much more economical for the country and much better for the farmers than the wasteful system that has prevailed.  We ought to get some information as to how the Board is progressing; what improvements they have been able to effect in getting better prices for the farmers; what are the prospects for the future; and some figures to show the extent to which expenses have been reduced.  The Minister yesterday, when discussing this question of doles and subsidies, stated, as far as I understood him&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash; that he did not object so much to expenses in connection with administration, where he felt that the legislation was necessary, and that the control was necessary.  I think he ought to give the House some indication of the extent to which expenses have been reduced and some indication of how the suppliers are safeguarded in this matter.  With regard to the inspection of records, that <Col N="217" /> does not, I presume, apply to proprietary creameries.</P>

      <P>As regards the joint stock principle, it is stated in Section 11 that you are going to give members the right of holding shares in excess of £200.  I think in the re-organisation of the entire co-operative movement you will be approximating to the joint stock company idea.  Could the Minister give us any idea how a joint stock company would fare under this?  Would it be covered, or would there be any facilities given to a society, which felt that it could conduct its business better as a joint stock company, to do so?  Of course that may be the negation of co-operation, but at present undoubtedly the joint stock principle lends itself better to the Minister's idea than the ordinary co-operative society organisation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heffernan rather regretted that this Bill more or less amounts to State control.  I daresay that State control is a thing that should not be resorted to in general, but there are certain industries that, if they are to be carried on efficiently and for the benefit of the nation, need State control.  Certainly, it is necessary in the beginning.  This Bill has for its object the legalising of the buying out of the Condensed Milk Company, and also aims at the complete reorganisation of redundant creameries.  I am sure everybody in the House will admit that is a necessity.  No industry is open to so many attacks from outsiders, middlemen and dealers of every description, as the agricultural industry. It is the one industry, I believe, that we are in a position to organise efficiently and in such a way that the consumer, who really controls all industry, can be satisfied that we can guarantee the produce we put on the market to be absolutely of the highest quality and in the most healthy and sanitary condition.  Other industries, mercantile industries, have middlemen, just as there are in the agricultural industry.  They are in a position to control them, and in a better position than we are to arrange what sort of <Col N="218" /> commissions or fees the middlemen should get.  They are in a position to be more or less the masters of the middlemen, but I fear that in the agricultural industries in general the producers are not the masters of the middlemen, but that, in general, the middlemen become the masters of the producers.  There is no necessity to give details as regards prices, to show the difference between what the consumer pays and what the producer gets.  That is well known in the House. I believe that this is the beginning of an efficient means to stop that.</P>
      <P>It is rather suggested by some, that perhaps too much money was paid to Messrs. Lovell and Christmas.  I suppose Messrs. Lovell and Christmas and the other parties would probably say that they got too little.  It is difficult to judge.  It is a transaction that is past and finished, and I do not believe that any good results can be got from regretting what is past.  It may be too much or it may be too little.  I am not in a position to say whether it is or not.  As I say, it is past, and it is a good thing that steps are being taken so that we will be in a position to put such an important and fundamental industry on a sound basis.  It is within the knowledge of Deputies, even those who do not belong to creamery districts, that hardships will, to a certain extent, occur under this reorganisation. That is bound to take place, but it is no doubt for the benefit of the nation; and although a few redundant creameries or proprietary creameries may suffer or imagine they may suffer, it will benefit the whole nation at large and the producers will ultimately find that it will benefit them.  The whole object, not of this Bill, but of this particular scheme, is to ensure that the producer gets a reasonable price.</P>

      <P>The general agricultural producers when they market their produce have to take what they get. They are not in a position generally to bargain or insist upon a price.  Articles produced by mercantile industries have a standardised price.  The price is marked and nothing less is taken.  These commodities can be bought and sold by <Col N="219" /> telegram cheaply and efficiently.  Unfortunately we have not yet reached that stage in agriculture.  I believe this is one step towards that result, and I am glad an effort is being made to put the agricultural community into such a position.  Above all others it is the industry that we are peculiarly fitted for and for which the climate of the country is peculiarly fitted.  For the products of the industry we have an unlimited market.  For these reasons I welcome the Bill and the steps that have been taken, and will be taken in future, to put this industry on a sound basis. Without State control I believe that cannot be done.  I believe that State control is necessary, because if we cannot, by such an industrial effort as this, get at least 100 per cent. loyalty from the members of such societies, we will not be successful.  In marketing the great difficulty is supply.  Without some sort of compulsion for producers we cannot guarantee supply, and if we cannot keep up supply the consumer is going to go elsewhere and we will lose our market.  Most farmers will admit that during the war they benefited largely under the control system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig mentioned a point which I do not think comes under this Bill.  It might come under a Co-operative Bill, that is the question of supply and distance.  I believe that for efficient co-operation all the members of a co-operative society should have an equal chance, that for the men living a long distance away some arrangement should be made that would get the same price as those who live close up to a particular auxiliary or central creamery.  If the State insists upon controlling their supply, it is up to the State to give something else in return. I think that that is possible and that there should be no difficulty about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that certain uneasiness arises about is the question of butter fat content.  There are cow testing associations which test the milk and find the butter fat content, or declare it to a certain amount, and when the milk is delivered at the creamery it is found to be less than declared.  Some sort of arrangement might be come to under that heading.  I am sure the House is satisfied with this Bill, although it is <Col N="220" /> complicated and not easily understood by farmers or by many Deputies.  Most legal matters are not understood by us; that is rather unfortunate, but I suppose we will have to wait for another day until we get another language or simplify these legal terms.  We cannot help that at present, and we have to take what we get.  Otherwise the Bill is satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">

      <P>As coming from a constituency with which this Bill really deals&mdash;namely, Limerick&mdash;I wish to give a word of praise to the Minister and his Department for bringing it forward. It is a Bill that will do an immense amount of good to the farmers in Limerick.  The financial deal was was made last year, and when brought forward it got a good deal of criticism from the farmers, but now that the farmers have the creameries working and have seen its advantages they have changed their opinions and the scheme is appreciated.  We think it is sufficient to show that the farmers are going so far into the dairy business as to increase their dairy cows by, in some cases, 50 per cent.  That is sufficient praise and thanks to the Minister.  Deputy Derrig and Deputy Heffernan have spoken about the prices paid by the purchaser; that they were very high, and have compared the prices that they could have been got for in 1922.  But I do not think there is any comparison, when you compare the conditions prevailing in 1922 and those of last year, because at that time it was bankrupt stock that was taken over by the Condensed Milk Company.  There was great unrest in the country at the time, and of course the real value of the premises in building, etc., was very much below what they would be in normal times.  The farmers really had not the courage to take them over at the time, and I do think that the men who had the courage are entitled to be paid their compensation.  They did make a profit, no doubt.  I will give an instance of the profits that were made out of one proprietary creamery in comparison with a co-operative creamery close by.  The co-operative creamery paid one penny per gallon more than the proprietary and had a net profit of £850.  One penny per gallon all the <Col N="221" /> year round means for an average cow about 50s.  Taking a man with ten cows that meant £25, or £25 profit to the owner of the proprietary creamery.  If the farmer had that going into his own pocket what an advantage it would be. The co-operative creameries are only charging up to £3 per cow, extending over eight years.  That will mean 7s. 6d. a year, or approximately a farthing per gallon.  After that it is their own. Being in the centre of the area, we have taken three co-operative creameries in the poorest area in West Limerick and compared these with the adjoining proprietary creameries all over the adjoining county.  That means that that other country was taxed to the extent of £52,000 last year by supplying their milk to the proprietary creameries and not having co-operative creameries there; the adjoining counties are really jealous that they are not under the Act. There are some co-operative creameries in the adjoining county, but the number of shareholders or guarantors is very small.  We have some cases where four or five are guarantors in the bank for a sum of £4,000 or £5,000, and their position is very precarious.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Section 14 will deal with those proprietary creameries and that they will be closed down. The section is rather drastic, but at the same time it will bring so much relief to those people that they will not consider it so.  Section 14 deals with the prohibition, the licensing and maintenance of certain creameries.  Will the Minister say if I am right in my reading the section as such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The section is not aimed at proprietary creameries at all. It is aimed at certain developments that are taking place in Tipperary at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the creameries that Deputy Derrig spoke of and the three hundred and sixteen cows supplying 3,000 gallons of milk, that is simply impossible.  It would mean an average of ten gallons to the cow.  It might be that there would be only shares to the extent of 316 cows and that other suppliers would come from outside without having any shares&mdash; that is, that they would have the benefits of co-operation without responsibility. <Col N="222" /> Three hundred and sixteen cow shareholders would be responsible for a thousand £1 shares, and the other 700 cow shareholders would have the benefits without any of the disadvantages in case the creamery went bankrupt. There was another point that Deputy Ryan made as to the employees of the redundant creameries.  All these have not been dealt with satisfactorily. Many of these were not in a position to get into the other creameries, but get small compensation.  Many others are unemployed and have very little chance of employment.</P>
      <P>There is a section also dealing with audit.  I think that is a very important matter.  Generally speaking, the shareholders are not satisfied that the audit is as complete as it should be.  The auditor, they think, cannot go through the books of a creamery in four or five, or even ten, hours in an annual visit. I think it would be well to have a more detailed audit somewhat similar to that of the Government audit.  If they took the particulars of butter fats and the price got for butter in any month and took the prices got for milk and compared them, it would take some time longer, and it would be worth the cost. I am not suggesting there is anything dishonest; at the same time it would satisfy the suppliers and bring a good deal of confidence if the audit was more exhaustive.  In dealing with the audit it does seem strange that a very satisfactory balance-sheet sometimes is brought out at the end of the financial year, and then after three or four months you have the creamery society going bankrupt to the extent of four, five or six thousand pounds.  There is something wrong there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the accounts of some creameries are not audited as frequently as they should be.  I have received many anonymous letters&mdash; they show the mentality of the suppliers&mdash;giving the names of creameries whose accounts have not been audited.  Under the Friendly Societies Act I thought that the accounts of all creameries and societies should be audited at least once a year.  Such audit ought to be very detailed, and particulars should be given regarding the stock-in-trade and so forth.  I thank the Minister and his Department <Col N="223" /> for the detailed manner in which they have gone into this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>One phrase has been used here to which I take exception, namely, &ldquo;State control.&rdquo;  Some Deputies think that it has gone too far. We really never had State control in the accepted sense of the word, but we have had State help.  In some cases we have had compulsory State help, because it was absolutely necessary that it should be compulsory.  There has not been, as I say, State control.  So far as it has been carried out, I would be inclined to say that it should be carried a little bit further.  I take full responsibility for saying that, and I do so because of the experience I have in directing a co-operative concern.  The difficulties which you meet in respect of ordinary suppliers are things which you would not except to meet in a reasonably educated country.  I think the proper designation of it is &ldquo;State help,&rdquo; and in my opinion it has never gone beyond that.  We are not duller in this country than people elsewhere, but we are not more intelligent.  Other countries thought it essential to have State control, State help, and the only countries that have come to the top are those where the State interfered.  In this country, where the vast bulk of our agricultural community consists of small farmers, they do not get the same facilities as larger farmers in bigger countries.  Naturally our small farmer has not the same education.  It is not his fault, but it is his misfortune.  Here you are dealing with a large number of small farmers, and it is much easier to have effective co-operation among a smaller number of people than to have it among larger numbers who have not the same facilities.  I think that Deputy Matthew O'Reilly got very close to the question when he said that it was necessary that we should get a fair price.  It is necessary that we should get the best price at the lowest expense and that we should do away with all possible overhead charges and not have a millstone around the neck of an industry which cannot bear unnecessary burthens.  We are already reaping the benefit of what was done here when the previous Bill went through.  What do the market reports indicate now?  What did they indicate <Col N="224" /> a month ago or twelve months ago?  Anybody who reads them can understand the lesson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the English markets for butter.  A fortnight ago we were in excess of the Danish price.  Now with regard to creameries that are closed.  Creameries have been closed.  Deputy Derrig referred to a particular creamery which I know better than anyone here.  I come from very near that district, which is a little hamlet surrounded by hills.  It is in the slate quarry district between Kilkenny and Tipperary.  Naturally, they have a small supply of cows, as the land is not suitable and the district is far removed from other creameries. Deputy Derrig talks about 360-gallon cows and 2,000-gallon cows in the one district.  Anyone familiar with cow-testing knows that by multiplying by two the best yield of your cow you get a return in gallons.  If the Deputy said twelve hundred gallons he would be putting it at a conservative figure.  The reason of that is, in this case, bad location. The only way to deal with that difficulty is by organising motor lorry transport.  That difficulty can be dealt with.  I do not see that there is any hardship inflicted on that particular district more than any other.  I want to stress the fact that in a country like this, with a lot of small suppliers dependent altogether on managers, we ought to have a very efficient auditing system and a very efficient staff of auditors to deal with that particular class of work in all its bearings.  I am not going to make the charge that there is a lot of room for improvement.  It is essential, however, that the best system in that respect should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the Government valuer when assessing the value between the seller and the buyer puts on too high a price and that it would be advisable to review that price in this House.  I object to that.  I admit it is good politics, but it is very bad business.  It will read well in the papers, but it is bad business and I object to it.  One thing has been said here, with which I think all of us will agree, and that is the inconvenience <Col N="225" /> caused by the peculiar forms we have in regard to all legal documents, bills, assignments, wills and so forth. I am sorry that the Minister for Justice is not here.  I know that he belongs to one of the oldest and most conservative trade unions in the world.  One finds it very difficult to realise the necessity for such forms, but when you get the bill it begins to dawn on you that they are made cumbrous in order to justify the amount of the bill.  I wonder would the Minister for Justice, or whoever is in charge of our legal forms and formalities, ascertain what the legal forms in America are.  Indeed I think it is more necessary to get the legal forms of other countries than to get copies of the Constitutions of other countries.</P>

I do not think it is possible that the committees or a council of committees of co-operative societies could do the same good or do it in the same way as has been done through the assistance of the Department. In my opinion the Department which is responsible for that particular end of our national life is the only body to deal with it effectively. Other countries found that out. Although we have gone a long way to meet other countries in competition, we may except keener competition in the future.  They will not sit still.  They reached a point which we afterwards reached, and they seem to be sitting there, but they will advance from that point, and we too will have to advance from ours.  I think we can put absolute trust in the Department to carry on that side of the work.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to have an accurate or intimate knowledge of the subject matter of this Bill, but I have helped to do what I could to bring to the notice of people in areas where there are no creameries the advisability of establishing co-operative creameries.  In the course of discussion with various people on the matter, there was one <Col N="226" /> question which always cropped up. That is the question of control and the audit of accounts&mdash;the measure of control held by the Department or the I.A.O.S.  When I saw Section 15 in the Bill I looked upon it as an advantage, but a remark which the Minister made in replying to Deputy Dr. Ryan led me to believe that this Section 15 is not of general application.</P>

      <P>If it is of general application it meets the principal point that I would look for in a Bill of this kind, because I have received complaints from people, who had knowledge of the matter, to the effect that the system whereby the accounts of creameries are audited is not at all satisfactory, and that if a staff of auditors were appointed by the Department or the I.A.O.S., who would be responsible for auditing the accounts, it would be much better than the present system whereby the Creamery Societies appoint, sometimes, I am informed, on the recommedation of the manager, a private firm to audit the accounts.  If that is the system it is essentially bad, because private auditors will be competing for the business, and if they feel that the manager may have the power of recommending their appointments they are not going to be particularly hard on the manager when it comes to the question of auditing and they will be very careful in their criticisms. They will overlook things which an independent auditor, who does not depend upon the manager for his appointment, would not overlook. I would like to ask the Minister for an assurance on that point.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if it is proposed to take any steps towards federating creameries either <Col N="227" /> in a local federation or in a national federation.  I think it will be found that federation will be necessary.  The section that has struck me and that is most interesting to me is, Section 15 by which competition is prohibited. In my opinion that will inevitably lead to compulsion on the part of the State. I think that once you have changed the character of the industry in that way there is no longer any competition between co-operative creameries and instead of having the whole of the country linked up under one proprietorship, you have each individual creamery as a self-controlled unit, and you have a new problem altogether to face.  It was from the private enterprise of Cleeve and people like that that the manufacture of condensed milk started.  I think that the same remark applies to the manufacture of casein and other things.  At any time it may be desirable to have powdered milk for instance turned out here.  I wonder if it would be possible for an individual creamery to take the necessary steps to fulfil that requirement or would it not have to be done through a federation?  Similarly we might find ourselves in the position that the article required abroad&mdash; and, of course, all this Bill is, unfortunately, based almost entirely on the prospect of a foreign market&mdash;if at any time it may happen that the demand on the foreign market may be altogether different from the demand on the home market, in that case I think the people will not be content to see creameries producing entirely in response to the foreign demand. I observe the Minister is impatient to get on but I just wanted to ask him a few questions from that point of view.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should be pleased at the general tone of the discussion on the Bill.  This might have developed into a very acrimonious discussion, and I think it is satisfactory to the agricultural community generally to find that a better spirit has been, if I might say so, fertilised in the House in dealing with matters agricultural.  I do not propose to criticise the Bill in detail, except to <Col N="228" /> re-echo many of the minor details that I heard discussed by other members.  I do say that in taking this, what I might describe as the first step in the proper organisation or control of one of our most important industries, we must bear in mind that many other problems arising out of this dairying industry will have to be overcome before we can say that we have evolved a really perfect system of control, or fostering, if you like, and also a system of marketing. Deputy O'Reilly brought me back a few years when he spoke about the conditions of control in war times.  It reminded me of a little incident that occurred in my own career, when I had the privilege of being pelted with eggs which cost 5d. each.  I had that privilege on a certain occasion.  I do not think that any Deputy in this State will ever have to say or will ever have to complain again that he was pelted with eggs which cost 5d. each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am complaining that we are not able to sell them at 5d. at the moment.  Many questions have arisen in this debate, amongst them the question of control and the question of audit.  I think these are rather important. If any laxity has occurred in the work of the creameries in the past&mdash; and certainly some of them have not got on very well&mdash;I think it is entirely due to improper auditing of the accounts. That is a matter that should be attended to: it is most important to the industry.  It has been universally admitted in the House that State control is necessary.  It is necessary that the State should take a strong hand in fostering the industry and in marketing the produce.  No matter what measures are necessary, it is in the interests of the individual as well as the State that the best prices should be obtained for our produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude, without further criticising the measure, by saying that <Col N="229" /> it is a measure of such importance that I think the further stages of it should be left over until after the Summer Recess, so that each of the Parties and individuals in the House&mdash;unfortunately I belong to a Party where I can only read one sheet of paper at a time, and I cannot deal with all the Bill&mdash;would be able to consult those intimately connected with the industry and be guided as to what necessary amendments, if any, are required.  That is all I have to say on this matter.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that the discussion would have, more or less, followed the line of analysis given by the Minister last night.  It seems to me that the discussion has been more on the details of the Bill, minor matters, instead of on the big aspects of it, following the Minister's analysis.  I think he dealt fairly fully with two of the sub-divisions.  He says that this Bill is meant to meet three classes of cases: one the case where the disposals company had acquired as a going concern both the plant and the milk supply; two, where the milk supply was acquired, where certain creameries were closed down&mdash;redundant creameries&mdash;and the milk supply of these taken over; and three, a situation which I would like to have heard more about.  I think the Minister passed rather lightly over that, if he touched it at all.  That is the case where the milk supply was bought over and where some individuals whose supply had been given previously to one of the creameries closed down and bought over&mdash;where that is going to some other creamery, to somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The third case is where a creamery buys a milk supply and some of the suppliers, instead of supplying the creamery that bought the milk supply, supply milk to a neighbouring creamery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">

      <P>Section 2 provides that in a case where creamery &ldquo;A&rdquo; buys a milk supply from a redundant creamery which has been closed, and where the suppliers of that redundant creamery or some of them send their milk to creamery &ldquo;B.&rdquo; it is creamery &ldquo;B&rdquo; that will be held responsible.  That section deals with suppliers who, instead of sending milk to creamery &ldquo;A,&rdquo; send it to a creamery that has not bought it at all.  It is provided there that they shall pay a certain amount, and under paragraph (d) &ldquo;the said principal sum payable by such person to the company shall be calculated by the Department at the rate of one pound for every complete gallon of milk in the peak day quantity.&rdquo; That makes the arrangement that the creamery that gets the milk supply without agreement shall pay £1 per year for every complete gallon of milk. Section 5 provides that they shall issue three shares per cow.  The section relates to the issue of debt shares by societies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this Bill, I agree that it is complicated.  This Bill has been in preparation for four months, and if it has been altered once it has been altered half a dozen times. It was found extremely difficult to draft the Bill.  Undoubtedly it is difficult for the layman to read it, certainly without some explanation.  The question of whether it is possible to simplify drafting is one with which I would like to deal.  There is a famous case of attempting to simplify drafting, and that was the first Workmen's Compensation Act passed in England. That Act was passed while Mr. Chamberlain was Chancellor of the Exchequer. He had charge of that Act, and he announced before its passing&mdash;it was very revolutionary at the time&mdash; that he proposed to draft it himself. It was a most concise piece of English. He announced that he would draft it himself, and he had taken considerable care and he promised to draft it in such a simple way that any workman sitting by the fireside with his wife would know perfectly what every clause meant.  He did, in fact, draft it himself in non-legal and non-technical language.  As a piece of English, concise clear English, it is certainly regarded as a masterpiece.  But the results of the Act were that the English Law Courts were in arrears for at least three years after the Act was passed dealing with compensation cases.  The lawyers of England made a fortune out of it, and they held up the English Law Courts.  That is a very notorious example, and it is an example often quoted for the people who talk about simplification.  It is an Act which is interpreted by decided cases.  There is hardly a clause in the Act that is not now interpreted with reference to decided cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an example of the fact that you cannot get away from the parentheses and qualifications that are necessary when you are drafting an Act of Parliament.  An Act of Parliament is supposed to cover all possible future contingencies, and it is a strange thing that in fact it is the contingencies that one thinks will never arise <Col N="232" /> that do arise in practice.  It is impossible to simplify what is essentially complex; it simply cannot be done.  We believe ourselves, and it is generally believed amongst people who are very competent to judge, that we are particularly lucky in the drafting of our Acts of Parliament.  The drafting staff we have is extremely good.  There is a school of drafting.  The English Acts are not drafted quite on the same lines from the point of view of technical drafting, but it is considered here and in England, where there are really great equity lawyers and where there is a very big Chancery Bar, that the drafting here is really first-class.  I do not think it would be possible to simplify very much more than is done. The main thing in drafting a Bill is to see that it will not give rise to endless litigation afterwards in the course of its administration.  That is often more important, and Deputies will have to put it out of their heads that it is possible to draft a highly complicated Bill in simple language that will cover every possible contingency and be at the same time easily understood by everybody.  In other words, it is impossible to simplify the essentially complex.  I agree, therefore, that it is a very complicated Bill.</P>
    <P>There was another point raised here. It is the second important point.  It was a point raised in connection with the purchase of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland.  There is a difference of opinion about that purchase. Some venture the view that the creameries were bought too dear; others think that they were not too dear, and others say that, whether they were bought cheaply or dearly, they are likely to confer benefit on the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember this when they are speaking of the purchase of the Condensed Milk Company, that you cannot say that they were paid too much or that the premises were bought at too dear a cost, or that they could have been bought cheaper.  I believe they could have been bought cheaper if we were content to wait a year or two and if we were content to take the consequences of waiting for one or two years.  When the Condensed Milk Company was purchased it was highly capitalised, <Col N="233" /> and it was not making a profit. On the contrary, it was making a loss. It was in the middle of a big trade war with the co-operative societies of Limerick, Cork and Tipperary.  On the one hand you had the Condensed Milk Company, the biggest shareholders of which were Messrs. Lovell and Christmas.  On the other hand you had the majority of the co-operative societies of the counties of Limerick, Cork and Tipperary. These were bodies that had not anything like the same amount of money as Messrs. Lovell and Christmas, but they had very special advantages in view of the fact that the suppliers of the raw material were shareholders in the co-operative societies.  Consequently the position was that, while they had not the same advantages in money as the Condensed Milk Company had, they had other advantages which enabled them to carry on the compettion for two or three years with the Condensed Milk Company.</P>
    <P>If that competition had gone on it is hard to say what would be the outcome. You can only make a guess.  So far as that competition had advanced it had landed the co-operative societies in very great difficulties.  The competition had not bankrupted them, but it brought some of them into the position that they had no further credit; it brought others of them into the position that instead of being free of debt, they had mortgaged their securities, but still they could carry on.  On the other hand the Condensed Milk Company were making big losses, but they were putting up a first-class fight.  But in this company, with a capital of £300,000 to £400,000, the largest shareholders were Lovell and Christmas.  Messrs. Lovell and Christmas, I might mention, is a firm that has a turn-over of £23,000,000 to £24,000,000 per annum.  They are the biggest grocers in the world, and they control one-third of the grocery trade in England. The whole butter trade in Ireland could pass through their shops. They are the biggest buyers of New Zealand, Danish and Australian butter. They had a special interest in holding a certain amount of control over the butter-making business in this country, and while they were making a big loss, say, £100,000 a year, it was only a small thing to them.  They could afford to <Col N="234" /> take very long views, they could afford to wait and to finance the proposition themselves and afford to lose £200,000 on it until the co-operative societies would have stopped paying the money. They could have continued until the inevitable happened, until the co-operative societies in the district who would then have to go out of business, and then they would control the bigger butter supply from Ireland. During all that time I would be receiving deputations from the proprietary creameries and from the co-operative creameries looking for money and everyone would be asking, &ldquo;What will you do about it?&rdquo;  It is not a question perhaps so much of comparing the prices at which it was bought with what it might be bought at, but it is a question of the terrible waste that would have gone on in those two years and with the grave uncertainty of what would happen at the end of those two years.</P>
    <P>Remember it is not to our interests to buy any proprietary concern at too much of a loss to that concern.  The State can buy any proprietary concern at any price it likes; at any price that it puts into an Act of the Oireachtas. The price that the Dáil fixes for the compulsory acquisition of any concern is the price which the State must pay.  But the State has to take other things into account.  This is not a country of very great enterprise.  You have to encourage enterprise so that people who start proprietary enterprise in this country should not get the impression from the action of the State that they were not wanted, and that this was not a place in which to invest money.  Such enterprise should get encouragement, and if they were to be bought out they should get a fair price. It was not to our interests at all to put pressure on Lovell and Christmas because they are an English firm.  They are an English firm with tremendous influence in the English market, and while we do not go out of our way to cultivate English firms, and while we must have such organisation here that they must give competitive prices for what they buy from us, it is not at all to the interests of this country because a firm is an English firm to treat them unfairly.  They must be treated <Col N="235" /> in the same way as any other firm.</P>
    <P>Anyway it is a bed of roses, roses all the way up to the present, because nobody has paid anything yet except the State, and the first payment will not become due until next November.  I believe myself that the payment will be honoured.  Of course, it will be a question of whether we can get through such a transaction without some trouble.  Most of the societies will honour their obligations and make no attempt to get out of their obligations. Whether they will or not, it depends entirely on what the butter market will be like in 1929, 1930 and 1931.  This business is a bit of a gamble.  There is not a fortune in the dairying industry. But its success is essential to this country, because dairying means not only butter but pigs and calves.  We must help and foster the dairying industry. There is no fortune in it.  If the times are good all the creamery societies will pay up and look pleasant and they will not say what a fine transaction this was.  But if the times are not good they will not pay up so easily.  That is human nature.  If there is any encouragement to the odd creamery that wants to take advantage of these obligations and get out of them, they will do it.  The experience up to the present is that with one or two notable exceptions the creamery societies have not tried to blackmail.</P>
    <P>In answer to the question that I have been asked I will give some figures now.  When I come to the final balance sheet everyone will have a chance then.  It will be pointed out that this scheme costs so much in liquidation, that it costs so much to transfer, all sorts of losses will appear in the balance sheet and will be commented on in the Dáil in a sort of detached way without any reference to the general advantages of the purchase scheme, without any reference to the general conditions of this particular scheme.  The Deputies will have to remember that this is a commercial proposition. a very big commercial proposition done by a very big firm, namely the State.  When carrying out a very big transaction it is always a question of having to carry some big disadvantages and some big advantages and weighing up the situation <Col N="236" /> and pointing out which outweighs the other.  There are undoubtedly aspects of the purchase of the Lovell and Christmas transaction, that can easily be criticised.  Everybody could point out how the firm was losing £100,000 a year for three years previously and they could point to the fact that £365,000 was paid for it.  Everybody could draw the moral from that, and point out how foolish we were and how young we were and that it is a pity we did not know more about business. It is not easy to defend that sort of thing by pointing out the advantages generally to the farmers of the country from such a purchase.  By pointing out as I think Deputy Nolan and Deputy Gorey pointed out that, possibly a penny a gallon in any county would amount to about £40,000 a year. In Limerick it would amount to more, but in Kerry it would amount to about £40,000 a year.  Undoubtedly the closing of the creameries, the establishing of big solvent creameries which could afford to put in proper equipment and plant which could market their butter properly, and do other things well and the re-organisation generally all mean far more than a penny a gallon to the farmers in the country, and in fact the amount that the creameries of these districts, Cork, Tipperary and Limerick, saved as a result of that transaction would be round about one hundred thousand pounds which should be 33 per cent. say, on £350,000.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt myself that the transaction is a good one and that it will prove to be a good one.  I will give Deputies recent figures with regard to that transfer, but will only deal with the creameries.  In a case like this it would complicate matters to deal with the condensers and other assets.  The creameries cost £210,000, and we have already sold twenty-nine creameries, of which six would be centrals, for £44,165.  That is the full price, including the subsidy, wherever there was a subsidy in connection with the turning of a central into an auxiliary.  Actually 48 redundant creameries have been closed.  I say on an average&mdash;it is a conservative estimate, but it means a saving of £560 a year to a farmer, and for milk supplied will be £38,451. <Col N="237" /> Another creamery property amounts to about&mdash;I will not say what it is in order to leave a little doubt.  It is a small amount of money, and I do not want purchasers to be able to calculate it exactly.  There is more creamery property sold amounting to a few thousand pounds, but we have sold total property up to the present valued for £95,190. That total property consists of 48 redundant creameries and 29 creameries actually sold as going concerns.  We have on hands about five centrals and 30 auxiliaries, and they are easily the best creameries to-day.  They are New Market, Tipperary, Knocklong, Coachford, and Terelton.  There are no co-operative societies in those areas at all. They control the whole areas.  They are magnificent concerns.  They control a huge market supply.  They are the best of Lovell and Christmas's, and we have those on hands.  There are about five centrals and 30 auxiliaries, and they certainly are worth more than the balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will tell.  I hope it will.  The operative creameries sold are 29 and the redundants 48.  We hold 35.  That is a total of 112.  So far as creameries are concerned I have no doubt, provided something extraordinary does not happen in the future, such as a complete collapse in the price of butter, or something like that, that we will be better than I anticipated.  I have no doubt that we will be able to sell creameries at a figure which I indicate. All those sales took place voluntarily. I want Deputy Derrig and others to realise that.  They were all voluntary, and not carried out by the Dairies Disposals Boards to any extent. They are carried out in conjunction with it.  The people who sold them were the I.A.O.S.  The I.A.O.S. run the creameries of the country.  This is an agreement between the Dairy Disposals Board and the Society.  It is a voluntary thing which they signed and were advised to sign by their own organisation, <Col N="238" /> which acted as a go-between and carried out the transaction.  There was no compulsion as far as that was concerned.</P>
      <P>Condensers are a different problem. They have been all re-organised.  Four or five condensaries have been closed and four or five left open.  We are not in a position to hand them over.  They will require further re-organisation. There is not a terrible lot of money, I have come to the conclusion, in the condensers. There were big losses in condensing while the Condensed Milk Company held them.  We have re-organised them and made them four times, at least, as economic.  We have closed the uneconomic condensers and we have increased the turn-over.  But they are yet not in a position to be able to be handed over to the co-operative societies, and it would take a considerable time and perhaps some money to put them absolutely right and in a position to be handed over to the co-operative societies.  I do not want to go into that any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now to come back to the Bill.  I agree with the point of view of Deputy Heffernan, that the sooner these societies take charge themselves the better. Once we have this Bill and the Co-operative Bill through, the societies and the I.A.O.S. will have everything they want.  If it is considered desirable, for instance, to organise federations they should have all facilities for doing it; it should not be the business of the State, as it was not the business of the State to organise a federation for the sale of butter.  That has been organised by the creameries themselves, and it is going on very well, but it was not the State organised it; the State has nothing to do with it.  It is an organisation built up by the farmers themselves for the purpose of marketing their produce, and if afterwards for some other reason the societies decided to federate for the manufacture of condensed milk, casein, or milk powder or any other purposes, let them do so. They will have an Act of Parliament within which they can operate, so creameries will be in a position, but Deputies must remember there is a tremendous amount of federation already. Remember we have closed 48 creameries, and that there is a number of amalgamations.  The ordinary creamery <Col N="239" /> in Limerick is able to take a big quantity of milk, and is a federation of three or four others.  When this Co-operative Bill is passed it will contain a provision to the effect that every creamery must affiliate with the I.A.O.S.  That would be the beginning of federation, and further federations can follow that, but Deputies should not come to the conclusion on the face of it that the bigger a creamery grows the better it is.  That might be very dangerous, as such a creamery might become top-heavy.  There are certain creameries which are very big, and which may become bigger, but to merge them in others would be very wrong.  I say the Irish Associated Creameries is an example of successful federation. They are doing extremely well.  When I hear talk of the price of butter, I happened to get a Danish trade paper to-day.  It is called &ldquo;Smor-Tidende.&rdquo; It is a Danish paper.  It is printed in English and Danish, and I happen to read this, which is the first time it ever appeared in print.</P>
    <P>Weekly report, 29th June, 1928:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had a fairly good market for butter here this week, but in the absence of any further demand for storing purposes, the supplies were fully sufficient to meet all the orders, and prices ruled much the same as last week.  In Great Britain both Irish and New Zealand butter seem to command prices equal to those of Danish, or even higher, but there is a steady outlet for the Danish article in the Northern districts and in Scotland, where Colonial qualities are more or less neglected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hear so often that our butter and eggs are so good, and so on, and hear that contradicted, and I see quotations in the papers which do not often bear out some of the most extravagant demands made for our produce. Here is a Danish trade paper, and in it we see: &ldquo;In Great Britain both Irish and New Zealand butter seem to command prices equal to those of Danish or even higher.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Danes were told that three years ago they would not believe it. This is the first time that it has appeared in a Danish paper.  It is really <Col N="240" /> a very significant statement.  For twenty years we never touched the Danish butter.</P>

      <P>That is tall talk.  They could hold it for two months, and it would not make a huge difference to the market, but in fact they are not doing it, and it would be very foolish to do it.  They may hold it over for a day or so to get it in good condition. It shows how well they are doing, considering the disadvantage they are at by reason of the fact that there are certain creameries outside their organisation. There are certain creameries on the ditch who will not come in.  They say: &ldquo;We wish you well.  If you do well, we will come down on your side. If you do badly we will not.&rdquo;  It is a great pity.  I quite understand the point of view of the big creameries that have been doing extremely well.  They say: &ldquo;We are taking no risks; we are selling our butter very well.&rdquo;  On the other hand, it shows that there is very little class consciousness amongst a small section of the dairy farmers of the country.  It is not our business to intervene in the matter.  It certainly is hard if there is not to be some class consciousness amongst the dairy farmers of the country, and if they have not sufficient pluck to come into this thing and put their backs into it; anyway to make a real attempt to make it a success.  If they went into it and it did fail, while it would be most unsatisfactory there would be some results, but if by any chance it failed and there were good grounds for believing <Col N="241" /> that it was because a minority stayed out, then you would have got no conclusion of any kind.  Anyway, as it happens, the associated creameries are doing very well.  Unless the market is manipulated and if the weather is not against them. they ought to have an extremely good year.  It is an example of the federation that should take place, and should take place without the help of the State.  I was asked to help, but I simply refused.  I said this is not a matter for us; our business is to see that good butter is produced.  We consistently refused to do anything in the way of giving money.  We will help them every other way, by giving them information supplied by our own inspectors, and in the way of seeing that the butter produced in the creameries is good butter.  On their own they have done this and, apparently, they are making a big success of it. They represent about 80 per cent. of the creameries, and it is a pity that they are not getting the support of 100 per cent.  I believe they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the point about closing redundant creameries, the Department did not close them.  The creameries themselves closed redundant creameries.  As has been pointed out, this transaction has been really carried through by the I.A.O.S. in conjunction with the Dairy Disposals Board.  Where a creamery has been closed it has been closed after consultations with the organisation of the creamery itself and the I.A.O.S. Of course, there is bound to be dissatisfaction every time a creamery is closed amongst some section.  Men who are living within a mile of that creamery are dissatisfied if they have to go two miles to a new creamery. It would be quite impossible to have uniformity of prices in the sense that Deputy Ryan mentioned.  At the present moment everyone is paid the same price at the same creamery.  Deputy Ryan suggested that they should be all paid the same price, after deducting a certain amount for transport.  You rule your price, say, at 6½d. a gallon. If you decide to deduct a different amount for each district according to the transport, it would be a job for the Creamery Committee as to how they could do it.  I do not know how it could <Col N="242" /> be done.  If I send my milk from three miles away with a horse and cart to the creamery and another man sends his from four miles away with a horse and cart, how are you going to decide what is the extra cost?  In fact it is nothing very much.  I do not see how the Committee could do it.  You would not get uniformity.  In fact there is very little difference now between the prices at the creameries in Limerick. Tipperary, Cork and Waterford.  All creameries are standardised; they produce the same article and get the same price for it, and the overhead charges are about the same.  I do not anticipate that there is going to be any joint stock organisation.  Joint stock organisation was attempted often in various countries in connection with agriculture and it always failed.  There will never be one in this country.  Co-operative organisations are the ones for the farmers, and will go on increasing.  The co-operative society will always be controlled by a committee elected by each member.  It does not matter how many shares the member has.  The suppliers take shares according to the number of cows they have.</P>
    <P>The point about the audit is a very important one, but this Bill does not deal with it.  Up to this the position has been most unsatisfactory.  The Registrar of Friendly Societies has power to compel societies to make returns, but then, as Deputy O'Connell suggested, a creamery manager could get a friendly auditor to audit his accounts and present the balance-sheet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

      <P>That point has to be dealt with.  It is undoubtedly a fact that proper auditing is absolutely essential to the success of these societies.</P>

      <P>It is being prepared by the I.A.O.S., the Dairy Disposals Board and the societies, but there are various questions in connection with it on which they cannot make up their own minds. It would be impossible for me to get something drafted which is not in a concrete form&mdash;until the interests concerned tell me what they want.  When they put their proposals before me I will have to criticise them, agree with them, or disagree with them, but I cannot do anything until they have cleared their minds on every point as to what they want.  After that there will be the question of drafting, and then I come in.  Deputy de Valera asked what was the present position in regard to the existing proprietary creameries. We are trying to buy them.  The position is that if the existing proprietary creameries sell to the co-operative creameries, we will consider the question of financing that transaction, if we approve of the price.  I have told them that we are not buying, but that the I.A.O.S., which represents the creameries of the country, is buying, and that they have got to deal with it.  If they do succeed in selling, in coming to a conclusion, we have told them that the money will be all right, provided the Dáil agrees to it.  They have been in negotiation for the last six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These negotiations are extremely slow. One reason why the negotiations are taking so long is that they have enough in hands, in trying to liquidate the Lovell and Christmas transaction.  But we must make the attempt to buy.  It is in the national interest&mdash;I do not want to put it further than that&mdash;that the existing proprietary creameries in Kerry should be bought.  Farmers in Kerry who are supplying milk to these proprietary creameries are getting 1d. per gallon less for their milk than farmers in the County Limerick who reside near the North Kerry border. That is a state of affairs which must be ended.  With regard to cream content, that matter hardly arises.  An Order is being issued under which the cream has to be kept for a certain time so that it can be inspected and tested by the Department's inspector when he visits each creamery.  It would be quite impossible to arrange for a test of a <Col N="244" /> sample other than the sample that was taken for test by the creamery manager. Any other method of carrying out a test would simply lead nowhere. Suppose, for instance, you were to take a sample and that it worked out at 3.45, and that from another bucket of the same milk you took another sample and that it worked out at 3.6, what does it prove?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It might occur, but still I think it could hardly occur.  But how could you have an inspector of the Department there at the time to do that?  The milk goes into a tank in the creamery and a sample is taken there. If an inspector arrives at the moment when the milk is in the tank, and simultaneously takes a sample from it with the creamery manager he could take it away and test it.  We consider that the most satisfactory thing is to make the creamery manager hold the milk that he has taken for test to enable us to test the same sample again if we wish to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers do not understand the process of testing milk, and they always mistrust any process that they do not understand, and maybe they have a reason for it.  The real business of the Committee of the society will be to keep that right.  I would be anxious to get this Bill passed.  I realise it is a difficult Bill.  In any event I would be anxious to get the Second Reading to-day.  With regard to the point that was made by Deputy Ryan, I suggest that there is nothing in it.  If a man refuses to take shares, what happens is, you simply cut off his source of supply.  Take the case of a man with twelve cows.  If he does not take shares and you refuse to take his milk supply, well, all he can do is to spill it if he does not supply it to the creamery.  In that case the Department would not charge him.  We are arranging that we shall pay a pound per gallon for the peak day quantity. When you are making your calculations, if you are told that such a fellow rather than sell his milk to the creamery and take shares in the society prefers to feed his pigs with the milk, <Col N="245" /> well, you do not include him, and that is all that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You would, of course. With regard to Sections 13 and 14, Section 13 prohibits the establishment of unlicensed shops.  It prescribes the manner in which factories dealing in milk and in milk products shall be set up in the future.  Section 14 deals with the situation where attempts have been made to set up factories during the last six months in spite of the Department of Agriculture.  After we had purchased the Condensed Milk Company a certain firm that would not touch this country with a forty-foot pole came along and became extremely interested in milk and milk products. It wanted very badly to set up a factory in the Co. Tipperary to compete with the Condensed Milk Factory which we had bought.  Unfortunately it was helped by a certain co-operative society in the neighbourhood suffering from a grievance.  We have to stop that.  That is redundancy over again. There is only a limited milk supply there.  The Condensed Milk Factory is owned by the suppliers themselves, and is able to handle all the milk it can get.</P>
      <P>For some reason or other these philanthropic Germans came in&mdash;of course, I know the reason, but I do not want to state it&mdash;and professed to be deadly anxious to spend their own money in putting up a casein factory in a certain place in Tipperary.  I put it to them that they were going against national policy as outlined in the Dáil. They said nothing; they remained polite, but went ahead.  I have informed these people, and all whom it may concern, that I will try to get the permission of the Dáil to stop their activities, and if they are foolish enough to spend their money in this way, that is their own look-out.  I do not believe that it is philanthropy exactly that is behind it.  There was no great anxiety to come in and start factories in Tipperary until we bought the premises of the Condensed Milk Factory.</P>

Now there are all sorts of Continental people anxious to take a hand and help. I think there are a great many people in this country and in other countries who know that there is a very big and dangerous experiment from their point of view going on, and they are anxious to come and get certain blacklegs amongst the farmers themselves to help them and to smash this in the beginning. Section 14 is aimed very specifically at this, and if I get this Bill through the Dáil it is my intention to tell this particular firm that it is to build no further and that it is to leave the field to the Condensed Milk Factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is not the value of the milk at all.  First of all the farmers are coming into a creamery that has all the advantages of a big milk supply from another source, and that is what they are paying for.  If you organise a creamery it costs a certain amount to build it.  It generally costs £1 a gallon to get the plant and equipment to handle the milk, and the more milk you have the more equipment you want.  Three shares per cow will give it to you.  Additional equipment is necessary to handle milk in a big way and leave a decent profit.  They will have the advantage when they take out these shares that at the end of eight years they will own that creamery without owing one penny to a bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Flinn's amendment, I do not think it creates a contingent liability, except with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and the Executive Council.  The Minister for Finance has complete discretion in the matter. The exact terms of the amendment are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before sub-section (4) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited shall until it shall be otherwise enacted offer to the Minister for Finance for re-insurance such proportion of each risk accepted by the company as the Minister for Finance shall determine: provided always that the Minister shall have power to accept or refuse all or any part of any such risk.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not create a contingent liability on the part of the Minister for Finance.  It creates an obligation on the company to offer to the Minister for Finance for re-insurance a certain proportion of the risk it accepts.  There is nothing in the amendment which could compel the Minister if the company made such an offer to him to <Col N="248" /> accept any portion of it.  It does compel the company to make the offer, but it does not create any contingency that the Minister would have to accept such an offer under any circumstances.  The amendment was drawn up to enable this particular principle to be discussed, and therefore the ruling you have given was borne in mind.  If you read the amendment I think it is quite clear it imposes an obligation on the company to make an offer, but it certainly does not create any contingency in which the Minister would be compelled to accept the re-insurance offered to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is it enables the Minister to accept the risk. Generally votes that are passed in the Dáil only enable a Minister to spend. This amendment authorises the Minister to take a risk which involves expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment does not authorise the Minister to do anything.  To make the amendment fully operative the Government will have to accept the principle, and introduce a Bill empowering the Minister for Finance to accept these risks. There is a difference there.  There are two different points to be considered. As I have said, the amendment would make it obligatory on the company if the Minister so required to offer to the Minister a certain proportion of each risk for re-insurance.  I believe there is a power the Minister would have to get by a separate Bill from this House to enable him first of all to acquire any portion of such risk and to accept it if offered.  The two things may be complementary to each other but they are separate proposals.  If the Minister were to introduce a Bill to enable him to give effect to the principle of State re-insurance which we have introduced here I feel at the same time he would have to introduce an amending Bill to this Act.  In anticipation that the Minister will accept the principle of State re-insurance we propose to take time by the forelock and amend this Bill, but that does not create a contingent liability on the <Col N="249" /> Minister.  That will be created when the Minister having accepted the principle will introduce a Bill to set up State re-insurance here.  The company in accordance with the terms of this amendment will offer some portion of each risk it accepts for re-insurance, and it will enable him to accept that risk when offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit also that it affects a very particular principle in connection with this Bill in that, as has been explained, neither the Department of Local Government nor any other section of the Government take any responsibility for this company, and the introduction of the principal Bill was simply brought about in order to give the General Council of County Councils who unanimously desired it an opening to start a company on these particular lines.  The purpose of this Bill is to hold a position that was thoroughly appreciated and sympathetically dealt <Col N="250" /> with at that particular time, to hold a position that has arisen as a result of a flaw in the original Act, to back this particular company with the possibility of re-insurance and through the Ministry of Finance to impose a certain amount of State guarantee to this company, and put the Government in a position with regard to this particular company that it never decided originally to take, and to go into a position that it has with no other company in the country.  I suggest that it is undesirable in principle and against the principle embodied in the Bill to attempt to stretch the principal Act by amendment beyond what we originally intended. If the question of re-insurance through the State has to be considered at all, let it be considered as a separate matter. To consider it simply in connection with amending legislation to this particularly restricted principal Act I think would be undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that I would like to say this, that as a matter of fact the present proposals of the Minister do not hold the company in its former position, owing to circumstances over which the company has no control.  I think, owing to the drafting of the original Act, to the legislation which subsequently took place, and to the criticism which took place in regard to this particular measure in this House, that the company has been very seriously damaged, and it was with a view to re-creating a feeling of confidence in the proposal which I think the original Bill contemplated that we introduced this amendment, because, though this is a new principle, if you like&mdash;I would not like to admit that it is a new principle&mdash;it is certainly an attempt to meet the criticism which was passed on the principle contained in the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act, the principle that certain public bodies which were not, in fact, mutual could enjoy the benefits of mutual insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amending Bill to the principal Act, which is the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act, 1926.  Neither in the principal Act nor in the amending Bill that is now before us on the Committee <Col N="251" /> Stage is there embodied the principle of State re-insurance, or the acceptance by the State of any re-insurance risks in any shape or form.  This is a new principle which cannot be introduced on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  On the Second Stage of the Bill, in reply to questions, the Chair made a statement that covered the whole case. That is one reason, and I think sufficient reason, for ruling the amendment out of order.  The amendment is also out of order on the ground that, in so far as it leaves the Minister any power at all, that power cannot be exercised without creating a liability on State funds.  Amendment 2 introduces another new principle, that is that local bodies would be compelled to insure with this company, and that all contracts with other companies would after a certain date have no validity in law.  That, too, is a very important principle, and one which could not be inserted on the Committee' Stage of the Bill.  The whole question at issue is that you cannot insert a new principle in Committee on a Bill.  The meaning of the amendment is quite clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The amendment is to insert two new sub-sections.  The first sub-section would compel local authorities to insure their property with one company. That introduces an element of compulsion that does not exist in the principal Act or in the amending Bill.  The second proposal is a sub-section which would compel local authorities to levy a rate of 1d. in the £ for a particular purpose, in other words introducing into this Bill, which now places no obligation of any kind on local bodies, an obligation to levy a rate of 1d. in the £.  I think that this Bill could not be used at all for the purpose of compelling local bodies to levy a rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 2 perhaps a word might be said, as we are dealing with the company here.  I think Deputy MacEntee's suggestion <Col N="252" /> was that something like Deputy Flinn's amendment was necessary in order to improve the position of the company from the point of view of confidence and security.  Certain points with regard to the security were raised on the Second Reading, and I said I would look into that matter.  Again, the Minister for Local Government stands in relation to this company in no way differently from the way he stands in relation to any other insurance company. There is no responsibility on the local bodies to insure through this company. But the company was formed for the reason that it was perfectly clear that a good deal of money was being unnecessarily paid away in premiums. For instance, in returns furnished by 199 out of 326 local bodies it was shown that, during a period of eleven years, the eleven years prior to the setting up of this company, these 199 local bodies had expended £78,848 in premiums, and had recovered only £5,796; in other words, that their fire loss on the premiums paid was only 7.3.  The fire loss ratio during a period of nine years on the insurance of county council property in England and Wales was 11.9.  For twenty years with these local bodies that were members of the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company the fire loss ratio was 16.7 whereas the general fire loss ratio of companies doing fire business in England, as published in 1927, was 55 per cent.  So that as between paying a fair premium and paying the type of premium that local bodies were paying before, there is a very big margin for saving, even while doing almost complete re-insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thrift raised the question as to what would happen if there was a £60,000 loss, and if the company was not fully re-insured.  During the last thirty years there has not been a fire loss to a local body in this country to the extent of half the amount that Deputy Thrift mentioned.  The normal fire loss ratio is very small.  There is no moral risk with regard to the kind of property that is insured, that is, nobody is likely to come along and put a match to his own property.  The fire loss ratio during the nine months for which the company has issued its report was only 4.29, as against a normal <Col N="253" /> people that the matter has been examined carefully at headquarters, loss in England during 1927 of 55 per cent. of the net premium.  Therefore the company, so far as we know anything about it, is dealing with a very low rate of loss.  We are informed that it is re-insuring in the most conservative possible fashion.  The directors are shown in the last annual report. The Chairman is Senator Kenny, the Vice-Chairman, Count O'Byrne, of the Tipperary County Council; the Chairman of the Dublin County Council is on it, as well as a number of other prominent persons in local government.  It is on their capacity to direct the company along satisfactory and sound lines that the local bodies who insure with the company must depend, and there is not, to my mind, any grounds&mdash; good, bad or indifferent&mdash;for suggesting that the security of this company is not perfectly satisfactory for the people who insure in it.  That is as it affects my outlook on the matter with regard to the security.</P>

      <P>I might say that on this side of the House we are not by any means satisfied with this Bill&mdash;at least, perhaps, if I said we were not happy about it, that would express our views very much better than to say we are not satisfied.  In other words, we are in the position that we have doubts on various points, and the Minister has not satisfied me, at all events, with regard to some of them.  I am afraid that there are other Deputies in our Party in the same position.  Our attitude is this: we realise that to refuse to pass a Bill to deal with the particular situation that has arisen might mean, possibly, the breaking up of this <Col N="254" /> examined by experts, that it has been found to be good and is a recommen-company. We do not desire that by any means.  We want to see it work and to follow the start that has been made.  We are anxious that this principle of combined insurance, leading ultimately, we hope, to mutual insurance, will get every opportunity of proving itself satisfactory, but our feeling is that the way in which it is tackled in this Bill is not the right way. We feel that the particular difficulty which has to be met could be met in another manner.  For example, on the Second Reading we indicated that one of the things that might be done would be to exclude them from the necessity of lodging the £20,000, if that was the crux of the situation.  Another suggestion that occurred, and to me it seemed all right&mdash;though I believe there are difficulties which I did not foresee at the time&mdash;was a change of the name, so that there would be no suggestion of mutuality as it is generally understood. Since we were discussing the matter before another point has cropped up, namely, whether deeming it to be mutual, might not make for complications in case of re-insurance, and whether it might not be held by some re-insuring company that, as a matter of fact, as mutuality is deemed to exist here, as a result of that, local bodies are, in fact, liable for any losses that might be incurred.  I will admit that it is largely a technical and a legal matter and the Minister ought to be in a much better position than we, who are outside, can possibly be, to satisfy himself both on the legal implications and the question of general security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot wash his hands out of this by saying, &ldquo;The State has no responsibility.  We are only passing an Act to enable the Company to be formed; we are giving it no State guarantee, no State backing or assurance, and this is simply the same as any ordinary company would be.&rdquo;  I hold when you pass an Act for a special purpose of enabling a company to be set up there is an implication, a suggestion, that those who went to the trouble of bringing in an Act to enable a company to be formed did examine the project, and that there is a certain guarantee given to the local <Col N="255" /> dation to the local bodies to insure with it.  I think the Minister will admit that.  You can go further.  A decision against that company has been registered in the Courts.  Now you go to the point of saying: &ldquo;We are going to mend our hand, and we are going to defeat that decision.&rdquo;  Remember, I am not saying that that should not be done.  I am simply trying to make the case that the Ministry in bringing in the original Act, and now in bringing in this particular Bill, are in fact giving a certain guarantee to the local bodies that everything is right and well with this company, that it is a thing that ought to be supported, just, for example, as in the case of the Creamery Bill.  In the case of the Creamery Bill, and other Bills of that kind, we are helping another organisation.  It is public policy and there is that idea behind it.  When this Bill is passed local bodies will certainly get this impression, that it embodies a certain public policy, that it has been examined carefully by the people in charge, and is a guarantee to the people that everything is right.  As I say, we are not in a position to know whether everything is right, both from the point of view of safeguarding the public bodies that wish to insure, and from the point of view of seeing that this particular way of getting out of the immediate difficulty that has arisen will not lead to further complications. If we could be satisfied on these two points we would be satisfied with this as a temporary measure, but we would like to see the Department going much further afield than they propose either in the original Act or in this Bill.  We believe that the whole question of mutual insurance and the insurance of public bodies ought to be considered from the point of view of public policy, and that some such scheme of mutuality, as was indicated, with regard to the possibilities of re-insurance by the State ought to be considered. I know that that is outside the scope of this Bill, but I am mentioning it to show that we are not against the principle, even though the statement has been made that we are <Col N="256" /> very doubtful about this Bill in connection with the principal Act, and also in connection with the question as to what extent the local bodies are protected.  As I say, I believe that you cannot wash your hands out of it and say: &ldquo;We have no responsibility.&rdquo; I think this Bill will be taken as an assumption and a guarantee of some sort on our part that everything has been thoroughly examined and that everything is all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that one way out of the difficulty referred to by Deputy de Valera would be if the Minister would consider whether he could not put in an amendment under which he would take the right of auditing the accounts of the Irish Mutual Bodies Insurance Company annually and the right to examine re-insurance agreements. I am quite sure that many local authorities will get the impression that when a company is specially mentioned in an Act of Parliament, and when it has been discussed for several days here, that that company has a sort of hall-mark or guarantee about it.  It will be a pity if that impression goes out, and at the same time if it is not the intention of the Government to accept all responsibility for the company. It would be quite easy for the Minister to undertake to have one of his auditors examine the books and to examine the re-insurances each year.  It would be a comparatively simple matter and, I believe, that it would at all events save the face of the Dáil in regard to this question.  It is a bit surprising indeed that the Government did not take the opportunity afforded by this Bill to explain if they have a policy in connection with insurance or not.  They ought to be familiar enough now with the cry that too much money is leaving the country.  In this case the money is being paid into the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Assurance Company and practically all of it, I think, is leaving the country, as it will have to be paid out in re-insurances to companies outside the country&mdash;eventually anyhow.  In any case, even if it were not, there is still with the public bodies a larger volume of insurance than is going to be done by this company. There is employers' liability, fidelity <Col N="257" /> guarantee and a whole lot of other things.  It is rather strange that the Minister for Local Government has nothing to say as to future policy in regard to these questions.  It would be a very simple matter&mdash;at least to us it looks simple&mdash;and it would be extremely beneficial to the country, if the State were to arrange to accept re-insurances of any company formed for local bodies insurance or, alternatively, if the Councils were asked to contract&mdash;I know that this is practically repeating some of the remarks that were made on the Second Reading, but, as our amendments have been ruled out of order, I suppose the Ceann Comhairle will not be too severe.  I think the principle of real mutuality, by which local bodies would agree to be responsible through the rates for losses accruing in the matter of fire, or other disasters, could very well be considered by the Department of Local Government, and that they really should have some policy to announce in connection with it.</P>

      <P>This is Section 2 of the Bill, and, as I indicated on Second Reading pretty clearly, the time for raising questions wider than the Bill itself was on Second Reading. I said that if the Bill is narrow then the questions which will arise under it must also be necessarily narrow and the scope for amending it will be as narrow as the scope of the Bill itself.  If the House wants a discussion, as it appears to want, on the general question of insurance an opportunity can be found for that discussion presumably, but on the Committee Stage there cannot be a discussion on the general question of insurance, and still less on the Fourth and Fifth Stages.</P>

      <P>The question of security and other questions relating to the company, I think, can be discussed on Section 2.  The question of mutuality can be discussed on Section 3.  If we took them all on Section 2 perhaps it would be better.  The principal points that Deputy de Valera has in mind are: (1) he objects to the retention of the word &ldquo;mutual&rdquo;; (2) that the Government definitely does not take any responsibility, good, bad <Col N="258" /> or indifferent, for the company; (3) that the scheme is not satisfactory, as it is not wide enough.  On the question of Government liability for the company, the local bodies who insure with the company must do so with their eyes quite open to the fact that the Government accepts no liability or responsibility for the company; that the people who accept responsibility for forming this company, for looking for facilities to form it, and for conducting the company afterwards, are the General Council of County Councils. It must not be taken that the company is to be looked askance at because the Government does not take any responsibility for it.  That would be unfair to the company and to the important work that the General Council of County Councils has undertaken in this matter at a time when the Government are not prepared to go any further than to give local bodies, through the medium of the General Council of County Councils, the facilities that the local bodies desired.</P>

      <P>On a point of order: does the General Council of County Councils come into this matter as an organic body at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The General Council of County Councils came into this matter by a unanimous request that they should get facilities for the formation of this company.  The people who run the company are the local authorities, who actually come into the company, insuring their property through it, and becoming members of it.  That point, perhaps, requires to be made clearer, as a misunderstanding might have arisen from what I said.  Under a scheme, the initiation of which was fully approved by the General Council of County Councils, a large number of local bodies have taken this up, and their representatives, including the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils and, I think, the Vice-Chairman&mdash;I do not know if Count O'Byrne is the Vice-Chairman of the Council, but, at any rate, he is Vice-Chairman of the company&mdash;are the people who run it.  It is on their ability, integrity and capacity to do this work that the local bodies <Col N="259" /> who insure with the company must rely for the proper conduct of their business.  My own personal opinion is that the local bodies can rely on them with perfect confidence.</P>
      <P>On the question of a more elaborate scheme, I as Minister am not prepared to recommend a more elaborate scheme at present for the insurance of the property of local bodies.  I do not rule out any consideration of the matter.  As a matter of fact, in so far as the present arrangements might be desirably extended, I would be very glad to cooperate in any way with the General Council of County Councils in making their position in this company a more widespread and more satisfactory position, because it would certainly be a great saving all round if all the local bodies were in this.  It would be a great saving if we could make it compulsory for all the local bodies to go into this.  I am not prepared at present to propose that as a policy.  It is a matter that would require consideration, and I do not see any reason why the amending of the original Act should rush me or any of my colleagues interested in the matter into making a different scheme.  As I say, it would undoubtedly reduce the premium which local bodies have to pay if they were all in this.  It would reduce the amount of the premiums if there were not the competition that at present&mdash;because they are free in the matter&mdash;this particular company has to go through in competing with other companies, whether native or otherwise.  At any rate, the position is that I am not prepared to recommend a wider scheme at present.  I simply want to attain the situation which we thought we had attained for this company by the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>On the question of mutuality, it is quite clear that the term &ldquo;mutual assurance&rdquo; is applied in the British legislation that we inherited to a much wider class of insurance than pure reciprocal insurance.  If this particular company was being set up in pre-Treaty times I am perfectly satisfied that it would have been set up in the same way in which the Municipal Mutual Assurance Company has been set up in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>It was set up before the Act of 1909.  It was set up before the Act of 1906&mdash;the Marine Act &mdash;but if you take the Acts subsequent to the Act of 1906 you must realise that the term &ldquo;mutual insurance&rdquo; is used for covering people who do not accept inter se liability.  The particular case quoted by ex-Deputy Magennis was mentioned here as a precedent that made the local bodies that are members of this company liable inter se for any losses.  That is not a fact, because what was established in the particular case referred to by him was the principle that what gave liability to the people involved in any company were the contracts that they entered into with one another through the medium of their Memorandum of Agreement.  The company dealt with in that particular case had inserted in their Memorandum of Agreement that they accepted inter se liabilities.  It is quite clear that the only liability that the local bodies who were members of this company accept is the ten pounds liability in case of the winding-up of the company.  Every section of the 1909 Act shows that by relieving them of the necessity for depositing £20,000 under certain circumstances, these particular types of companies did not accept inter se liabilities; that they simply joined themselves together by association for the purpose of mutual insurance in respect of certain matters.  There was no suggestion that there was anything like inter se responsibility involved in the term &ldquo;mutual insurance.&rdquo;  What we are doing here in respect of this company or any company formed under the Principal Act is that we are giving &ldquo;mutual insurance&rdquo; a definition which the British Board of Trade has consistently given to it in dealing with companies of this particular kind; the interpretation which it has given in dealing with the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company.  There is nothing at all in the suggestion that by actually defining and interpreting &ldquo;mutual insurance&rdquo; in a particular way in this <Col N="261" /> Bill, and for the purpose of the Principal Act, any complications are being created in any way as between the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances, Limited, and anybody they may reinsure with.</P>
      <P>They enter into definite treaties with the re-insurance companies and these treaties are such that in the present circumstances if the company was going out of existence on the point of illegality there is not a single one of these re-insurance treaties but would be repudiated by the companies with which the present company is re-insured. There is nothing at all in that. It is simply a bogy raised and you can raise a lot of bogies in this matter.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question? The Minister made a definite statement previously: that there was no foundation for the suggestion that the members of this mutual body were liable beyond £10.  I have Judge Davitt's decision before me, and it would contradict that.  I should like to read an extract from it.  Judge Davitt said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The defendant company is a body corporate, being a company registered under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1917, upon the 26th September, 1926.  It is not a trade union or a Friendly Society and could not be registered under the statute relating to such bodies.  It is a company limited by guarantee, the amount which each member of the company undertakes to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up being such amount as may be required not exceeding £10,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and he goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A member of such an association is liable to the full extent of his property for contribution towards the losses which other members may incur by reason of loss of ships insured in the said mutual association, and that liability has no reference to has guarantee at all.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The judge in that decision there intimated that £10 was specifically stated for winding up, and in quoting this decision he quoted another in a similar case where men had got together for the purpose of insuring ships.  In that particular case one ship was lost, and the members under such a clause as this were all liable up to the whole extent of their assets.</P>

It should not be mandatory on the local authorities to give their insurance to any society.

      <P>What is involved in this particular matter?  We have to secure the company in regard to its articles of association framed on the original Bill, which apparently had a flaw in it.  We had to secure it in regard to its operations both prior to and since the judgment.  That is Section 2. Section 3 makes a definition of mutual insurance, bringing it into harmony with the particular analogous body that is doing the same class of work in Great Britain.  We are told, from the point of view of the company and the local bodies which are interested, that there is a virtue contained in the term &ldquo;mutual insurance,&rdquo; and that they are loath to do without the use of it.  We think that they are entitled to such help as they can get in that matter, particularly when the definition put in here is <Col N="265" /> the definition on which the Board of Trade in England have been acting for quite a number of years.  Section 4 refers to Section 4 in the Principal Act where the deposit need not be made if the Minister for Industry and Commerce was satisfied that it was a body that came under the Act.  As the courts have ruled that they are the arbiters in the matter, whatever the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done, there is no necessity to have the Minister brought into the picture at all, and Section 4 is put in to take him out.

      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall not apply where the company is an association of employers which satisfies the Board of Trade that it is carrying on, or about to carry on, business wholly or mainly for the purposes of the mutual insurance of its members against liability to pay compensation for damages to workmen employed by them either alone or in conjunction with insurance against any other risks incident to their trade or industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was because the Municipal Mutual Insurance Limited were able to persuade the Board of Trade that they were such a body that in 1918 they were exempted from the position of <Col N="266" /> putting down a deposit of £20,000 while they undertook insurance of that particular kind, and they are not liable inter se for risks and they have not to deposit £20,000.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Deputy if he can give me an interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;mutual insurance&rdquo; in the section?  &ldquo;This Act shall not apply where the company is an association of employers which satisfies the Board of Trade that it is carrying on, or is about to carry on, business wholly or mainly for the purposes of the mutual insurance of its members against liability to pay compensation or damages to workmen employed by them either alone or in conjunction with insurance against any other risks incident to their trade or industry.&rdquo;  The same clause is put in in regard to fire insurance in this particular Act.  The practical application by the British Board of Trade of that term, &ldquo;mutual insurance,&rdquo; is what we are getting put in here as a statement in law to help to settle our position here, because, for some reason or another, a different interpretation based on the Act of 1906 has been given by our courts to the words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the section is that it does imply inter <Col N="267" /> se liability.  I would be glad if the Minister would quote some case as an example of the practice that obtains in Britain.  The only case he quoted was that of the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company of England which was established in 1906, three years before there was a legal definition of the word &ldquo;mutual.&rdquo;  The law, not being retrospective, did not hit municipal bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were going to hit that company it did not hit them in respect of fire insurance, because they were established prior to the Act, but when they came in 1918 to deal with employers' liability, then if this term &ldquo;mutual insurance&rdquo; did not mean the type of insurance that that body was carrying on, it would have hit them in respect of employers' liability, but it did not by a decision of the Board of Trade.</P>

      <P>Though the Minister has satisfied me on some points I am still rather doubtful on others.  It is, however, the Minister's responsibility for getting definite legal advice. We have not got that advice here and we have not had an opportunity of looking up cases, but we do not want to inflict any hardship that would follow by rejecting this Bill.  Therefore, be it on his head, and on the advice he has got here.  That is our attitude in respect to the Bill.  We have not had an opportunity of completely examining this Bill in regard to all its implications or the legal implications which there might be, but we are of opinion that it is an unnecessarily long way of doing a comparatively simple thing.  However, if the Minister has satisfied himself, through his legal advice, we are not going to oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  As Deputies will see, it is a very short Bill.  Its purpose is to extend the life of the Betting Act, 1926, from the 1st November next until the 30th June next year.  The Betting Act, 1926, was passed in consequence of the decision to impose the existing tax on betting.  The Act provided for the registration of bookmakers and for the registration of bookmakers' premises, and other various incidental matters in connection with those two things.  It provided also for the prohibition of betting with persons outside Saorstát Eireann and for power to set up totalisators, a power which has not yet been acted upon.  The principal <Col N="269" /> change it made was that it legalised ready-money betting.  The other matters were much smaller.  I need hardly at this stage go into the reasons why it was decided to make this change in the law.  As the Bill passed through the Dáil it was intended to be a permanent Act, but in the course of the discussion in the Seanad I agreed that it was better to pass it first as a temporary Act in order that we might get some experience of its working, and an amendment was passed with my assent in the Seanad, and agreed to later by the Dáil, limiting the life of the Act to two years.  A good deal of experience has been gained during those two years, and it seems to me that it will be necessary, before this Act is made permanent or continued for any great length of time, to make certain changes. Complaints have arisen, and in certain cases they have been justified, with regard to the manner in which betting establishments have been carried on. Complaints have also been made that in many cases the number of establishments which have come into being is too great.</P>
      <P>Other points of a like character have arisen which will require the joint consideration, not only of the Revenue Commissioners and of my own Department, but also of the Department of Justice.  It has not been possible for the people who are concerned in the two Departments to complete their examination, and, before an amending Bill is brought before the Dáil, it is felt that the best course is to extend the existing Act for a relatively short period&mdash;that is, until the 30th day of June next.  If we were simply to allow the Act to lapse on the 1st November, a great deal of confusion would ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, you would have certain bookmakers, who carried on a credit business, liable to tax, and you would have bookmakers who carried on a cash business no longer entitled to carry on that legally.  In consequence you would have undoubtedly a resurrection of the illegal betting shop, and an additional incentive for the setting up of the legal betting shop, because the legal men, whether on or off racecourses, would be subject to tax, while the people carrying on illegally would <Col N="270" /> be subject to no tax.  Other elements of confusion would arise, and it seems to me that whatever it may be decided ultimately to do with reference to the regulation of betting and betting establishments and of bookmakers, it would not be a practical thing to allow the Betting Act of 1926 simply to lapse on the 1st November.  I am satisfied, and I have had consultation with the Department of Justice, that it will be possible to frame proposals for the amendment of the Principal Act in time to have them to put before the Dáil early in spring, and have sufficient time to have the matter considered before the Act as extended would lapse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We had given a certain amount of consideration to this Bill before we heard what the Minister had to say about it and we were determined to oppose the Bill unless we got an assurance from the Minister that a committee would be set up, a Select Committee, to examine the whole question of the working of the Act.  We realise that a permanent Act is likely to be produced fairly soon and we think that it would be very much better if members of the House had an opportunity of getting representation on a committee which would examine into the working of the Act.  The Minister has indicated that he is aware of complaints that have been made with respect to the present position of betting. I am sure every member of the House has heard of these complaints also. They are, that abuses have cropped up and evils have arisen which every one of us ought to be anxious to prevent as far as possible.  The main heads of the abuses are, first of all, that there are too many betting shops&mdash;leaving out the general question of betting&mdash;and there are big questions involved in it, &mdash;I am simply confining myself to the abuses&mdash;that it is too easy to get a betting licence, that the shops are crowded and that they are turned into miniature racecourses as far as the excitement of betting is concerned and that children are not excluded.  These are points which indicate that an examination is necessary.  Before we on this side of the House are prepared to agree to the extension of this Act for another year we want to have a definite promise <Col N="271" /> from the Minister, not merely that he will introduce later some proposals of his own, but that he will set up a Select Committee consisting of members from different parts of the House to examine into this whole question which is certainly one that requires examination. I hope that the Minister will be able to give an assurance of that sort and that we will not be compelled to vote against the extension of this Act for a period. We realise that as the Act is terminating within a short time, as its period of operation is terminating within a very short space, that it is necessary to take action of some kind, and we are prepared to let the thing stand for the period the Minister mentioned provided we are satisfied that when that period is ended all Parties, our own Party included, will have an opportunity of thoroughly investigating the whole problem and the evils attendant on it.</P>

      <P>I think there is a great deal in connection with what Deputy de Valera has said.  I know endless misery has been caused by the opening of these betting shops all over the city.  I believe the same applies to the country and I only hope that the Minister will consider the advisability of doing what Deputy de Valera has said; that is, appointing a committee of the House to consider the whole matter. There is nothing contentious in this. We all want to do the best we can for the country and there is nothing contentious about the matter.</P>

      <P>I was about to say, when Deputy Murphy rose, that on the main points to which Deputy de Valera has replied I had already come to the conclusion that changes were necessary. I had come to the conclusion that we would have to take effective measures to prevent crowds gathering, and that children should not be allowed in, as at present, and that the number of houses in certain areas, at any rate, would have to be restricted.  With reference to the point the Deputy made about a Select Committee, before Deputy Murphy spoke I was about to say that I do not want to treat this matter as a political matter in any way and if there was anything like a general desire amongst other Parties in the House to <Col N="272" /> have a committee set up, I would certainly be agreeable.  I take it from what Deputy Murphy has said that there are other people anxious for the same thing, and I agree to move for the setting up of a Select Committee when the Dáil reassembles in the autumn.</P>

      <P>(1)  This section shall apply to any person who before the establishment of the Board satisfies the Minister or after the establishment of the Board satisfies the Board that he fulfils the following conditions, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that he was a citizen of Saorstát Eireann on the 1st day of January, 1928; and</P>
      <P>(b)  that he was on the 31st day of December, 1921, not less than twenty-one years of age; and</P>
      <P>(c)  that his principal means of livelihood during the whole period of seven years immediately preceding the passing of this Act was the practice of dentistry in Saorstát Eireann; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> (d)  that he was not guilty at any time of any crime or conduct which, if he had at that time been a registered dentist, would have caused his removal from the register.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of the application of this section to a person who was a dental mechanic before the passing of the Dentists Act, 1921, the expression &ldquo;practice of dentistry&rdquo; in the foregoing sub-section shall be deemed to include the work usually performed by a dental mechanic.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person to whom this section applies shall on passing either of the examinations in dentistry to be prescribed and held under this section and on making the prescribed application and paying the prescribed fees be entitled to be registered in the register.</P>
    <P>(4)  Two examinations shall be prescribed and held under this section, the first of which shall be held after the expiration of five months and before the expiration of six months from the passing of this Act, and the second of which shall be held after the expiration of eleven months and before the expiration of twelve months from the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>(5)  An examination prescribed and held under this section shall if held before the establishment of the Board be prescribed and held by the Minister, and if held after the establishment of the Board shall be prescribed and held by the Board.</P>
    <P>(6)  Nothing in this Act shall operate to prohibit any person to whom this section applies from practising or representing himself or holding himself out as practising or prepared to practise dentistry or dental surgery during the period between the passing of this Act and the publication of the results of the second examination held under this section.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every person to whom this section applies who is registered in the register under this section and is resident in Saorstát Eireann shall so long as he is so registered and resident be entitled to vote and be elected at an election of the elected members of the Board held after he is so registered as if he were registered in <Col N="275" /> the register by virtue of a previous registration in the General Dentists Register under Section 3 of the Dentists Act, 1921.</P>

      <P>I contend that sub-section (b) of the new section &ldquo;that he was on the 31st day of December, 1921, not less than twenty-one years of age,&rdquo; does not fulfil what the Deputies in this House had in mind or what the Minister himself purposed to do when discussing this Dental Bill during its various stages in this House and also in the Seanad.  The Minister said on the 4th July in the Seanad as reported on column 867 of the Official Debates:&mdash;&ldquo;I think we should demand, as a consideration in return for that, that there should be a fairly lengthy period of practice.&rdquo; Well, now in the Minister's new insertion here it means this&mdash;and I want to be as logical and clear as I can on this to show the Minister the effect it will have&mdash;in 1921 when the British Act was passed it stipulated that anybody under the age of 23 who applied for registration besides other qualifications necessary, was to sit for an examination.  Seven years will have passed from the passing of that Act up to the time that this Act comes into being and yet any man who was over 23 years of age in 1921 and who was not in any way engaged in dental practice is in a better position than the other.  I think in general that meant that men engaged in it should be considered.  But the man over 21 years of age in 1921 could immediately after the passing of the British Act have started here, knowing that he had no possible chance of getting on any register.  They did so. If that man is 28 years of age to-day he gets a chance of sitting for an examination to be put on the Dental Register that is to be brought into being.  I contend as against that that there was a number of men who were too young to apply for registration under the British Act but who may have had a number of years' practice.  There were men who had, before the passing of the British Act and who were too young to apply to be put on the register according to the British Act and who by virtue of this reading are still too young.  Take <Col N="278" /> the case of a youth of 14 years of age apprenticed in 1917 to the Dental business or profession.  That was eleven years ago.  He is 25 years of age to-day. He would have 11 years' apprenticeship at the dentistry but he would be too young to be considered for this examination. Then as against that we have a man who was over the age of 21 and who started to practise much later in life.  I want to lay emphasis on the fact about the time.  After the time the British Act was passed he is protected by this Bill.  The Bill protects him provided he is over 28 years of age now. But the man who has eleven years' apprenticeship is precluded under this Act.  I submit that that is not the Minister's intention at all.  His intention was to get consideration for those people who could prove that for a considerable number of years they were engaged in the practice of dentistry and that they were not quacks who had come over from the other side to try to get a status here which they could not get in Britain.  When this Bill was going through this House here several points of view were put up.  Apart from the Departmental Dental Committee which was set up, the Minister set up from this House a Dáil Dental Committee.  This Dáil Committee in conjunction with the Departmental Committee issued an advertisement to those people who were concerned also who are affected by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people in compliance with that request sent in applications accompanied by affidavits.  They went to a lot of trouble and expense to put their cases before the committee for consideration. These applications were considered.  A certain number were turned down and a certain number were passed on.  The Dáil Dental Committee put on to the Bill this third Schedule which embodied a certain number of men who had complied in that way.  Subsequently the Bill went to the Seanad.  In the Seanad representations were made on behalf of others and these were accepted and the Seanad set up a Seanad Dental Committee to consider the applications of those not put up by the Dáil Dental Committee.  The Minister himself accepted from the Seanad Committee the names of two individuals who were put <Col N="279" /> up by the Seanad.  Now it appears that all these men are wiped out, irrespective of the fact that Deputies in this House who had some knowledge of the matter and who considered that they were suitable to be included in this Third Schedule, agreed to permit them to stand for examination.  They are all wiped out now.  Although some of those may have a chance of sitting for an examination by virtue of age there are some who are not of age and who will be disqualified for all time.  That is the injustice which I am sure it is not intended by this House should be inflicted on those people.</P>
    <P>In my amendment here I set out that the age should be reduced from 28 years to 25 years, and I do that for this reason, that I figure out that as the average age of the youth who is being apprenticed to that particular trade or profession.  These started at the age between 15 and 16.  That gives them a certain number of years' practice. These men should be considered if they have a certain number of years.  I do not say that the Bill should consider those less than 25 years of age for the simple reason that I am inclined to agree that the number of years in practice should be extended from 7 to 10; and that is why I say that a young man starting at 15 years of age and who had served his time and embodied in all ten years' practice should be facilitated.  I have tried to show that the Bill as it stands now with the amendments from the Seanad makes it possible for men who started to practise after the day the Dental Register was brought in and after the idea of quack dentists being stopped, that these men who started after 21 years of age should have consideration; and on the other hand you have boys apprenticed to the trade before the passing of the British Act who are not getting any consideration at all.  I appeal to the Minister to accept it down to the age of</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to reply to this proposed amendment I will have to go back over the history of the 25, and that, in accepting that he would extend the number of years in dental practice from 7 to 10 years. <Col N="280" /> past.  This Bill has suffered badly in its passage through both Houses so far as the main idea entitling men not properly qualified to get a status and qualify now.  Originally when this Bill was brought in&mdash;it was introduced in the Dáil three times and on each Second Reading there was this statement made, and I think it represented the facts&mdash;that it was always intended in this country to have dental legislation and to found dental legislation strictly and rigidly upon the Act of 1921.  There is some doubt as to whether the Act of 1921 runs in this country.  I believe it does, but there has been some hesitation in enforcing it.  But in the Bill founded on that principle, the 1921 Act, in so far as the period of professional practice was going to count in lieu of examination, we always made the statement that we were not going to have a 1927 class.  We have worked to remain strictly up to the 1921 class. That may not be in accordance with the views of the people here, but that was our intention.</P>
      <P>We did find ourselves in the 1921 Act, and Deputy Briscoe has not comprehensively stated what the effects of the clause were.  There are two things we will leave out of consideration because there is a similar clause to this here.  There is one question of good character and afterwards of professional character; there were two points: one, the age limit and, secondly, the number of years in practice. If we were going to carry forward the 1921 Act we would have it that the person who at the particular date before the commencement of the 1921 Act was 23 years of age, but in addition he had to let us get to the examination class.  He will have the other clause under which he had to have been for five of the seven years immediately preceding the commencement of the Act engaged in dental practice.</P>

      <P>The 1921 Act, and nobody could come forward if he could show even 15 years' practice in the years allowed after 1921, if he could not have shown them five out of the seven years <Col N="281" /> prior to the 1921 Act he had no chance of succeeding.  That is the 1921 Act on which we were basing ourselves, so the Deputy in giving an explanation of my enlargement of the period of years left out altogether the other side of the question which was that a period of practice had to be limited to the five years period making up the seven years prior to 1921.  What do we do now? We came in here.  We are not going to have the 1927 clause, in other words we are not going to recognise people who set up here in my opinion illegally in practice and count what was the period of illegal practice from the date of passing this Bill backwards for a period of years.  We have been driven to that, and the principle of the 1921 Act was abandoned.  It was eaten into in the beginning.  Some people were under 23 years.  They were 23 all but 3 days.  Naturally those were admitted. Then we got a case where three months was the point of time.  Where a man was short by that period we allowed him on.  Next we found men who had only four of the seven years, and then we got a big rush of the people who prior to the 1927 Act had nine years' practice, if one counts the period of apprenticeship which shows even twelve. The Bill went through this House as Deputies know with the Third Schedule setting out the names, and Deputy Briscoe again makes the statement that those names have disappeared.  The names as names have disappeared but I am not so sure that very many&mdash;I think about two will not even qualify for the examination&mdash;will not be able to present themselves for the examination and so again qualify.  The big majority of the people named will be able to go for the examination and are in no worse position though their names have disappeared by reason of the substitution of this general clause.  The clause was substituted in the Seanad.  At a very late stage a clause was brought in more indicating certain points than actually having them drafted and in the Seanad I found them agreed on several things. First of all there was an insistence on apprenticeship, then on age, then on the period of practice, and then on good professional conduct even in the irregular dental practice period.  I asked the Seanad to agree with me in one proposition. <Col N="282" /> I got their assent.  The proposition was this.  Inasmuch as a man who goes through dentisry through the avenue of examination is not allowed to sit for his professional examination until he is 21 years of age, that we should be at least as hard in that respect on the people making their approach to dentistry through experience and not through examination, and that we should not count any years except years after 21.  Originally this clause as it appeared in the Seanad insisted on 10 years professional practice prior to the date of the passing of this legislation, and naturally and automatically it was felt that a person ought to be of such an age as would make it necessary that no single one of these ten years would have been prior to his attaining his majority.  In the discussion in the Seanad the ten years' period was weakened to seven and that brought down the age period, and the age period in paragraph B. and C. go together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has made a suggestion here to-night which I, personally, would be glad to adopt, but I do not know how it would appeal to the Seanad.  They rather rejected it in advance. The suggestion was to leave the period of age almost entirely out of your calculations and say ten years' practice.  The Deputy had better watch the phrase used because I asked the Seanad to let me change paragraph (c) in another way.  Paragraph (c) as drafted so read that it was his principal occupation during the whole of the ten years.  I agreed to reduce ten years to seven if I got a change in the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; into &ldquo;principal means of livelihood.&rdquo;  I did not mean that &ldquo;principal means of livelihood&rdquo; taken in conjunction with the phrase &ldquo;practice of dentistry&rdquo; covers any period of apprenticeship.  It is definite professional practice, not apprenticeship. If the Deputy wants this moulded in another way there is a danger of having it interpreted in another way.</P>

      <P>I am not sure people can complain that there is any hardship by the insistence on the clause <Col N="283" /> as it stands.  We do insist that a man should be 21 years of age on the 31st of December, 1921, and has been seven years in practice in the country.  We have got away from the basis of the 1921 Act and are not regarding it as so many years prior to 1921.  We are definitely regularising illegal practice since 1921.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Practice no one ever thought should be legalised in the country because, remember the 1921 Act was passed on the report of a Committee for the United Kingdom, which reported in 1919 but was established in 1917.  The report was of such a serious character that it was seen immediately that the unregistered practitioner was going to be done away with to a great extent.  Notwithstanding the 1917 Committee, their report in 1919 and the 1921 legislation which followed, a very big number of people continued in practice in this country, simply meaning that they were going to get the best out of a bad situation and to continue in practice until they were pulled up.  They now find themselves in the happy position of being regularised.  I think that in those circumstances a period of seven years prior to the passing of this Act is not too much to insist on.  I would prefer to have ten years.  I would go this length: I would prefer, although I would not insist on it, that sub-section (b) would go back to the way in which it was originally drafted&mdash;&ldquo;on the 31st day of December, 1918, was not less than 21 years of age.&rdquo;  That is to be in accord with this next paragraph if the ten years is to be insisted on.  However, it is for the House to decide.  A period of ten years is not so important as the insistence on the number of years in professional practice.  I do think that one ought to bear in mind the fact that I announced to the Seanad, and quoted here that the man who does dentistry by the avenue of examination cannot sit for his final examination until he is 21 years of age. We should not, therefore, count any period of practice whatever that started before a man attained his majority.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his reply bore out what I said, that illegal practitioners are being protected by this, and are being given an opportunity here of becoming dentists to the exclusion of men who cannot be classed as illegal, men who have served their time in this country.  I would like to impress on the Minister and on the House, if sub-section (b) is left as it is now, that opportunity is being given to those who are definitely illegal from the point of view of practising dentistry to the exclusion of those who should be given consideration or chance.  I am not asking that they should be put on the register; I am asking that those of 25 years of age be allowed to stand for the examination, and if the examination is severe enough only men who are as capable as can be in the circumstances will pass.  There is no great hardship on the community in putting a man of 25 years of age on the register provided he satisfies an examining body as to his qualification. There is no greater hardship in putting him on the register than there would be in putting a man who would scrape through after seven years of practice. It might be considered as unfair that a man who is now 25 years of age, who has been engaged for the last ten years in dentistry and who is prepared to stand for an examination, should be excluded.  Those who started later in life are being given an opportunity against those who are, in my opinion, more deserving of it.</P>

      <P>I was rather sorry to hear the Minister say that the effect of this amendment would be to exclude from the possibility of siting for this examination two of those who had been recommended for examination by the Committee which the Dáil appointed.  The Committee went into the case exceedingly carefully. I happened to be one of the Committee and, as far as my judgment would go, I do not think anybody was sent forward by that Committee who did not establish a reasonable claim to this concession, namely, that his qualifications, knowledge and experience should be tested by examination.  Reading down these provisions, it seems to me that their effect would be rather to <Col N="285" /> allow the possibility of one, or two additional ones to those whom the Dáil recommended than to exclude anyone whom the Dáil recommended.  I was wondering if the Minister would say which of the provisions had the effect of limiting the number recommended by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I need not say that I am fairly sick of this Bill.  As the Minister said, it came before us on three different occasions and received three Second Readings.  Some of us gave a considerable amount of time to discussion of this matter, and it does seem rather strange to us who spent <Col N="286" /> many hours in connection with this to find that there are names that we consider should be placed upon the list as possible to sit for examination now being excluded.  I feel pretty sore about that matter after the amount of trouble we have taken.  I think I see a point in what Deputy Briscoe has stated.  I am not inclined to press the matter very far, but I think he has made a case that we will, by this amendment of the Seanad, be giving a better chance to men who took up dentistry after it seemed quite impossible for them to be able to get on the Register, and we are going to exclude men who had been serving their time as apprentices before the 1921 Act came in.

      <P>I hope to congratulate myself on having convinced the gentlemen opposite that there was no favour shown to members of the Free State Army who applied for positions, as they alleged.  On the last occasion, when speaking on this, I instanced two cases which should make it clear to Deputies opposite that their statements were not altogether correct.  With regard to another case which occurred in South Cork, I am in the position that I can get corroboration in regard to it from a member on these benches.  That was a case where a doctor was appointed by the Board of Public Health and not approved of by the Local Government Department.  Two candidates were then sent on to the Appointments Commissioners, and, very much to the pleasure of Deputy Corry, a man of his own way of thinking, as he says, was appointed.  So much for the favour shown, as was alleged by Deputy Lemass, to members of a certain political belief.  I suppose there are other county councils who took their cue from Cork.  In Cork we have established a scheme of scholarships in order that the poor man's son may get the opportunity of developing and training the brains with which he has been endowed.  We spend the ratepayers' money in granting these scholarships, and we have taken good care to see that it is the poor man's son gets them, because we have laid down in the scheme certain stipulations with regard to the valuation of a man's farm, and in other cases of their pensions and salaries.  We could not do any more than that to ensure that it is the poor man's child who will get the scholarship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the Selection Board as well as the competitive examination. The former gives a good opportunity for looking through the candidates in every way.  I hold that if the Appointments Commissioners are to send down three names, as is proposed under this Bill, the result will be that it will be the old story over again.  As I stated on the last night, I had experience myself of seven or eight elections for doctors.  I always found that after the candidates had been galloped round the course once or twice that the election dwindled down to three.  If, as is proposed now, we are to have the practice of sending down three names to the local body, then you will have the same story that you had in the old days.  We in the Cork County Council hold ourselves up as an example for all Ireland.  We have a Selection Board of our own even for the appointment of a typist as well as for the appointment of rate collectors and other officials.  As regards rate collectors, there is one qualification at least that they should have and that is to be able to stand a bit of hardship, especially in the present times.  I think that having paid out of public funds for the education of young doctors that we ought to take steps to see that the best men are appointed.  The dispensary doctors attend to the poor in their districts. The poor have no choice but to go to them.  When we talk so much about looking after the interests of the poor, I think we ought to see that the very best men are appointed to these positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> My idea is that the present system is the best way of getting good men.  The best men to select doctors for appointment are members of their own profession. Some people would say that the old Boards of Guardians were responsible for the creation of these Selection Boards.  I do not believe all we hear about corruption as regards these old Boards of Guardians because I never saw it.  A lot of damage could be done without any corruption.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of ways of being corrupt without being corrupt at all. That is my way of reading it.  One might say if a man voted for his nephew, that that was corruption.  I do not think it would.  It would be the natural thing to do.  I think it would be corruption if we were to revert from the present to the old system.  What I would call corruption would be the hard cash.  If you met a man and had a drink from him that would not be corruption, nor would it be corruption to have a little thanksgiving after an election.  The damage is done then and there would be no harm in having a little champagne.  I remember on one occasion that a man got so much champagne that he came into my house on the following day and asked for two bottles of cider and two glasses of whiskey as the nearest approach to champagne.  I think that we should stick to the system that is now being carried out and leave these appointments to the Selection Board composed of capable men who have no axe to grind as far as the candidates are concerned. As far as the Local Government Department is concerned, we are assured and believe that they do not know the members of these Selection Boards at all. As I said a moment ago, if you do away with these Selection Boards, young doctors, poor men's sons, educated at the public expense, will have no chance of getting an appointment.  What chance would they have if you were to go back to the old system and adopt the principle now advocated of sending down three names?</P>

      <P>After the passing of the Local Government Act of 1898 and from 1898 to 1922 there were thousands of local appointments made under the new bodies set up under <Col N="290" /> the Local Government Act of 1898, and I challenge the Minister for Local Government, or any member of the Government, to state whether those men who were appointed prior to 1922 did not compare more than favourably in respect of ability, character and general proficiency with the officials who were appointed since 1926. Although some of the Deputies opposite owe their meteoric rise to place and power to membership of local bodies, when they got into the Dáil one of their first acts was to dissolve these local bodies and turn down the comrades who served with them prior to 1922.  These gentlemen found out mighty quickly how inefficient the local bodies became, and one by one they were dissolved.  It was quite all right to climb to place and power by the help of these bodies, but once in office they took very good care that these councils were quickly got rid of.  It was quite the thing to use these local bodies in 1922 to boost the Treaty so as to get the people of the country to accept it.  It was soon forgotten the part local councils played from 1918 to 1922 during the Black and Tan regime.  Of course, having played their part and put these men into power and after passing the necessary resolutions they were soon after discovered to be corrupt, and then this corruption at all costs must be got rid of.  Similarly with the officials.  When the local officials failed to bend the knee to Caesar other devices were tried to get rid of them, and to make certain where new appointments were made that only Free State supporters would get the appointments, the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act of 1926 was passed so as to make certain that only the nominees of Merrion Street were appointed to local positions.  There is no doubt in the minds of the people of the West of Ireland as to why that measure was introduced and passed.  The real and only cause for bringing it into the Dáil and passing it was to get rid of their political opponents, and prevent them getting any appointments under the local bodies.  The excuse was made that these councils were corrupt and the Dáil was asked for permission to make these appointments in Dublin.  After the country was bludgeoned and <Col N="291" /> dragooned in 1922 and 1923 the local officials were combed out, and under the Local Authorities (officers and Employees) Act very good care was taken that none but true, tried and trusted Cumann na nGaedheal sycophants would be selected.  Knowing all this we are asked from these benches to submit certain cases of corruption&mdash;knowing, as we do, the record of the Government through their Departments. Take the Land Commission, for instance.  In the case of grants that are distributed down the country we know who gets the gangership. Even the man who only earns 24/- a week, a road man, if he had not a Cumann na nGaedheal membership card would not get the earning of even 24/- a week, and yet we are brazenly asked to submit cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it necessary to submit any cases when all one has to do is to go into the Land Commission Office and find out there the different officials appointed, and why they were appointed, since 1922?  If we go into the Local Government Department Offices we will find the same state of affairs, and also in the other Government Departments. Then we are asked to submit cases of corruption.  If we go into those offices we will find brothers, cousins and other relatives of the Ministers all basking in the sunlight of freedom and soft jobs, occupying easy chairs, and then we are asked to submit cases of corruption. We are told this is a bad Bill.  If every word in the Bill was a word of wisdom it would not meet with the approval of the Ministers opposite, but if the Bill was drafted in Downing Street it would then be accepted.  It is not accepted because it is an attempt to give fair play to all classes of the community.  I do not know how the rank and file opposite are going to vote.  I know that when this matter of the Local Appointments Committee is discussed at county council meetings down the country, the Cumann na nGaedheal members of the councils speak against the Bill, but when they come up here and the official whip is cracked they will answer the call of the whip, and so of course they will go in and vote against this Bill.  Of course, <Col N="292" /> there is no use in having an automatic majority if one does not use it; there is no use in having patronage if it is not zealously guarded.  The dishonesty and corruption practised by local councils was not one-tenth of the mass-corruption and petty meanness practised at headquarters.</P>

      <P>We are told that the reason for the Act of 1926 was to squelch the long-tailed families with a pull down the country.  The Government know well that the best men are not always got by skill in passing examinations. There is something more required; it is poise, judgment and experience which reveal the best men. I wonder would Arnott's or Clery's appoint as their business manager a man simply because he happened to pass an examination?  This Bill is introduced as a genuine attempt to amend the Act of 1926 and bring it into conformity with the wishes of the local bodies.  There is scarcely a local paper one picks up in which one will not find expressions of grave dissatisfaction and adverse comment at these local appointments. There is continual friction between the Local Government Department and the local bodies.  I hold that the recommendations contained in this Bill should be accepted by the Government, and the Bill referred to a Committee of the Dáil.  What I would like to see built up is a local Civil Service for employees of local authorities on the basis of the permanent Civil Service, whereby officials could be transferred from one local body to another, and if found suitable would get promotion in the different grades of the local services, that from the more highly qualified men and women the office staff of the Local Government Department could be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if a scheme on these lines was prepared it would tend to <Col N="293" /> build up a more efficient local and national service.  There is lacking in the present local service the incentive to work hard.  There is no scheme of promotion in the service, and the local official falls into a rut, loses hope, becomes despondent, and fails to put all his energy, brains and ability into the work, simply because the system lacks the compelling force.  Since the Free State was set up officers of the local authorities have been appointed to posts in the Local Government Department, and from their training and experience I have no doubt they are excellent officials.  That goes to prove that if the principle was extended it would be to the benefit of the service and of the officials.  In introducing the Bill of 1926.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In introducing the Bill of 1926 the then Minister for Local Government stated that the intention of the Bill, as drafted, was to close the door on jobbery and on the abuses they were trying to stamp out.  In the discussion that took place on June 8th of this year the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bourke, said: &ldquo;I have no sympathy with the point of view that our local bodies are hotbeds of corruption.&rdquo; You cannot blow hot and cold.  You cannot hold that in 1926 it was necessary to introduce the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act because there was such corruption, and now in June, 1928, to say that you have no sympathy with the point of view that our local bodies are hotbeds of corruption. Were the local bodies so corrupt prior to 1922?  If they were corrupt why did not President Cosgrave show up that corruption when he was a member of the Dublin Corporation?  Why did not the Minister for Finance, whose work brought him in contact with local bodies day after day, show up corruption if corruption existed?  I say it was the <Col N="294" /> duty of the Minister to show up this corruption if it existed.  The county councils are elected on a more conservative basis than the Dáil.  Members of local bodies are elected by people who have a stake in the country, yet we are told that it is only the Dáil, committees of the Dáil or institutions set up by the Dáil that should have the selection and election of officers under local authorities.</P>
      <P>There was recently a case in Leitrim of a Miss McIntyre who was appointed to a post as rate collector.  The Department accepted a sum of, I think, £300 which she had no right whatever to pay. Miss McIntyre was not a surety for her brother but the Department took the money.</P>
      <P>The appointment of this young lady has not been sanctioned since.  I wonder is it because the Scriptures say &ldquo;The Lord will visit the sins of the father on the children to the third and fourth generation,&rdquo; that in a similar manner the Local Government Department are visiting the sins of the brother on the sister, and that the sister will not get the appointment because the brother erred?  I hope that is not so. An idea is prevalent down the country that everything must be done in Dublin; all these appointments must be made in Dublin; sanctions must come from Dublin; the wires must be pulled in Dublin, and any person who has not a political pull in Dublin need not look forward to any of these local appointments. I do not know that I can do better than quote what Deputy Gorey is reported to have said in this House on the discussion which took place on the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill in 1926.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What object have we now in calling this Department the Local Government Department, or calling the Minister Minister for Local Government?  It is the Department of Central Government, and he is Minister for Central Government. Local authority and local jurisdiction is gone.  Under the Bill every vestige  <Col N="295" /> of what was local authority resides now with the Minister.  Not a single appointment can be made, not even a road-maker or a stone-breaker can be appointed by the local authorities....</P>
    <P>I think, in common decency, the first thing we ought to do in connection with this Bill is to remove the term &ldquo;Local Government Department and Minister for Local Government,&rdquo; and not have this palpable fallacy.  We are asked to believe that some Committee of Public Appointments are going to be superhuman beings&mdash;people who must live shut up behind glass walls.  They will be without family influence.  Nothing can influence them.  I can see the members of this Local Appointments Committee invited to all the teas and luncheons in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Small wonder that Deputy Gorey was disgusted in 1926.  I have often wondered why it was necessary to have all these luncheon parties at Clery's. I see it now.  I wonder is Deputy Gorey as much against the Local Appointments Commission to-day as he was in 1926 and, if he is, will he vote for this Bill as introduced?  Deputy Gorey on the last occasion, speaking with reference to this Bill, said that in counties bordering on the Shannon corruption was rife.  He mentioned the case of Limerick.  I remember that in 1917 a similar charge was made against members of Leitrim County Council, and a public inquiry was called for.  The very members of the Council who made the charges against Leitrim County Council were the first to run away.  Perhaps if there was a public inquiry in the case of Limerick Deputy Gorey would be the first person to give it the go-by.  I would ask this House to accept this Bill in the spirit in which it was introduced and to let it go to a committee to devise some better means than we have at present for these local appointments.</P>

      <P>Or corruption or otherwise.  I will take it any way you wish.  A doctor was wanted in County Galway for the Hospital and Dispensary Board, and the local Committee appointed Dr. O'Shea.  The oath of allegiance came down with the appointment, and Dr. O'Shea, as a Republican, said he would not take it. The Local Government Department refused to sanction his appointment because of his political principles.  The committee that appointed Dr. O'Shea asked him to continue his work.  He did so for three months.  The Local Government Department refused to sanction him.  The position was not advertised under either body.  Dr. O'Shea fulfilled the duties in the hospital, and no other doctor applied for the appointment at the time.  We could not get another doctor to apply, and we wanted to have the sick poor in the Central Hospital in Galway attended to.  We kept the doctor working for six months and paid his salary.  The Local Government Department surcharged some members of the Board for doing so.  A doctor was wanted quite recently for a dispensary in County Galway.  Before the setting up of the Local Appointments Commission we had, what was called, a promotion scheme in Galway.  We graded the hospitals in the county into first, second and third class.  The Connemara area, being the poorest of the dispensary areas, was graded third class.  The dispensary at Oranmore was vacant.  We circularised all the doctors in County Galway, but none of them applied.  They did not consider it promotion to go there.  We then in pursuance of the promotion scheme advertised for a doctor in the Saorstát and one applied who had passed the Local Appointments Commissioners in competition with six other doctors for a dispensary in Donegal.  The Local Appointments Commissioners sent Dr. Jennings, who was a Galway man, to Donegal.  Dr. Jennings applied for the dispensary at Oranmore in order to get back to his own county.  He was the only applicant and was elected unanimously, but the Department of Local Government refused to sanction him.  He was not <Col N="297" /> fit for Galway, although he passed the examination for Donegal.  I have no hesitation in saying that if Dr. Jennings or his people held other views he would be sanctioned for Oranmore, but because he and his people think as they do he was not appointed.  I hope that will satisfy Deputy Wolfe that there is a certain amount of corruption, or victimisation if you like, in the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last two speeches have, to my mind, exemplified quite an amount of the rubbish that has been talked from beginning to end about amending a perfectly good Act.  The last speaker gave two examples that are entirely away from what we are discussing.  Number one was about victimisation which he described as occurring in one place where a man would not take what has been decided as a necessary oath before he is eligible for an appointment.  And that is corruption or victimisation! The Deputy does not care which term he applies to it, and he does not care that it was an action of the Department of Local Government, if there was anything in it at all, and that we are discussing the Local Appointments Commissioners. Deputy Holt has the habit of some members of his Party.  The part of his speech to which I listened with interest, and in which I had a great deal of belief was the part in which he joined with his colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, in running down the system of examination pure and simple. <Col N="298" /> What have we proposed in this Bill? We have an attempt to establish the system of examination much more rigidly than it was before.  This is a point that has been very much argued on this Bill.  The Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;It was left in the first instance completely in the hands of the local authority as to whether or not there should be a dispensing with the system of examination.&rdquo;  That statement was challenged, but that statement stands as an accurate statement of fact- &ldquo;and the local authority in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the local authority does not agree it is a condition precedent to dispensing with the competitive examination that the local authority must ask for a certain thing.  Therefore the local authority, by not asking, can impose a system of examination for cases where the system of examination should never be required.  Attempts have been made, and Deputy O'Kelly made a long attempt to prove that what the Minister for Finance said was wrong, but what the Minister for Finance said on that holds.  Yet this is a Bill which Deputies Holt and O'Dowd think very strongly of, though both have expressed themselves very strongly as being against the system of competitive examination. Similarly we have had over and over again since this debate started the talk that we have listened to from Deputy Holt when he was interrupted by Deputy Wolfe, about corruption, and he talked in the most general terms. Asked by Deputy Wolfe to give an instance under this local appointments system, all that Deputy Holt could do was to drift away into vague talk with regard to the Land Commission Staff, and matters like that.  Another Deputy gave two cases, clearly and entirely, on his own confession, outside the scope of this discussion.  Now, there has been an attempt right through the whole of this debate to get away from the enthusiasm of the early speakers, who wandered in with statements that glaring cases of corruption were to be given.  The phrases were &ldquo;corruption,&rdquo;&ldquo;nepotism,&rdquo;&ldquo;favouritism&rdquo; and &ldquo;political appointments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera said several times <Col N="299" /> that charges would be made.  I find it difficult to understand what Deputy de Valera did mean by the phrase which has been so often quoted.  It certainly was in a peculiar juxtaposition, if he did not want to have himself understood, in the ordinary meaning that anyone would take out of his words, that he personally was going to be apart and aloof from these detailed charges in regard to corruption.  He may not have meant it, but if so the juxtaposition of his words &ldquo;The talk about corruption which formerly was fairly frequent with respect to the local bodies is now turned on to the Local Appointments Commission&rdquo;&mdash;that is the thought at that particular point&mdash;&ldquo;I am not going to go into details as to whether there is any justification for that or not,&rdquo; is strange.  Deputy de Valera will not go into the question of corruption, but he said: &ldquo;Other Deputies will be speaking and will probably refer to certain appointments.&rdquo;  If that does not mean certain appointments which have an atmosphere of corruption about them it is a very unfortunate placing of his words.  But that is not his only statement in the matter.  Deputy de Valera said later, with regard to the local bodies: &ldquo;They were known locally and that responsibility was perfectly clear to them, and the people who elected them, knowing that they would have responsibilities of that particular kind to discharge. so that I say the difference in the whole case people feel is this: formerly corruption was nearly almost always revealed. There was a check, therefore, by publicity on it.  But they feel at present, if there is favouritism of that particular kind at the centre, there is no check of any kind upon it,&rdquo; again a deliberate avoiding of a clear statement that there is corruption, but the insinuation there the whole time, and if that was not meant it was the second time in which the Deputy was rather unfortunate in the choice of his words.</P>
    <P>Continuing along that same line, Deputy de Valera said: &ldquo;I think it is very important that there should be public confidence that appointments of this kind are made in the interests of <Col N="300" /> the community as a whole and not to give jobs to friends, or anything of that particular kind.&rdquo;  Again there is the suspicion and the innuendo that there is corruption in the making of appointments by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The Deputy at the end stated that he was not giving his own views on this thing.  That was towards the end of his speech, and whether is is supposed to refer to the whole Bill, that in fact he is unwillingly bringing in this Bill, or whether it merely refers to the statements it was expected to produce in this effort to amend a good Act, it is hard to see, but in the end he did confess: &ldquo;I am not giving my own opinions on this thing.&rdquo;  But the Deputy has been the recipient of a certain number of unsavoury stories and unfounded suspicions, but he does not justify them.</P>
    <P>He is not alone.  Deputy Ward to make up by vehemence for the absence of any details, announced himself in this way: &ldquo;I know a fair share about public administration and about the public life of the country, and I say quite deliberately that the corruption &mdash;there may be, and probably is, in isolated cases corruption in public bodies&mdash;practised by public bodies down the country is put in the shade by the corruption that is practised at headquarters.&rdquo;  Deputy Maguire hinted at things that were being spoken of&mdash;insinuations that were going round.  He gave one case in which he professed to find grounds for suspicion, and I will deal with a concrete case later.  Deputy Boland guarded himself much better than any other member of his Party.  Deputy Boland hinted at a number of things, while at the same time expressing himself to the effect that it is impossible to find out anything wrong, because although they believe there is a considerable amount wrong it has been cloaked and hidden too efficiently.  But the man who says that everything is cloaked and hidden too efficiently does not think that he is stultifying himself in any way by saying that nevertheless there are cases of favouritism, corruption and political appointments.  He guards himself with phrases.  He says at the beginning of his speech: &ldquo;I take <Col N="301" /> it that if we could be in the happy position of finding some of the details of the appointments made by this body there might be a lot to be said for the body&rdquo;&mdash;that if we could be in the position to find it out, then if we did find out the things we are looking for, what a great case we could make!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister, however,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;has been challenging us to produce some specific cases of corruption. He challenged us with an air of assurance that there were no leakages.&rdquo;&ldquo;I do not believe,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it would be possible in the case of a body which works along the lines of this Public Appointments Commission for anybody to produce what the Minister asked for&mdash;a specific case, with all the details attached&mdash;whereas in the case of public bodies it is entirely different.&rdquo; That is by a person who says it is impossible to give a case.  But the whole substance of the introduction of the Bill is based upon the fact that there is suspicion going about.  Deputy Lemass said: &ldquo;Every Deputy on these benches, and he believed every Deputy in the House if he was honest about it, could give out of his own experience an example that would prove....&rdquo;  I am not binding Deputy Lemass to the charge of corruption, but either to corruption, nepotism, political influence or some of the many evils alleged against the Local Appointments Commission system.  Deputy Boland referred to a statement made by the Minister for Finance later, and he continued in that fashion.  That is the speech of a man substantiating this particular type of amendment: &ldquo;Perhaps I could throw light on that.  Perhaps the political opinion of some of the applicants would have something to do with it.&rdquo;  Finally he makes one specific statement: &ldquo;We know that people have been turned down for political reasons.&rdquo;  At that point I began to write.  I thought I was going to get one case from Deputy Boland.  Instead of that he retreated again: &ldquo;A specific case cannot be produced for the reason that it was done in a star-chamber way.&rdquo;  But the Deputy, who knows all the people who have been turned down for political reasons, going on and feeling himself bound, as I thought, in the course of his remarks, to come to some <Col N="302" /> specific case, blocks his own way by saying that a specific case cannot be produced for the reason that this is done in a star-chamber way.  Then, feeling that he had weakened his own point, he gets back to the region of innuendo and insinuation and says: &ldquo;There may be all sorts of influences, and I fear there are all sorts of influences worked there, political and other influences.  That is the opinion of a very large section in this country. We have no choice; we have to put up with it.&rdquo;  These are typical of the vague charges that have been made with regard to how the Public Appointments Commission works.  There were seven or eight cases given&mdash;omitting the case given by the last Deputy who spoke as not having anything to do with the scope of the discussion.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy wait and see if I have mentioned them? I gather there were eleven specific cases spoken of.  There was the assistant matron, appointed in the mental hospital somewhere in Sligo or Leitrim, referred to by Deputy Maguire.  One listened for the gravamen of the charge, which was that a particular lady who should have got the appointment, according to him, did not even get notice of whatever it was, either the examination or to appear before the Selection Board or something else.  He admitted that she had changed her address. There was apparently a charge of corruption or something based on the fact that she did not get an interview with the Selection Board at a particular time.  That was the only instance that Deputy Maguire gave.</P>

    <P>Deputy Ward had four cases.  One was a dispensary doctor appointed at Scotstown.  I want to find out the seriousness of that situation.  Deputy Ward entered upon a line of argument from which he checked himself almost immediately&mdash;a line or agument leading up to the criticism in this House of a colleague, a member of his own profession, who was not here to reply to him.  The main point about the Scotstown appointment, as far as I can gather, was this: that according to Deputy <Col N="303" /> Ward, he was not aware &ldquo;that this man had any special qualifications unless the fact that during all the years of the national struggle, when this other man's family brought themselves down financially in the world owing to their national services, this man all this time conducted his practice in England and that he came back from England to fill this appointment over the other man.&rdquo;  Are we to generalise from that case quoted by Deputy Ward, and hold that any man who has served in England in any capacity is not going to be considered eligible for appointments under the Local Appointments Commission or any service in this country?  How would he act in regard to his colleague, Deputy Flinn, in regard to that?</P>

      <P>As the Local Appointments Commission appointed him there is a prima facie case that he was the best qualified.  The Deputy did not allege that he had not better qualifications than the person whom he thought should get the post.  The Deputy was making his case and he had full time to give evidence; he was there to give evidence against the Local Appointments Commission, and the whole charge is that the man who came across had been practising in England. The Deputy was not aware that he had any special qualifications.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be aware of them.  I do not want to be satisfied on every particular case brought up.  I take it the charge was seriously made.  The best that the Deputy can say is that the man was brought across from England when someone else was fighting here.  Is that going to be applied generally?  Are we going to have it that people are to be <Col N="304" /> ruled out from other appointments, from service in the Dáil, for instance, because they wore the uniform of England at one time?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the inference of the man who stands up to make a case against the Bill.  The second case was another dispensary appointment in County Monaghan&mdash;I do not know where it was and I did not bother looking into this case.  All that Deputy Ward could say was &ldquo;I understand that the man appointed to the position had been able to take up one of those post-graduate courses that Deputy Hennessy told us about, and he had degrees that the local candidates did not have.  But I do say this that the other candidate has taken his degrees in medicine, in surgery and in midwifery, and he had been four years practising in the town&rdquo;&mdash;that is the serious part of the argument from Deputy Ward's point of view&mdash;&ldquo;That town, with a couple of thousand of population, has four doctors in it already.  I do say that it is not good administration to send down another doctor to that area because some one or two of them must go to the wall.&rdquo; Supposing that they send down a really first-class man and that two or three people who were no good went to the wall would the Deputy speaking not as a medical practitioner in any area in Monaghan, but simply from the point of view of the public health, say that <Col N="305" /> that was a wrong thing to do?  That is the second case the Deputy talked about.</P>
      <P>We then come to the famous Kilskyre case, that was alluded to later. It was argued that Deputy Ward had for the first time introduced into this House the question of religion in making appointments.  Deputy Ward denied that.  He had not done it directly, no doubt, but simply by reading a letter relative to the appointment.  The appointment was one of the four which Deputy Ward gave as a statement of facts against the Local Appointments Commissioners, and the only evidence he gave with regard to this being an appointment which was unsatisfactory were the facts contained in the letter. Deputy Ward lives near the border.  I wonder will the medical practitioners on the other side of the border be pleased at the headline he has set to another Government with regard to medical appointments in future&mdash;that religion is to be a necessary qualification, that religion is to be a thing to be looked to, that the religion of the people whom the doctor is going to move around amongst&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy had another case just equally as good&mdash;a matronship again in a Monaghan hospital!   The difficulty was the Local Selection Board.  That is the best case the Deputy brought forward because there are certainly no evil arguments with regard to religion and no hopeless argument with regard to where a person was during the earlier period, and no fatuous arguments with regard to a good man being sent down and driving three medical practitioners to the wall. This is a case that possibly might be examined into by a Committee just as to what that Board was.  Remember that was a local Board, the type of Board that other Deputies asked should be set up.  Deputies from the Party opposite argued that in case of an appointment where there was a very big local interest there should be some advertence to that, and that the Selection Board should be taken from the people of the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass professed to give two cases, and they have only to be spoken of just to show exactly where the Deputy has got in the course of his argument.  He simply said, in the most dogmatic way, that he knew men who had been appointed as dispensary doctors and who had not been a day sober since appointment.  That was one of the two main arguments that Deputy Lemass thought fit to put forward with regard to the work of the Local Appointments <Col N="307" /> Commission.  When he found that that particular line of argument did not appeal to the House as being a decent type of argument to bring forward, he retraced his steps. He asked was it seriously considered that every appointment made by the Commissioners was the best, that they make no mistakes whatever, and that there was no question of error?  He also asked &ldquo; Is it seriously contended that appointments have been made by the Local Appointments Commissioners which are nit bad?&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass, although he starts with corruption and nepotism and political influence and bad appointments made in good faith, follows that up by saying that no system of appointment will ensure that you will always get good appointments made in good faith.  That is one of Deputy Lemass's cases, at least a series of cases grouped together in that way&mdash; that men whom he knows&mdash;not individual men&mdash;were appointed as doctors who have not been a day sober since they were appointed.  Then there was a particularly foolish thing, which I think he himself came to regard as foolish, of a doctor whom he knew at Harepark at the Curragh who gave a man a does out of a bottle and the man died.  There are some medical men in this House!  Would they like to have their reputation founded upon that&mdash;that they gave a man a does out of a bottle and the man died?  Would any of them stand much chance for an appointment anywhere if that were urged as a charge against them?</P>

    <P>&ldquo;There was a doctor there and he used to go round all the huts once a day, accompained by an officer, and the officer used to carry a bottle under his arm.  He was no doubt a <Col N="308" /> qualified doctor.  I remember he came into the hut in which I was resident at the time, because there was a man lying ill there.  The doctor was accompanied by this officer carrying a bottle under his arm.  The man who was ill had consumption, and he died shortly afterwards.  The doctor came to him, felt his pulse, examined his chest, and said to the officer: &lsquo;Give him a drop out of the bottle, Mick.&rsquo;  And do you know what the officer said afterwards?&mdash;&lsquo;God, this bottle must be great; we gave it to a man with a broken leg next door.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of Deputy Lemass's cases, and the other was that men had been appointed as dispensary doctors who have not been a day sober since their appointment. These are Deputy Lemass's two sets of facts as against the work of the Local Appointments Commission.  There are four other cases made outside the two absurd cases given by the last Deputy who spoke.  Deputy O'Kelly talked about a town clerk appointed in Enniscorthy. Deputy Little spoke of a surveyor appointed in County Waterford, and I think Deputy Ryan gave three cases&mdash;an engineer appointed in Limerick, a Wexford County Board of <Col N="309" /> Health appointment&mdash;I think that was the ophthalmologist.  Of these four cases, the one given by Deputy O'Kelly with regard to the Town Clerk of Enniscorthy was entirely wrong.  With regard to two of the others&mdash;I leave out the surveyor&mdash;the Minister for Education said here that this was not an accurate description of the work of the Local Appointments Commission since they were established; that the Selection Board examined into the professional and technical qualifications of people; that they placed them in a particular order, and that that order could only be varied by the reaction on that list of three other items.  One of these is a knowledge of Irish, for which a preference was given; the second the fact that a man comes from the locality for which a slight preference is given; and the third being whatever may afterwards be discovered with regard to the man in connection with a series of things given in the Act &mdash;age, health, character, and, I think, moral conduct.  In no case can it be said that the names sent up by the Selection Board, examining from the technical and professional point of view, are varied except by reason of Irish, some local qualifications for which only a slight preference is given and which is asked for in the amending Bill, and what there may be from the examination that was made with regard to health, age, character, and, I think, moral conduct&mdash;at any rate, there is a fourth.  The surveyor of whom Deputy Ryan spoke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">

      <P>I did not raise that case as a case of corruption.  I raised it in answer to a point that the examining body or the Selection Board were always unacquainted with the men they examined.  I raised it to show that the man selected was actually an assistant to one of the examining board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but I make that general statement.  I <Col N="310" /> would like to say a word in reference to the engineering appointment, in regard to which Deputy Dr. Ryan seems to have put up a good case.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, in answering that, pointed out that the case turned entirely on the point of experience. Deputy Dr. Ryan said that the man had experience.  The man himself did not claim to have experience.  It was on that point, that though the man had a fine academic record, but had not experience, he was not appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>He claimed to me to have experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing which the Appointments Commissioners or the Selection Board have to go on is what a man claims in the form which he puts in.  With regard to the other two cases I make this statement&mdash;Professor O'Sullivan has made it already&mdash;that the only variation made from the list of placings sent out by the Selection Board, is by reason of the items I have mentioned. I take this for the purpose of comparison. I am not saying that this is the only thing put in the Bill, but the Bill founds itself on a more rigid system of competitive examination. Surely examination results can be twisted and disturbed quite as much as the placings made by a Selection Board.  The only security is that an examiner who gave the marks and who knows how they were distributed, will know that the people are not appearing in the order in which he marked them.  Surely the same can be asked in regard to Selection Boards?  Surely if there are as many cases as Deputy Lemass stated, when he said that he believed that every member of every Party, if he were honest, could give instances into which political prejudice entered, it is reasonable to expect that some Selection Boards would have complained many times and complained openly that their placings had been disturbed, that the name of a man whom they recommended and in regard to whom they saw no reason to suppose that he would not get the appointment, was disturbed in the list of placings.  Surely we would have had a great outcry from some members <Col N="311" /> of the Selection Board if that were the case.  Surely they would have made some comment on it.  The same thing would apply to examinations. I have neither the time nor the intention to go into the cases mentioned by the last speaker, as they are not relevant.  These are the two cases spoken of, and on these, we are to found this Bill, which is described not as a repeal of the Principal Act, but merely as an extension and an amendment of it.  Is it an extension to say that instead of a single name being sent down to a local authority the local authority has a right to demand a panel?  We have been talking here as if that panel comprised only three names, whereas it might be 43.  The Deputy may not have meant that, but let him read the Bill.  Local authorities can demand a panel of 43 names.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Even if it is limited to three, what difference does it make to the unfortunate man who has to start the old system of canvassing again, go around visiting and provide all the refreshments mentioned by Deputy Daly, if that was a true picture of conditions in the past under a local authority, about which I know nothing?  Surely the competition is only intensified by three candidates being left in for the final round.  When each man knows that he has only two competitors to beat, that the opposition is weakened by the way in which the numbers are reduced, the competition is intensified from the point of view that each of the three candidates knows that he has got to the last fence and it is his great effort to get over that last fence.  By that simple change, there is a complete repeal of the old Act and that complete repeal of the old Act should not be carried out on the fatuous cases put up by Deputy Dr. Ward. The case mentioned by Deputy Lemass and the better case mentioned by Deputy Dr. Ryan did not show any evidence <Col N="312" /> of corruption, intrigue, or the victimisation of anybody.  I would put it to Deputies if they consider the details of this Bill, though it may not be meant, they will find that there will be set up under it a more rigid form of examination than there has been up to the present.  A local authority must take the initiative in the matter.  If the local authority remains recalcitrant and demands a competitive examination in regard to a medical appointment or in regard to the appointment of a county surveyor, then there must be a competitive examination and that is the only way in which the appointment can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some difficulty in reconciling this idea of a panel of three with the other clause which provides that there is to be a competitive examination and that the first name must be sent down or where there is more than one vacancy that only one name must be sent down for each vacancy.  I was amused to find corroboration of the attitude taken up on this side with regard to the Bill, in the speech of Deputy MacEntee, because the Deputy definitely referred to the three names that would have to be sent down when there is to be a competitive examination.  That is the difficulty of reconciling the two clauses.  I think I know what is meant, but we have to discuss what is before us.  Deputy Dr. O'Dowd was very frank in his attitude on one matter.  He is backed by Deputy Holt.  It is an attitude with which I have a certain amount of sympathy, but I would not have gone to the length to which they have gone in regard to it.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy said that he could not understand Deputy de Valera backing this Bill.  He spoke of him as Chancellor of the National University, but I suggest that where he is wrong is not in thinking of Deputy de Valera as Deputy de Valera but as Chancellor of the National University. If Deputy de Valera were a man of academic standing we might expect some indication of that throughout this measure, but we certainly would not expect to find two members of his Party running down examinations as a method of selection in the way they have done.  If Deputy de Valera had been a real member of the University, and if he were associated <Col N="313" /> with the students, he would know what these students feel in regard to these appointments, but the fact is that he did not form any part of the student body in that University.  Neither can it be said that, academically, has he any authority to speak as Chancellor of the University in this matter.</P>

      <P>I will discuss it elsewhere.  Deputy Little went out of his way to attack certain bodies with which he is associated.  I think that it is quite wrong that Deputy Little should be allowed to say what he did in regard to a certain body with which he is associated.  He has given that as an analogy to local appointments under review.  I know these bodies quite as well as Deputy Little, and I would like to deny here the particular implications that arose out of that statement with regard to one of these bodies which has a particular university tinge. If Deputy Dr. O'Dowd's or Deputy Holt's views in regard to examinations are to be the views held by members of that Party, why insist, as in Clause 10 of the Bill, that there is going to be a much more rigid system of examination than what there is under the Act? Although I would not approve of examinations being the final test for a considerable number of appointments, I put it to the House that they should not put it into the power of a local authority to demand that for a particular type of appointment, such as that of a county surveyor, or a medical appointment, there shall be immediately established an examination.</P>
      <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, speaking on this Bill, referred to the Labour Party's amendment, which suggests that this Bill should be referred to a committee.  Certain suggestions have been made by Deputy O'Connell with regard to that.  He agreed, I think, with the principal points put to him by the Minister for Finance.  In fact, he stated himself that it was not his purpose to have the Committee inquire into the actual appointments but to inquire only in regard to the system.  The Minister for Finance said that it was the intention if this Bill were defeated but not otherwise, to have such an examination conducted on the lines suggested by Deputy O'Connell, but on no other lines.</P>

I think Deputy O'Connell will agree that the Committee should not go into particular appointments, as he stated in moving his amendment.  I will read what the Deputy said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to make it quite clear that I do not mean that this Committee should go into particular appointments that have been made under the Act.  I want to make that quite clear.  I do not propose that the particular appointments that were made, or the methods used by the Local Appointments Commission of finding out who would be the best candidate for any particular appointment, would be inquired into in any particular way.  What I do wish, would be to get a Committee together which would find out what the general complaints are with regard to the working of this Act generally, and what defects have been shown in its working and in its operations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the statement has come twice from this side that that type of Committee <Col N="316" /> would be set up, not the type of Committee referred to in the amendment, which would lead to much more being inquired into than what Deputy O'Connell wants.

      <P>I or somebody will bring in terms of reference which the House can have a look at, but no terms of reference will be brought forward <Col N="318" /> so long as this particular piece of fatuity remains on the Table, which, as drafted, leads to a considerable amount of difficulty in understanding it.  It has been explained differently by different members of the Party, but no Deputy has ventured to explain what is to happen in regard to technical appointments.  Deputy de Valera passed it off in a phrase which could mean anything.  If passed this Bill, as far as two sections are concerned, will destroy any good that was ever done by the old Act.  The idea of sending down a panel of not less than three names, or of even confining it to three; the idea that a local authority could insist on a competitive examination for every appointment, would render the whole thing futile.  It is suggested that the Bill should be got out of the way, that it should be defeated, and that after that Deputy O'Connell's amendment could be brought forward in another way. Deputy O'Connell will find, if he reads the speeches made by three persons from these benches, that he has got a very definite indication that the Committee which he wants and which he describes in his speech will be set up if this Bill is defeated.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that he has in any way answered the case put up by Deputy Dr. Ryan in connection with the case of Dr. Pierce in Wexford?  As far as I can see he kept away from it all the time. There is a very definite allegation made in this particular case that Dr. Pierce, the man in question, was brought to the Selection Board, was asked a few questions in Irish; his qualifications were not inquired into, and the appointment was given to a person who was an assistant to the Chairman of the Selection Board.  That is a very definite charge, and it looks corrupt if it is not corrupt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in answer, I think to Deputy Dr. Hennessy, or some other Deputy, I am not sure now&mdash;but I said in answer to some Deputy that in this particular case the successful candidate was well known to a member of the Selection Board.</P>

    <Col N="319" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the gravamen of the whole charge.  What the Deputy did say was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>They appointed a man to act as ophthalmic surgeon to their county hospital.  For a couple of years he was acting in a temporary basis, and the position was this, that his work was giving such satisfaction that they made up their minds to make it a permanent appointment.  When they came to that conclusion they found that the case would have to come before the Local Appointments Commission.  This man was brought before the Local Appointments Commissioners as well as were others.  It was suggested here by some speakers, I do not know by whom, that the examining body, the Selection Board, were not acquainted, as a rule, with the people who came before them.  In this case they were very well acquainted with some of those who came before them, with the result that the man who had been doing the work temporarily for two years was turned down in favour of a man from Dublin.  Now, this Wexford doctor was in the habit of attending that hospital every morning. He had done every operation that a man in his position would be expected to do, such as removing cataract, obstruction of strabismus, enucleation and lid operations.  He had, of course, after operations of that sort, to dress the eyes of the people on whom he had operated, and he was prepared to go on with that. He was prepared to call every day at the hospital, whereas the man now appointed is only prepared, if he gets the appointment&mdash;that is, so far as the Board of Health know&mdash;to come down once a week, on Saturdays... It may be held, perhaps, that the Wexford doctor did not have the proper qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Deputy gave the doctor's qualifications.  He said &ldquo;the Wexford doctor was qualified in September, 1924, and attended the post-graduate course at the Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin for three months.  In May, 1925, he attended a further post-graduate course and obtained a certificate there. In 1927 he attended a full three <Col N="320" /> months' post-graduate course in Paris. Again this year, 1928, he attended a short post-graduate course in the Royal Eye and Ear Hospital, London.&rdquo;  That statement was made.  Is there a case made that a worse man was appointed? It was not made by Deputy Ryan, Deputy Ryan's case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making a case that there was a better man appointed.  You are talking about besmirching a man's reputation.  I submit this is taking away from a man's reputation.  I submit that man who was working with the sanction of the Local Government Department for two and a half years and who was then turned down by a Selection Board, has had his reputation taken away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he will state the reasons why the applications of Pat Walsh, Breaghwy, County Mayo; Michael Loftus, Ballinooash; Michael Caulfield, Ballinooash; James Howley, Lognavodogue; Edward Mullaney, Lognavodogue; Ellen Callaghan, Cappavicar; Ellen Mongan, Cappavicar; John Quigley, Lognavodogue; Pat Fox, Corheens, and Patrick Clarke, Ballinooash, for parcels of land on the Browne Estate, Breaghwy, Castlebar, have been refused; whether he is aware that these applicants are congested holders who are in urgent need of increases to their farms; and whether he will now state when and how it is proposed to deal with their claims.</P>
      <P>The reply was:&mdash;&ldquo;The Commissioners, in the exercise of their discretion, have divided the lands situate on the estate of D. S. Browne to the best advantage having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicants, and to the area of land available for distribution.  It was not found possible to provide the applicants referred to in the question with allotments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister said, or at least, I understood he said, that one of the people I mentioned had a poor law valuation of over £18. I have a list here giving particulars regarding the valuations of each man. Pat Walsh pays a rent of £5 12s.  That man could not possibly have a poor law valuation of over £18.  Thomas Callaghan has a poor law valuation of £9 5s.; Michael Loftus has a valuation of £8 5s; Michael Caulfield, £5 2s.; James Howley, £5 15s.; Edward Mulaney, £5 15s.; Ellen Callaghan, £7 10s.; Ellen Mongan, £8 15s.; John Quigley, £2 10s.; Pat Fox has a rent of £9.  The poor law valuation could hardly be twice his rent.  Then there is Patrick Clarke with a poor law valuation of £7 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> Regarding the statement as to valuation, the valuation of one man who got land is £15.  One of the persons who got land was an ex-sergeant of the R.I.C. and he is supposed to be drawing a pension of £17 per month.  He got a house and 46 acres.  His mother, who holds the local post office and has another son living with her working as a blacksmith, also got an addition.  She has also a daughter, who was a teacher, living with her.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Fahy.  There is another case of a police-sergeant&mdash;Tom Staunton.  He is also supposed to be drawing a pension of £17 per month and he got land to the extent of about 70 acres.  I ask the Minister to compare the position of those people with the position of the people whose names I read out to him.  I ask him to compare their Poor Law Valuation and their rent and to say whether that was a fair and just distribution of the estate.  It is commonly rumoured around the district that the local inspectors are not to blame.  In fact, the common rumour is that the local inspectors positively refused to give land to those people and that they told them they would get it in spite of them. And they have got it.  Another man got land&mdash;this is an argument that has been used for refusing the claims of people that I have gone to the Land Commission about&mdash;and he is a shopkeeper. He is in a fairly big way of business.  I went to the Land Commission about a woman on the Moorehall estate.  She held a cottage on the demesne.  Her family for generations held that cottage.  Her husband was a carpenter.  For want of employment, he had to go to America.  She has eight children and she was refused land on the ground that her husband was a carpenter.  That was the sole reason for refusing to give her any land.  Another case that I communicated with the Land Commission about was that of a man in the village of Kilmaine&mdash; the village blacksmith.  All he got was about two statute acres, on the ground that he was a blacksmith.  I ask the Minister what is the difference between <Col N="325" /> a blacksmith in the village of Kilmaine and in the village of Carnacon?  What the people of this district want the Minister to do is to send down an independent inspector and let him hold an inquiry into the circumstances of the distribution of this estate.  Let him hear both sides of the story and, as far as I know, the people are willing to abide the result.  They are fully prepared to accept the result provided the inquiry is open and above board. There is another man&mdash;Thos.  Callaghan &mdash;who I thought might be the man to whom the Minister referred when he mentioned the £9 valuation.  I did not put that man's name in.  He has 46 acres.  I know the land and it is very bad.  In fact, one could say that five or seven acres of good land would be as good as the whole lot of it.  The proof of that is that the Poor Law valuation of those 46 acres is only £9 5s.  The Minister also mentioned that the husband of one of the women whose names I had in the question was in the asylum.  I am sure the Minister is aware that thousands of the small farmers of Mayo are away a great part of the year in either England or Scotland and that it is quite a common custom for their wives to do the work in their absence.  The argument which the Minister makes does not hold water, so far as Mayo is concerned.  I ask the Minister, in the interest of justice, to hold this inquiry and I give him a guarantee that if the inquiry is open and above-board the people will abide the result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the division of land, I personally do not know of any estate in the Country where the division gave anything like general satisfaction.  It would be contrary to human nature, in a sense, if it did, since you have so many claimants for parcels of land when an estate is being divided.  It would be expecting too much to expect that the division would give all round satisfaction.  The Land Commission has no hope of giving such general satisfaction in the division of any estate.  It can do no more than act in a manner which it thinks is fair and equitable in any circumstances. The Deputy says that the local inspectors were not to blame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can disillusion the Deputy in that respect, because the procedure in the Land Commission is that they normally go on the reports of the local inspectors. If the Deputy is satisfied that the local inspectors were not to blame, why does he ask that another inspector be sent down?  If the inspectors fully satisfied the people there that they were doing the fair and just thing, why send down another inspector? Apart from that, the very first name on the list of valuations over £10&mdash;it is £18 15s.&mdash;that I got from the Land Commission was that of the man whose rent the Deputy says is £5 12s.  I admit that there may be some mixing up of names.  The name on my list may be that of some other Pat Walsh.  That is quite possible and it is even probable in the circumstances because when I made inquiries about the division of this estate I found that all the documents were with the inspector, including the scheme for division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the statement I made about local inspectors not being to blame, I referred to local senior inspectors.  A particular inspector in Mayo, it is commonly said, definitely refused to consider the schemes of these people.  Whether the other inspectors were to blame or not, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the senior inspector in the district who would send up finally the scheme from the sub-inspectors. It would be his function to go through the scheme after it had been handled by the junior inspectors and send it on to the Land Commission. In the usual course, he would go up and discuss the matter of the division with the Land Commissioners.  The scheme of division of that estate is with the local inspector, and, therefore, I do not know who the persons are to whom parcels of land were given.  I cannot, therefore, say whether the two R.I.C. men got land or not, because the Land Commission were not able to give me the information this evening.  They had not the documents.  That is the position <Col N="327" /> in regard to them.  It would have been better, perhaps, if the matter had been postponed for another week, because the Land Commission is expecting the return of the report within the next three or four days and, with the report, the documents.</P>

      <P>I am in this position: I do not wish to make a personal attack on any official until I am quite sure. If the Minister will give me a guarantee now, that he will have this report in a week's time, I am quite willing to postpone the matter.</P>

That will not arise if the Deputy is satisfied when the report comes up.  He can discuss the report with Mr. Roddy or myself.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will recommend to the Civil Service Commissioners that certificates of Establishment be issued to the successful candidates at the confined Civil Service Examinations, June and July, 1925, and May, 1927, who were over 50 years of age at the time of their appointment as clerical officers as a result of those examinations; having regard to the fact that these men were within the limits of age prescribed for the examination (18 to 55 years), and were submitted to the same educational test and the same medical examination as younger competitors.</P>

      <P>The statutory regulations published before the examinations referred to were held, stipulated <Col N="163" /> that a successful candidate whose age was 50 or over on the date of appointment, would not be eligible for pension, and consequently a certificate of qualification as an established officer could not be issued in his favour by the Civil Service Commissioners.  In the circumstances, therefore, I am unable to take the course suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
