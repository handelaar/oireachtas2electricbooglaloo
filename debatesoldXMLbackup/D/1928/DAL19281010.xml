      <P>The person appointed is a carpenter with twenty-two years' experience in the building trade.  He held at different times the posts of foreman, clerk of works on building jobs and also carried on business as a building contractor.</P>
      <P>Posts of this kind could not well be filled by examination.  They are filled after consideration of the likely candidates by senior officers of the Board of Works, preference being given to applicants who served in the National Army, and due regard being paid to the merits and suitability of men already in the service of the Board. Apart from his extended technical qualifications and experience the man appointed in the present instance was selected as the best qualified for the special requirements of this particular post.</P>

I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that he was one of the least qualified men for the position.  I would like also to mention that his principal qualification was that he was an organiser for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in Dublin. What answer has the Parliamentary Secretary to that?</P>

      <P>No, quite the contrary. Everybody knows that it is a fact.  It was not for the man's ability at all.  He was already remunerated for his work in the National Army. Everybody knows that as a building contractor he was not a success.  It was stated in the answer to which I am referring that this gentleman &ldquo;was <Col N="4" /> perfectly qualified to discuss various matters with people of very high rank.&rdquo;  Well, I happen to know that he was not qualified from that point of view at all, and I want to say that this appointment was a job pure and simple.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The total expenditure on the Kilmastulla Drainage District to 30th September, 1928, in respect of works of reconstruction carried out under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, amounted to £5,700 and of that amount £1,664 was expended during the year 1927-28.</P>
      <P>During the year 1926 the average number of men employed varied from 70 to 120, but in 1927 labour was scarce, and the average number of men was about 30.  Sometimes they worked in one gang, and at other times in two gangs.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been received from a few persons as to the manner in which the work has been done, but I am satisfied that the complaints made were without foundation.</P>

      <P>The candidate referred to was one of those who had shown to the satisfaction of the Civil Service Commissioners, by passing a literary test, that they were sufficiently qualified to be summoned for personal interview by a Selection Board which assisted the Commissioners in determining the person to be appointed.  Any candidate who, before the vacancy was announced, had already satisfied the Commissioners in that way was not required to undergo a further literary test, and this arrangement applied in the case of the candidate who was eventually appointed.  It would be misleading <Col N="6" /> to compare the marks obtained by him and the other candidates referred to in one subject in the two separate examinations in which they qualified.  A knowledge of Irish was essential for the appointment, but Irish was only one of a number of subjects prescribed in the tests.  The conclusion of the Civil Service Commissioners in determining the relative merits of the candidates was taken, not on the examination in question, but on the report of the Selection Board.  Under the advertised conditions of appointment a candidate with Army service was to receive a preference, and the candidate appointed had such service.  No other post in which Miss Davey could be employed is at present vacant.  Any further vacancy will be duly announced by public advertisement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to assess grants given under the Housing Acts to persons building houses as income; and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that money which must be expended on the construction of houses is of the nature of capital expenditure, he will consider the desirability of making an alteration in this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to assess as income grants given under the Housing Acts to persons building houses.  In the case however, of builders, or other persons building houses for sale, any such grant or subsidy must be taken into account in the computation of the profits assessable to income tax either by inclusion in the trading receipts, or by deduction from the costs.  In these cases the money expended on the construction of houses is not in the nature of capital expenditure, but is analogous to cost of manufacture in the case of a manufacturer, or to costs of purchases in the case of a merchant.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state how many motor cars for re-sale have been imported over the Northern Border since the beginning of the current year; whether the levying of duties in connection with such importations has involved a great amount of trouble, and necessitates the presence of specially trained officials; and whether any inconvenience would be caused by an order that motor vehicles other than those already in use for transport could only be imported through the ports of the Saorstát.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to state the number of motor cars imported across the Land Frontier for re-sale, as importers of motor cars are not required to state the object of importing. The total number of touring motor cars and of motor cycles imported across the frontier from the 1st January, 1928. to the 31st August. 1928. was 257 and 71, respectively, and of this number approximately two-thirds were second-hand vehicles in each case.  Customs officials are not required at land frontier stations for the express purpose of dealing with motor cars imported for re-sale.  This is only part of the duties falling to be performed by such officials at these stations and it is doubtful whether any saving of staff would result if the importation <Col N="8" /> across the land frontier of motor cars for re-sale was prohibited; no official inconvenience would be caused by the issue of an order as indicated in the last part of the question, but such an order would result in considerable restriction on trade and would, therefore, be unjustifiable in the absence of any official reason for it.</P>

      <P>It is not the function of the Minister for Finance to examine and check the lists of persons in receipt of pensions or other moneys payable directly or indirectly from the Exchequer of Saorstát Eireann.  These duties are carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who has already informed the Dáil* that as a provisional arrangement the audit of the supplementary pensions of the Irish County Court Judges, the pensions of Civil Servants who retired before the 1st April, 1922, and the pensions, etc., of the Royal Irish Constabulary are paid in the first instance from the British</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> Exchequer, and the accounts are audited by the British Exchequer and Audit Department, and the cost of this is repaid annually from the Vote for the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The Public Accounts Committee have been aware of this arrangement from the beginning, and have examined the Accounting Officer for the Superannuation Vote upon it.*</P>
    <P>A similar arrangement exists for payments made from our Exchequer and recoverable from Great Britain, such as the payments made from the National Health Vote for Discharged Soldiers' Sanatorium Benefit and from the Land Commission Vote for expenditure on improvement of British Ex-Servicemen's holdings.  These payments are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General here and his certificate is accepted by the British Exchequer and Audit Department.  The cost of these audits is recovered from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor-General has the right to examine in detail all payments made by Great Britain and recoverable from the Saorstát, and for this purpose may detach members of his staff for duty in London, if he so wishes.  Similarly, the British Comptroller and Auditor-General may send his staff here to examine payments made on his behalf by us.</P>
    <P>As regard the final part of the Deputy's question, I have already explained at length in correspondence with him the difficulties in the way of securing reliable information as to the amount paid by way of pension and compensation allowance to ex-members of the Royal Irish Constabulary resident in the Saorstát.  I have, however, since been informed by the British Government that, on a very rough calculation, they estimate that £960,000 was so paid in the year ended 31st March, 1928, the Saorstát liability in respect of which amounted to approximately £700,000.</P>

      <P>Owing to the loss to revenue sustained on the postal service in the Clonaslee-Rosenallis district it was necessary in 1923 and 1924, as part of a general restriction of unremunerative service in An Saorstát, to reduce the frequency of delivery.  The district was not treated exceptionally.  I regret that the expense which would be entailed by an increase in the frequency of service to four days a week would not be justified.

      <P>Arising out of the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary, may I direct his attention to the fact that the Minister for Defence has already published, in the debate here in the Dáil, certain figures relating to these contracts, and in view of that fact I think we are entitled to have the definite contract figures for these boots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the attitude which this Party took up upon this Bill on Second Reading, we intend to oppose the inclusion of this particular section.  Section 1 of the Bill proposes to reduce the term of office of Senators from 12 to 9 years.  When we opposed the Second Reading of the Bill, we were informed by the President and others on the Benches opposite that we were opposing the reduction of the term of office of Senators.  Of course that was inaccurate, as most of the statements made from the Benches opposite are.  When the Bill, therefore, comes before us on Committee Stage we have an opportunity of singling out this particular section and there can be no confusion caused by the fact that we are opposing it on this occasion.  We are opposed to this section of the Bill not because it proposes to reduce the term of office of Senators, but because it <Col N="23" /> does not reduce that term sufficiently. We believe, and have expressed our belief, that if we must have a Seanad the term of office should not exceed six years.  The advisability of not increasing the term beyond that period becomes much stronger in view of the altered system of election.  We believe that if any effective control is to be exercised over those appointed to the Seanad it can only be done by holding over them the possibility of their removal at the end of a period which will not be too long.  A person elected for nine years, no matter what other provision you make, will feel himself independent of public opinion or the opinion of the Dáil for a considerable portion of that time.  He knows that no matter what he may do during the first five or six years of that period it will very likely be forgotten when the question of re-election comes forward.  We will have as a result of this section, if it is passed, an aggravation of the evils which we have at present to endure in respect of the Seanad.  We have had a very considerable number of the members of that body showing absolute indifference to the duties which membership places upon them; and the cause of that was no doubt the fact that the period of twelve years was in the Constitution.  Reducing that period to nine years, does not remove the cause of the evil; it should be reduced to, at least, five or six years.</P>
      <P>We do not think that the term of office of Senators should exceed the maximum term of office of a member of the Dáil.  We, therefore, intend to oppose this section.  We hope that Deputies on the Benches opposite who profess to desire to see a vigorous, active and useful Seanad will realise that their desire is much more likely to be accomplished by the adoption of our suggestion than by that contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We are favourable to the suggestion contained in the section, and are prepared to go further and agree with Deputy Lemass to reduce the period to six years if necessary.  I suggest to Deputy Lemass that if he has views on the lines of the speech to which we have just listened, in favour <Col N="24" /> of the reduction of the period of office to six years, the right road to follow is to vote for the nine years.  If he felt so disposed, an amendment might be brought in, and we would be prepared to support him to reduce it further to the period of six years he mentions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty in relation to these good people up above is that there seems to be very great difficulty in finding out what they have to do or who intends to do it.  You have them functioning there now for a number of years.  They seem to meet sometimes for an hour.  Officially they are sometimes adjourned for a fortnight or three weeks.  They are sometimes waiting for months, apparently, with nothing to do, and when that very small modicum of work which they have to do is offered to them, the attendance as a body is very small, and the attendance of individuals is scandalous. Under the present arrangement, once you have bought a pig in a poke you have got to live with him for this period.  If they do not attend&mdash; some of them have shown quite frankly that they do not intend to attend&mdash;we have no means of dealing with them. If we had as a record of this House that these people did ordinarily attend and pay attention to business, and that they did not merely just turn up when some particular interest came up in which they were concerned; if we had a record that they attended to their business over the period of office which they have had there might be some reason at any rate to give them an extension of the period in which their action would be without review in this matter.  But having regard to the fact that a certain number apparently hardly attend at all and that the average of them do not make even a reasonable attempt to do the very small amount of work that apparently comes their way, then if the lowest possible limit the period during which they can disregard their duties and treat with contempt the functions to which they were appointed and the Dáil which they are apparently appointed to supervise and control and delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we have the President here, in relation to this and other Bills, saying <Col N="25" /> that they have to introduce for these gentlemen a compensation for disturbance in the vested interest, which this House is engaged in extending, in their power to interfere with and delay legislation of this House it is time, and more than time, that we reduced the period of their office to the smallest possible limit. Nine years has been proposed, six years has been proposed.  How about three years?  Why three years on their record of non-attendance?  Why three years or two years or one year of the continuance of their vested interest as declared by the front bench opposite, in the power they have to restrict and restrain the activities of this House?  Why should they have nine years?  Why should they have twelve years?  Why should they have vested interest for one single minute in the power to hold up for twenty and, if they are sufficiently ingenious, nearly thirty months the legislation of this House?  Why should they be given a period of office which would enable them, by picking a particular moment during the lifetime of the Dáil, to sterilise completely the activities of the Dáil unless and until they had forced the people to dissolve?  Personally I think it is an outrageous thing that a House so constituted, claiming through the mouth of the President a vested interest and a right to compensation for disturbance of vested interest in their power to interfere with this House and to delay its legislation, should be given this office.  I for one will vote for the shortest period that anyone has the face to propose as the period of office in the other House.</P>

      <P>We have got a great lecture, lasting about seven, eight, nine or ten minutes, and one could conclude nothing else from it than that the person who gave it is a man of remarkable ability and capacity. But what are the facts?  This is a measure which reduces the term of office of Senators from twelve to nine years.  That is the measure, and the Party opposite were disposed to oppose it the last time it was here until I informed them what it was, and, having explained it so clearly that they quite understood that it was a reduction in <Col N="26" /> the period of office from twelve to nine years, they said: &ldquo;Yes; we like that. We would like it better if it were six years, and we would like it better still if it were three years.&rdquo;  The Deputy who has spoken could have made a better speech if he had put down an amendment to reduce the period from nine to six years, but he did not do so. He either forgot or was incapable of doing so, and he is constrained to vote for a period of nine instead of twelve years.</P>

      <P>Fortunately or unfortunately, the Rules of the House give an opportunity of talking three times in Committee.  That was one of the reasons why I deprived the House, with that haste which is unusual with me, for seven minutes of the pleasure of hearing the oration which has received great commendation from my temporary colleague in Cork.  The fact of the matter is, An Dáil or Peadar Doyle, it does not matter the toss of a coin what we put down.  From our experience of this House and of the debates on this Bill it does not matter the toss of a coin what argument we put forward. All we have to do is to deal with the majority which introduces these Bills and slings them at the head of the House without reason, without justification, without argument.  Any amendment that was offered when it was not ruled out was blown out by the majority.  Will the President say that it would make the slightest difference if we brought forward an amendment for a three-year period?  Is he not fooling, or trying to fool, us and is he not making a mistake in attempting to try fooling on his colleague from Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not what I do, it is not what I know, it is not what I neglect, which matters.  It is the three men from Trinity College.  It is the indication of appreciation.  It is the men bankrupt of intelligence, bankrupt of initiative&mdash; very useful in relation to a series of legislation which abandons the initiative. It is those people&mdash;Deputy Cooper.  That is the thing that matters. It is not whether I put down an amendment or not.  Why should I waste the valuable paper and printing of this House by putting down an amendment which might just as well be left in my <Col N="27" /> portfolio at home?  He knows it.  He is just fooling.  That is the plain English of it.  Look back over the whole of this discussion and ask yourselves if there has been any honest attempt, any pretence of attempt, by the President or any man on his bench to justify by argument the whole body of these Bills which they have thrown out.  What justification has been offered to any of you&mdash;except Peadar Doyle?  What justification, what evidence, what argument except &ldquo;we have the majority&rdquo;?  Is not that argument overwhelimingly strong against me wasting my time in writing down an amendment which not An Dáil but Peadar Doyle will decide?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if I am to answer the casual interruptions, the little odd contributions to the discussion on constitutional questions which we get from the President, they ought to be intelligible.  I do not expect them to be intelligent.  We ought to be able to hear what he says to the Chair.  It is not a private conversation, and if he has any answer to make to what I have said, that the question is not whether I should have put down an amendment but whether it was any use, having regard to our experience of the contempt with which the President and his body have treated the House in relation to the whole of these Constitution Amendment Bills, he ought to have said it in a way which could be heard.  He knows as well as I, everyone in the House knows, that it is waste of time for us to attempt to amend this thing because this is part of the foolish, bad and corrupt bargain which has been made by the President and the other House by which, in consideration of the fact that they allow in certain ways their vested interests in interfering with the <Col N="28" /> liberty and authority of this House to be interfered with, he will give them definite compensation.  He could not do it if he tried.  He told us himself&mdash; we did not invent the phrase.  He came here and told us that that House ought to receive compensation.  He got up and told us that it was not in money&mdash; an amazing sort of interruption that was intelligible though it was thoroughly unintelligent.  You are dealing in all these Bills with a bargain between the President of the Executive Council of the Free State and certain forces in this country which govern and control the President of the Executive Council of the Free State.  It is waste of time for us to put down amendments which will be beaten simply by a majority and which will not be tackled by argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the second explanation we have heard as to why an amendment to reduce the term of office from nine to six years has not been put down.  It is perfectly clear now why the Deputy did not put it down.  It is getting clearer every time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already pointed out our objection on Second Reading to this particular aspect.  We have said that no argument has been put forward by the speakers who spoke on the last occasion as to why the period of nine years should be kept.  If you look at the period of office in other countries where there are Senates, you find, for example, that the United States has a period of only six years, that in Belgium Senators have a period of office of only four years, in the Netherlands a period of six years, in Australia a period of six years, and in New Zealand a period of seven years. We made out a positive case for having the period not more than six, but, as Deputy Flinn has pointed out, seeing the attitude of the Executive on this matter, there is very little use in going to the trouble of putting down an amendment to a Bill of this kind, particularly where the moment you change the period you have a whole lot of consequential changes that would also have to be worked out.  It is quite obvious that people are not going to go to the trouble of working out these consequential <Col N="29" /> changes when they know that they are talking to the air, that the Executive have made up their minds that they are going to push this thing through as they did other Bills without any reason behind it except that it is their policy.  No other reason has been given to us.</P>
      <P>We are quite prepared to formulate and put down an amendment on the Report Stage fixing the period at six years.  I hope that we will get for that the support of those who want reason in this thing and who are not satisfied with the statement simply that it is the policy of the Executive.  As I have said the reason why six years was considered a fair period was given on Second Reading, and it should not be necessary to stress it at this stage.  Why a longer period than six years should have been selected we do not know. We understand, of course, that it gives a certain amount of conservatism and continuity of office, etc., but there are serious objections to it which we pointed out.  Not one of these objections has been met.  Our position in regards to this Bill is exactly what it was.  We intend definitely to vote against this section, even though our opposition would appear to be throwing the period back to twelve years.  We will at least do this.  We will not allow this particular thing to go in this particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly clear now.  Deputy Flinn has been overruled by his Leader, who says that he will put down a motion on the Report Stage.  That is at least an advance on the attitude of saying that it is stupid to argue against this Bill while attempting to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely convinced, speaking for myself, that there is every reason and every justification for the shortening of the existing period of office of Senators and for a shortening of the period laid down in this section of the Bill.  I took the liberty of asking, although I was not quite sure whether I was entitled to it, for certain information regarding the <Col N="30" /> manner in which the Seanad had discharged its work for the past three years.  That information was declined and I was forced into the position of having to spend several hours yesterday going through the official records of the Seanad in order to satisfy myself of the efforts these people have made in the past three years to justify their existence and the existence of the Seanad.  I find that there were 103 meetings since the last Seanad election and the number of hours devoted to work of national importance was 274. In other words, the average length of the Seanad meetings held during that time was two hours and thirty-nine minutes.  For the work performed the taxpayers of the State have had to find £74,390.  Assuming that every Senator attended at each of the 103 meetings which were held, which is not the case, the taxpayers would have to pay each Senator at the rate of £4 10s. per hour. We know that every Senator was not present at the meetings that were held during that period and that the average attendance was actually forty out of sixty members for the three years.  On that basis the payment of Senators would appear to be £6 15s. per hour.  I am satisfied that the taxpayers, as far as my constituency is concerned at any rate, are not prepared to stand that nonsense any longer.  Speaking for myself.  I am in favour of a Second Chamber, but I am not prepared to state here and now the type of Chamber which I would be prepared to support.  I am prepared to stand for a revisionary Second Chamber with a right to initiate legislation. The Seanad has a right of initiating legislation under the present Constitution, but they have made no attempt whatever to do it or to discuss matters in that Assembly which might educate the electors of the country by trying to get the mind of the country on to questions of national importance. That is due absolutely to the type of men you have in that Chamber, and I am therefore in favour of shortening the existing period of office to the very minimum so that we may in the future get into that Chamber a type of men who will do honour to the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was receiving its Second Reading in the House I made a very valuable suggestion which I thought the Government might have adopted.  I suggested that instead of Section 3 of this Bill, as it now appears, they should merely insert a clause to the effect that the manner in which the Seanad election of 1928 would be carried out would be determined by law and then have inserted in the Seanad Electoral Bill or some other Act the necessary provisions to make that possible.  If they had done that they would have saved themselves a very considerable amount of trouble into which I think they are now walking. In the first place, it is a rather extraordinary procedure to adopt the necessary sections in the Constitution which have only a very temporary importance and which will become obsolete after the expiration of a few months. For those who profess they have any respect for the Constitution it is a particularly extraordinary procedure because it will mean that in time that document would become of interest only to historians who are anxious to find out the particular steps which the Government took, from time to time, to preserve the continuity of their existence. But in the section as it now appears here certain provisions are made and to any person who examines these provisions, even casually, there will appear at once to be consequences which are not provided for.  In paragraph (a) for example it is stated &ldquo;the first five members so elected shall hold office for nine years.&rdquo;  Then the second Section provides so many of the members so elected after such first five members as are necessary to fill additional vacancies because of the death, resignation or disqualification of Senators who are due to retire in the year 1937 shall also hold office for nine years.  The next five, however, shall only hold office for six years.  There is an important distinction between <Col N="34" /> these two classes and it is important to provide that there shall be no confusion as to what successful candidates were or were not amongst the first five.  I thought that provision would be made in the Seanad Electoral Bill or some other measure to ensure for example that in the event of an equality of votes between the fifth and sixth candidate some machinery would be devised to distinguish the fifth from the sixth.</P>

      <P>I would be very glad. I have searched carefully the Bill and found no provision which meets the situation adequately, and the same applies to Section 5.  The machinery set up to distinguish between the candidates who got an equality of first preference votes and who would be tying for either the first fifth or the second fifth seat is not adequate, and there is going to be confusion.  We think that this particular section, particularly in the manner in which it appears here, is an indication, as is also the next section, of the hasty and ill-considered manner in which the Government produced these Bills.  It would be much better from the point of view of the Government and the Dáil and, I might add, from the point of view of the Constitution, if what I have suggested on the Second Reading was adopted, and if the Government are prepared to adopt it now we are prepared to facilitate them and let them withdraw the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is slightly exaggerating when he states that the Bill was hastily prepared. This was certainly one of the most technical sections of all the Constitution (Amendment) Bills which have been introduced, and it is absolutely watertight.  As the Deputy knows, the number of vacancies normally arising under the present system is fifteen at each triennial period.  Under this system twenty would go out triennially, having a nine-year <Col N="35" /> term of office.  Fifteen are already in office for nine years, having been elected in 1924, and having a twelve years' term of office.  They were elected for twelve years.  In order to fit in the new arrangement of the nine five have got to be added to the fifteen so entitled by the election of 1924 to run for a term of office of twelve years, and no interference was made in connection with that particular point.  So down along the fitting in of the next period is so arranged that those who had a six years' period can be added to the number so as to allow twenty to go out in the following election and then twenty are left for nine years hence.  It is obvious that while in ordinary circumstances one might not like to have the Constitution burdened with such an amount of detail, as a matter of historical knowledge and accuracy it is advisable that the thing should be stated plainly and distinctly so that there may not be any possible misunderstanding of the position.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matter that the Deputy touched upon, Section 13, sub-section (2) of the Seanad Electoral Bill will settle the point with regard to the possibility of two persons having an equal number of votes.  That, however, falls for consideration when that matter comes up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have assumed, rightly or wrongly, that my colleague, Deputy Lemass, is a moderately reasonable and intelligent man, reasonably capable of reading a Bill and of understanding it. The fact that he is in the position that he is means that not merely his colleagues, but a very great body of people in this country think the same of him, that he is reasonably competent, perhaps something more than averagely reasonably competent.  Yet we have the fact that making an honest attempt to understand this Bill he does not clearly understand it.  I do not want to speak of my own interpretation. I am in the same position as Deputy Lemass, and I find it very difficult to bring the drafting of this Bill within the definition which the President predicated for drafting Bills in relation to <Col N="36" /> Constitution matters, that they should be so pellucidly clear that there could be no doubt or misunderstanding as to their meaning.  We are not by any means satisfied that an attempt has been made to make these Bills as clear as they could have been made.  We had the example in relation to the people who were to elect the Seanad.  It was possible to put the qualifications of those who were actually going to elect in this case from the Seanad in language which was unmistakable.</P>
      <P>And yet apparently they deliberately chose that.  I do not think it was mere casual idleness and neglect&mdash;they apparently deliberately chose to put that particular Bill in such a form that it was certainly not easy for the ordinarily intelligent man to find out what it meant.  I say quite sincerely in this House that if I had not had in my hands the report of the Committee which went into the constitutional changes and the recommendations of that Committee, and unless I presumed that the Bill as they drafted it was intended to carry out those recommendations, I would not have known who it was was going to elect those people. What I am suggesting to the House quite plainly is that there is a lot of loose drafting in these Bills.  You have cases now before the Court in connection with the Licensing Act, an Act drafted by the Minister for Justice. That Act was very carefully considered apparently, and yet it now turns out that the Act was so badly drafted and is so unintelligible, so controversial as to its obvious meaning, that your own judges are differing as to its meaning, and you are having the District Justices in one case sending up one licensed house for removal compensation and holding themselves estopped under that Act from sending up more.  Assuming for a moment that you disregard the intelligence of the ordinary member of Fianna Fáil during the reading of these Bills, your own judges, the people whom you appoint to interpret the law, professional interpreters of the law, are being offered laws so badly drafted that they are in definite antagonism to each other as to the meaning of this legislation.  You have a judge saying: &ldquo;I will do a certain thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to draw Deputy Lemass's attention to Article 82 of the Constitution, where I think he will find under sub-section (d) it is mentioned that a certain number of Senators shall hold office for a term of three, six, nine and twelve years.  That is in the Constitution, and obviously there is an alteration being made which is putting it perfectly clear as to the number who will hold office for nine years.  That is perhaps the main reason why this Bill is drafted as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the President has not understood the trend of my remarks.  It is probably my fault.  I can quite understand the necessity for a procedure of this kind in order to get over the intervening period in the period of their term of office of the newly-elected Senators. What I do say is, there is no adequate provision in the Seanad Electoral Bill to ensure that under any conceivable circumstances there will not be a doubt as to who is to constitute the first five members elected.  It is quite possible under the Seanad Electoral Bill in its present form that there may be ground for dispute as to whether the person elected sixth, seventh or eighth may be elected for nine years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our intention to oppose the passing of this resolution. The resolution asks us to declare that it is expedient to authorise the charge upon the Central Fund of any expenses required in connection with the Act to regulate the election of members to Seanad Eireann.  It has been frequently discussed in this House whether or not there should be in existence a Second Chamber.  I do not intend to deal at any length with that question now. The question we are asked to decide is whether or not it is expedient to vote out of public funds the money required to keep that Second Chamber in existence, and we as Deputies, answering that question according to our conscience, have to say it is not.  The sum of £400 mentioned by the President as being the outside figure which the conduct of these elections will require is a matter of minor importance.  What is of major importance is the fact that by continuing to elect members to the Seanad every time a vacancy occurs in the membership of that body we are keeping the Seanad in existence, and the cost of that to the people cannot be reckoned as a sum of £200 or £400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had very interesting figures given to us to-day by Deputy Davin, which he compiled at considerable labour and at great personal risk, because in order to procure these figures he had, as he told us, to read through the reports of the meetings of the Seanad for the last three years, and the risk to his sanity perhaps which was involved in that operation was not inconsiderable. <Col N="45" /> But, as a result of his courage and labours, he produced very interesting figures&mdash;figures which will help some Deputies to appreciate much more keenly than they do at present the fundamental reasons for the opposition to the Seanad which exists in this country.  The Seanad costs a considerable sum.  Deputy Davin has estimated that it costs us the sum of £6 15s. 0d. for every hour which each member of the Seanad spends at the meetings of that body.  That is a rate of payment far in excess, I am sure, of anything which great captains of industry in this or any other country receive.  It is a rate of payment even far in excess of what we give to the Executive Ministers of the State.  These Ministers have from time to time professed to believe that the Seanad is a useful institution and that Senators were an ornament, if of no other use to the State.  They will find it hard to justify the remuneration of these Senators at that rate.</P>
    <P>The President, of course, tried to forestall this argument by telling us that a very small sum was in question in this resolution.  Those who have read the resolution and realise its significance know that the sum required is one which this country is not in a position to pay year after year. There was a question on the Order Paper to-day with reference to the money available for the relief of unemployment during this year, and the Minister for Finance informed us that a sum of £32,000 was provided in the Estimates for that purpose.  £32,000 to provide for the relief of unemployment and double that sum to provide for the existence of the Seanad! If the ordinary plain people of the country were asked to give expression to their opinion as to whether the money which is being now utilised to maintain the Seanad could not be better utilised to provide relief for the unemployed there would be no doubt as to what their answer would be.  Knowing that that is the feeling of the people, and that the financial position of the country is such that we would not be justified in continuing to expend money for a luxury purpose&mdash;and the Seanad is no more than a luxury&mdash;we are going to oppose this resolution, and we hope that Deputies who like to fool <Col N="46" /> their constituents into the belief that they stand for economy in public administration will take this opportunity of making good their promises by supporting our attitude concerning it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, with his usual accuracy in matters of finance, has told us that this thing is going to cost something between £200 and £400. Deputy Lemass has told us that the existence of the Seanad costs somewhere about £76,000.  I am not concerned for the moment either with the £76,000 or with the £400.  I am concerned with the fact that we are going to elect 19 men, whom we do not need to elect, by this means; that we are going to pay them in salaries alone £360 for doing nothing but to maintain a vested interest and the right to interfere with the legislation of this House. £200 or £400 says the President.  £7,000 is the fact.  The proportion of £400 to £7,000 is just about the ordinary proportion of the truth that you will find in any financial statement made on the benches opposite.  We have not got, after all the efforts we have made, and after Deputy Davin had gone to a great deal of trouble&mdash;I saw the figures which he had; elaborate and difficult work it was&mdash;how much attendance these bright boys give up there. Two hours and thirty-nine minutes! The hours I spend &ldquo;with thee, dear Seanad,&rdquo; are nearly two and a half. This Seanad costs between £250 and £300 an hour for salaries alone for every hour it meets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is time the country knew that the Seanad which we are going to elect has, under this precious Constitution and with its precious sense of responsibilities for its duties, cost between £250 and £300 an hour for salaries alone for every hour it sat.  I do not think the people understand that.  There is an illusion that this country is a very rich country.  It must be if it can pay £250 an hour for every hour of that kind of service that it gets.  Why should we now, when we have an opportunity of not doing it, insist upon contracting for the future for £7,000 expenditure per annum for the maintenance of this thing?  Personally, I cannot see why.  I think this financial resolution ought to be refused. <Col N="47" /> Remember that financial resolutions and what you do with them constitute the whole control of this House.  Let this House exercise proper and intimate control over every financial resolution and it does not matter twopence halfpenny what other legislation comes from the body sitting upon the benches opposite.  Refuse this resolution and refuse all financial resolutions that are concerned in this matter and you break up this miserable conspiracy to deform and degrade the Constitution of this country into the instrument of a Party caucus.  You have an opportunity here in this Bill. You hear of £400 and £200, the fact being that you are really arranging to pay £7,000 a year in salaries alone which you need not pay.</P>
    <P>And that is not the whole of the expense.  Why should we contract to do it?  Will the addition of 20 members to the Seanad make any difference which will matter?  Assume that it went on with its present forty, would it be any better or any worse? You may, no doubt, infiltrate five or six intelligent people into it, but they will be utterly overwhelmed by the votes of the majority of those already sent there for the purpose for which they were sent there.  Does it matter?  Just envisage two Seanads, one of 60 members and one of 40.  Will its Constitution be altered in such a significant manner as to justify this increase of expenditure by £7,000 a year which you can save?  Are there not any better purposes in Ireland to which we could put this £7,000 a year?  Is this the best use we can make of it, not to speak of £400 or £200 token amount which is used for the purpose of starting again this instrument of extravagance? Are you getting value for your £7,000?  Let us assume, for the moment, that you are getting some value for your expenditure upon the 40 Senators.  Are these other 19 that you are sending back going to make such a brilliant difference?  Even if the whole lot were good men, they could not vote down the vested interests that the President is so anxious not to disturb and whose right of <Col N="48" /> tenure, whether 12 or 15 or 20 years, he introduced Bills to safeguard.</P>
    <P>Is the Seanad going to be bettered by the introduction of these nineteen new members?  Why not leave it at 40?  Leaving out altogether the question of what their powers are and whether they are right or wrong&mdash;these we will deal with at the proper time, and if they are not dealt with properly then they will be dealt with properly again&mdash;why 60 members?  Why pass this Bill that enables you to have 60 when you have 40?  What value are you to get?  The issue you will have to decide when you vote for the £400 or £200 resolution is: are you getting value for £7,000 a year which you do not need to spend?  Have you no better purpose to put your £7,000 than this purpose?  A question was asked to-day as to money for relief of unemployment. We were told we could not have it&mdash;and I think this is a very strong reason&mdash;because it would have to be balanced by the introduction of a Money Bill to provide additional taxation to that amount.  If the effort you are now starting on, to spend this £7,000, is stopped by the rejection of this resolution, then you will have £7,000 which will not have to be raised by taxation and which can be used for one of the two, three, or five hundred other purposes which any man of intelligence in this House can see is more important than that of raising the Seanad from 40 to 60 members.</P>

      <P>This resolution is to authorise the expenditure of something like £200 of a minimum and £400 of a maximum sum instead of the system of election which has been in operation until these amendments of the Constitution came into the Dáil.  That is the matter we have got to consider, and not all the rubbish to which we have just listened.  This is a limitation of public moneys, a much more economical and business-like method of dealing with the matter.  This is carrying out a recommendation made by a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad, which the Fianna Fáil members voted <Col N="49" /> for and which ever since they have tried to get out of.  Election by the people is undesirable.  That is what they subscribed to, notwithstanding all the thunder, noise and denunciation which we have heard.  That is what was subscribed to by Fianna Fáil members when the Committee considered this matter.  This Bill is one of a series carrying out recommendations of the Joint Committee, and the expense saved is considerable.  The expense of a triennial election is, I suppose, about £40,000.  The Seanad register costs between £2,000 and £4,000; the cost now will be between £200 and £400, and yet we have been told through all the thunder and noise to which we have listened that that is bad business.</P>

      <P>We know the President's method well.  He picks up some irrelevant little point, gets up, and is humorously impertinent, and irrelevant. He gets away with it and has been getting away with it because he always talks last.  Just as he has attempted <Col N="50" /> in this case to do, he has been able to prevent people from examining his little irregularities and his impudent irrelevancies.  You have had a case of that now.  He did exactly what I tell you and, though an ordinary and unassuming private member in Opposition, meek and shy, was attempting to exercise the rights which he has under the rules, the President attempted to bluff that innocent and shy member and this House into the idea that that member had no right to do what that innocent and shy member, in his ignorance of the rules, thought he had a right to do.</P>
      <P>The President says that it is a question of saving £40,000.  It is not a question of saving £40,000.  You must be expected or you are always supposed to intend the reasonable consequences that follow from any act.  You are always expected to intend to avoid the reasonable consequence of not doing any act which you might avoid.  Now the reasonable consequence, the inevitable consequence, of passing this resolution is that £7,000 of salaries in the Seanad, which will not be paid if this is not passed, will be paid.  Will the impudent irrelevancies meet that? Will they say it is not true?  Will they say that if we do not pass this resolution, they will be able to spend that £40,000 on an election without introducing special legislation to upset the legislation which they have introduced in this Bill?  They will have legislation in relation to the election of the Seanad, and they will have no means of carrying out and financing it unless they play some hoofling trick with the finances and come to the House for a Bill of Indemnity afterward for their financial misconduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the direct issue and it is not the slightest use for the President to try to side-track the issue.  He is asking you to do an act which would involve you in an expenditure of £7,000 a year, which, if you do not do that act, you will not be involved in.  Of course, that is trying to misrepresent the action of Fianna Fáil on the Committee, that impartial Committee, that utterly unpacked and judicial Committee which dealt with the Constitution <Col N="51" /> of the Seanad and those other Bills.  He did not tell you that what Fianna Fáil were out to see was that not merely £7,000, but £76,000 would be saved.  He did not tell you that by loading that Committee with an equal representation from the Seanad and his own nominees from this House he had made it impossible for us to save this £76,000, that he had made it impossible for us to say that that Seanad should not be elected at all.  He did not say that.  He knows it, and he chooses to misrepresent it, and the closed valve of his Press will keep from the people the fact that he is deliberately misrepresenting to this House in relation to a matter which he did know.</P>
    <P>When you cannot do a thing which you want to do, you may have to choose between different alternatives and you may have to choose between lesser evils.  Every vote that was given by Fianna Fáil members on that Commission was a choice between lesser evils, and I think we are faced by the fact that the interested representation of <Col N="52" /> the Seanad and the representation of Cumman na nGaedheal on that Commission were sufficient to prevent any useful or proper decision being taken by it.</P>
    <P>Now come back to the issue again. You are asked to do an act, the direct and inevitable consequence of which will be that £7,000 a year, which would not be otherwise expended, will have to be expended on salaries alone, in the Seanad.  I am asking you to refuse to pass a motion which, if you refuse to pass it, will mean that unless they hoofle with the finances of the House, unless they do something behind the backs of the House and come back afterwards with their machined majority to get through an Act of Indemnity to cover their financial hoofles, will make it impossible for them to put on you that charge of £7,000 a year. £400 is the maximum! One capital sum, £7,000, is an annual sum.  That is the amount of the gross and the deliberate misrepresentation of the financial facts which was offered by the President in his very impudent speech.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add, at the end of sub-section (1)  the words &ldquo;and who shall be either the Registration Officer at the time being for the University Constituency of the National University of Ireland or the Registration Officer at the time being for the University Constituency of Dublin University.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down to enable the House to express its opinion upon the proposal contained in the Bill. It appears to us that of the many extraordinary things in this Bill, the section which deals with the appointment of the returning officer is easily the most extraordinary.  It is laid down here that the returning officer for the Seanad election shall be appointed by the Minister.  I think I referred to this matter during the Second <Col N="55" /> Reading.  It is a bad principle.  You have in this election a very limited number of voters of whom the Minister is one.  You have political parties contending for success at this election and the Minister is a very important member of one of those parties.  When, therefore, we find in this Bill a proposal to give that Minister, who is a voter in the election, who is a partisan in respect of the candidates nominated and who has a very direct party interest in the result of the election, the power of appointing the returning officer we think that proposal is unsound and wrong and that there should be a restriction placed upon that power. The restriction which it is suggested in the amendment should be placed upon that power, is that there should be specified a number of persons occupying suitable positions from amongst whom the Minister must make a selection.  I suggested, for example, that the returning officer for the borough constituencies of Dublin or the returning officer for the county constituency of Dublin would be a suitable person to appoint.  I suggest in this amendment that the registration officer either for the National University or the Dublin University should be appointed. It would not be possible to suggest the appointment of the returning officers for the University constituencies as they are not persons who would be free to come in and take up work of this kind.  The actual work as far as I have been able to ascertain in connection with elections for these constituencies is done by the registration officers and they would be persons with considerable experience of the manner in which elections by postal voting are carried out and that is the method suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think to leave it to the Minister's absolute discretion to appoint any person whom he may as returning officer is a bad principle.  Remember there is no restriction whatever on his power, nothing in this Bill which prevents him appointing as a returning officer a person who may himself be a candidate for this election, nothing to prevent him appointing, say, the General Secretary of Cumann na nGaedheal as returning officer for this election.  We believe the <Col N="56" /> system suggested in the amendment is a better alternative and will give the Minister for Local Government the right to make the appointment, but it says that the person whom he appoints will be one of the following, and we suggest that the following be the registration officer of either of the University constituencies, or I would not object if it were proposed to include the returning officer for any of the Dublin constituencies.  We think, however, that the confidence which voters would have in the secrecy of the ballot and the conduct of the election would be much greater if that suggestion were adopted than if the Bill goes through as it stands.</P>

He asks that a man should be appointed at the dictate of the governing body of the National University, the President over which is the political leader of his own Party, who will be rather a strong politician, but not saddled with statutory responsibilities, which are those of a Minister or a person nominated by <Col N="57" /> the governing body of the Dublin University, a body presided over by certainly an absentee, a person who, as far as I know, walks into the position in an automatic way, but actually as far as we are concerned here, an absentee. The Deputy may have introduced this amendment simply for purposes of discussion of this proposal.  If he suggests that he intends his amendment seriously, I am hardly prepared to believe him.  The proposal in the Bill is that the Minister made statutorily responsible for the administration of those elections will be the person who will appoint the returning officer.  I submit in carrying out that responsibility that he should do it on his own initiative and not be subject to the guidance of any other body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that if he thought twice he would not have spoken against this amendment in the manner he did. The fact that the registration officer of the National University is appointed by a body the chairman of which is a person who is interested in political matters does not arise.  I know that, for example, the returning officer of the constituency of which I am a member is one of the keenest politicians in this country, but he is also one of the fairest returning officers.  The registration officer is appointed for the specific reason by the governing body of these universities.  We permit the Vice-Chancellor of the National University and Provost of the Dublin University to act as a returning officer at the election of members to the Dáil, and every argument advanced by the Minister could be advanced against that, and surely the election of members of the Dáil is as important as of members of the Seanad.  The objection to the proposal in that Bill is that the Minister appoints an individual for the specific purposes of conducting the particular election in which whoever may be Minister at the time will undoubtedly have a very keen interest, and whether or not there is any possibility of the present Minister for Local Government using the power given to him wrongly, this section does undoubtedly leave the way open to the possibility of corrupt practice at some <Col N="58" /> time in the future, and as such we think it should be amended.  If the amendment of mine is not considered suitable, perhaps the Minister will indicate on what lines he would consider an amendment to be suitable.  As far as I am concerned, I want to see it provided that there shall not be given to the Minister for Local Government, whoever he may be at the time, absolute discretion in the appointment of a returning officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that is the point.  Here is an attack by the Minister for Local Government upon that body because it has got an absentee automatic and that same Government is standing over paying grants to these people and grants which are not paid relatively to other universities.  I put down a question some time ago asking where a sum of money was spent.  It was beautifully covered up.  It took a long time to find it out, but it went to one of these universities which has been truthfully or untruthfully characterised in this manner by the Minister for Local Government.  Deputy Lemass has said that this particular clause lays open the road to corruption.  I am going to put it much stronger than that.  If the declarations which have been made from those front benches in relation to these Constitution Bills and the rights of minorities under these Constitution Bills and in relation to the amendment and changing of them are correct, then I say not merely does it open out the road to corruption, but we have a direct intimation that that road to corruption will be followed.  A Minister upon those benches told us that what we would get would be our minimum of right, no more and no less. The full exercise of all powers that <Col N="59" /> they had and which their majority gives to them under the Constitution they would use, and we would not come crawling, mewling and asking ad misericordium for something more. They, the strong men, the upright and honest men, told us if a thing was put into a Bill by a majority which gave them a power to do a certain thing they would do that certain thing.  Do they deny that?  They can look up the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the most amazing statement I ever heard coming from men professing any constitutionalism in the ordinary way in relation to minorities. Those people went out of their way to say that &ldquo;the minimum&rdquo;&mdash;that was their own phrase, I was astonished to hear&mdash;exercise of right and nothing more but the minimum exercise of right, would be allowed the minority. Unless they were lying in this, they were deliberately misrepresenting their attitude in relation to this Constitution. They may have been telling us something they would do which they did not intend to do, but they have told us that they would use this power to do a corrupt thing which they have power to do and which we know has been done.  You can remember a series of instances given in this House in relation to what happened before elections. A road was to be finished before an election, but a man who was Chairman of Cumann na nGaedheal and who had no interest in that road, because there was an election coming on, by a little bit of manoeuvre arranged that the job could be made to last for ten weeks.  That was the evidence which was produced, and that was the evidence with the production of which the President interfered as much as he possibly could.  That is the record of these people.  You had the same story here, from another member of these benches, of ten cases within five miles, where there was a corrupt misuse of public funds for the purpose of indications of appreciation to the servants of Cumann na Gaedheal.  Those people have taken to themselves deliberately the power to do this corrupt thing, and they have told this House that any power they have we must envisage them using, because they have said that <Col N="60" /> our rights were going to be the minimum.  Either they said what was false or they were showing just that little spurious courage of the forcibly feeble, or they meant it and they were telling the truth from those benches when they told us in advance that every power they had under any legal straining of the law they would use against the minority and for the majority.  They have declared that if they had the power legally to do a corrupt thing they would do it.  They have taken the power legally to do a corrupt thing and this House is entitled to assume, and bound to assume, that they intend to do it.</P>

      <P>I rise to correct two mistakes.  I think I had better correct them by categorical statements. No member of the governing body of Trinity College, Dublin, is an absentee. The body no doubt to which the Minister referred is the Senate, which is not the governing body in that sense at all, and does not correspond in many ways to the Senates of other universities. There is no member of the governing body who is an absentee.  The second statement that I wish to correct has reference to the grants.  In the Estimates for this year, for instance, there is no money in the form of a grant to Trinity College, Dublin.  There is a sum of £3,000 paid in accordance with the Land Act of 1923 as compensation for losses accruing due to the operations of that Act, but there is no definite sum in the form of a grant to the university.  I think, in view of the statements made, it is important that these two points should be made clear.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy Thrift's remarks, perhaps I did make a mistake in equating the Senate of the Dublin University with the Senate of the National University, and, therefore, I withdraw the suggestion. A propos of the suggestion, I would have thought, at any rate from some of the speeches we have heard on the Seanad and on certain sections of the Seanad, that the Party on the opposite side would not be prepared to allow the governing body of the Dublin University to nominate a Returning Officer for the Seanad election.</P>

      <P>Some time or other, perhaps, the day will come when Deputy Flinn will be Minister for Finance in a Government elected by Fianna Fáil.  On that occasion it may be the misfortune of the Minister for Local Government and the President to sit on one of the benches now occupied by Deputy Flinn and his Party.  When that day comes, if it ever does come&mdash; what I say may be due to a foggy outlook on my part&mdash;perhaps a discussion on a Bill of this kind will be brought forward by the Local Government Minister who is fathering this Bill to-day, and he will be saying probably the same thing about Deputy Flinn as Deputy Flinn is now saying of him.</P>

      <P>It may be due to my foggy outlook when I say that day may come.  To come back to the question at issue, I must say I was surprised to hear Deputy Lemass say that he would stick to the same view in case postal voting was abolished.  I take it that the returning officer in this case will be a civil servant, who will, perhaps, be a man of very high standard, a man, perhaps, who was responsible for the conduct of the last Seanad election and, as for as my knowledge and the knowledge of my Party is concerned, he conducted that election in a manner befitting the position he occupied and the trust reposed in him by the people who appointed him.  Now, whether postal voting be the system or whether the voting be here in this House, I am prepared to place my trust in that man, believing that he will do the work in <Col N="62" /> as faithful and as conscientious a manner as he did it on the occasion of the last election to the Seanad, when the job was far bigger and was a much more onerous one.</P>

There is a general feeling here that a person politically interested ought not be put in that position. He ought not be put in that very significant position while definitely or partly politically interested.  He ought not be operating.  We are not particular who will be put in.  We are not particular about the machinery you will adopt.  The Minister's own words are that Deputy Lemass has made a suggestion.  We make the suggestion that between now and the Report Stage the Minister will find some party-proof <Col N="63" /> method, reasonable party-proof method, of appointing this man.  The present position is a direct party asset.  There is not the slightest reason to doubt our sincerity in saying that we do not like it.  We do not like that that power should be in the possession either of the Minister's Party or our Party in relation to these elections.

The person the Minister will appoint will naturally be someone responsible for the election section of his Department.  To modify this thing any more would not improve the legislation as drafted, and would not give any of the safeguards that the Deputies are looking for.</P>

      <P>I am sure when the Deputy is at a meeting of his own Party, if he looks round, he will say: &ldquo;The President was right.&rdquo;  This is the usual method in connection with legislation, and all these allegations about corruption come from a mind that is not sufficiently strong to stand the strain of politics.  I hear these allegations from people young in politics, and the louder and the more vehement they are, the greater the change that is after taking place or is likely to take place in the political convictions of the person who makes them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My advice to Deputy Flinn is to take those matters much more easily.  The Deputy should not get excited.  There is a great deal of good in human nature. The fact that the Deputy pretends to think there is corruption in public life shows only that he is convincing himself and not convincing anyone outside. <Col N="65" /> Such statements as the Deputy has made are not contributions to the business of this House; they do not do him or his Party very much credit, and they do not do the country credit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It does the Government no harm.  I can assure the Deputy of that; but I think he knows it already.  If much more of that goes on all the people will say, in my opinion, is &ldquo;God help him.&rdquo;  This particular method of appointing a returning officer is, in my opinion, and in the opinion of the Minister, the best method.  It has been done before, and I think it is in a previous Electoral Act. No question arises of abuse, and if such a question did arise it would not mean that it was a bad system.  There are opportunities for ventilating objections or grievances or any exceptions that might be taken to the person appointed. That is parliamentary government.  I do not know that the Minister would be in a much more happy position if he <Col N="66" /> were to approach either of the two bodies mentioned and ask them to nominate persons.  Why should he not get nominations from both?  If they both nominated how would he make a selection from the two?  Would it be by seniority or suitability for office? Then he is to escape all responsibility in connection with an Act which ought to be an Act for which the administration would be responsible.  The Minister stands over and can be held responsible for anything that takes place in connection with an election carried out in the manner that we advocate.  If the returning officer is appointed in the manner now suggested and anything is subsequently questioned, the Minister can well say: &ldquo;I carried out the appointment in accordance with the law and I have no control over the person appointed.&rdquo;  That would be an unhappy position, not alone for the Minister, but for the House.  I think the appointment by the Minister&mdash;and it is practically inevitable that it would be a civil servant&mdash;is the best and the only proper method of filling the office.</P>

      <P>If the Minister proposes to accept the alteration in the date suggested by Deputy Davin, it will shorten considerably the time for the conduct of the election.  I should like the Minister to indicate, before we go any further, whether or not the suggestion contained in amendment 17, with reference to the declaration of identity&mdash;that is an amendment which frankly compels voters to be in Ireland when recording their votes&mdash;will be accepted.  One of the main reasons why that amendment has been put in is that the provision in the Bill at present really only confers the benefit of voting outside the country on people who happen to be absent in England or France, or some near country.  The right would not be extended to members of the Dáil and Seanad who happened to be absent. say, in the United States or Canada.  If it is now proposed still further to reduce the period which will be available for the conduct of the election, it will also reduce the facilities for voting outside the country.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> This amendment is proposed to deprive retiring Senators of the right to vote for their successors, or as the case may be, and will be, in some cases, to vote for their own re-election.  It is very hard to argue against the proposal in the sub-section when one has not heard the arguments in favour of it. I will listen carefully for any sound reason from any democrat, such as the Minister is supposed to be, in favour of giving these nineteen retiring Senators the right to vote to re-elect themselves. The average attendance in the Seanad for the past three years, taken from the official records of that House, is shown to be something less than forty out of sixty.  The people who have failed to attend or whose names are at the bottom of the attendance list are, in most cases, the nineteen who are about to retire.  I am given to understand, and I am sure the Minister cannot contradict me, that a number of these nineteen retiring Senators do not propose to seek re-election, for reasons best known to themselves.  A considerable number of the nineteen never took any active interest in the work of the Seanad, to which they were nominated by the President or elected by the people three years ago.  As I say, it is difficult to make a case against this proposal, because one cannot understand why such a proposal is brought in.  The point is an important one&mdash; and I hope Deputies, irrespective of Parties, will pay attention to it&mdash;that these nineteen Senators, a small number of whom never have attended the proceedings of the Seanad for the last three years, will have the right to send two of their selection back to the Seanad again.  If nineteen people vote and act in accordance with the same procedure they have carried out in the last three years, they will possibly return two men who will not attend the Seanad as they did not attend it before. How long are we going to carry on a farce of this kind?  In the words of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; this morning, are we going to put men into the Seanad who will do honour to the nation and honour their own responsibilities to those who put them there?  I shall listen very attentively to the arguments which the Minister will put forward in favour of rushing the Bill, by which it is provided <Col N="74" /> that retiring Senators should have the right to elect their successors or themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's difficulty apparently is to make any case in favour of his own amendment. The provision in the Bill is a provision that could not be modified without going against the Constitution.  I almost feel that the Deputy's amendment is unconstitutional, because the Constitution states that members shall be elected to the Seanad by members of the Dáil and Seanad voting together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution provides that the Senate shall consist of 60 members.  I should have to refer to the Attorney-General as to the point whether if there was no election carried out to fill the different vacancies before the 6th December the Seanad would exist or not.  The Seanad has existed from time to time with a casual vacancy, but whether it could exist with one-third or one-fourth of its membership vacant is a legal point upon which I should not care to give a decision.  If we saddle people with the responsibility of Senators, there is a certain amount of childishness, I suggest, in saying that in reference to a particular election in which they are outgoing members they are not to be allowed to vote for fear that by all joining together it would be possible to return two of the outgoing members again to the Seanad.  I suggest that the person who has given nine years to his duty in the Seanad ought to be particularly qualified to say what kind of person should be put into the Seanad and, perhaps, ought to have a particular qualification to say which two of the outgoing Senators ought to be elected by outgoing Senators voting en bloc, if they so desire.  It is not conceivable that outgoing Senators would club together in this particular way to put themselves into the Seanad, but if they did I think they would be perfectly entitled to do it, and they might give us two very good Senators as a result.  It is a small matter, and the point can hardly be raised for practical <Col N="75" /> purposes to suggest that in our legislation we should exclude outgoing Senators from having a voice in an ensuing Seanad election.</P>

      <P>We intend to sup port Deputy Davin's amendment.  I listened carefully to the Minister for Local Government, wondering what reason he would put forward for giving retiring Senators a voice in the election of their successors.  So far as I could make out, his first argument was that constitutionally we were bound to do it.  That might be an excuse in ordinary circumstances, but when we have a bundle of Constitution Bills before us and when this matter was raised before it gave an opportunity to the Executive of changing the Constitution if they so desired; they cannot excuse themselves on that basis.  They have simply to say that it is their intention to give retiring Senators, whether they attended or not, the right to vote for their successors.  That is their deliberate policy.  Let them stand for it and not pretend that they are forced under the Constitution to have to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not leave the Deputy under a misapprehension in this matter.  I hope that I did not suggest that we were being forced by the Constitution into this particular frame of mind.  The giving to Senators of a vote, apart altogether from the Constitution, is a thing to which we see no reason to object.  We are satisfied that there is no reason why, three or four days before a Seanad election becomes due, you should take from a certain section of Senators rights which their colleagues have.</P>

      <P>Is it not clear that if the election was not rushed and did not take place before the 6th December, the period of office of the nineteen Senators would have expired, and, under the Constitution, they would have no right to vote for their successors or for their own re-election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We may discard the argument about the Constitution. It is one to which we should give no attention.  The Executive, as part of their policy, have deliberately arranged and continue to keep it so that retiring Senators would have a vote.  That point, therefore, does not give any argument so far as meeting Deputy Davin's request for argument is concerned. The Minister said &ldquo;for fear they might join together and elect two Senators.&rdquo;  Is not there very good reason for seeing that they should not join together and prevent it altogether? I hold there is.  I hold with Deputy Davin that because many of these retiring Senators could be proved not to have attended to their business it is wrong to give them a vote in order that they may vote for themselves.  It is also wrong from this point of view, namely, one of our objections to including the Seanad with the Dáil as an electorate is that the Seanad is far more numerous in proportion to the Dáil.  We are only 153, while the Seanad is 60.  Therefore, the Seanad has altogether an unfair proportion of votes.  One of the reasons that I would like to see these 19 or 20 retiring Senators not being allowed to vote is that it would lessen the disproportion which the Seanad would have as compared with the votes of the direct representatives of the people.  Therefore, from the positive point of view of trying to reduce the voting strength of the Seanad, I think that that opportunity should be availed of.  It is a bad principle to allow retiring Senators to vote for themselves.  They are going to be the judges of their own conduct, whereas if they are to be elected by a body other than themselves they will have other people to judge of their conduct. These are some of the points which we have in mind.  I do not believe that the Minister for Local Government has at all met Deputy Davin's request <Col N="77" /> for a positive reason as to why these retiring Senators should have a vote.</P>

      <P>I think a very poor case has been made for this amendment. In the first place, we are always inclined to overlook the fact that a Joint Committee of the two Houses made certain recommendations which, as I have said already this evening, are embodied in certain Bills before the Dáil.  One of the recommendations is this particular one.  The matter was brought up at the Committee as to whether or not outgoing Senators should have a right to vote.  What struck me in connection with that right was that if we were to suppose that outgoing Senators were the wisest men in the country, the most competent and the most honourable, are they going to be returned?  If these 19 Senators gave excellent service to the country during their term of office, and if they were the best men in the country, would they be returned?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I would still have this view with regard to a Second House.  Not once have the Deputies on either the Labour Benches or the Fianna Fáil Benches told us what their view would be under ideal conditions as regards a Second House.  I have heard complaints being made about non-attendance.  The Senator who perhaps has erred most in that respect is a very old friend of mine.  He was one of my nominees to the Seanad.  He was unfortunately in rather indifferent health when appointed, and his number of attendances was perhaps the lowest. From my knowledge of him, I know him very nearly twenty years, I consider that he would be one of the best qualified persons in the country to mark a ballot paper, and he would not do it from any political motive.  He would not be guided by political affiliations in marking it.  It is one of the disadvantages of being in a small introspective Party that outside the walls of that Party we cannot see.  Deputies opposite do not know that type of person, but on more than one occasion he was a very real bulwark for national interests in this country, although he never belonged to any political party in the country.  To say that outgoing Senators should be deprived of the right of voting at this election, in my opinion, is really a sharp trick, although I believe Deputy Davin never intended it as such.  The Seanad consists of 60 members.  Members of the Dáil are not precluded from voting for themselves if they happen to live in the constituency which they represent. They are reproducing themselves <Col N="79" /> according to what we have heard.  It is all right as long as you do it outside for yourself, but to do it for anybody else is another proposition altogether.</P>

      <P>One evening when I was distributing words of wisdom here the Leas-Cheann Comhairle interrupted me and said that I was not to go into the history of the country or into the reorganisation of the national institutions of the country.  I think I told Deputies on more than one occasion that circumstances prevented that regular and ideal organisation which ought to have come about.  One effort was made when the Seanad was in course of construction on the first occasion to make some attempt, at any rate, in that direction.  Not many of the members of the Seanad, of the original nominees, are left.  The fact of these nineteen members having the right to vote would affect I do not believe the election of two members.  From my examination, I think, it would take something like eleven votes to secure the return of one person.  These nineteen will certainly not vote in one direction. They may vote in two or three directions, but it occurs to me to be an act of very bad grace indeed to say that the outgoing members of this body should not have the right to vote, that instead of having an electorate of 212 we are to have an electorate of 193 or thereabouts.  I do not think a case has been made for it.  I think everything is against it.  I so not think we ought to be nervous because of these nineteen out of 212 votes, and I think that to try to extend the life of the Seanad so that they would not be entitled to vote would be an act unworthy of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Of course we know that the President, first of all, and his Party are responsible for taking from the people the right of electing members to the Seanad because they believe, and have convinced themselves, with very few other people, that the people if given this right would not send into the Seanad the type of person which the present Government would like to get there.  They took this right from the <Col N="80" /> people.  The President goes on further and hopes&mdash;he apparently gives one the impression that he is objecting to it&mdash; that the Seanad will not be turned into an institution such as this is, composed on party lines.  This Bill is the very Bill which makes certain that the Seanad of the future, after three or four more elections, in six or nine years time, will be a body similar to that which we have here to-day.  Who is responsible for that but the President and the Minister for Local Government and the people who stand for this Bill?  If the elections were left to the people, more people of independent outlook would come into the Seanad than would be elected to it as a result of voting by the Dáil and Seanad combined. The Minister for Local Government knocked me out altogether.  He said that the people who do not attend the Seanad, although they took an oath to carry out certain duties there, were specially qualified to re-elect themselves or to elect their successors.  That is something you would not have expected from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, say, about ten years ago.  Of course, he is entitled to change his mind.</P>

      <P>The President also taunts members of the Opposition Benches with not having given their views in this House, as to what their impressions are of the most ideal Seanad we might have.  Deputy de Valera was the Deputy who moved the reference back of these Constitution Amending Bills affecting the Seanad, until such time as a Select Committee set up by this House could go into the question, and the President, speaking from the very same seat in which he is now sitting, vehemently opposed the proposal.  That is my view, because I believe we could learn from the experience of the last five or six years.  I think all Parties should be consulted and their views taken by the Government as to what amendments are necessary so far as the Constitution of the Seanad is concerned, so as to get the best type of people in that Assembly. The President will have to father the <Col N="81" /> responsibility for bringing in this Bill and in particular for the section which I am trying to amend.  The Minister for Local Government has stated that I made no case for the amendment, but one would like to hear the arguments for this section.  He admitted quite frankly that the Bill is being rushed through so that it will become an Act before the 6th December in order that retiring Senators will have the right they would not otherwise have, of voting for their own re-election.  We will have the Ministers and their colleagues entered on the records of this Dáil as supporting this Bill, and in the days to come they will have to justify this proposal.</P>

    <P>(2)  At a Seanad election the ballot of each voter shall consist of a paper (in this Act called a ballot paper) containing a list of the candidates described by their names, addresses, and descriptions as stated in the panel of candidates for that election and arranged alphabetically in the order of their surnames and, in the case of identity of surnames, of their other names and either in one continuous column or in such other manner (without departing from the said alphabetical order) as in the opinion of the Minister is best calculated to facilitate marking and counting.</P>
    <P>(3)  The ballot papers shall be in the prescribed form and each ballot paper shall have a number printed on the back and shall have attached a counterfoil with the same number printed on the face and every ballot paper shall at the time of issue thereof be marked on both sides with an official mark either stamped or perforated.</P>
    <P>(4)  The surname of each candidate shall be printed on the ballot papers in large characters and their other names and their addresses and descriptions shall be printed in small characters save that whenever the surnames of two or more candidates are the same there shall be printed in large characters (in addition to their surnames) the other names of such candidates and so much of the address or the description or of both the address and the description of each such candidate as will, in the opinion of the Seanad returning officer, effectively distinguish such candidate.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 12, to delete the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;returning officer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a minor amendment, the purpose of which is to give to the returning officer what I believe should be the powers of the returning officer.  As a matter of fact, when I saw the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the section originally. I thought it was a misprint.  It appears to me that it is the only part of the election in which the Minister directly interferes.  He has the right to appoint the returning officer and to make regulations concerning the returning officer's duties, but this section provides that he should interfere in one matter concerning the election, that is, the drawing up of the form of the ballot paper.  That is properly the duty of the returning officer, and I cannot see why it has not been left to the returning officer.  I would be glad if the Minister states why he thinks it necessary to have that power.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for prescribing forms for <Col N="85" /> both registration and election purposes. He did the same in connection with the last Seanad election, and you cannot split up the Minister's responsibility in the matter by saying he shall be responsible in one way for the form and the returning officer shall be responsible in another.  It falls naturally in with his responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not feel satisfied with that.  I think this involves the Minister interfering in the conduct of the election after it is started.  The prescribing of the forms and all that class of work can be done long before the election has actually commenced, but the Minister would not interfere under this section until after this had been done and the number of candidates was known and other information was available which it would be necessary to have before the forms of ballot paper could be prescribed.  If the provision laid down in the Electoral Act concerning the ballot paper were followed in this case I think it would be satisfactory.  The matter could be left, I believe, to the discretion of the returning officer.  He would know how to do it just as well as the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another special point involved in this. There is to be a certain limit to the number of candidates, and these will not vary except by one or two.  If the Minister is responsible for prescribing the particular form to be used in the election there is no reason why you should take from him the responsibility of saying whether it would be one, two, three or four or whatever number of columns there are to be in the form. He has to prescribe the form to be used in this election.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 44 and 45, to delete the words &ldquo;except the voter's number on the back.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and amendment 24 go together.  It is put down to hear what justification, if any, can be offered for the system of writing the voters' number on the back of the ballot paper. According to the Constitution Amendment Bill which was passed concerning this, this election is to be conducted by secret ballot.  In order to ensure, apparently, that the ballot will be secret, provision is made by which it is possible to find out how each voter recorded his preferences.  Therefore there does not seem to be any useful purpose whatever served by this provision that the number of the voter will be placed upon the ballot paper.  If there is any useful purpose served by it, we will be glad to hear it.  It seems to me that the only purpose which could be served by that provision would be to have some means by which the secrecy of the ballot could be violated.  The same thing is done at elections carried out for the Dáil, but, as I pointed out before, I think it is not so serious on those occasions.  It is one thing to find out how each voter recorded out of a total vote of sixty or seventy thousand.  It <Col N="87" /> is a very different thing if the total number of votes is only a couple of hundred.  There would be very little difficulty for the returning officer or any person on the returning officer's staff, or even for any person&mdash;a candidate, for example&mdash;attending the distribution of the ballot papers or the counting of the votes finding out how a particular individual voted.  If you want an open election, have an open election, and you will get the support of every Deputy on these benches in favour of it.  But if you want a secret ballot, let it be secret.  Do not let it be secret merely for one section of the House only.  I believe the main purpose of this provision is to provide some means, as I said, for violating the secrecy of the ballot.  If there is any other reason for it, let the Minister state it.  We have given the matter careful consideration, and we have been unable to arrive at any other conclusion concerning the insertion of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy understands the procedure in sending out ballot papers and receiving them back by post.  There is sent out to each voter a ballot paper, an envelope in which the ballot paper is to be enclosed, a form of identity, and an envelope in which the envelope is to be returned.  The ballot paper is filled up, put inside the small envelope and closed by the person sending it in. The identity paper is then put around that envelope, and that is put into an outer envelope, which is sent to the returning officer.  The identity paper is looked at to see that it is properly filled up, and to see that the person sending the envelope in was a person entitled to send it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is to be the way.  On the envelope in which the number of the voter is there is the identity number in pencil.  The number of the voter is on the outside of the envelope which encloses the ballot paper.  These two numbers are compared to ensure that the identity paper that comes in is the identity paper proper to come in that envelope.  The identity papers are then put away and sealed up.  Before the <Col N="88" /> envelope containing the ballot papers are opened the number of the envelope is compared with the number on the back of the ballot paper for the purpose of establishing, to the satisfaction of the returning officer, that the identity paper in the envelope is the identity paper corresponding to the ballot paper which is inside.  It is the envelope enclosing the ballot paper that is the connecting link between the two.  The two are never related to each other directly, so that there is no disclosing of the secrecy of the ballot there.  At every act which the returning officer takes in carrying out the opening of the count representatives of the candidates, or the candidates themselves, are present.  So that, as I say, the identity paper is never brought into direct relation with the ballot papers.  The number on the back of the ballot paper is there for one reason only, and that is for the purpose of being able to prove in the case of a petition to the courts for the purpose of the court that the voting paper was issued to a particular person.  A particular elector may deny, as part of a policy of upsetting an election, that he got a voting paper or that he was allowed to vote.  There is only one way to establish that, and that is by the court having the power to examine the ballot papers, when put in a proper and legal way before the court.  It is only the court that can examine the ballot paper for the purpose of relating it to somebody who comes before it claiming that he did not vote or get an opportunity of voting.  In so far as the suggestion is made that this provision is to enable it to be known how persons recorded their preferences, in sub-section (2) of Section 14 it is distinctly stated that no person who has voted at a Seanad election shall in any legal proceeding be required to state for whom he has voted.  So that it is not within the competence of the court to say in respect of a ballot paper that comes before it how the preferences of a voting paper belonging to a particular man have been cast.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a Select Committee consisting of eleven Deputies to be nominated by the Committee of Selection be appointed to enquire into and report upon the working of the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, as affecting officers and servants of railway companies amalgamated or absorbed by or under the Railways Act, 1924 who lose their employment or suffer other loss or hardship and claim compensation therefor; that the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and that the quorum of the Committee be five.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Railways Act, 1924, which provided for the amalgamation in one group of the whole of the railways completely within the Free State, was enacted ostensibly in the interests of the community.  Amalgamation rendered possible extensive economies in administration, in the mass purchase of materials, in the pooling of rolling-stock, and in the operation of a common policy, and thereby enabled lower rates and fares to be charged to the travelling and trading public.</P>
      <P>If it was essential from the public point of view that fewer railwaymen should be employed, it would not be just or equitable to achieve this public gain at the expense of the men dismissed, who would lose their means of livelihood, and thereby incur great suffering and possibly starvation to their families.</P>
      <P>The age-old principle of compensation for loss of employment in the public interest as a result of legislation was, in fact, definitely recognised in the Railways Act, 1924, and embodied in the Third Schedule to that Act.  This Schedule closely followed a similar schedule in the British Railways Act, 1921.  In fact, the whole Act of 1924 was a fairly exact copy of the British Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same system obtained in the Act which gave effect to the amalgamation of unions whereby certain local officials <Col N="90" /> were declared redundant.  The ratepayers as a result of the redundancy had to meet the compensation which was given to these local officials after the coming into operation of the Amalgamation Act.</P>
    <P>In regard to compensation, the draftsman departed slightly from the wording of the British Act, with the result that in a few cases dismissed men were enabled to claim compensation for disturbance and also secure a lump sum out of a local superannuation fund to which they had been subscribing for periods up to 50 years.  This, however, applied only in four or five cases, and even if every one of them so circumstanced were dispensed with it would be of very little consequence from a financial viewpoint, as there were only 70 or 80 men all told, and in any case the Company did not stand to lose, as the additional amount was provided by the pension fund, which was jointly owned by the Company and the men.</P>
    <P>Because of these few cases, the Government came along with the amending Act of 1926, which, instead of setting out to correct this slight anomaly, proceeded to alter in the most drastic manner the whole of the compensation provisions.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the protection afforded by the 1924 Act, which was a continuing protection for all those five years and upwards in the service on 23rd April, 1924, was limited to seven years.  In other words, three years from now the new Great Southern Railways Company can do what it pleases with employees whose pre-amalgamation rights were permanently safeguarded during the whole of their service by the Act of 1924, just as the rights of British railwaymen were similarly safeguarded under the Act of 1921.  To avoid paying compensation, or even having a claim made, the Company can retain a man with 20 or 30 years' service for three years longer (until 1931), and then dispense with his services completely and pay him no compensation, or alternatively put him to a junior post and pay him half his existing salary, and he has no redress.</P>
    <P>But the Act went very much farther than this, and for practical purposes made it practically impossible for anybody to get compensation at all, no <Col N="91" /> matter when he is dismissed or in what circumstances.  According to Section 4 of the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, a dismissed employee, in order to establish a claim for compensation, must prove to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that he was dismissed.  The Act says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In consequence of changes of administration due directly to the amalgamation and absorption of companies affected by or under the Principal Act, and not shown by the amalgamated company to have been caused by decrease of traffic, reduction of renewal or maintenance work, introduction of improved methods of working... or other economic cause.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The employee is, therefore, first of all called upon to prove that his dismissal is due &ldquo;directly&rdquo; to amalgamation, and has to rebut the numerous contentions of the Company in a negative sense that it was not due to any or all of the various other causes mentioned.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate the impossibility of, say, a porter, guard, painter or fitter attempting either to prove the affirmative or disprove the negative, with his limited information, his non-access to board minutes and to official information, against the formidable array of experts which the Company can put against him.  The arbitrator who has just retired&mdash;Mr. Justice Davitt&mdash;used these words in giving judgment on a very important case:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As soon as I commenced hearing these appeals, it became evident that for an appellant to discharge or even shift this onus of proof was a matter of extreme difficulty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure it was not the Minister's intention to put the onus on the applicant and relieve the Company of all responsibility for proving or disproving the case from their point of view.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;This shows the insurmountable difficulty with which the applicant for compensation is confronted. He is asked to prove certain things and disprove others, although practically the whole of the information necessary to do either is in the hands of the people on the other side who are opposing his case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To quote again from Mr. Justice Davitt:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Each appellant has to come and prove to my satisfaction&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That his services were dispensed with.</P>
      <P>(2)  That they were dispensed with because they were unnecessary.</P>
      <P>(3)  That they were unnecessary by reason of certain changes of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> (4)  That these changes of administration were due directly to amalgamation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These averments are all positive, and the information necessary to prove them would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the respondents, still I have been able to discover no principle of evidence which would relieve the appellants from the burthen of proving these averments before they can succeed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This indicates, in the considered, impartial and unimpassioned words of a judge acting as arbitrator, the heartless farce which has been perpetrated upon hundreds of unfortunate men, in leading them to believe that if deprived of their livelihood in the public interest, they shall get some measure of compensation, when in reality, in order to get the benefit of this protection, they are asked to achieve what the Official Arbitrator indicates is impossible.</P>
    <P>In plain fact, all the Company has to do is to reduce maintenance work for any period, no matter how short, and on the strength of this reduction of renewal and maintenance work, dismiss as many as they like, and refuse to pay compensation because the dismissal was due to reduction of renewal or maintenance work.  This is not a wild statement on my part.  It is the considered judgment of Mr. Justice Davitt, who deliberately states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even should I accept Mr. Duffy's argument (Counsel for the applicant), the Company would escape liability, because the dismissal of his client was caused by the reduction of renewal and maintenance work, whatever was the occasion of such reduction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is easy to see the farce to which this Act can be reduced, when it is quite clear that all the Company need do is to reduce maintenance work for a couple of months, during which they can dispense with the services of as many men as they wish, without paying compensation, and then take on new men at beginners' rates of wages.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the manner in which the two Acts have operated, we find that out of the 52 cases dealt with <Col N="94" /> by the first Arbitrator, Mr. Meredith, K.C., (who, as the Minister knows, resigned when he brought in the amending Act), under the 1924 Act, in 42 cases compensation was awarded, and there were 10 dismissals.  Mr. Justice Davitt dealt with 166 cases, in which compensation was awarded in 35 cases, and 131 were dismissed.</P>

      <P>There are still 107 cases awaiting disposal, but the cases already dealt with have convinced the applicants that they have no chance of success under the present Act, and in addition there are some hundreds of cases where no appeal has yet been made to the arbitrator because the men have despaired of getting any redress until the law is amended, and do not want to incur useless legal expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To show you how the Act is operating and how it is a ridiculous farce&mdash;I am not saying the Minister intended it to do that, but he is responsible for the amending Act and the original Act&mdash;I will quote one case.  The Minister's Government appoints the Chief Justice, who in turn appoints the arbitrators. There is the case of Michael Donohue who was appointed on the Tralee and Dingle Railway previous to the Amalgamation Act coming into operation. He was dismissed on the 9/10/'26.  His application for compensation was immediately submitted in the usual official way and through the proper channel. The hearing was before the arbitrator on the 9th January, 1928.  The Company produced evidence which, in the opinion of the arbitrator, was merely hearsay evidence.  According to what I am told, the arbitrator was inclined to rule in favour of the appellant, but he <Col N="95" /> invited the Company to say whether they were prepared to bring evidence other than hearsay evidence and the Company undertook to do so.  As a result the arbitrator adjourned the case on the 9th January, 1928, and it has not since come up for hearing.  There is a man who, to-morrow, will be two years out of service.  He was dismissed from the Tralee and Dingle Railway, and in the opinion of legal advisers he has a clear case.  There must be some doubt because if the man had not a clear case the arbitrator would have dismissed it&mdash;would have ruled against it.  He adjourned the case and the individual concerned has been two years waiting.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the manner in which the men have lost their employment, due directly to amalgamation, and still have been unable to get any compensation, I need only cite the case of the painters in the old D. &amp; S.E. railway works at Grand Canal Street. At the date of amalgamation there were 8 carriage painters employed in these works.  The works were closed down in February or March, 1925, and the painters, with the other staff, were transferred to Inchicore.  By this time every one of the 8 carriage painters have been dismissed, and not a single one of them has got a penny compensation. Three or four of the cases have been before the arbitrator and have been turned down, and the rest of them see no hope of going on with their cases as they are similar.</P>
    <P>The point is this: The Act says directly due to amalgamation.  If the 1926 Act was not passed, the old D. &amp; S.E. Railway Company would be still presumably running as the D. &amp; S.E. Railway.  I know the Minister is a keen debater and he will probably say that as a result of a loss on goods and passenger traffic, there was every possibility that the railway would close down.  If the railway carried on, as I believe it could have whether amalgamation came or not, the works would still be going at Grand Canal Street, and these men would still be in employment. Now, they are out of employment and without compensation.  The <Col N="96" /> closing down of the Grand Canal workshops is a direct result of amalgamation. These people in accordance with the spirit and intention of the 1924 and 1926 Acts have a right to compensation. They have been turned down. If that was the intention of the Minister, he should have made the position clear that he was asking the House to pass the compensation clauses of the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>Now it is obvious beyond any shadow of doubt that if no amalgamation had taken place, whilst it might be possible to effect some small economy in the number of painters employed by the old D. &amp; S.E., the Company would have to employ at least a proportion of the 8 painters, and could not have dispensed with the lot, so that the majority of the men at least have lost their employment, as a direct result of amalgamation, and yet because of their inability, through the construction of the amending Act, to prove this fact, and because the Company need only prove that there has been a reduction of renewal or maintenance work, they lose their cases.</P>
    <P>As an example of the manner in which temporary economies have been effected for the purpose of getting rid of commitments under the Act, it need only be pointed out that in one particular section of the shops at Inchicore, in which a number of dismissals without compensation have taken place, there were employed in 1924, before amalgamation, by the old G.S. &amp; W. Company, 17 men.  After amalgamation when the work of the whole of the amalgamated companies had to be done, the staff numbered 30, but these were eventually reduced by dismissal to 18. or one more than the number employed by one of the amalgamated companies before amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The temporary reduction of maintenance work having resulted in the Company getting rid of its commitments and legal obligations to the old employees, they can now take on new men without any legal obligation, or take on old men as newcomers and at reduced rates of pay, and in this way the Act has become a futility.</P>
    <P>When I tell the House that the majority of these men have periods of service ranging from 15 to 35 years, <Col N="97" /> they will appreciate the terrible hardship to which they have been subjected and the cruel injustice inflicted upon them.  If they had been left with their old Companies there was no reason to believe that they would have been disturbed in any way, or at the very worst only a small proportion of them would be without employment.  As it is, however, 1,000 men have been dismissed out of the loco department alone, and of these only a small fraction have received compensation.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the employees of the Grand Canal Street Works, belonging to the old D. &amp; S.E. Company, were treated is an illustration of the monstrous injustice inflicted upon some of the men dismissed.  If amalgamation had not taken place it might have fallen to the old D. &amp; S.E. to try and effect economies in the number of staff employed. Obviously they could not dismiss all their staff, or anything like it. It was doubtful if any reduction could be made, as considerable economies had been effected before amalgamation.  If they did effect economies, they would act on the principle of &ldquo;Last man in, first man out.&rdquo;  Now, what actually took place under amalgamation was this: the Grand Canal Street Works were closed, and the whole of the men transferred to the Inchicore Works.  By that means many of them lost the seniority which they had enjoyed at Grand Canal Street.  For instance, if the senior man at Grand Canal Street had 30 years' service, he would be junior to a man with 31 or 32 years' service taken off another line and put to work with him at Inchicore.  Even on the basis of seniority, therefore, he would be liable to be dispensed with before a number of other men would go, whilst in his old employment he could not be dispensed with except through misconduct or incapacity, unless the line closed down altogether.</P>
    <P>What happened, however, was that practically the whole of these men of all Departments from Grand Canal Street have lost their employment, irrespective of service.  In many cases men outside of Inchicore with much shorter service have been retained.  It is clear beyond all doubt that it was directly because of changes of administration <Col N="98" /> due to amalgamation that these men lost their employment, and if amalgamation had not taken place the majority of them could not have been dispensed with.  Yet because the Company can plead an economy reason, the men cannot hope to secure compensation, although theoretically the Act says they are entitled to it.  To get any compensation they have to achieve the impossible.  There are very large numbers of men with service ranging from 20 to 40 years who have become adapted to one particular kind of work, who are now too old to get employment elsewhere, even if trade were much better than it is, and they are now thrown on the scrap-heap without hope of any kind for the future.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to scrap the Act altogether as far as compensation is concerned than to make a mockery of numbers of unfortunate men, leaving them to spend large sums of money in futile litigation, without any possible result except failure.  The results to hand, so far, and the remarks of the official arbitrator, followed by his resignation, establish a prima facie case for a full inquiry into the working of the Act, unless the Oireachtas is to commit itself to a policy of confiscation of the most cruel and glaring kind. Suffering of this kind is accentuated by the fact that after three years' service the men are not insured against unemployment, the Company being relieved from this obligation on having given an assurance that, generally speaking, railway employment was permanent.</P>
    <P>I myself happened to be one of a delegation, and I was at the time a member of the Executive Committee of the Railway Clerks' Association, that waited upon Lloyd George at that particular period.  The representatives of the railwaymen were accompanied by the General Managers of the Irish railway companies, and the railway Managers, on the instructions of the Directors stated, in order to get exemption from the Act at that time, that railway employment could be regarded as permanent.  In the case of the clerical staff, the companies bound themselves to a deputation, at which I was present, to guarantee three months' full pay during sickness in order to get exempt from the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> From that point of view railway employment, at that period particularly, was regarded as permanent.  This makes the obligation of the State still more binding and direct to those men whom it has rendered destitute for the purpose of bringing about railway amalgamation in what we claimed to be the interests of the community in general.  If the men were insured in the ordinary way, the same as other workers, they would at least be entitled to unemployment benefit on the basis of whatever contributions they had made to that particular fund.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1924 secured a smooth passage as far as the Labour Party was concerned, although not looked upon as by any means ideal, owing to the fact that it at least recognised the universally-accepted principle of compensation for disturbance as a result of legislation.  Having thus secured the passage of the Bill, the Government came along two years later and shamefully confiscated the protective provisions. It is now time that something should be done with a view to getting back to the principle of elementary justice, and it is for this purpose that this motion is being moved.</P>
    <P>In moving the motion and giving these reasons for doing so, I am not moving it in any party spirit&mdash;in any spirit of complaint against the Minister personally.  So far as I know the Minister's mind, when he was putting the original Act through the House it was never his intention to deprive the railwayman, who would lose his employment as a result of the legislation, of reasonable compensation.  He now knows, or ought to know, as I have cited some cases, how the Act has been worked.  He knows that the first arbitrator, Mr. Justice Meredith, resigned as a direct result of his bringing in the Amending Act of 1926.  The second arbitrator, whose opinion I have quoted, has also resigned.  The result is that one hundred old men who retired or were dismissed in the year 1926 are still waiting to have their cases decided by some arbitrator who may be appointed in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am positive, from the information given to me, that the first arbitrator, Mr. Justice Meredith, tendered his resignation as a result of the original provisions of the Amending Bill of 1926, because it was proposed to make that Bill retrospective.  The Minister afterwards bowed himself out on that point in the House, but Mr. Justice Meredith had resigned before the Minister gave way on the point.  When that Bill was first introduced, it proposed to review the decisions of the arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice. The arbitrator looked upon that as an insult and tendered his resignation, but the Minister, to his credit be it said, gave way on the point, and perhaps Mr. Justice Meredith might have been sorry for resigning.  I have positive information that he retired as the result of the provisions of that Amending Bill as first introduced.</P>

In regard to the second arbitrator, I believe that he had more work than he could do in the ordinary way and that he was doing this work in whatever limited spare time he had.  I certainly cannot make that statement in regard to the second arbitrator&mdash;Mr. Justice Davitt.  The point I make is that there are over 100 cases of men who were dismissed or who retired as the result of amalgamation waiting to be heard for the past two years, and there is now no arbitrator to hear these cases.  That is an injustice to the men who were dismissed or who retired believing they were being de-graded in some way as a result of the amalgamation. It is a glaring injustice to have these cases still waiting to be heard.</P>

Let them be given an opportunity to put their case before the Select Committee.  They will either be able to make their case or they will not. At any rate, it will be a Committee of this House, and I am prepared to accept the decision of the majority of any committee set up by the House as to whether or not there is a case for amending legislation to deal with the cases of men who were dismissed or who retired from the railway service as a result of amalgamation.

      <P>Until I heard the end of Deputy Davin's speech, I did not know whether he was indicting the Government or the railway.  I take it that the motion was not an indictment of the Government, because he explained he was sure the Minister was doing everything that was fair.  If, by any chance, he thinks the railway has not played the game, I assure him it has.  I could give the House instances of how the railway company is fighting against tremendous odds.  Traffic, both passenger and other, is being filched from it by what I call unfair competition.  If the railways are not carrying the goods traffic and the passengers that they used to, then fewer <Col N="102" /> men are wanted in certain grades of employment.  The railway company cannot be expected to compensate everyone for whom they cannot find work.  I am afraid that this really only adds to the Government's task of dealing with unemployment generally.  We also ought not to forget that there is a tremendous lot of capital invested in the railway undertaking.  That was not put there by millionaires.  It represents to a large extent the savings of the comparatively poor people in the country, who look forward to the dividends from the railway company as their means of existence.  I do not know whether Deputy Davin can tell us how many men are involved in this question that he has raised.  I should not think there are many.  I hope he does not want to introduce legislation to make it incumbent upon the railway companies to compensate every man for whom they cannot find work.</P>

We do not think when we are passing legislation here that such legislation can be defeated by legal quibbles and by the difficulty people have for whose benefit the legislation is passed finding the means to prove to the satisfaction of a judge that their case is in accordance with the legislation.  Take this statement of Judge Davitt: &ldquo;These averments are all positive, and though the information necessary to prove them would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the respondents, still I have been able to discover no principle of evidence which would relieve the appellants from the burden of proving these averments before they can succeed.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read: &ldquo;I have sought all available evidence from both sides before coming to a decision as to what was the cause of any dismissal, and such evidence has not, I am satisfied, been cursorily withheld in any case.&rdquo;  I do not think, notwithstanding that the Minister is placing his reliance on Judge Davitt's modifications of his own statement, that the onus is upon the applicants.  I do not think the House should be satisfied that that good will on the part of Judge Davitt has been sufficient to protect the unfortunate men who are concerned in this.  As well as that, those of us who have gone to the trouble of inquiring into the working of the Act and have met the men concerned are undoubtedly struck by the fact that there must have been the greatest difficulty in proving that their dismissals do not result from amalgamation. Take the case of a man named Michael Fahy.  He worked at Avoca as a smith, where his father also worked in the service of the company for 47 years. He himself was there for 23 years. Both father and son were transferred to Dublin.  Both made an appeal.  I am only dealing with the son's case at the moment, because the father failed in his appeal and the company allowed him a pension of 16/- per week.  He had to leave his family, a fairly large one, in Avoca, and he gets four days' work a week in Dublin.  Yet when he presents his case to Judge Davitt, the judge is able to decide that although he was transferred as a result of the amalgamation and although his father, who had been for 47 years at Avoca, had also been transferred, this transfer and the hardship of being placed on four days a week were not due to amalgamation.  If Judge Davitt were <Col N="104" /> a Solomon, he could not possibly prove that.  I think that in practice, in all these cases it surpasses the wit of any man to prove that dismissals have not been due to amalgamation.  Reading the things which Judge Davitt has set down as the things which he requires proved, I think he himself has given a good case for believing that the Act was not being worked as it was intended.</P>
      <P>It is rather unfortunate that, notwithstanding the long time this motion has been on the Order Paper, it has come on unexpectedly this evening, as a great many of us had a number of individual cases to bring forward, and, not expecting the motion to come on, we have not got them with us.  At any rate, from representations made to us and from close and careful inquiries, we are satisfied that the Act has not been worked as it was intended to be worked; that some men are suffering terrible hardship, after a lifetime of service, and we think that inquiry should be made into this matter.  There are a number of men from Bray district alone who were dismissed, practically all in one day:&mdash;T. Redmond, 17 years' service; T. Keenan, 21 years' service; P. Caulfield, 9 years' service; James Bryan, 12 years' service; others were dismissed after nine, twelve, five, and three years' service.  None of these men has appealed, because they were not in any trade union, and they had not the means to pay for an appeal. But in practically all these cases I venture to say the intention of the Act is to protect them, and in the case of the senior men, at least, to give them compensation for the years of service which they have given.  An inquiry cannot possibly do any harm.  It will not cost much, and it will certainly, I think, establish what should be the principle of all legislation&mdash;confidence that any Acts passed through this House will be worked as they were intended to be worked.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Moore, I did not expect this motion to come on this evening.  If I had known that it was coming on, I could have brought forward numerous cases of victimisation arising out of the amalgamation of the railway systems in Southern Ireland. <Col N="105" /> Deputy J.X. Murphy asked Deputy Davin whether he was making an indictment of the railways or of the Government. In my view, Deputy Davin has indicated both the Great Southern Railways and the Government, and I leave the House and Deputy Murphy to apportion the blame.  We know that amalgamation, while, perhaps, resulting in some economies, has had very serious reactions, notably in the cases which I have in mind among railway shopmen.  At the period of the amalgamation, we had a very efficient and up-to-date workshop in Cork.  We had in connection with the Cork and Bandon system a fine system of railway workshops which earned many encomiums from railway engineers and other authorities.  The efficiency and quality of the workmanship had, in fact, never been questioned, but, owing to the amalgamation, the majority of the workers in these shops in Cork city were first put on short time and the next step was to discharge many of them from the railway service altogether, while those that were left were kept on short time.  We find on examination that there was a gravitation of the work which could be done in those workships in Cork towards Inchicore. I do not know whether it is a wise policy to centralise everything in Dublin, but while that gravitation, or, rather, orientation, was going on we had railway shopmen in Cork put on half time where they were not put out of employment altogether.  I am not at all sure that the Great Southern Railways have attempted to reap all the advantages they might have reaped had they foreseen the development of road traffic.</P>

      <P>I agree.  In regard to this amalgamation scheme, there are many anomalies in connection with retiring allowances and pensions.  I could quote some cases in regard to railway checkers and others.  One man, about whose case I got particulars recently, had over forty years' service as a checker, and he got a pension of about nine shillings a week, while some of the higher officials got retiring allowances <Col N="106" /> varying from £300 to £1,000 a year.  I hope that when this Committee is set up serious attention will be given to the question of retiring allowances.  If I had notice that this matter was to be discussed this evening I could have brought from Cork particulars of many cases of real hardship as the result of amalgamation.  I know that this hardship is not confined to men employed in Cork and that it is pretty general. I trust, as I say, when this Committee is set up, the whole matter will be inquired into.</P>

      <P>I hope the House will agree to accept this motion and that a Committee will be set up to inquire into the whole details and circumstances arising out of the amalgamation of the railways and the redundancy of the employees.  In common with other members of this party, I looked into certain statements made by persons affected and, while I am quite prepared to say that there are two sides to every story, nevertheless from the information at my disposal I should say that if a Committee were set up it would do much good and could do no harm.  Deputy Murphy pointed out that unfair competition had had an effect on the amount of employment on railways but I maintain that when the Department concerned brought about the scheme of amalgamation it should have realised that it had some responsibility not only in regard to the railways and the employees but that it had to face unfair competition.  The Department, however, did nothing to stop it.  Efforts were made to attract attention to the inroads which that competition was making on the railways. From what I have heard from certain representatives of the workshops, particularly those at Inchicore, I believe that an inquiry into the whole matter would do a lot of good.  I believe that sympathy towards the men's cases if they are justified would bring about something to alleviate the distress which exists among hundreds of unemployed railwaymen.  The Minister in reply will probably give us lost of information, figures and details to take away from what Deputy Davin put before the House but I believe that a Committee of this House, if allowed to examine some of the claims made by <Col N="107" /> both sides, would be able to decide whether the Act is being interpreted in the sense in which it was put before the House.  If we got that clearly brought out we would be getting nearer to facing the whole problem of transport in the country as well as being able to deal with the question of capital mentioned by Deputy Murphy.  I have in my possession particulars concerning numerous individuals who, so far as I can see, were definitely dismissed owing to redundancy caused by amalgamation. I have, of course, heard only one side and, so far as I can make out, I believe that that is the case.  The only way to dispel the error in people's minds, if there is an error, is to set up a Committee and to see whether we cannot bring about some understanding by which the interests both of the workers and the railways will be safeguarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I have particulars of a few cases to bring to the notice of the House and I also desire to explain the practice adopted by the railway company. Previous to amalgamation the men in the shops were on full time but about twelve months after amalgamation they were put on for about four days a week.  They were then offered by the Company alternative employment in Cork or Waterford on four days a week.  One man, Patrick Conachy, of Bray, with twenty-eight years' service, was offered alternative work in Waterford at four days' pay.  He appealed to the directors not to ask him to go to Waterford as he had a wife and large family.  If he went he would be unable to maintain his family in either Waterford or Bray.  As he did not go he was dismissed and he appealed for a pension but received no acknowledgment so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the case of another employee named John Byrne who had about 22 years' service.  He was being employed four days a week in Bray and he was requested to go to Kingsbridge. He was expected to maintain himself and his family in Bray or Dublin at £1 18s. 0d. a week.  He refused to go and he was dismissed.  Five men from Maryborough were sent there and given an extra day's work&mdash;five days a week&mdash;in place of the men who <Col N="108" /> were dismissed.  That is the way the railway company works.  Deputy Murphy made an appeal on behalf of the shareholders.  I wonder did he attend the last meeting of the Company and make an appeal there as to why the Great Southern Railway Company spent £25,000 in erecting a platform in Bray that is of no use to the visitors, the shareholders or the workers? Again we have an expenditure of £2,000 at Wicklow station in order to abolish the job of one man, a signal man, an old man who was going out on pension.  After the expenditure of that £2,000 in making a single line, they found that they would have to keep a man employed to look after the crossings at the station.  That £2,000 could have been devoted to some object that would have been of benefit either to the workers or the shareholders in whom Deputy Murphy is so interested and would not have gone for nothing. We have a large number of grievances but although this motion has been down for a considerable time it has been brought on to-day unexpectedly and we were not able to have full particulars. These, however, are two cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's word for that.  We have heard a lot about the railways and economy. Twelve months ago I asked the Minister's Department to furnish particulars of the compensation awarded to various officials from the chairman of the company down to the principal members of the staff who received from thousands of pounds to £400 and £500 a year.  I have only received up to the present an acknowledgment that the matter is under consideration.  The result is that either the railway company or the Minister or his Department is shielding the railway company and the directors for their gross mismanagement in giving thousands of pounds compensation to directors and other officials for whom work could have been found while they are dismissing men of 28 and 22 years' service.  These men are not in receipt of a pension at the present time.  I support Deputy Davin's motion and I think that the Minister or the railway company need <Col N="109" /> not be afraid of having a Committee to inquire into the management and the action of the railway company up to the present.</P>

      <P>Let the Committee inquire into the working of the Act. I suggest that the railway directors are taking advantage of the Act to give compensation to themselves and to clerks while dismissing men under the pretence that there is no work. They are also availing of a section of the Act to offer alternative work miles away from the men's homes at five days a week and then they dismiss them when they refuse to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelEHolt" hpid="Mr. HOLT Mr. HOLT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOLT</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Davin's motion.  In the case of the Cavan and Leitrim Light Railway which is a section of the Great Southern Railways, the services of 7 employees have recently been dispensed with on the ground that these men had become redundant.  The cause of the redundancy is that the work which was hitherto performed at the workshop in Ballinamore has been transferred to Dublin&mdash;to Inchicore or perhaps to England.  The work may be done in England for all we know.  These seven men, whose services have been dispensed with, have been thrown on the labour market at a time when they cannot get work.  Unless something is done for them in the way of compensation or providing other work, these men and their families will have to go to the County Home, to emigrate, or to become a charge on the ratepayers.  The work taken from Ballinamore workshop could be as well done in Ballinamore and at less cost than it is done in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a case submitted to me of four transfers of railway material from Ballinamore to Dublin.  Each of these four transfers cost £40&mdash;that is £160 to transfer that work from Ballinamore to Dublin.  That £160 was spent before any work commenced at all.  If amalgamation had not taken place and if this Amalgamation Bill <Col N="110" /> had not been passed in 1924, I presume these men would still be working on that line.  Is it possible that the Bill passed in 1924 will deprive the working man of his work and the compensation which he should have got under the 1924 Act will be taken from him by the Bill brought in two years later? I hope that is not so.  Furthermore the baronial guaranteeing area in County Leitrim contributes £4,221 a year to the upkeep of that railway for ten years, from 1924 to 1934.  Altogether County Leitrim has contributed some £200,000 towards the upkeep of the railway since it was laid down.  The Leitrim County Council at a meeting specially called for the purpose passed the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we the County Council of Leitrim, in special meeting assembled, hereby emphatically protest against the action of the Great Southern Railway Company in dismissing the old employees of the Cavan and Leitrim Section.  After due consideration the County Council have come to the conclusion that the dismissal of those men will not effect any economy, as we are aware that the removal to Dublin workshops of materials for repairs, or the sending to the district of tradesmen from Dublin to carry out necessary repairs will cost more than by retaining those men in the service.  We further point out that as Leitrim is paying a sum of over £4,000 per year towards the upkeep and maintenance of the Cavan and Leitrim section, the County Council will oppose by every means in their power any attempt by the Great Southern Railway Company to penalise the employees of this section for the benefit of the employees of the South.  We also emphatically protest against the employment of outside labour and demand the withdrawal of all outside labour employed on this section since amalgamation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Leitrim is the poorest county in Ireland, and has no industry, and we consider that the little employment which can be given on this section of the Railway Group should be given to the people of the district. Some of these men under notice of <Col N="111" /> dismissal have up to 30 years' service and have dependents to provide for.  There is no other employment in the county for these men and eventually themselves and their families must become a charge on the rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That resolution was passed unanimously at a special meeting of the County Council.  I wonder if it is necessary to dismiss these men. I believe it is the duty of the Dáil to amend the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, in so far as it affects these railway employees and place them on the same conditions as they enjoyed under the Railway Act of 1924.  I hope the Dáil will pass Deputy Davin's motion and do justice to these men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion in the name of Deputy Davin. I quite realise that there are two sides to the story.  Deputy J.X. Murphy put up a case for the railway shareholder and I know there is much to be said for that.  I am personally aware of cases in the suburbs of Dublin of people whose sole income should be derived from railway shares.  Money was invested in railways when these were considered practically gilt-edged securities. Those people are in very straitened circumstances now, but such cases as that are no excuse for doing injustice through legislation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce insisted on, I believe, two Deputies quoting one or two sentences of decisions of Justice Davitt which they had omitted, whether intentionally or not I do not know.  One of them was that this course was not seriously opposed by counsel to the Railway Company.  I believe something to that effect is in the course of hearing on the other side.  Even that does not prove for a moment that the Act is working out as it was intended, or that under it the workmen can secure the compensation which was intended for them.  I gather when the Act was first passed information had to be given by the appellant proving averments, which information is in the hands of the Company and is not available for <Col N="112" /> these men.  It is asking them to achieve the impossible; it seems the Act has been reduced to a farce.  I wonder would the Minister tell us that the compensation clauses of the 1924 Act have worked out in practice as it was intended they would.  Has he satisfied himself that their claims are getting fair attention, and that compensation is not refused in cases in which it should have been granted?  I notice it was stated that of 52 cases before Justice Meredith, in 42 of these compensation was given.  Then Deputy Davin proceeded to quote figures of cases before Justice Davitt, and the Minister said, &ldquo;Not necessarily under the 1926 Act.&rdquo;  Considering the great discrepancy, the great change in the percentage of cases in which compensation was given under the 1924 Act and after the passing of the 1926 Act, it seemed as if post hoc ergo propter hoc is a fair argument.  Concrete cases are being given in which it seems to me there is a decided injustice.  Take the case of Michael Donohue, of Tralee, and the two cases quoted by Deputy Everett. It is a grave injustice to keep a man in suspense for two years when his livelihood is at stake and that a man should be dismissed on the 9th of the 10th month, 1926, and his case not heard until January, 1928.  He is still waiting for a decision.  It has been further referred, and there are 107 cases waiting until some arbitrator or justice is appointed apparently.  Advantage also seems to have been taken of the legislation to dismiss men and avoid compensation, and take on men at a low rate of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be my conclusion from the case of these eight carriage painters who were dismissed and had been working in the Grand Canal Street Works. Also grave suspicion attaches to the figures given of the numbers of men in Inchicore.  In one Department there were seventeen men in Inchicore, thirty after amalgamation, and subsequently reduced to eighteen, doing work that several workshops were doing up to that. That it only requires one man more, it seems to me, there is there a suspicion of the company taking advantage of legislation to reduce the number of men, nominally because there is no employment <Col N="113" /> for them, but really to get out of giving compensation and to take on other men subsequently.  Looking at the whole case, it seems to me there is a very good case for having this Committee to inquire into the matter. A Committee of this House is not going to do an injustice to either, but would see that the purposes are achieved for which this legislation was intended and that compensation was given to those for whom it was intended.  Deputy Carey has asked should the country give them compensation.  It is the duty of this Dáil to see that compensation is given to whatever men legislation meant it should be given.  It should be given to them, and a Committee of eleven selected by the Selection Committee is not going to do injustice to the shareholder and will see justice done to these men.  I am certain from the cases I have heard that injustice is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I also desire to express my dissatisfaction at the method in which the Act is being carried out, particularly as I have some knowledge of what seems to me wholesale unnecessary dismissals at Inchicore since the amalgamation came into operation.  I do not know that the adoption of the resolution will give Deputy Davin and the others who support it the information they desire, for this reason, that I think the main objection at the moment is that so many hundred cases have been awaiting decision through whatever neglect is responsible for the non-hearing of those cases.  If the Minister could give any undertaking to try and urge that these cases be dealt with immediately, we might be then in a better position to know what would be the result of the test cases that have been sent to the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the competition that the railway companies have to contend with, and it struck me he wanted to suggest that the dismissals were not as a result of amalgamation but as the result of bus competition, etc.  I know for a fact that if it were only the bus competition that was given as a kind of excuse for the so-called economy there might be something in it, but I know and suggest to <Col N="114" /> Deputy Murphy that he would be well advised to make inquiries into the administration of the various departments in Inchicore and compare what is being done now with what has been done hitherto, particularly with regard to the manufacture of a good deal of the rolling stock required by the railway. I know at present, and I do not intend to go into details here, but I will discuss the matter with Deputy Murphy outside and will be able to put before him some cases that I think will give him something to go on with.  He will find there is no necessity whatsoever for the wholesale dismissals that have been taking place in these works.  The work is there, and it can be done cheaper; it has been done.  That has been proved, but whatever undercurrent is responsible for it, it is bringing about unnecessary dismissals.  I know, and everyone else knows, that the bus competition is seriously affecting railways throughout the country, and a good many people who are supporting the buses should, if they wish to maintain the railways, give them some help in that respect.  However, that is another question, but it is bringing about unemployment that could be avoided.  I do not know whether the carrying of this motion is going to be of any advantage until at least these cases are disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself somewhat in a difficulty in dealing with this motion, even at this time, but I am assuming from the very fact that Deputy Davin has brought it forward that what I thought to be an objection to the discussion at this time no longer stands as an objection.  What I mean is this, that the arbitrator in giving his decision in a particular test case, the Kearns case, gave his decision not merely in that case but in several other cases.  He indicated what his point of view was with regard to one of the appeals put before him.  He indicated the line of action that he was going to take.  He knew that his decision in that case was obviously and clearly one which the unions fighting the case did not contemplate and did not consider to be right, and in order to ease the situation he agreed to make a speaking order in that case at once <Col N="115" /> to enable an appeal to be made by way of certiorari.  It was understood when that decision was given, and it was given in the eighth month of 1927, that there was going to be an appeal taken. That appeal has not been taken since. I am not sure that it has been entirely called off, but if there is a possibility of its being taken, I suggest that it is a peculiar thing to have this House discussing the terms of an Act when these terms are, in fact, subject to judicial interpretation, and when the final interpretation has not yet been put upon them by reason of the fact that no appeal has been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sub judice, I understand, but there is still time to appeal.  I am going ahead on the assumption that the terms as interpreted in the Kearns case remain until the Court of Appeal has put some other interpretation upon them.  Deputy Davin started out by saying that the wish of the Oireachtas, with regard to the men affected by the operation of the 1924 Railways Act, was that there should not be achieved the <Col N="116" /> good of the public at the expense of the individual by reason of private hardship.  That was clearly the principle that was accepted by everyone in this House.  It was reiterated time again, even when the amending legislation was brought forward in 1926 and on that basis that there was going to be no private hardship for the public good the 1926 legislation was passed. How could one sum up what was the intention of the 1924 and 1926 Acts except by saying where a man lost his position or was prejudiced in his position or suffered in his emoluments by reason of the amalgamation, he should be compensated?  When the 1926 Act was being passed I put it to this House that they should not stand for a policy whereby the railway users would be made to pay for people whom the railway could not employ, when the lack of employment was not due to amalgamation and that policy was disclaimed by everybody and disclaimed vehemently by the representatives of the Labour Party.  It seemed at one time that the Labour Party wanted the number of men employed in 1924 should be stereotyped and that any reductions in staff would have to be compensated for either by the taxpayer or by the railway user but that policy was vehemently repudiated by the Labour Party at the time.  The situation then is that we do not want to have every redundant railway employee, where the redundancy is because of something not directly due to amalgamation, compensated. We do want to give compensation in the case of dismissal or where employment was lessened or in any way affected by the amalgamation. That is the principle.  In the Kearns case the arbitrator gave a judgment and, for the first four or five pages of that judgment, he referred to appeals generally, and then made the application of his mind on appeals generally to the specific case that was before him. Deputy Davin gave two quotations. Deputy Fahy said I asked for a sentence to be added.  One of the quotations has not yet been given in its fullness. The other I dragged from Deputy Moore.</P>

      <P>Judge Davitt, speaking of appeals in general, said this&mdash;this is a preamble to what Judge Davitt said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deciding the numerous appeals which have come before me, arising under the Third Schedule to the Railways Act of 1924, as amended by the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, has been and continues to be a matter of very considerable difficulty.  I came at an early stage to the conclusion as a matter of law, that every appellant before he could succeed in his appeal would have to satisfy me that his dismissal, or the event whatever it might be, upon which he based his claim to compensation was due to amalgamation and absorption of companies effected by or under the Railways Act of 1924.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a good start.  &ldquo;As soon as I commenced hearing these appeals it became evident that for an appellant to discharge or even shift this onus of proof was a matter of extreme difficulty.&rdquo; That is where Deputy Davin wanted to stop, but he did continue under pressure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  At any rate, the Deputy continued: &ldquo;In the majority of the appeals, if I had to decide the question upon the evidence offered up on behalf of the appellant only, I would have had to dismiss them without calling upon the respondents.&rdquo; Then the arbitrator continues: &ldquo;This course, however, I did not adopt, and in all cases required the respondents to submit evidence as to the reasons for the dismissal or the event relied on as the case might be, and this attitude upon my part was not <Col N="118" /> seriously opposed by counsel upon behalf of the respondents.  While going thus far in favour of the appellants.  I could not go the length of forcing the respondents into the position that upon them lay the onus of proving the negative&mdash;that the dismissal or other event as the case might be was not due to amalgamation.&rdquo;  In other words he was not putting the onus upon them directly of proving that amalgamation was the cause.  Take this as the final summing up by the arbitrator of his position: &ldquo;I finally came to treat the appeals in this way.  I would hear all the evidence available on both sides, and after doing so would make up my mind as best I could as to what was the cause of the dismissal or other event. If the cause was amalgamation the appellant succeeded; if it was not, he failed.&rdquo;  Could there be a better summing up of the mind of the Oireachtas in regard to compensation arising out of the Act than that last sentence?  &ldquo;I would hear all the evidence available on both sides, and after doing so would make up my mind as best I could as to what was the cause of the dismissal or other event.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer it at once.  I am making my case in my own way.  Judge Davitt continued that the particular course he followed was to get a number of cases argued before him.  &ldquo;This course had the advantage of enabling me to take a larger view of each individual case, and gave all the appellants the benefit of evidence and arguments advanced upon behalf of each particular one.&rdquo; In other words, he heard a number of cases and then took a specific case, having at the same time a background formed by the generality of cases. Judge Davitt also said:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Duffy, counsel for Mr. Kearns, put certain legal arguments very fully to me.  His preliminary argument was (1) That in so far as the 1926 Act renders it less easy for officers and servants of the amalgamated company to recover compensation. it should be construed strictly.  With this argument I agree.&rdquo; That is, construed strictly as against the company.  The arbitrator was in agreement on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what evidence he gets.  He says that before compensation is payable &ldquo;Each applicant has to come and prove to my satisfaction (1) That his services were dispensed with; (2) that they were dispensed with because they were unnecessary; <Col N="120" /> (3) that they were unnecessary by reason of certain changes of administration; (4) that these changes of administration were entirely due to amalgamation.  These averments are all positive, and though the information necessary to prove them would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the respondents, still I have been able to discover no principle of evidence which would relieve the appellants from the burden of proving these averments before they can succeed.  Although this is clearly my opinion as to the effect of this section, as already stated, I have not acted upon it in hearing these appeals so strictly as to dismiss any appeal where upon the appellant's own case he had failed to discharge the onus.  I have sought all available evidence from both sides before coming to a decision as to what was the cause of any dismissal, and such evidence has not, I am satisfied, been cursorily withheld in any case.&rdquo;  He says that although in strict law the appellant should prove four averments, he has not acted on that but has, in fact, looked to both sides to give him the evidence and he is satisfied that evidence is not withheld.</P>

      <P>I do not get that point.  He said &ldquo;I have not acted upon it in hearing these appeals so strictly as to dismiss any appeal where upon the appellant's own case he had failed to discharge the onus.&rdquo;  The next sentence says: &ldquo;I have sought all available evidence from both sides before coming to a decision as to what was the cause of any dismissal, and such evidence has not, I am satisfied, been cursorily withheld in any case.&rdquo;  In other words, he has asked both sides to put their cards on the table.  Then, having got all the evidence, he says his <Col N="121" /> principle is &ldquo;If the cause was amalgamation the appellant succeeded, if it was not he failed.&rdquo;  Is there a better interpretation both of how evidence is to be got and the principle on which compensation is to be given?  I do not think there is.  Deputy Davin says there is a case upon the judgment of the arbitrator which he quoted, not fully, and there are certain cases which he then went on to give.  As regards Donohue's case, as far as I could make out there was a case which appeared to be founded, and the railway company was asked to produce something other than hearsay evidence.  They said they could do so, and for one or two years they failed to do it.  Why was the case not brought again before the arbitrator?</P>

      <P>Then, two years have not elapsed, and that is one of the cases which has been held over because there has not been a new arbitrator.

Why were the others turned down and why did they not appeal if they thought they had a case?

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would like to amend the Act by allowing a Minister to replace the arbitrator?  I wonder would he be as popular with the railwaymen if that was the proposal?  These are the two cases that were put forward.  There are other matters that the Deputy referred to.  He referred to the D.&amp; S.E. Railway and presumed that if there had been no Amalgamation Act in 1924 the D.S.E. Rly. would still be in operation and would presumably be employing as many men as before.  Does the Deputy seriously believe that?  Does he believe there would have been no economies forced on the D.S.E. Rly., as a separate system, if there had been no amalgamation?</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy hold that all the men employed in 1924 should now be in employment?  I do not think he does.  Who is to make the distinction and who is to say whether two of the painters should be dismissed, whether six should be dismissed or the whole lot?  Surely, an arbitrator set <Col N="123" /> up to award compensation on certain terms.  The arbitrator's principle is that if amalgamation is the cause of dismissal the man will succeed, and if it is not he will fail.  Two arbitrators have resigned according to Deputy Davin, one as a protest against the Act. The Deputy amended that in answer to a question from another Deputy and said the arbitrator resigned because the 1926 proposals contained retrospective sections and he believed there was to be an inquiry into his awards.  He would not tolerate that and he resigned. That is no longer in the 1926 Act and whatever reason there was then for the resignation of the first arbitrator there are no such grounds now for resignation.  That matter disappeared before the 1926 Bill became an Act.  The Deputy positively declined to say why Judge Davitt resigned.  Judge Davitt gave his own statement that his court work occupied his time sufficiently and he had not much time to devote to any other work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government in justifying the system proposed in this Bill with reference to inscribing each ballot paper with the voter's number, said the reason was to ensure that if any voter claimed he did not receive his vote, when in fact he did receive it, the truth could be exposed and he could be shown up.  Because of the desirability of having that proof, apparently it is necessary to take steps which make the violation of the secrecy of the ballot possible.  I note the Minister has a large number of amendments down to the Bill, all of which are intended to provide for the possibility of any voter claiming that he did not receive his ballot paper.  Apparently, the Minister had not thought of that explanation of the provision in this section when he was tabling these amendments.  It appears the Minister is now suggesting <Col N="124" /> by these amendments that a person who claims he did not receive a ballot paper can secure a duplicate paper and he will be entitled to vote on the duplicate paper unless at the counting of the votes it appears he has already voted.  I would like to point out to the Minister that during the last General Election to the Dáil a number of voters in the University constituencies did claim that they had not received their ballot papers.  I have personal knowledge that a large number of them did not, in fact, receive them.  On that occasion the same system was followed. The voter's number was, no doubt, placed on the counterfoil but it does not seem to have been any benefit to the voter.  It did not help him to establish his claim that he did not receive a ballot paper.  It did not alter the result of the election in any way except that those who did not get the ballot paper did not vote.  Even in the elections carried out in other constituencies where postal voting is not the practice there is provision made for duplicate ballot papers for voters who claim they did not receive their papers. That is what it amounts to.  If a voter enters a polling booth and is told that his vote has already been recorded and he states that he did not recorded it, he gets a pink paper and he votes.  The number on the counterfoil has nothing to do with it.  There may be some reason to justify that procedure but the Minister has not told us what it is. The actual wording of this section appears to be the subject of some confusion in the Minister's mind.  It says here &ldquo;Any ballot paper on which anything except the voter's number on the back is written or marked by which a voter can be identified shall be invalid and not counted.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The voter's number is not written on the ballot paper and in the first schedule there is nothing about writing the number on the back of the ballot paper.  It is really the number of the ballot paper and not the voter's number.  The voter's number is on the counterfoil.  It is because the number on the back of the ballot paper also appears on the counterfoil on which the voter's number is written <Col N="125" /> that it is possible for any person who happens to pay particular attention to the distribution of the ballot papers and the counting of the votes to be able to know how particular people have voted.  I say that would not be possible in the case of a constituency where there is a large number of voters.  It would not be possible in the case of an election to one of the University constituencies.</P>
      <P>But where there are only two hundred voters it is possible for a candidate who happens to be present at the distribution and counting of the votes to bear in mind the numbers on the papers sent out to a particular voter, and then when the votes are being counted to note the manner in which the votes upon that paper are recorded. If I know the Minister's number on the list of voters happened to be 100, it should not be a difficult matter for me, if I am present at the sending out of the ballot papers, to note the number of the paper he gets, and when the papers are being counted to note the manner in which the Minister voted. It is because there is a possibility of that happening that we are opposed to this provision in the Bill.  There is no need for the provision, and the point I am trying to stress is that an election can take place and every possible safeguard that is required can be included, and every legal provision that is needed can be secured without this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of <Col N="126" /> having the number on the counterfoil is for the purpose of subsequent identification in the event of a petition.  That is when the pink paper comes into operation.  How is identification to be secured in this case?  It is quite possible that the word &ldquo;voters&rdquo; is unnecessary here, but if that were taken out would the Deputy's objection still stand?  Obviously, the subsequent identification ought to be provided for. There is the possibility of disqualification, the possibility of death, and so on. It would be a rather foolish proceeding to have, let us say, the full number of voting papers returned when the full number, minus one, would be the correct number voting.

I suggest that that is not necessary, that you have a provision in the Bill already by which it would be possible to say whether a voter has voted or not, without this provision. The Minister has already explained the procedure with reference to the declaration of identity forms.

      <P>He would have to sort out some 60,000 or 70,000 votes.  But it is an easy task to sort out 220 votes. As it is not necessary in either case and causes suspicion in both cases, another system should be adopted.  For the purpose of dealing with an election petition every provision required is in this Bill already to show that a particular voter did record a vote, and the insertion of this provision will cause suspicion that a loophole exists by which the particular way in which a voter has recorded his preferences can be made known.  That does not affect the members on this side of the House, as we are in favour of open voting, but it may affect the Cumann na nGaedheal members.  They may not be anxious to let Ministers know how they vote, and I suggest that in the interests of Cumann na nGaedheal members this particular provision should be deleted.</P>

      <P>It might meet the Deputy, if instead of the voter's number some counterfoil number were on the back of the ballot paper, and that would meet the situation.  In connection with this you have to read paragraph 14 of the Second Schedule, which says that when votes are being counted the ballot papers shall, as far as practicable, be kept face upwards. However, between this and the Report Stage I will consider the question of having the counterfoil number on the back of the ballot paper instead of the voter's actual number.</P>

    <P>(2)  Every declaration of identity shall be in the prescribed form and shall be exempt from stamp duty and shall be a statutory Declarations under the Statutory Declarations Act, 1835, and if made in Saorstát Eireann shall be made before a peace commissioner, commissioner for oaths, or notary public to whom he is personally known, and if made outside Saorstát Eireann shall be made before a person to whom he is personally known and who is authorised by the law of the place in which it is made to administer oaths.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person entitled to vote at a Seanad election shall be entitled to vote at that election in the following and no other manner, that is to say, by marking and returning by post to the Seanad returning officer the ballot paper sent to him under this section together with the form of declaration of identity similarly sent to him duly made and completed by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 16.  Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Whenever a person to whom a ballot paper for a Seanad election should be sent under the foregoing sub-section states in writing to the Seanad returning officer that more than twenty-four hours have elapsed since such ballot paper should have been delivered to him in the ordinary course of post and that he has not received such ballot paper and that <Col N="131" /> he desires a duplicate ballot paper and declaration of identity to be issued to him, the Seanad returning officer, if such statement is received by him not less than forty-eight hours before the close of the poll at such election, shall forthwith or, if such statement is received by him less than forty-eight hours before the close of the poll at such election, may send by registered post to such person at the address mentioned in the foregoing sub-section a ballot paper and form of declaration of identity which, by being printed on paper of a special colour or otherwise are clearly distinguished as duplicates of the ballot paper and form of declaration of identity originally sent to such person under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to make provision by which when a Deputy or Senator does not get a voting paper issued to him by the returning officer with in a reasonable time, and complains to the returning officer that he has not got the ballot paper and establishes that fact he should have a duplicate ballot paper issued to him. A case might arise in which, owing to a railway accident, or a fire in the Post Office or some circumstance like that, a ballot paper might be destroyed on its way out.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Every Declaration of Identity shall be in the prescribed Form and shall be exempt from Stamp Duty and shall be a Statutory Declaration under the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835, and shall be <Col N="132" /> made in Saorstát Eireann before a Peace Commissioner, Commissioner for Oaths, or Notary Public, to whom he is personally known.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to which I made reference already.  The Bill provides that the declaration of identity shall be prescribed in certain form in this country and if made outside Saorstát Eireann shall be made before a person authorised by law of the place in which it is made to administer oaths. I propose the deletion of the second portion of the section and to provide that the declaration of identity shall be sworn in Saorstát Eireann and not outside it.  As I pointed out, there are three courses possible in respect of this matter.  Either you can make provision in this Bill by which every member of the Oireachtas, no matter in what part of the world he may be, will be given reasonable opportunity of recording his vote, or you can provide that only such members of the Oireachtas as are in the Saorstát on the occasion of the election shall record their votes, or lastly you can have a section in the Bill&mdash;this is the most satisfactory of all&mdash;to provide that members of the Oireachtas in Saorstát Eireann and members of the Oireachtas who may happen to be in other countries at that time may record their votes.  It seems impracticable to provide that members of the Oireachtas in every part of the world, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South America&mdash;no matter where they may be&mdash;should be given facilities to record their vote.  I suggest that the best alternative to that is to provide that only such members of the Oireachtas as are in Saorstát Eireann on the occasion of the election shall vote and not to make provision for giving facilities to those who happen to be in England mainly, as particularly, with the suggested alteration of the date, that would apply practically exclusively to England. That provision was, no doubt, inserted to meet the case of certain Senators normally resident in England and whom it was thought inadvisable to put to the inconvenience of coming to this country to record their votes on the occasion of the Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Personally, I will support, and the members on this side of the House will support, an amendment that will be moved subsequently by Deputy Davin, and which provides that voters must not merely be in this country, but must come to this House to record their votes in person.  But we may assume that the usual majority will support the Minister for Local Government, in opposition to that amendment and that it will be defeated.</P>

      <P>They may do it all right, but on the assumption I have made I am trying to amend the Bill and make it a little better than it is.  I think this would be a very satisfactory amendment.  I would like to hear from the Minister what reasons he has for opposing it&mdash;why these facilities should be given to voters in England to record their votes and not given to voters in the United States.  It seems extraordinary that if the President happened to be in the United States on another tour next November he would not be able to vote, whereas if he were in England cementing the sympathetic bonds that bind us to the British Commonwealth of Nations he would be able to record his vote.  Of the three alternative methods which may be taken, I am convinced the best is that provided in the amendment, and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept it, or else be able to adduce a very satisfactory case against it.</P>

He has spoken a great deal about England, but his amendment would make it impossible for anybody in that part of Ireland not now included in the Saorstát to vote.  It would apply to the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he went home as well as to Deputy MacEntee. I do not think we need waste very many words upon an amendment which is an entirely hypothetical one.  It is practically certain that all through <Col N="134" /> November all of us will be here, and not in the United States or in England.</P>

Whatever may be said for Deputy Davin's amendment&mdash;and a good deal may be said for the idea that we should vote as a public function and as part of our duty as representatives&mdash;I do not see that anything would be gained by the acceptance of Deputy Lemass's amendment.  It simply may mean disallowing the vote of a Deputy or Senator who happened to be away from the Saorstát and was taken ill.  There are Deputies not only on one side of the House, but on both sides, who are absent from the House at the present time. I hope they will not be taken ill.  But if they were, it surely would be desirable to allow them to exercise their functions.  Let them take the trouble to go to the Commissioner for Oaths or to whomsoever the responsible authority may be.  I think it would apply not merely to England, but also to France and Belgium and to Northern Ireland, which seems to me the most important point of all.  We should not accept this amendment of Deputy Lemass, moderately as it is urged.</P>

      <P>I think I should be allowed to move Amendment 19 before Amendment 18, because if Amendment 19 is defeated or rejected by the Minister, No. 18 would not in my opinion be necessary.  With the leave of the Chair, I therefore move Amendment 19, which is to delete sub-section (3), Personally, I cannot see any justification for the introduction of postal voting for the Seanad election, except to enable people to remain in London or somewhere else away from the meeting place which they are supposed to attend, and at the same time retain their influence over the government of this country.  The Minister for Local Government knows that the postal system of voting was introduced as an emergency during the European War to enable people who, for reasons of their own, joined the British Army to take part in elections.  I do not see why we should copy the example set by the British Government during a period of emergency when there is no real emergency here in the circumstances under which the Seanad election will take place.  It is the personal duty and responsibility of each Senator and Deputy to attend the place of meeting. I do not think that they should be given facilities to remain away, especially on an occasion of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I read a speech of Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll at a branch meeting of Cumann na nGaedheal in Dublin North when, perhaps, the Minister for Local Government was present.  She encouraged the Government to push a measure through this House which would penalise citizens who did not exercise their civic duty by recording their votes at the Dáil election.  I wonder is she going to follow the Minister for Local Government into the Division Lobby in support <Col N="138" /> of a clause which will release her and members of the Seanad from carrying out that very duty which they expect ordinary citizens to perform.  They are paid to vote under the Constitution of this country, unless they can give good reasons for staying away, but the ordinary citizen is not paid for voting. Some Senators, a small number I admit, have been absent from all the meetings of the Seanad held during the past three years.  It is a national disgrace and a public scandal if this House is going to allow people who refuse to attend to do the nation's business and to criticise in a constructive way legislation going through the Seanad, or Dáil if you like, to remain away and to vote in this election.</P>

      <P>The object is to insist on putting back into the Seanad the same type of people as those who will not attend to do the nation's business although they took an oath under the Constitution to do so.  We are following this precedent set up by the British Government when it introduced the system of postal voting during the European War.  There is no national emergency here.  Indeed, so far as I know, the people of the country would not worry whether there was no Seanad election, whether it was carried out by the Seanad and Dáil voting together or in any other way.  It is the opinion of the country that the Seanad, as composed to-day, has not justified itself, and that its members have neither justified themselves nor that institution. I quoted figures earlier in the evening to show that, if all the members of the Seanad attended, they would have been paid £4 10s. 0d. an hour.  Why should we waste a twopenny stamp or the price of a registered letter on these people who may be away on the Riviera or in Belfast and who are paid £4 10s. 0d. an hour to attend the Seanad and to do the business of the State?  The people who will go into the Seanad as a result of the coming election will have considerable influence, if they want to exercise it, over the measures coming up there within the next three years.  I appeal <Col N="139" /> to the Minister to set a good example to the ordinary citizen by compelling people who are responsible for legislation to do what they expect other people to do.  Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll encouraged the Government to penalise those who refused to do their duty as citizens at elections.  Why then should we facilitate persons who have not attended the Seanad by sending them ballot papers through the post?  I appeal to the Minister to cut this undesirable clause out of the Bill.</P>

Here we have members who are drawing salaries, and special facilities are given to them to stay away on the Continent or elsewhere and to vote from there at the Seanad elections.  I think that, in particular, the Minister who in all probability was the promoter of the Bill for paying travelling allowances to county councillors should at least have the courage of the conviction which I am sure he felt when he introduced that Bill and compel them to do their duty by attending the meetings.  I am sure he will have the courage of that conviction now and say that members who are getting £1 a day and travelling expenses should at least attend to cast their votes.  I am sure that he will realise the unfairness of what he is doing and that he will consent to this amendment.</P>

      <P>The proposal to have postal voting for the Seanad election is dictated by the interests and convenience of the work of the Oireachtas solely, and not for the convenience of any particular party or section. Deputies on the Labour and on the opposite benches have taken advantage of the discussion ranging round the Seanad to raise arguments and catchcries of a class or political kind for class or political purposes.  We cannot <Col N="140" /> allow ourselves to be drawn away from a line of action that is dictated to us by considering the interests of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It is to the interests of the Oireachtas that if the Oireachtas were not meeting in the autumn, as the Oireachtas might not, members should not have to come to Dublin for the purpose of carrying out a Seanad election.  For the purpose of carrying out a Seanad election, a panel is set up by the Dáil and a panel by the Seanad and the election has subsequently to be carried out.  The preparation of a panel by the Dáil and by the Seanad is governed by regulations drawn up by the Dáil and the Seanad respectively.  They have nothing to do with the Bill.  The Bill prescribes that they shall be drawn up, and if the work of the Oireachtas is in such a state that there need be no autumn session, then the regulations of the Dáil and the Seanad for the preparation of the panel can be framed so that the panel can be prepared if necessary by postal voting, or can be prepared before members separate for the summer recess so that the bringing together of the Oireachtas unnecessarily for the purpose of carrying out the actual voting for the Seanad election is considered undesirable.</P>

      <P>There is one other point.  Many members of the Oireachtas might not be able to attend on the particular day that would be set aside for the Seanad elections, either through sickness or urgent business. Many members of the Dáil find very often that they are not able to attend on a particular day because of urgent business.  It is undesirable when they can be facilitated by being allowed to cast their votes by postal <Col N="141" /> voting that they should be brought away from a sick bed or from urgent business.</P>

      <P>Deputies are supposed to vote here on the arguments they hear, and they have to be here in order to hear these arguments.  There is another very important matter, too, and that is the secrecy of the ballot. The secrecy of the ballot for a Seanad election, by the Dáil and the Seanad, can be much more easily secured by postal voting than by a system of personal attendance.  Rather elaborate arrangements would have to be set up here bearing on the secrecy of the ballot if personal attendance of members of the Dáil and the Seanad were required for the purpose of voting at the Seanad elections.  For these three reasons principally, but above all for the personal convenience of members of the Dáil and the Seanad, a system of postal voting is proposed for the Seanad elections.</P>

      <P>If it were more convenient for the people generally and the carrying on of these elections <Col N="142" /> for a postal vote to be arranged I could see many good reasons why it should be arranged.  It would be much easier for a Deputy in a country constituency to have the voting paper delivered at his house and to ask him within a certain number of days to return it by post than to have him drive four or five miles to a polling booth on a wet day. It is not practical to introduce that in ordinary elections to the Dáil where the ordinary electors of the country are voting.</P>

      <P>There is one thing he did say that contains a good deal of truth and explains a good many things.  He said in reply to Deputy Anthony that the reason this admirable system of postal voting could not be extended to the Dáil and the reason why the members of the Dáil on ordinary occasions could not receive the special considerations which they do in connection with the election to the Seanad was that members are supposed to vote on the arguments they hear.  I think having heard the argument we begin to understand the reason for the present appearance of the Government Benches.  Those loyal members of the Party were anxious that even their loyalty should not suffer too great a strain and that they should not be compelled to sit here and listen to the arguments put forward in support of this measure by the Minister for Local Government lest they might for once refuse to obey the Whips and vote as their common sense, as their sense of civic duty would dictate to them in support of Deputy Davin's amendment. I think the Minister himself is conscious of the fact that this proposal cannot be justified.</P>

      <P>If those special facilities are extended to the members of the Dáil and Senate on this most important occasion why should they not be extended on every other occasion? I think that is the logical extension of the Minister's own argument which will defeat it.  If it is a good and proper thing to do on this occasion why not extend it first of all to the divisions that take place in the Dáil, why not allow Deputies to register their votes by post?  If we did that at least it would have this advantage; it would make life a good deal easier for the Whips of his Party.  Instead of continuing in an almost impossible task of keeping together that tenuous majority they would be able to look after their own private affairs and as those of us know who have occasion to debate questions here on their merit they would at least discharge their duty as effectively and efficiently as they have hitherto done since they have come to the Dáil.  The Minister said the proposal is dictated by the interest and convenience of the work of the Oireachtas only.  We on this side of the House, at any rate, representing a considerable section of the House, and Deputy Davin, on behalf of his Party, representing also a considerable section of his House and a considerable interest in the country, question that and contest it most strongly.  We ask the Minister before the debate on this motion concludes to define what are the interests of the Oireachtas and whose convenience it is that this proposal is designed to meet.  We, hitherto, in discussing the Senate have laboured under some misapprehension.  We have on occasions, referred to it as Seanad Eireann.  If this proposal is adopted I think we shall have to extend the term. It looks to me as if it is going to be the Seanad of the United Kingdom.  It might even be the Seanad of Europe. It might even become the Seanad of the World, because men who never put a foot in Ireland possibly since first they were returned to that Seanad or have visited the country on very rare occasions would be able by their votes cast, while they were living in the wilds of Kamschatka, to elect members to one of the legislative Houses of <Col N="144" /> this country.  I think that is an impossible position.  I think we should not operate it.  I think that if men are given, if you like, as under the Government proposals they will be given, the privilege of electing members to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas that at least there ought to be imposed upon them the condition of tendering their votes for whatever candidates they select in person.  I do not see how, as a self-respecting body, we can do anything else than that.</P>
      <P>We know, of course, that the Minister is afraid to divulge the real reason for this.  We know it is out of that particular regard which the Minister and the other members of the Government have for a particular class.  We know that they look up to the aristocrats of another land.  They have already by nomination given them a certain privilege in this country.  They wish to continue them to exercise that privilege but they know, at the same time, that the regard which these privileged persons have for the country which has so honoured them is of the slightest and that if even to continue themselves in office they had to come here and tender their votes in person they would probably neglect to cast their votes.  Therefore the Minister has introduced a proposal for postal voting in this Bill so that these people, who have never been friends of this country, but of whom the Government would like to make friends of themselves should not be called upon to sully their immaculate feet with the soil of Ireland. Deputy Boland put this in a nutshell. He said if they want to vote let them come home to vote.  If the Government Party, in order to secure the election of its panel, wants to have the support of this particular class, let the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the very able chief Whip of the Government Party, for once enact the rôle of &ldquo;Little Bo-Peep.&rdquo; Let him bring home his sheep and let them bring their votes behind them.  I think that at least the Minister, in trying to justify his proposal, should not have contradicted himself, at least should not have stultified himself.  He tried to justify it by some reference to the manner of preparing a panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> So far we have not seen any regulations for preparing the panel.  Most of us assumed that if we wished to vote for candidates for inclusion in that panel we should have to tender our votes in person here in the Dáil.  Now the Minister foreshadows that we shall be able to register our votes or to indicate our preferences for a particular candidate for inclusion in the panel through the post.  I am afraid that was an afterthought of the Minister, one which he had not well considered, but, at any rate, I am fairly certain that it would be impracticable.  To leave that one side for a moment, he did suggest that the panel for the election could be prepared some time, say, during the summer or during the end of the summer session.  Why could not the election for the Seanad take place at the end of the summer session also?  The only argument with any show of reason in it that he advanced for this proposal, was that the Dáil might not be in session in the autumn. We know that so far as this autumn is concerned, judging by the programme which is put before us, that we are bound to be in session.  We are in session to-day and the election has to take place, I think, some time before the 6th of December.  So far as this election is concerned, therefore, there is no weight in the argument of the Minister.  This present election could take place and the members could tender their votes in person.  I would suggest that we should let the future take care of itself. We, here on these benches, are not without hope that better times will bring better measures and better men, and that in a short time and before the next election is due, there will be in power a Government which will not feel called upon to elect a Seanad, but which will tear up that House root and branch and substitute for it some assembly which will have real functions in this State, and which will not be simply a wasteful and extravagant &mdash;I cannot say ornament&mdash;excrescence upon the State.  Why not then leave the future to take care of itself?  This election can take place without this postal voting.  Only those people who take sufficient interest in this country to come here because they are voters <Col N="146" /> and Senators should be allowed to participate in that election, and accordingly, on these grounds I ask the House, at any rate, to support the amendment proposed by Deputy Davin.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has made a suggestion that fourteen days should be allowed, during which time a member of the Oireachtas could present himself here and vote.  I think it is a very useful one.  I want to say, so far as the statement of the Minister is concerned, I think that the proposal made in the Bill is one of the most ridiculous that I ever heard of coming from a responsible Minister.  All parties in this House have condemned, from election platforms and in this House, the apathy shown by electors at election periods.  We have had many instances of where less than fifty percent. of the voters presented themselves at the polls.  That was condemned by all parties in this House, and this evening we are asked to encourage such a system, and even in the persons of members of the Oireachtas. Surely an example should be shown by Senators and Deputies in the matter of public and civic spirit, and if Senators and Deputies&mdash;Senators particularly&mdash; do not consider it worth their while to come to this House or to the other House and record their votes they are not worthy to sit in either of the Chambers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no particular virtue in the proposal to fix a period of fourteen days in which Deputies could get their ballot papers and hand in their votes.  Why it should be argued that to receive your ballot paper by post and to return it by post is a worse system than to enable you to come up any time within fourteen days and get your paper and vote I cannot understand.  Deputy Anthony complains of apathy on the part of voters. His way of getting rid of apathy is to put responsible people like members of the Dáil and Seanad to the necessity of taking a journey from their constituencies, or their places of business, for the purpose of recording a vote which might quite easily be recorded by post. I think it is a proposal that would help to dispel a little apathy if it makes it <Col N="147" /> more easy for busy and responsible people to record their votes.</P>

      <P>I do not often feel sympathy with the President.  I do not think he deserves it as a rule, but certainly my heart bled for him as he sat there unable, with decency, to leave the House, and had to listen to the extraordinary exhibition of incompetence, stupidity, bad argument and sound common front bench manner of debate which he had to listen to from the Minister for Local Government, this inspired superman who is accustomed to lecture us on these Benches.  Just try and measure the brain power which you have opposite.  The Minister for Local Government has just told you&mdash;I am not saying it about him, he is saying it himself&mdash;that he is incapable of devising a system within this building by which 152 Dáil members and 60 Senators can use a secret ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible.  He could not say how it could be done.  The secrecy of the ballot would be violated if the people came here.  Now that is his statement.  It was difficult to obtain a secret ballot within the ambit of his intelligence.  And that is the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government, knowing what this House knows, tells us that things here are decided on argument.  Now, he knows that this House knows that he is stating what is false.  He knows that.  And the poor unfortunate President, hardly recovered from the toil and trouble of his great meanderings, has to come back here and to sit and listen to that meandering by that man whom he is responsible for recommending to the country as a man capable of responsibility and a man proper to put over the functions of an office in this State.  We are not to have these people voting by a secret ballot, which he cannot design, because he would not ask help from anybody else.  It is against the standard and principle of the superman to ask for help from anybody. Because there might not be an autumn session! When was there not to be an autumn session? Except when they were running stunt general elections. Are we to assume that the ordinary thing is going to be a stunt general <Col N="148" /> election?  By what has been the normal experience of this House, an autumn session will be held if legislation in this House is to be discussed instead of being railroaded through as it has been railroaded up to the present.  We are asked to do this thing on the chance that there is going to be no autumn session some time&mdash;no autumn session nine years hence or six years hence. I forget to what particular position they have reduced it now, but we are asked to do this on the chance that we are not to have an autumn session. Now, those are the ludicrous sort of follies which the Minister on that side of the House has the stupidity to offer to this House.  The personal convenience of the general electors and the personal convenience of the electorate do not matter at all.  It is the personal convenience of a special electorate.  Is this more of the pact and the bargain? The Upper House is disturbed in the function which it possesses.  It wants compensation.  It is going to vote from the bed.  Breakfast in bed for the Senators.  Why on earth does he not arrange that the Minister shall have the power as proxy of the Seanad to vote for them and to save them the trouble of opening the envelope?  Why they are asked to go to this trouble, I do not know.  That would be just as sensible an argument.  There are a certain number of these people whom they begged or bribed or bluffed on the other side to pretend to show their love for the new system which is supposed to exist in this country.  As a result they begged some of them to become Senators.  They begged them to be allowed to be nominated so as to add an air of respectability and responsibility to an otherwise horribly democratic assembly.  These people are to be convenienced.  That is the sort of argument that is being offered to you, and I say it is a disgrace even to the Cumann na nGaedheal Front Bench.</P>

      <P>I do not like following Deputy Flinn or taking any notice of him because I am satisfied that he speaks simply to pretend to the people of his constituency that he is a very useful member of this House. I put it to any person who has any <Col N="149" /> sense of decency whether or not what we have just listened to is worthy of the Dáil or worthy of this country.  I do not think it is.  I hope, as we grow older, that speeches like that we have listened to will not be made here.  They show very bad breeding and the Deputy is not badly bred.  The Deputy is well educated and what he has said is most unworthy of him.  No Senator was begged, bribed or coaxed to become a member of the Seanad.  It is an untrue statement to say that any Senator was begged, bribed or coaxed to become a member of the Seanad. The proposal here is a simple one, that is the proposal made by Deputy Davin. It is not to have postal voting.  He wants the members to come here.  I recollect within the past few years here a good deal of criticism about bringing up people from the country for one day. They can come any time within a fortnight. But it would mean a very considerable expense to get them to come here.  Why is it that postal voting is introduced?  Principally to save expense, in connection with any of the other constituencies in respect of which postal voting is allowed&mdash;the expense of bringing the person to the place of election.  The two universities have got it and voters are not supplied with railway vouchers to come to the university for the casting of their votes.  In the same way here, there may or there may not be an autumn session.  There might not be an autumn session during the particular week or fortnight in which the election might be held and postal voting would be a convenience in many respects.  The Deputy may not have much business to attend to.  Other Deputies have.</P>

That is a small miserable sectionalism, doing no credit to the person responsible for it or to the place whence he comes or to the party to <Col N="150" /> which he belongs and we ought to have no more of it.  It was never propounded from any political platform in this country that I ever heard of, or that was ever anxious to keep up the name or the good fame of the people or any of its sections.  The country is composed of many sections and it is no credit to any one section to throw contumely on any other section.  The less we have of that cheap sort of talk: &ldquo;I am a great fellow, a big fellow, I have a great big head and I am a great big man and I can think better than anybody else&rdquo;&mdash;the less of that sort of thing, the better.

      <P>On December, 1927, there was a meeting held which lasted ten minutes.  I can go on and give the President information of these meetings which would show that there has been waste, with his knowledge or without his knowledge, I do not know which.  Now, there was a reason given by the Minister for Local Government that there was quite a possibility that <Col N="151" /> there would be no autumn session.  Did the Minister for Local Government sit at a meeting of the Executive Council which, according to inspired Press writers, was held for the purpose of considering the business of the present session?  We have been supplied with a list of the Estimates which as yet have not been discussed.  We were told that certain Bills are in the earlier stages, and that a lot of other Bills are to be discussed, and we all know that there is more business here this autumn session than there has been during any autumn session held here.  The President knows well that in former years the discussion on the Estimates never went into the autumn session.  We have most of the Estimates to go through yet, and the Minister for Local Government was going too far when he asked the members of this House to believe that there was a possibility of an early adjournment, and that we are not to do the business we were called here to do in the ordinary way.  He states that the members of the Seanad and the Dáil should not be brought here unnecessarily, for this particular purpose.  If the Seanad as an institution, is necessary as a Parliamentary institution in this country, it is equally necessary that the people who have a right to constitute that Seanad should be brought here for that work, and that those who are too lazy to come here should not get facilities.  I am glad Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll, a member for the same constituency as the Minister, is here now.  I am sorry she was not here the last time, but Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll, at a meeting of the Cumann na nGaedheal Organisation, is reported to have suggested that the Government should penalise people who refused to recognise their civic duty and vote at elections.  I hope Deputy Mrs. Collins-O'Driscoll will not follow the Minister for Local Government into the lobby in favour of those who are against the ideas which she advocated at a meeting of the Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to the statement made by the President that it may be possible that members of the House have got more important work to do <Col N="152" /> than coming here, that they have to attend to their own private business, and that they should attend to that before they attend to their public duties, I have only to say this, that when a person comes along and takes an oath&mdash; and an oath is a solemn undertaking in this particular case&mdash;and is sworn in here, it is quite plain that he swears to serve the people who sent him here, to serve them faithfully and conscientiously. Now, the first principle of service is attendance at the place where the laws are made, and this is equally important as any Bill we have here for discussion, because the very people who are to get on to the Seanad are the people who are to make the laws.  It is right, I think, that they should come here and do the work which they are paid to do.  The President told us when he came here before this House and made a case against the election to the Seanad by the people of the country a number of things.  He pointed out to the members of the Fianna Fáil and other parties who are present that the people had not taken advantage of the opportunity given them three years ago in the election to the Seanad, and he pointed to the fact that only 33? per cent. of the electorate exercised the franchise on that occasion.  That was the reason the President gave for the alteration in the law, that was the reason the President gave for allowing the electors to elect the Seanad.</P>

      <P>But a very important one, if I can remember the President's stirring speech on that occasion.  Now he is going to allow public representatives who have not a proper sense of their public duty to remain away in London or some foreign place, and he proposes to give them facilities to remain there instead of forcing them to come here to vote.  I am hoping that the Ministers will not carry through this proposal for postal voting, because if they insist on carrying it through they will live to regret the day when they were a party to it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), page 5, line 2, before the word &ldquo;post&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;registered or ordinary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is to enable ballot papers to be returned to the returning officer by registered post if the voter so desires, so that arrangements may be made whereby, through the operation of the Post Office machinery, he can get an acknowledgment from the Post Office of the delivery of his letter to the returning officer.  There are consequential provisions, so that if a voter does not get an acknowledgment from the Post Office within a reasonable time that the letter has been delivered to the returning officer he can take steps to approach the returning officer with a view to having a duplicate ballot paper issued.  It leads up to an analogous position later on, enabling a duplicate ballot paper to be issued in the case of a ballot paper lost on the return journey.</P>
