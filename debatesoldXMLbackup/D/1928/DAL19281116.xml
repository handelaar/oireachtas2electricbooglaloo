We do not want to be responsible for continuing this Act on the Statute Book, and if this is, as I believe, going to be a real Public Safety Bill, we see no reason at all why, for example, you would have anything more than: &ldquo;Section 1 of The Public Safety Act, 1927, No. 31, is hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,305 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the President of the Executive Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on the discussion on the Vote for the establishment of the Governor-General, this Estimate calls for a sum which is only three-sevenths of that, and there is some justification anyhow for a Vote for the Department of the President on the ground of work to be done.  At the same time we think that there are still reductions possible even in that Department. We are going to vote against this, however, not so much on the ground that a reduction is possible as on the ground that we disagree with the whole public policy of the Executive Council. If we were to confine ourselves to the question of reductions.  I am afraid that there is very little hope that the House would do anything in the matter, seeing that a majority was prepared to pass the wholly indefensible Estimate for the Governor-General's establishment. As far as reductions are concerned <Col N="335" /> we have to go back again to the old question of the scale of salaries. To my mind it is not a question as to whether the salaries are or are not earned.  It is a question of the standard that is being set for salaries generally, and we believe the salaries in public departments cannot be cut down to the proper level unless a proper example is set at the head by the Ministers.  In speaking on the Estimate for the Governor-General I pointed out that the President of the United States of America, who was the real head of the State, who was an Executive Officer, only got £15,000, that he had to look after business that involved the welfare of 117,000,000 of people, that the area which was under his jurisdiction was one hundred times the size of Ireland, and that the 117,000,000 of people who bore his salary were comparatively the richest people in the world.  The position here is very different from that.  The average income of the ordinary citizen in this country is possibly not more than £200.  We think that to pay £2,500 to the President of the Executive Council is altogether out of proportion to that sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk of salaries, it is objected that you need big salaries if you are going to get proper people to fill positions.  Now we all know that the heads of Departments in the Ministry are not recruited simply on that basis. They come largely there by a vote of the people, and they are very often elected not for their administrative capacity but because they stand for certain principles and certain ideas. Therefore we ought not to apply in that case at all the standards that would be applied in business.  It is said also, for instance, when we talk of the Civil Service, that if we do not give salaries substantially equivalent to those which they would get anywhere in business we cannot have the best men; that it is necessary to retain the best brains in the country, so to speak, by giving them these high salaries.  I do not think so at all.  I think brains as good as any we have are going out on the emigrant ship week after week, and that in many cases it is a question of opportunity; that we are, in fact, by paying these high salaries, and by the lack of employment <Col N="336" /> in other directions which follow from wrong standards, sending out the best brains of the country, so that I do not think a case can be made at all in this matter for the standard of high salaries, and any of the excuses that are put forward I hold and believe are not tenable.  I said also in the discussion on the Estimate for the Governor-General's establishment that in this matter we ought not to follow the example of big countries like the United States or England; that we ought, if we want to be prosperous as some of the smaller countries in Europe are prosperous, to consider our own resources and set standards by them. Those are the best standards.  Instead of taking as models large countries whose conditions are altogether different from ours, we ought to look to some of the small countries in Europe where there is relatively higher prosperity than there is in some of the larger countries, and take them for our standard.  Look at Belgium.  In Belgium we find, for example, that a secretary of a department gets a salary of £457, rising by increments to £514, with an allowance for children of £13 2s., making a total going from £470 to £527. Out of that there is also a percentage set aside for insurance for widows and orphans in the case of death.  He has to contribute to a fund for that purpose. Here we find that the secretaries of departments get salaries ranging from £1,200 to £1,500.  There are two secretaries in the President's Department, but the Parliamentary Secretary is in a different class, and I am talking in this connection of the Civil Service.  The President's secretary has a salary of £1,200.  In Belgium the scale of salary is fixed.  Here there is no definite scale.  For instance, the Secretary of the Department of Finance here gets a salary of £1,500, and the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce gets the same.  The Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture and of Education get £1,200, but the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs has a salary of £1,000, rising by annual increments of £50 to £1,200.</P>
    <P>In the case of Belgium, there has been no cost of living bonus since 1923, when the present scale of salaries was <Col N="337" /> fixed.  All these salaries that I have mentioned have a bonus&mdash;a bonus of well over £200, bringing the £1,200 salaries to something about £1,400, and the £1,500 salaries up to £1,700 or £1,800.  We think, therefore, that the administrative policy of the President and the Executive Council generally is not the proper one for the circumstances and conditions of this country, and we believe that to vote for the Estimate for the President's Department would be condoning that type of policy.</P>
    <P>Coming to the President's salary itself, there was the question of maintaining the dignity of the office.  My view is that the dignity of the office will be largely dependent on the person who holds it, and that no amount of externals will increase the dignity of the office unless the person who holds it is in himself a person who wins respect, and, by his actions generally, indicates that he understands what the dignity of the office is.  I believe that to try to bolster up an office by any externals of the kind which come from additional salaries, equipment, and so on, is a mistake.  I think that what our people want is simplicity; not to be aping in any respect the conditions in other countries, which are altogether beyond our means.  It will be held that the sum which is given to the President is not intended so much as a personal salary as to enable him to entertain, etc.  The same thing was said about the Governor-General, and possibly the same thing will be said about some of the other Ministers.  My view is that if there are to be entertainments of a public character, there ought to be an arrangement by which these would be undertaken by a special department for them, if you want to have it, or at least that there should be a special section charged with them, and that all these matters ought to be subject to a definite vote and a definite audit. I think this is a wrong way, and I think it is not fair to the President, if the great bulk of that sum is spent on entertainments, to have that huge sum credited to him&mdash;huge, I say, in comparison with the country's resources and the general income of the average citizen.  It is not fair that that sum should be debited to him if, in fact, <Col N="338" /> it is spent in a public way, and in a way for which we all ought to take public responsibility.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said, our main reason for opposing this Vote is not altogether because of the reductions that we think could be made in it.  We believe that a reduction of at least 20 per cent could be made in that Vote, and if we were able to get reductions of 20 per cent. here and 20 per cent. elsewhere, in the long run we would be able to get a general reduction that would be getting near 20 per cent at least. There is scarcely an office that we have taken up in which we have not been able to point out the possibility of a 20 per cent. reduction.  We believe that we could point out how a reduction of 20 per cent. could be made in this Vote without in any way taking away from the effectiveness of the work of the office.  But it is because of the general national policy&mdash;national in the political sense&mdash;the economic and the general administrative policy of the Government that we are opposing this Vote.  We are opposing it from the point of view of national politics, because we have been, and are still, opposed to the policy which the present Executive represents.  We believe, even assuming that they have been supported in the policy which they proposed to the country, that they are not genuinely carrying out that policy.  We have to point, for example, to the attitude of the Executive on the Boundary question, and we have to point to their surrender on the financial question.  We do not yet know what is the position with respect to certain matters that are mentioned in the Treaty&mdash;for example, the question of coastal defence, or those matters that are in the Annexe to the Treaty&mdash;conventions and various matters.  We do not know what the position is in regard to them.  For example, with regard to the Governor General, they tell us that he has to do what he is told, that we have complete power, and I think the Minister for Finance said that he is in no way the representative of a foreign Power, that he is part of our institutions here, and that we are free to do as we please, which I take it, if there is any sense in it at all, means that we are free to deal <Col N="339" /> with that office as we choose.  I do not know whether any change has taken place in that office so far as its being the medium of communication between the Executive of the Free State and the British Government is concerned.</P>
    <P>When we pointed out some years ago that the Governor-General was the agent of a foreign Government we were told that that was not a fact; and yet we find that it was only a year or two ago that it was definitely and publicly recognised that he was.  We have seen the documents in relation to a number of matters between the two countries that passed through his hands, and therefore we have definite evidence that he was definitely a representative in this country of a foreign Government. Since the last Imperial Conference it would appear that a different practice is contemplated.  I would like to know whether the new practice of completely shutting off any intermediary, and dealing as between Government and Government and Executive and Executive, obtains now. There are a number of matters between the two countries in the carrying out of this policy which the Executive represent of which we are ignorant. When it suits them they tell us that they are only forms.  If so there ought to be very little difficulty in making these forms correspond to our wishes. They say at election times: &ldquo;Oh, that means war,&rdquo; when the electorate have to be frightened&mdash;that these forms are substantial things&mdash;but when we try to urge them to take up a proper national attitude they always ask us why should we trouble about things that are unreal and of no substance whatever.  Our view is that these are important matters, from the point of the general peace and stability of the country, and that the sooner the facts are as the Executive Council would represent them&mdash;the sooner that the facts and the forms correspond&mdash;the better for us all.</P>
    <P>I said that the general national policy of the Executive does not satisfy us.  We believe that they have been guilty for a number of years past of deceiving the people as to what they were intending to do, and as to what <Col N="340" /> the results of their action would be. We were told at the start that the Treaty meant independence, that it meant a Constitution which we ourselves could frame freely without any interference from outside.  I think I have referred already to where the Chief Justice, talking of that Constitution, claimed it as &ldquo;all their own.&rdquo; We know that is not true.  We know that Constitution is not all our own. The records of the Provisional Parliament and the statements on more than one occasion since of responsible Ministers prove the contrary.  It is a Constitution which, in respect to the Articles that were regarded as vital from the national standpoint, was imposed on us from without, and a good deal of the expense of the administration is consequent on the fact that that Constitution is an imposed Constitution and not one which the Irish people, given freedom to choose, would have chosen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose was to show that there was a continual deception, on the part of the Executive Council, of the people as to what they were doing and as to what would be the result of their policy.  I think it is fair to assume that if people have deceived in the past, they are capable of deceiving in the future, and on that ground we think that they are not the proper persons to hold the offices of responsibility they are holding at the moment.</P>
      <P>The next point on the question of deception was the matter in connection with the Boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really outside the scope altogether, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point was that of the financial settlement. That is an immediate effective thing which is affecting us, and will continue to affect us.  We see that the policy of the Executive Council is to maintain <Col N="341" /> that settlement.  They talk about them as honourable agreements.  The President, only a day or two ago, spoke of the Treaty, and that they will be treated as honourable agreements freely entered into.  We know perfectly well that the majority of the people of this country do not regard them as agreements they have entered into freely, and do not regard themselves as morally bound in any way to fulfil these conditions.  The burden which they imposed on the people is far beyond the people's ability to bear, and consequently the people of Ireland feel they are not bound, morally or in conscience, to maintain these, and it is the duty of any Council that pretends to represent the people of this country to make representations to the proper quarters in that respect, and to point out that these have been forced upon the people, and that they are a burden beyond that which our people can bear.</P>
      <P>There is another matter arising out of the same policy which I think I can also refer to.  I do not intend to go into it at length.  That is the question of the treatment of our brethren in the Six Counties.  A short time ago a question was raised here by Deputy Aiken with respect to compensation&mdash; I think the motion is on the paper&mdash; that is due to those who, in the Six Counties, in pursuit of national policy and in accordance with instructions which they received with respect to national policy, had their property destroyed. When an agreement was being made in which Sir James Craig, the head of that Government, was a party, whilst every provision was made to safeguard minorities down here, giving them an extra grant of 10 per cent. over and above that which had been given to our people up in the North, they were completely lost sight of, and no provision whatever was made that they should be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same sort of treatment was awarded to national teachers up there who were faithful.  When I questioned the Minister for Education, on that matter on one occasion, he was silent because they had no defence whatever to offer.  We have also the case of officials who were dismissed in those areas.  No representations have been made and no <Col N="342" /> attempt whatever made to safeguard their interests.  Take the case of Mrs. O'Doherty, who was in private practice in Derry from 1918 to 1920.  She was asked in 1919 by a delegation from the Corporation of that period to come down and qualify for the post of medical officer of health. She got her degree, was appointed, and in 1922 during the period in which the whole of Ireland was still supposed to be the Free State, whilst the whole question of the boundary was pending, we find that the Northern Government tried to impose an oath of allegiance in that area.  This lady was asked to sign this declaration of allegiance to the Northern Government and because she did not sign it it was taken that that was equivalent to dismissal and she is still without any compensation or recognition whatever.</P>
    <P>After that period she was appointed temporarily to the same office because it was recorded by the Council that she had been dismissed for not signing this order.  She occupied the position temporarily for three months and she was recognised even by the Northern Executive as is shown by the fact that her reports appear in the Department of Public Health there.  I hold that the Executive Council has been guilty and continues to be guilty of gross neglect in regard to our brethren up there.  In the Treaty itself you will find, in one of the alternative provisions, that safeguards for minorities were specially mentioned in case that the North opted out.  What were the nature of the safeguards that were intended there?  There were religious and civic safeguards which should have been taken account of to prevent, for example, the jerrymandering of constituencies which have deprived nationalists up there of anything like their proper share of representation on local bodies and which would have prevented the doing away with proportional representation which is also intended to deprive that section of the community from their proper share in civic affairs.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council, of course, seeing that a year or two ago they themselves proposed to do away with proportional <Col N="343" /> representation, would certainly be very bad advocates of the maintenance of minority rights anywhere. Therefore, from the point of view of the external policy, the policy with regard to countries outside, the policy with respect to the partitioning of the country and the people who occupy the partitioned areas, we totally disagree with the Executive Council, and are not prepared in any way to vote that they should be continued in office and paid for doing work which we think is detrimental generally to the country's interests.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in regard to which we hold that the Executive Council and the President, who is supposed to inspire that Council, have been grievously at fault, and that is the question of the Gaeltacht.  We all know very well that it is not sufficient to teach Irish generally in the schools of the country unless we take steps to maintain the Irish language in the place where it is spoken by the majority of the people, and from which ultimately the language is to spread and be spoken in the country as a whole, if it is ever to get to that position.  What is the use in pretending that we want to save the Irish language if we do not seriously tackle the problem by seeing what are the things that will have to be done if we are to succeed, and then go about doing them?  The Executive Council were pretty thorough when it came solely to a question of imposing their will on a section of the community that disagreed with them.  I hold that if they were anything like as earnest in bringing back the Irish language they would be no less thorough in the means which they would employ towards it. Money could be borrowed.  Huge sums of money could be borrowed.  Blood could be spilt.  It did not matter what sacrifices the community were called on to bear when it was solely a question of compelling other people to align themselves with, or at least not to oppose, their policy.  We think that men, who were not going to be stopped by any barrier when there was a question of carrying out their own will in certain matters, must lack will when they do not give evidence of intending in <Col N="344" /> any similar thorough way&mdash;not by similar methods, but by the thoroughness to which I have been referring&mdash; to act in the case of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>They are allowing things to drift when it is a question of matters of that kind, and they have hundreds of excuses as to various sorts of inconveniences which will arise if we are to proceed thoroughly and quickly in dealing with the problem of Irish. Money is not available.  Nothing can be got.  But, as I have said, when it was a question of forcing their will on other people, who, from their associations with them, they knew held these opinions perfectly sincerely, there was no barrier they were not prepared to leap across.  I hold, therefore, that the present Executive Council, taking them as a body, are not serious in bringing back Irish to be the spoken language of the country.  They know that the language is dying in the Gaeltacht, and that, if it dies and becomes extinct in the Gaeltacht, there will be no hope whatever of getting it back as the spoken language of the country.  It is not for linguistic purposes that we want to restore it, but because we believe, notwithstanding the views held by Professor Thrift, that it is an essential part of nationality.  We have heard that it was only an accident of nationality.  It is very difficult to tell us which of the various things that go to make nationality is not an accident. I suppose you can take off a cow's horns, tail, legs, and so on, and it would be difficult to say when you arrived at a stage that you did not have a cow.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to say, in regard to the question of nationality, what is essential and what is only accidental. The greatest authorities do not hold with Professor Thrift on that particular matter.  They hold that of all the factors that go to make up nationality, one of those which is most to be regarded as essential is language.  Therefore, as I have said, it is not simply that we want Irish restored because we are interested in Irish from a purely linguistic point of view, but because we are interested in it as the national language.  We hold that if the Executive Council, as a whole, were interested in Irish and had the will to bring it back, they could do so.  We <Col N="345" /> know that time is pressing.  We see young native speakers emigrating in thousands from the Gaeltacht, and we know that nothing you do in the schools will make up for that national loss.  Yet nothing has been done to keep these people in the Gaeltacht.  A fraction of the expense and a fraction of the sacrifices which were made because the Executive Council wanted to put its own policy into effect would be sufficient to put the Irish language into a position in which it is only a question of time for it to become really the spoken language of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about what I call the thoroughness of the Executive Council in carrying out their own policy, but it has been thoroughly mean as well as thorough in other respects. We would, however, expect from those who are going to set a headline in the country as a whole, at least, simple truth.  A good many of the difficulties of the last five or six years could have been avoided if that simple virtue of truth were only practised by the members of the Executive Council.  They are pursuing individuals who they know hold views sincerely and whose views correspond to the aspirations of the vast majority of the people.  They are pursuing these people in a petty, mean, and vindictive manner.  We see them with constant raids and keeping young girls who served the national cause in jail for protracted periods.</P>

      <P>The President smiles at it, but he knows as well as I do that there is very little use in talking about prosperity or raising the standard of this country if we set false standards and low standards in that respect.  He knows that truth in business is not simply a question of sentiment. He knows that truth means something in business, and means something in the relations between employers and employed, and that honesty in these matters counts.  I say that if a false public standard is set in these matters by the Executive Council that it is going to have its effect right through the community from top to bottom.  It is not to preach on things of this particular kind that I am speaking at the moment.  When we started originally in Sinn Féin in 1917 one of the first things we said was that we wanted to set a decent standard in public morality.  That standard, I hold, has been very seriously departed from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass now to aspects of the administration. We disagree with the policy of the Executive Council in respect to local affairs and local government. We believe that their policy of centralisation, depriving the local people of authority and getting them to lean more and more on the centre, when as a matter of fact the centre has much more work to do than it can properly cope with, is wrong.  The whole of our policy should be as far as possible, I believe, to decentralise things so that the local authority would bear a greater part of the burden of the work of administration. Our policy should be altogether in that direction.  Instead of that, we find that the Executive Council is not able to cope with the work which it has and is looking to have further responsibility placed upon it.  When we were <Col N="348" /> speaking yesterday, the Minister for Local Government, I think, found fault with the local authorities because they did not do certain things.  When I heard him say that, I wanted to ask him how did he expect the people would have any reliance upon themselves when he takes away all responsibility from them.  If he wants them to undertake responsibility as regards home assistance and other local responsibilities he cannot expect them to do it if he weakens them by taking away responsibility and authority from them in other respects.  If you want local authorities to look after local affairs properly and take on themselves the burden that properly belongs to them, then you must give them responsibility from the beginning, and you must not be sapping and depriving them of that feeling of responsibility by taking away from them powers which they should have.  I say that if the local bodies are shirking responsibility and are trying to throw more and more on the central authority and to get the whole community to bear a burden that might properly be regarded as a local burden, the primary cause of all that is the fact that the Central Executive insists in interfering with them.</P>
    <P>It is a proper point of view of theirs that the responsibility for raising money to meet this should be the responsibility of those who insist in arrogating authority to themselves. We disagree also, as we pointed out more than once, with their general economic policy.  We have heard members of the Executive Council talk for years past of the prosperity of the country, and it has been vain for those who have been in touch with the people to point out to them that any prosperity there is is confined to the official classes.  There is no prosperity with the small farmers, no prosperity with the labourers.  Of course, if they keep talking long enough and repeating often enough that there is prosperity they will begin to believe it in the long run.  It seems to me they have ultimately got to believe the thing themselves, and that is largely responsible for their attitude towards <Col N="349" /> matters such as those brought up here yesterday on the Vote for the Relief of Distress, and some other matters brought up by members of the Labour Party here some time ago.  A few years ago also, and I understand it is still the policy of the Executive Council, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it was no part of his duty to see that people got work.  I suppose that is still the policy of the Executive Council.  We were met with the same smile that we are met with when we stand up for certain things here.  When we spoke on the liquor matter we were taunted with wanting to air our virtue.  When we said it was the duty of the State under modern conditions to see that every citizen had the opportunity of getting a decent living we were told we were holding a doctrine which could not be supported.  I am very glad to find there is a change in that respect.  I do not know whether it has yet gone as far as the Executive Council.  I am assuming, until we hear to the contrary, that it has not, but at any rate the principle that it is the duty of a modern Government in a civilised State to see that the citizens who are loyal citizens of that State should get the means of earning their livelihood is being acknowledged by authorities for which probably the President may have some regard.</P>
    <P>The policy with respect to building up our own industries, protecting them and providing for ourselves the things that can be provided in this country, and giving employment to our own people instead of giving it to the foreigners, we have referred to on more occasions than one.  We take issue with the Government also on this question of whether the State must stand passively by when want of enterprise is shown by the average business man in the country.  We do not agree that it should.  We think there are times when it is the duty of the State to set a proper headline, when it is the duty of the State if necessary, if there is no enterprise in particular quarters, if the private citizen does not show sufficient enterprise to show that enterprise itself and set a headline.  I think I have indicated the main points of disagreement <Col N="350" /> between the members of our Party and the Executive Council. We believe that a change has got to be made if this country is ever going to be prosperous or contented.  There is nothing inspiriting or inspiring in any of the actions of the Executive Council.  Where they should give a lead they do not give it.  They have got themselves into a position in which apparently they have not the power to give a proper lead, and consequently, as I have said, we are called upon because of these things to vote against this Estimate.</P>

      <P>This is the first time Deputy de Valera had an opportunity of dealing with this particular Vote.  I want to point out that the speech we have listened to and which, in the circumstances, I did not want to interrupt, has covered a considerable amount of ground which would not have been proper to this Estimate if the rules of order were strictly enforced.  In reply to that portion of the speech which did not deal with the particular Estimate, the Chair proposes to allow one speech only, and with that exception, to compel every other Deputy to keep strictly to the matter of the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few small points to which I wish to refer.  Deputy de Valera has a very poor opinion of the opposite bench, and he has a very poor opinion of the value in pounds, shillings, and pence of the Executive Council.  I do not share that opinion.  I think the members of the Executive Council, while they may not be supermen, and I am a man easily attracted to supermen, are men of very great ability and great courage, and this country owes them a lot.  They have for five years carried their lives in their hands, and for what?  For a salary less than would be paid to the manager of a third-class hotel.  Many of them are business men and have a capacity for business.  Many of them <Col N="351" /> are professional men, and by reason of the fact that they are devoting their time to this country and neglecting their profession they are inflicting a great loss on themselves.  If this were a mere sum in proportion, and if Deputies, including myself, were worth £360 a year, I would say, taking the Executive Council as a whole, they would be easily worth £2,000 a year.  We have short memories, but our memory cannot be so short as not to miss that very illustrious Irishman, the late Minister for Justice.  We know that he was not able, and did not get a chance, to make proper provision for his widow and family.  The State had to come in.  It may be the case with any of the Ministers.  I am sure that if Deputy de Valera and his Front Bench succeed the present Executive Council they need have no fear of a violent death, because the supporters of the present Executive Council do not believe in violence, especially towards the Ministers of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to reply to Deputy de Valera because there is not the time available.  It seems to me that what the Deputy did was he put down on paper a dozen or two dozen headings and he uttered a few inaccuracies in regard to each and then he passed on.  Of course that is fairly easy.  One can utter an inaccuracy in a minute, or less than that, and it might take perhaps a good many minutes to deal with it.  Deputy de Valera began on the question of salaries in the public service, and he quoted for us salaries paid in Belgium.  I do not know what are the conditions prevailing in the public service in Belgium.  There is a great deal more required than a mere statement that a person holding a certain office has a certain salary before one can draw any deductions from it. One has to know whether there are other emoluments, whether the work is full-time, whether it is performed by men who hold other offices or draw pensions.  There are all sorts of things that have to be known.  To suggest that in this country you should get your heads of departments at salaries of £457 a year is utterly ridiculous. That is no help, and it could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera talked about brains going away on the emigrant ship.  Perhaps there are as good brains going out this year, this month, or this week as are to be found in the country. If these brains had an education and training, perhaps they would not have to go out to gain experience and a knowledge of affairs.  We have to <Col N="354" /> pay for brains that have been educated, for brains that have been trained, for brains that have stored up experience, and we have to pay on some sort of a commercial basis.  We do not pay a full commercial salary, nor any thing like it.  Men at the head of departments receive far less pay than men of equal responsibilities, equal ability and training, and handling propositions of equal magnitude have in commercial life.  That is proper, of course, because they have security and advantages that men in commercial life have not.  Mind you, these are the successful civil servants; these are the men who have come to the top by reason of their special attainments and special capacity.  Successful professional men around them, men who perhaps were in college with them, earn a great deal more money and they do not necessarily pay the full income tax on it.</P>
    <P>It is more difficult for a Minister than a member of the Opposition to talk about the condition of affairs in other countries, but there are other countries which have very low scales of salary in their public service; and whose best citizens acknowledge that it would be very much better and more economical if they could increase the scale of salary.  There are countries where all the civil servants are grossly underpaid, where they are inefficient, where they are frequently corrupt, where scandals continually arise.  While we must try to have our service as economical as possible, it would be no advantage to the country if we failed to attract honest, competent men and a certain proportion of tip-top brains. You do not require to have tip-top brains right through the service, but there must be a certain proportion of tip-top brains there, and the rewards must be such that men of the best capacity will enter and remain in the Civil Service and will not be tempted to do anything except their plain and full duty.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Ministers we have to have regard primarily for our own conditions.  We may look at what is done in other countries, but you cannot say that what is done in some other country is necessarily just the thing that should be done here.  I do not <Col N="355" /> know enough to talk about the position of the President of the United States, but I have heard it said with regard to the members of the American Cabinet that ordinarily the official salary of one of those people would not pay the rent of the flat in which he lives.  It would be wrong in this country to have the position where you would ordinarily have either only men of wealth in the Ministry or men who were simply on the lookout for a political job and could not hold any other.  We have had already in more than one case refusals by men to hold office as Minister.  You cannot possibly have a salary where you would have no such refusal, but we have had refusals from men who could not, having regard to their families and other interests, make the sacrifices that would be involved by becoming Ministers and bear the loss of opportunities and business connections and all that would be involved by accepting the office of Minister.  I am perfectly satisfied that a reduction of the salaries of Ministers would have the effect that the range of choice would be narrowed beyond what the country could afford. At a time of revolution or immediately after a revolution you get men to go into administration irrespective of sacrifices or of the effect on their own worldly prospects.  You cannot expect that in normal times, and you cannot get it.  You cannot have the rich men in this country because there was, broadly speaking, a political dividing line between those who were rich and those who were not.  Whatever may happen in a generation or two, it is impossible to rely on the rich in this country, as has been done in other countries.  If you rely on the people who are willing to take anything, then it is going to be bad for the country. I have dealt with the subject of the reduction of salaries many times in the Dáil.  I do not want to go over it again. We have consistently reduced the salaries of the judiciary and others as compared with the standards that were prevailing previously.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the office of Governor-General, and whether the Governor-General was a medium of communication with the British Government. <Col N="356" /> The Governor-General is not a medium of communication with the British Government.  He is the selection of the Executive Council here. He acts on their advice entirely.  He has no communication with the British Government.  The Deputy talks about parts of the Constitution being imposed from without and causing a great deal of expense which the country could not afford.  I presume he was indicating that if there were no provisions in the Treaty governing the matter, we would either have no person in the position of Governor-General, or that if we had some person in that or some analogous position the cost would be very much less.  I beg leave to doubt that.  I think it would be found necessary, and I think it is in the best interests of the State, that there should be somebody in that position to discharge the social functions that are discharged.  I think if the financial situation were easier it would be money well spent.  It would be money well spent by the State to spend more than is being spent in that direction.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that our position here is entirely different from the position of a country like New Zealand. Leaving aside altogether the outlook of the people, it is very different from other countries.  I think certainly that there are certain things that people will look for, and that they ought to be encouraged to look for, at home rather than look for in an adjacent country.  It is a very big and difficult problem.  I am satisfied that if there was a definite separate Republic here, you would find that on the titular head of the State, whatever he might be called, there would probably be very much greater expenditure than there is in this particular direction at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talked about surrender on the financial questions.  It seems to me that he is still in the position of not having troubled to read the terms of the ultimate financial settlement, or he is still in the position of not having taken any trouble to understand it and know what it is about.  With reference to the Boundary, the Deputy lately made a speech for which some <Col N="357" /> people were rather inclined to laugh at him, but which I may say I thought was an indication that he was getting a more sane outlook with regard to the whole matter than he had previously. I suppose this Vote is not a Vote for Deputy de Valera, but for the Executive Council, and I suppose I cannot go into his part of the making of the present position.  I will only say that if he had behaved differently matters might have come about very differently.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Nationalists of the North, I want to say that perhaps there were things that we might have done and did not do. Perhaps there were.  We had our hands full with many matters.  If we take the specific case of Dr. Mrs. O'Doherty that the Deputy referred to, well, looking at it now, I do not think there was anything in that that we could have done or that there was anything that we ought to have done in the matter.  The Deputy talked about the Gaeltacht and he indicated that during the civil war we had been pretty thorough.  I do not think we were very thorough at all during the civil war period.  In any case, the thing that the Government had to do then was a comparatively simple thing. There have been many civil wars; the whole matter of waging civil war and its methods and principles are well-known, and they are easy things from one point of view.</P>
    <P>The question of the Gaeltacht is really&mdash;and I take it the Deputy himself would recognise it if it were being discussed in detail&mdash;a very much more difficult thing.  I agree with him entirely when he says that if Irish is not kept alive in the Gaeltacht it cannot be saved as a living speech.  I agree with him that the tide has not been turned in the Gaeltacht.  For my part, I am always thinking with anxiety of the problem.  But in spite of the working of the Gaelic League and all that, very little preparation had been made before the change of Government for the work that is now in hands.  If the whole teaching body, for instance, if the whole body of the national teachers had been able to impart instruction through Irish, if they had <Col N="358" /> been fully qualified, we would have had what would be a comparatively simple problem.  But they were not. If one looks for anything, for the doing of anything in Irish, for the writing of books, for the translation of books, for the giving of higher instruction through the medium of Irish, and all that, the number of fully qualified people is very small.  All sorts of works are being held up and delayed because there are not the people who have had the training to do them. The speaker from the Gaeltacht had no chance of getting on.  He may have had brains but he had not the opportunity of getting the education and the training.  So in all aspects of language work, the shortage of fully-qualified people is a thing that is very keenly felt.</P>
    <P>So far as the expenditure of money is concerned, there is no doubt that the expenditure of money can be of value, but the matter, in my opinion, could not be solved merely by the expenditure of money.  In fact one could expend a good deal of money in the Gaeltacht and produce only this result, that Irish would go out more quickly.  The Deputy, I am sure, has been in districts and really got down to the feeling that is there, that that would be possible.  I believe that one of the things that will help to affect opinion in the Gaeltacht will be evidence of a genuine change of heart on the part of the people in the rest of the country.  We must recognise that what has happened is that the major part and the wealthier parts of the country have thrown away the Irish language during the last two or three generations, and the people of the Gaeltacht in wanting to change to English from Irish, as we find in many districts, were simply following the rest of the country.  I believe that a lot of work that has been done in the rest of the country, although it does not help the Gaeltacht directly, is absolutely vital before a healthier attitude can be produced in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>One of the things that should be attempted, and it is being done&mdash;I do not know whether more can be done&mdash;in relation to the Gaeltacht and to keeping people from the Gaeltacht in the country <Col N="359" /> is to have as many of them as possible brought into the new preparatory colleges and given careers as teachers. I think the first two years' examinations were not so framed as to give very many Gaeltacht pupils an entrance to the colleges, but a change has been made in respect of the present year, and I understand that it is giving very good results.  Efforts have also been made by means of a special examination to give many of the boys and girls from the Gaeltacht entry to the Post Office service.  More may be done along those lines, but I would just like to say that one does not find as much detailed thought being given to this matter as would be desirable.  Sometimes suggestions are put forward which have no regard to the difficulties, and it is a comparatively rare thing to receive a series of suggestions from anybody who has obviously taken a good deal of trouble in regard to them.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered always in connection with the Irish language that all the work for the saving of the language must be done with the consent and support of people who themselves have no Irish and who are supporting the language policy for national reasons, because they recognise, as Deputy de Valera does, as people on these benches have said often, and as greater people have said, that it is an essential of nationality and that there can be no preservation of the Irish nation without it.  The people who accept the principle of the language policy fully might give trouble, might resent it, if things were done inconsiderately, were done so as to cause unnecessary hardship to individuals who, through misfortune as much as anything else, have not a command of Irish.  We cannot carry this thing through like a civil war.  That is a point I want to make&mdash;that we must carry the whole country or the major part of the country with us in what we do.  Consequently, things have to be done gradually.  As far as possible things have to be well thought out when expense is incurred in any direction, and we have to make sure, as far as we can, that good results will be obtained from the expenditure, and <Col N="360" /> also that there is not a cheaper way of doing the thing.  It is easy to say, and I would be the first to admit, that very much remains to be done&mdash;that nobody can say that enough is being done.  In any case, there has been steady progress. Each year or each quarter has seen some new step taken.  I think that more consideration has been given to it and more thoroughness displayed even than in the prosecution of the civil war.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera delivered a sermon on truth, speaking in a detached way. I do not want to initiate any sort of personal controversy.  I will just say that it is entirely inaccurate to say that there has been any failure to maintain, so far as the Government is concerned, a decent standard of morality.  I think there are few countries where there is a better standard of public morality, or where the Government can boast of cleaner hands in all respects than the present Government.  As a matter of fact, a great deal of support has been lost to the Government because it would not descend to the policy of jobbery and favouritism that a lot of people expected.  If we had been looking only for electoral advantages we could have got them by doing things that we did not think were in the best public interest.  We did not get votes, or any kudos, from things like the rigid Civil Service Regulations Act or by Acts like the Local Officers and Employees Act, but we believe that in time to come we will get credit and kudos from them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to vindictiveness, and indicated that the Government had manifested a harsh spirit.  I think we have not done so at any time. I believe that where we had to take action of a severe character the greatest possible moderation was shown.</P>
    <P>With regard to the present time, I am certainly clear about this, that if people will insist on carrying on any sort of illegal armed organisation, they must be pursued.  I have no belief in pursuing people for their opinions or for interfering with the opinions of people, or the propagation of political ideals of any sort; but when it comes to people conspiring to maintain an armed organisation, that is a thing that must be pursued in every possible way. At the present time the maintenance <Col N="361" /> of an armed society or organisation can result in nothing but some sort of crime.  It certainly leads to the danger of violence in the nature of assassinations or some such things.  It is entirely indefensible.  I have no sympathy, whether it is young girls or old men that pursue that sort of activity. I think it is the mere simple duty of the State to attempt to detect their activities and to prosecute them whenever it can find them.  I think no indication of harshness can be based upon that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Compensation Acts, these Acts were passed when the civil war had hardly come to an end. It was necessary to bring it to an end, and to prevent any attempt at further outbreak, that people who gave support to the forces that were against the State should suffer something for their support.  I think that was a necessary part of public policy.  It was not a question of vindictiveness, and many people who held the strongest views against the Government actually got their claims paid.  I do not want to go into the question at all of enforcing our will on the people.  What we were concerned with was to restore order and to see that the votes of the people should decide national policy. We believe that one man or one woman is as good as another; that no one is entitled to go into the motives of the voters; and that national policy must be decided by the ordinary votes of the plain people.  Whatever actions we took were directed, not towards enforcing our will on the people, but towards seeing that the will of the people was enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Estimate was prepared, the Vice-Chairman of the Prisons Board retired on attaining the Civil Service retiring age, and no appointment has been made in his place.  At present there is a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman of the Prisons Board, but they are members of the staff of the Department of Justice, and they receive no extra remuneration for the work they are doing as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. I may say that it is our intention to abolish the Prisons Board entirely and to control the prisons directly from the Department of Justice.  It is hoped that as a result a saving of about £1,700 per annum will be made.  Of that £1,700, we have already succeeded in saving £1,250.  It may be possible when the arrangements, following upon the abolition of the Prisons Board, are fully completed to save some further hundreds of pounds.  I have nothing further to say on Sub-head A, except to mention that in addition to the sums I have referred to, we have already saved about £1,500 of the all-Ireland costs of the Prisons Board.  Deputies will observe that there is a net decrease in the Estimate of £9,382.  That would have been a larger decrease if a certain <Col N="366" /> sum, to which I intend to allude later&mdash;a proposed capital expenditure of £3,500 for the purchase and enclosure of land&mdash;were also subtracted, because of course that is a capital item which did not appear in the accounts last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal decreases are in Sub-head C&mdash;Pay and Allowances of Officers&mdash;a decrease of £5,177; on Sub-head D&mdash;Victualling&mdash;a saving of £2,020; on Sub-head G&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water and Cleaning Articles, etc.&mdash;a saving of £1,000; on Sub-head I&mdash; Escort and Conveyance&mdash;a saving of £1,500; on Sub-head O&mdash;Maintenance of Criminal Lunatics in District Mental Hospitals&mdash;a saving of £1,000.  There are minor decreases in other sub-heads, but I do not think it is necessary to enumerate them all.  Sub-head B&mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash; shows a decrease of £50.  These expenses are incurred in covering the expenses which are incurred by headquarters officers in travelling on duty, and incidental expenses, which include the purchase of photo chemicals, the payment for advertisements in newspapers, and that sort of thing.  Sub-head C shows a decrease of £5,177. There has been a steady decrease in the cost of pay and allowances of prison officers since the prison service was taken over from the British Government. The total number of officers actually serving in the civil prisons in the Twenty-Six Counties on the 1st April, 1922, was 455, and their actual cost for the year 1922-3 amounted to £89,833.  By the 1st April, of this year, the number had been reduced to 352, a reduction of 103, and the estimated cost this year is £70,523, being a reduction of nearly £20,000 on the 1922-3 figure. This reduction was rendered possible by the closing of Kilkenny Prison and of Sunday's Well Female Prison in Cork, and by the reduction of Dundalk Prison to the status of a minor prison, that is to say, a prison that only takes prisoners on remand and prisoners who are sentenced to periods of not more than seven days' imprisonment.  It was further effected by the suppression of certain posts in the remaining prisons.  The decision as to Dundalk made it possible to reduce the number of governors by one, and to dispense <Col N="367" /> with the services of a number of warders.  The prison staff in Dundalk is now only one chief warder and two warders.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D is the cost of victualling. It shows a decrease of £2,020.  It is estimated that during the current financial year the average daily prison population, including about sixty Borstal boys, will not exceed 800. The average cost of food works out at less than 9d. a day.  This, however, does not take into account any overhead charges or the cost of labour. Sub-head E shows a decrease of £1,000. As regards clothing it may be mentioned that all the prison clothing is made by prison labour, and that the sum of £2,000 included in this Estimate is merely the cost of materials. There is also an item for beds and bedding. That has been occasioned by the fact that we have this year completely swept away plank beds in all our prisons.  For the future, the plank bed will be non-existent, and prisoners will have ordinary comfortable beds.  Sub-head G&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water, etc.&mdash; shows a decrease of £1,000.  The figures are made up as follows: Fuel, £5,000; gas and electric light, £2,500; and water, £950.  Sub-head H provides for the payment of head rents due in respect of certain of the prisons.  There is a head rent of £139 2s. payable out of the Clonmel Borstal Institution, which is held under a lease for ever.  There is a head rent of £51 13s. 10d. payable out of Sligo Prison.  There is a payment of £60 per annum in respect of what was Cork Female Prison.  As I mentioned, that has been closed, and the prison is now used for wireless broadcasting. There is also a head rent of £70 14s. 6d. out of Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I&mdash;Escort and Conveyances &mdash;is down by £1,250, while ordinary repairs are down by £500.  I might mention Sub-head O, dealing with the maintenance of criminal lunatics in district mental hospitals.  There are about 170 criminal lunatics maintained at the expense of the Prisons Board in district mental hospitals.  I mention that fact because it was stated from the benches opposite some time ago, in the form of a question, that it was the practice of <Col N="368" /> the authority responsible to release or discharge those prisoners who showed signs of insanity so that they might become a charge on local taxation.  I wish to say that that suggestion&mdash;because it was only a suggestion in the form of a question&mdash;was unfounded, and that there are 170 prisoners now detained in these hospitals.  Of course Deputies are aware that when a man who commits a crime is found guilty but insane, or if he is not fit to plead, the sentence is that he is detained during pleasure, and the place of detention, if it is a very bad case, is the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum, Dundrum, or, if it is not a homicidal case, the prisoner is usually sent to and paid for in the local mental home.</P>
    <P>There is just one other item which I would like to say something about&mdash; that is, the purchase and enclosure of land.  It is my desire&mdash;a desire very strongly felt on my part&mdash;that more land should be added to Portlaoighise Prison.  There is a certain amount of land there at present, but it is not sufficient to enable all the able-bodied prisoners of good character to work upon land.  In dealing with prisoners the main object is to endeavour to reform them, to endeavour to bring home to them that though a man may have fallen he can rise again; that though he may be down he need not be down for all time.  My own personal belief is that the best way of reforming and regenerating the man is by keeping him working upon the land, keeping him out of doors, in healthy surroundings, engaged on some particular form of work which occupies his attention and which may interest him.  In the terrible old days the idea for prisoners laid down by a Committee of the House of Lords was that they should have hard labour, hard fare, and hard beds.  That was a very wrong method, in our idea, and is the very worst method of dealing with prisoners.  Our idea is to try to save these prisoners, to do everything we can, so that when they go out again into the world they will be able to have something like a fresh start.  I am quite aware that something of this nature was tried before, but it was tried in different surroundings.  As possibly Deputies may know, a penal colony was <Col N="369" /> started in Lusk, Co. Dublin, in 1853, and carried on until 1886, when it was closed down, after very great expense, not having done the work of reforming the prisoners which it was hoped by those who established it it would have done.  Though Lusk was in a way an experiment on agricultural land, yet we can learn by the failure of Lusk. We can see where Lusk failed and we can profit by it.  It is my hope&mdash;a very strongly felt hope&mdash;that we can do a great deal by acquiring this extra land towards reforming men who are now inmates of our prisons.  We have had some difficulty in acquiring the land, for the simple reason that extremely high prices have been asked.  It very often happens when the Government is known to be a purchaser, and a willing purchaser, that people ask very extravagant prices.  Of course we have compulsory powers by which we could acquire this land at a fair price, and possibly, if necessary, we will invoke these powers.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this Vote, naturally the first serious matter that occurs to one's mind is the treatment of political prisoners, who must be dealt with on a different plane altogether from that of ordinary prisoners. The Minister, in reply to a question in this House, refused to entertain the principle that political prisoners should receive a separate status and separate treatment from ordinary prisoners. That is, in a sense, an innovation which commenced in this country at the time Balfour made new prison conditions under which he hoped to destroy the utility of men like William O'Brien, Michael Davitt, and John Dillon.  The actual details of that intrigue were divulged by Wilfred Blount.  On account of the very severe criticism of the British Government in that book it was suppressed by them.  I am sorry to see that, as the Minister for Justice was brought up in that particular school of thought apparently, he still persists in adopting that attitude of treating political prisoners as if they were criminal prisoners. His attitude differs from that of most European countries where special treatment is meted out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>A Minister who would have in his mind the idea that he was going to enforce strictly criminal justice and political justice would detach himself entirely from controversial questions.  It would be for him to investigate and see every possible method of change in order to make the present system as civilised as possible and, at the same time, as effective as possible, because to mix up the treatment of political with criminal prisoners brings discredit upon the majesty of justice. Not only are those political prisoners treated as I say, but they are ill-treated. We have cases of ill-treatment in the case of Seán O'Neill, George Gilmore, John Hogan, Mr. O'Malley, Peadar O'Donnell and some others.  I understand from a report issued by the Political Prisoners' Committee that even the lady prisoners are badly treated.  In their report they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Free State jails are a scandal to civilisation and a shame to Ireland. None of the prison reforms adopted in other countries, and even in England, have penetrated here.  There are no educational classes except for illiterates, no concerts, no recreations, everything is done to degrade, nothing to improve, the prisoners.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Maryboro' there is a dark dungeon where numbers of prisoners have been driven, some of them to the point of their minds being unhinged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In Maryboro' and in Mountjoy brutal kickings and beatings of prisoners by warders are allowed, if not actually ordered, by the prison <Col N="371" /> authorities.  In some cases, which we can vouch for, having personally investigated them, men have been permanently injured and disabled for life.  In Mountjoy, convicts have been armed with pokers and set on five Republican lady prisoners who were demanding political treatment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Report and I give it for what it is worth.  These ladies who look into the cases take all the trouble they can to get all the information.  I suppose when the Minister answers these matters he will deal with them with the same sense of levity as he has dealt with other charges from this side of the House.  There are at present eighteen political prisoners in jail and I submit that it is time they should be let out.  It is absurd to detain two ladies, Mrs. McDermott and Miss Eva Jackson, in jail for twelve months for merely posting up Republican leaflets. That I take it is one example.  Then again finger prints are taken, even in the case of political prisoners, which is degrading and should not be allowed. In the case of criminals finger prints are taken even before the criminal has been convicted.  Until a criminal is convicted he is an ordinary citizen and no one has a right to take any fingerprints. I would like to know from the Minister for Justice where he finds his authority for that.  The food conditions in the jail are bad.  I have heard complaints from people with actual experience that the milk contains a considerable amount of water and that the meat which is supplied is of a very poor standard and charged for at a very high price.  The tea is of such a curious nature that people could not make out exactly what it was.</P>
    <P>On the actual Vote there is a sum of £2,602 for thirty-four temporary warders. It works out very roughly at about £80 a year.  Owing to the fact that the amount of money paid to these people is so very small the wrong type are used as temporary warders, and although one is loath to suggest an increase in the amount of money, at the same time, I suggest it would be far better to raise the amount to a point where you would get men of a <Col N="372" /> better type and more suited to the particular work required.  I think the Minister mentioned that there were some 400 persons employed on the staff.  I did not get his figure and I would be glad if he would give it to me.</P>

      <P>Three hundred and fifty-two and the total number of prisoners is about 800.  You have a comparison there which appears to me to indicate a considerable amount of redundancy.  That is very nearly two to one.  Why should prisoners require such a staff?  As in other Votes, unless Deputies know the work each individual on the staff does it is impossible to make any detailed criticism.  It is time that the Ministry of Justice woke up to the fact that the administration of prisons should be carried out for the purpose of making men better men and really putting them on their feet from the point of view of self-respect. I suggest they should develop the Borstal system, investigate what is being done in other countries in the improvement of the conditions of prisoners so as to make them, instead of bitter men, better men and give them work which will be real work, which will bring in a return and in which they are interested and will have recourse to when they come out of prison.  These are matters in which the Minister foreshadows certain changes.  The quicker these changes are carried out the better.  My chief objection to this Vote is, first of all, the treatment of political prisoners and further that the conditions are out of date and that complete prison reform is required in Ireland.</P>

      <P>We are glad to hear the humanitarian sentiments expressed by the Minister for Justice.  Nobody can doubt his sincerity, but before he tries to emulate the example of those early Victorian reformers who went out to reform the present system I think it would be better for him to give a practical example of humanitarianism, particularly towards his political opponents, by showing that he <Col N="373" /> can be just and merciful even in small cases.  I will not go over the ground again, but will simply reiterate what Deputy Little has stated with reference to the two ladies, Mrs. McDermott and Miss Jackson, who have been in detention for the past twelve months.  Mrs. McDermott is a woman with a family and Miss Jackson, whom I know, is an extremely delicate girl and the only daughter of a widow.  I put it to the Minister, now that the season of peace on earth to men of good-will is coming, to do the right thing and release these two ladies.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of Portlaoighise Convict Prison.  We would have been very glad to have heard from the Minister what exactly is being done to make the lot of the prisoners somewhat better than it used to be under the old regime.  There is a suspicion in the country that conditions are exceptionally bad in that prison.  If we look up the last report of the Prison Board, that for 1926, we will discover that although only one-quarter of the total prison population is housed there, 85 out of 148 punishments inflicted on prisoners for disciplinary offences were imposed on prisoners in Portlaoighise. The fact that 85 out of 148 punishments were imposed in that particular prison would.  I think, go to show that the conditions there are severe.  We know that that prison houses convicts chiefly, convicts who are in for long periods, but I think it is generally understood that the old offender is generally the best conducted.  He sees that the game is up, so to speak, and he conducts himself fairly well.  He is generally submissive and acts in a way which conforms to the prison rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is a fact that these 85 offenders had to be punished in this way, I think it represents a particularly rigorous state of affairs in that prison and that there is no doubt that there is some justification for the assertion that the prisoners, whom we deem to have committed political offences, are having a bad time.  We hope that it will be unnecessary to have resort to punishment and that if the Minister cannot see his way to change the present regulations, which were handed down to him, so as to give the class of prisoners we are interested in a special category and <Col N="374" /> special treatment, he will at least see that unfair advantage will not be taken of them, and that when they find themselves in a certain position, when they believe that they are standing for certain principles, and when they assert that they ought not to be associated with the criminal types, their attitude and physical well-being will, at least, be treated sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that a considerable number of warders may expect to have their services dispensed with.  In that connection I think it is a fact that some warders with long service have not got the promotion that they were entitled to.  I think we should have an assurance from the Minister that promotions in the prison service will have special reference to length of service, and that we will not have the state of affairs which we have had in other Departments of the Government service, namely, that a newcomer, with little experience and poor qualifications, is put over old servants who have given long and faithful service.</P>
    <P>There is an institution in which I am particularly interested, because when I was in prison a warder told me that the conditions there were very difficult.  I refer to the Borstal Institution in Clonmel. That seems to have been a kind of experiment in the beginning.  I have not read the history of such institutions and I am not familiar with the idea on which they are based, but whatever the idea may have been, the fact is that they are really convict prisons, and boys who have no one to look after them are sent to such institutions as this, and treated exactly as convicts.  I do not know if there has been any improvement lately, and I would like to know if there has been, but I know that some years ago the boys were only allowed to associate at meals, and were kept separate at other times.  I think that the penalty of non-association with fellow-prisoners is one of the most severe things which a prisoner feels. For that reason steps have been taken in England and other countries to allow prisoners to associate at certain hours and to give them certain work in the workshops.  In such prisons convicts work together in prison workshops.</P>
    <P>In the Borstal Institution the prison <Col N="375" /> authorities, according to the 1926 report, do not believe that the training for trades is helpful.  We have the extraordinary situation that while industrial schools are training boys for certain trades the prison authorities tell us that they do not think that training for trades is useful.  They say that when the boys, who come largely from Dublin, get out of prison they will not find employment.  If that is true of prisons, it is also true of such institutions, and the whole system ought to be remodelled.  They also say that what they regard best for a boy and his moral welfare is training in skilled farm work.  What good such skilled farm work can do to a boy coming from the Dublin slums and having no liking for agriculture I fail to see.  It seems to me that you are imposing on such a boy an environment and training with which he cannot sympathise.  You are going against his grain at the very beginning.  It is stated, of course, also that a certain amount of elementary education and training is given.  Boys are trained to read and write and calculate. We have satisfactory assurances, satisfactory, I suppose, to the prison authorities, that these boys, no matter at what stage practically they enter a Borstal Institution, are trained to read, write and calculate before they leave prison.  But when we inquire into it we find that the persons who instruct them are persons who have no training whatever in the giving of education. They are merely warders who are picked out, quite arbitrarily, because they have perhaps a slightly superior education to the ordinary class of warder.  When we are told that this class of warder, called a clerk or schoolmaster, is entrusted with the education of those boys, we feel that it is not satisfactory and that something more ought to be done.  It is a problem that is there, and the Government has had a certain amount of time to look into it.  The Minister has told us that they were looking into it.  I would like to know what has been done with regard to giving more association, not alone to those boys, but to the convicts generally, and making things easier for <Col N="376" /> them.  There is also the question of the circumstances under which those boys are discharged.  I am not at all satisfied that even in the ordinary industrial schools that proper provision is made when boys are let out, to have them properly fixed up and put in suitable positions.</P>
    <P>In these cases all the boys, whether they have their sentences expired or not, are released on licence.  I take it, therefore, that the State takes a particular interest in them, and that when they have been released the State takes a certain responsibility in getting work for them.  I would like if the Minister would see that something is done for those boys afterwards. There is not much use in saying that there are certain voluntary associations for looking after those boys.  The State has a responsibility to them.  The fact that they find themselves there is largely the result of the environment in which they were brought up, and at that age they are particularly vicious and particularly criminal if the tendency which is there is allowed to develop in that direction. If we could put the tendency in the other way and deal with them sympathetically we would be doing a great deal of good.</P>

      <P>As one who had a little experience of prison treatment, I would like to compare the treatment given to political prisoners at the present time and that given to political prisoners in the pre-Truce period when some of the Ministers and Deputies on the opposite side enjoyed the pleasures of that period.  It has been a standing complaint with me that the present Minister for Justice has not had any experience of the pleasures that were in store for prisoners in those days.  I think that if he had such an experience, on one side or the other, that he would be a little more lenient towards political prisoners at the present time.  I would suggest to him that he should consult Deputy Jasper Wolfe as to the treatment that the Deputy received when he was in our hands.  It might help him to change his views in regard to the <Col N="378" /> treatment that our boys are receiving at the present time.  If he does that, I can guarantee to the Minister that if ever his turn comes he will receive as good treatment from us.</P>
      <P>When I examine this estimate I find that the estimated cost of maintaining prisoners is put down at £13 2s. 0d. per head per annum.  That works out at about 8½d. per day per prisoner.  I notice that there has been a reduction of over £2,000 in this estimate in the last twelve months, that is comparing the year 1927-28 with 1928-29.  That shows, as far as I can judge, that the conditions in the prisons have not improved, and are not likely to improve.  They have not improved since the old happy days when the Minister for Finance and others used to get two bad potatoes and a piece of horseflesh.  One would think that the memory of those days, when they used to wet their thumbs to gather up the crumbs, would lead them to be a little more generous in the food supply that they are giving at the present time.  Speaking from my prison experience of a short time ago, I do not think that the treatment which prisoners are receiving at present, as regards food, is as good as the treatment given to political prisoners or prisoners under sentence in, say, the years 1918 or 1919.  I remember the happy time when we used to be presented every morning with a chop. Deputy Hennessy remembers the same thing.  I see him smiling over there.</P>

There is another matter that I would like to refer to, and that is the association of political prisoners.  I would remind the Minister that in 1926 there was a very determined attempt made to prevent those of us who were prisoners at the time from associating with one another.  Meeting together was the only little amelioration that we enjoyed in those days.  Also for a fortnight all letters, papers, books, etc., are stopped.  I think that should not be done.</P>

I am anxious that the Minister would at least give better food to the prisoners than is being done out of the enormous sum of 8½d. a day which is allowed for the feeding of each prisoner.  I also urge on him to provide some national books in the libraries, instead of having in them as at present Empire Association books and books that are suitable only for proselytising institutions.  If the Minister goes to the Cork prison and examines the library, he will see for himself the class of books in the library, and it would cause him to get the Evil Literature Bill through as quickly as possible.  I wish to tell the Minister quite plainly I am afraid that I cannot guarantee him, if the occasion arose, anything like the decent treatment which Deputy Jasper Wolfe got when he was in our hands.</P>

I am also very sorry that, in view of the ruling of the Chair, I cannot respond to his invitation that I should give an account of my prison experiences, but I can say that a characteristic of my prison experiences was that I never grumbled.  I had no complaints when I got my gruel to eat; I took it like a man.  I am very sorry to think that Deputy Corry did not in the brief period in which he was incarcerated a year or two ago take it in the same way.  Deputy Corry complains, as I understand, that the association of prisoners nowadays is not as freely permitted as it was when other powers were in force.  He has selected a concrete instance, that was the occasion of his own incarceration.  I agree that that is a very wise and a very fair method of considering this question. He has selected an occasion that occurred a year or two ago.  It is always a dangerous thing to talk if you are not fully sure of the facts.  I, unfortunately, appeared for some of the Deputy's colleagues on that occasion.  I put it to Deputy Corry that the sequel on that occasion was that the largest batch of those prisoners who were arrested &mdash; I <Col N="381" /> exempt Deputy Corry who, I am sure, would thank nobody for anything&mdash; publicly thanked the prison authorities through their advocates, of whom I was one, for the treatment they received in jail.

On this particular occasion it became portion of my duty to visit some of the accused who were arrested on the same occasion as Deputy Corry was arrested.  A more decent or more innocent lot of young men I never saw.  I must say that as regards the courtesy I received from the prison authorities on that occasion nothing could equal it.  As regards allowing one accused man to associate with another, I never saw that privilege more freely exercised than on the occasion when I visited the jail to see the accused to whom Deputy Corry alludes.  To put it broadly, the occasion was more like a picnic or a smoking concert than like a consultation between three accused men and their advocate.  Nothing could be more generous or more fair, and I am speaking very sincerely when I say that I thank the prison authorities heartily for their courtesy.  The men were subsequently released, and I am sure they too appreciated the consideration shown to them by those in authority in the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say this in advance to young men who sometimes get into trouble, that I do not think the way to get on the soft side of the Minister for Justice or the prison authorities is, when they do treat accused men fairly and generously, to have other people who pretend sympathy with the accused men and who have not real sympathy with them, such sympathy, for instance, as I and others in my profession must have with them, making untrue <Col N="382" /> comments.  That is not the proper way in which to recognise past favours. I can take this opportunity of thanking the prison authorities for the courtesy I received on that occasion and on other occasions since the present régime came into power.  I must thank them for the facilities they afforded me as an advocate in meeting accused people.  I met those people under conditions such as no reasonable man would object to. I could give you a great many more instances but I do not wish to take up the time of the House.  I only select that particular occasion because it is the occasion which Deputy Corry himself selected, and which he wishes to rely on.</P>

      <P>I want to bring under the notice of the Minister the circumstances of a prisoner in Portlaoighise Prison.  This prisoner is alleged at the moment to be in a dying condition. He is an ex-National Army captain, and he was sentenced to penal servitude for life four years ago.  I understand his relatives have made representations to the Minister for his release, or for some special treatment, on the grounds that he is in a dying condition, practically beyond recovery.  He is certified, I understand, to be suffering from tuberculosis in an acute fashion.  Perhaps the Minister or the prison authorities could see their way to release a prisoner certified to be in a dying condition. If the Medical Officer of the prison certifies the man to be dying, I think some special treatment ought to be meted out to a prisoner under such circumstances.  I presume the Minister can get particulars of the individual to whom I am referring.  I hope that something will be done for an individual so circumstanced, and that special instructions will be issued for the future treatment of prisoners who are certified by the Medical Officer of the prison to be in a dying condition. I have no information as to what the prison doctor thinks of this case.  I believe the full facts ought to be in the hands of the Minister or the Prison Board.  I hope some special treatment will be meted out to this man, some treatment other than the ordinary prison hospital treatment, because he is in a dying condition.</P>

      <P>I would like to make some remarks with regard to visiting committees that are associated with the different prisons included in this Vote.  Some time ago there was a matter referred to here, and it was pointed out that the personnel of these committees is composed exclusively of those who hold one particular political view.  Those committees now act as a link between the general mass of the people and the prisoners undergoing punishment, for the purpose of ensuring that no harsh regulations or any action in excess of the regulations would become known and stopped.</P>
      <P>Recently complaints were received concerning the ill-treatment of prisoners in Mountjoy.  In the case of George Gilmore most alarming stories came out of the prison from time to time.  Those of us unable to accept the denials received from the Minister when questions were asked here were anxious to get some other means of securing accurate information.  The only other means that existed was through the medium of the visiting committees.  In one particular case we asked Deputy P.S. Doyle, a member of the visiting committee from Mountjoy, to endeavour to find out for us exactly what the real situation was. Deputy Doyle and other members of the committee were naturally inclined to take the view of the prison authorities as against the report of the prisoner. When Deputy Doyle told us his information we came to the conclusion that the stories we had heard must be very largely invented.  Since then Gilmore has been released, and we have found from him that the stories, although exaggerated in many parts, were in the main true, and that he was subject to very gross ill-treatment while a prisoner in Mountjoy.  Of course, the Minister has repeatedly denied that, and I have no doubt he will persist in his denials even now.  But if he is really anxious to see that proper conditions exist in the prisons, he could take advantage of the fact that such complaints were made in order to hold an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. MacDermott's case has been referred to.  She, also, is alleged to have been ill-treated.  Deputy Dr. Ryan is prepared to vouch that after her temporary <Col N="384" /> release he visited her in hospital, and he will bear personal witness to the bruises and other marks on her arms and head.  Other prisoners have also been released lately, and the report is that though the normal treatment which they received is not unobjectionable from the point of violence, nevertheless there are periods when some particular bug appears to bite the prison authorities and they proceed to give a general chastisement all round to prisoners who they think have annoyed them.  Such a bug appears to have paid the Mountjoy authorities a visit last February, because most of the complaints received from the prisoners centred in or about that period.  The Minister mentioned that the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the Prisons Board are civil servants in his Department. That is a most objectionable system.  The civil servants in the Minister's Department are directly under his control, and they hold their positions at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.  It would be more advisable if the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Prisons Board were not under the direct control of the Minister.  They should be independent persons, not dependent for their livelihood upon the Minister's word as to the satisfactory nature of their services.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, to stress the points made by one or two other speakers, particularly Deputy Little. I think that no case can be made out for treating prisoners who are decidedly and definitely political prisoners in the same class with criminals.  If a man carries through the street a placard with the slogan &ldquo;Up Red Russia&rdquo; on it, the Minister may think it a treasonable offence and put that man in prison. But if that man is to be classed with blackmailers, thieves and pick-pockets it is going too far, and I would strongly press for the institution of regulations defining a separate class for political prisoners.  It should not be impossible to define who are and who are not political prisoners.  We know that a number of people who are arrested and charged with criminal offences have tried to get themselves described as political prisoners in order <Col N="385" /> to get off and work other frauds when released from prison.  But there are men who object to the Acts passed from time to time here, such as the Public Safety Act and other Acts. They are men who are in pursuit of certain political ideals, no matter how mistaken the Minister may think the ideals are.  These men should not be forced under the same regulations as the ordinary prisoners.  They should not be asked to associate with these prisoners.  The Minister's own colleagues on the Executive Council will be able to tell him that the most objectionable part of that treatment is to be associated in prison with people who were very objectionable and who were put into prison for very obnoxious crimes.  There are ordinary, honest, decent, quiet people, who could not in political matters see eye to eye with the Minister or the Government. These should not be asked to associate with the ordinary criminal.  They could be given a status distinct from the ordinary criminal and they should not be compelled to associate with the ordinary criminal in the ordinary prison routine.  There should be new regulations made in this matter and it would be a step in the right direction. It would help to alleviate some of the bitterness that some of the recent reports from the prisons would show to exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. KERLIN Mr. KERLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, there are one or two points that I would like to bring before him. The practice has been, and is still in existence, as far as I am aware, where prisoners have been brought down to the court from Mountjoy for trial that they get their breakfasts early in the morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, and from that time until they are brought back to Mountjoy in the evening, it may be 3, 4 or 5 o'clock, and sometimes even 6 or 7 o'clock, they get nothing else to eat. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to that matter, and to ask him to make provision that such prisoners who have no friends in the City of Dublin to send in food to them, and who have no money with which to send out for food themselves, should receive <Col N="386" /> some meal during the day while detained in the cells down in the Bridewell or the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to mention is in connection with the Bridewell itself. The usual practice is that when prisoners are arrested here in the city they are detained for the night in the Bridewell.  Political prisoners are frequently detained longer.  It has happened in my own particular case; I was detained for two and a half days in the Bridewell.  Mountjoy, of course, is bad enough, but at least it is a clean place.  The Bridewell, in my opinion, is a filthy hole, and prisoners should not be detained there longer than is absolutely necessary.  There was a case which came to my notice last year.  Two young ladies who were arrested and detained in the Bridewell were both released shortly afterwards, and no charge preferred against them. One of the young ladies contracted scurvy or some disease like the itch in the Bridewell, and it took her two months afterwards to get rid of it.  I think that the Minister should make special arrangements that the Bridewell should be made into a fit place for the detention of prisoners.</P>
      <P>There is another point, and that is the question of taking finger-prints. This has already been referred to by Deputy Little.  There is a practice in existence of taking finger-prints of remand prisoners.  I understand that in certain cases where, perhaps, finger-prints would be required there would be a necessity for taking them, but I do not think that there should be any general practice of taking the finger-prints of those who are on remand. That is specially so in the case of political prisoners.  Prisoners who are brought in and afterwards released without conviction, have had their finger-prints and their photographs taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPatrickAird" hpid="Mr. AIRD Mr. AIRD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIRD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I wish to put before the Minister before he replies.  I happen to be on the Visiting Committee in Portlaoghise Prison, and I must certainly say that the prison there is well run.  We have heard no complaints there.  There are a number of temporary warders there and they are anxious that their appointments <Col N="387" /> should be made permanent.  It would conduce to more efficiency in the staff if they were made permanent. There is a small amount of land with the prison at present, and there are 40 or 50 acres around the prison.  I know that the Governor and the officers are very keen on getting more land.  The prisoners themselves very much prefer to work on the land rather than to be employed in the workshops in which they are employed, and I believe that when the prisoners time would be expired they would be made into better citizens by having been employed on the land.  I would be very glad if the Minister would see his way to take over certain lands outside the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the endorsement by Deputy Aird of the views I put forward in my opening statement, that the acquisition of further land in Portlaoghise would be appreciated by all the prisoners, and would have a beneficial effect in reforming the prisoners. The whole question of the Prison Service is under review, and the question of these temporary warders will be taken into consideration.  Deputy Little suggested that the temporary-warders were underpaid and not good warders; that they were a bad type of men; that the salaries should be increased and a better type of man brought into the service.  I cannot agree with Deputy Little that these temporary warders are a bad type. They are the very opposite.  They are a very fine type of men indeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kerlin spoke about not giving the prisoners who are brought for trial from Mountjoy to the Central Criminal Court food during the middle of the day.  I am not aware what the practice is, but I will have the matter inquired into.  I think that the prisoners should have food when they are kept in the courts for along time.  I will have inquiries made into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Kerlin talks of people acquiring the itch or scurvy in the Bridewell, I cannot agree with him at all.  I know that this Bridewell has got very up-to-date arrangements for cleansing and disinfecting, and certainly in <Col N="388" /> the cases that the Deputy referred to I must say that I never saw a medical certificate to the effect that this ailment from which this lady suffered was caused by anything that happened in the Bridewell.</P>
    <P>I now come to Deputy Lemass.  I was rather a little disappointed in Deputy Lemass, because I have again and again explained here in this House what the prison regulations are, and I thought that Deputy Lemass would have been sufficiently interested in the prisoners and the cases of the prisoners to have listened to the explanations which I made.  Prisoners who are convicted of sedition or who are convicted of seditious libel are always treated as Class 1 prisoners and receive treatment as such.  They must.  That is the statute. Prisoners convicted of sedition and seditious libel must be treated as Class 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy proceeded to instance a case to-day.  The matter he mentioned would at the utmost have been sedition. The Deputy talked, and other Deputies too, talked about the prison regulations for what they call political prisoners, and most of what was said seems to refer to the principle which is underlying the differentiation of people into political and non-political prisoners.</P>
      <P>As far as sedition is concerned, I have already pointed out that our prison regulations have regard to it and make special provision for it.  As far as other offences are concerned, I do not care what the motive is, if persons commit serious crime they must pay for their crime.  If a man commits murder or robbery or acts of armed violence, it does not matter the slightest bit to the victim or to the community what was the motive which inspired his action. One of the cases which is claimed to be political was a case of ordinary, simple murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard again from Deputy Lemass these old stories about ill-treatment in Mountjoy.  These stories were completely exploded.  He mentioned that Deputy Dr. Ryan had seen marks on the lady.  The lady never complained, <Col N="389" /> and I do not believe she has ever complained to Deputy Dr. Ryan, that any more violence was used against her than was necessary.  These ladies locked themselves into a room and the door had to be opened.  They clung to the banisters and had to be brought to their cells.  Never has one of these ladies, so far as I know, made a complaint that any undue violence was used towards them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not, I say with great respect.  I come to two very interesting speeches which were delivered, that of Deputy Fahy and that of Deputy Derrig.  As far as the Borstal institution is concerned, it is now being carried on in Clonmel, and everything that can be done to train and educate the young men committed there is being done.  I will frankly admit that I do not think Clonmel was an ideal place in which to start the Borstal institution.  The building is a disused prison in the town.  I do not think it was a good place to start it, but it has been started there and is working.  Deputies will understand that to purchase a rural place and build a new institution with the necessary surroundings would cost a great deal of money, and I do not think it is expenditure that we would be justified in undertaking at present.  As I say, it would have been better if, when the expense was being incurred at the beginning, the institution had been established in rural surroundings and not in a town.  However, as I say, very good work has been done in the institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig dealt with a very large question, which would take us into the whole matter of industrial schools, as to whether the training of boys in these schools in trades is or is not always advisable.  That is a matter upon which I could not express an <Col N="390" /> opinion, and I think it is outside the scope of this Vote.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahy also referred to the after-care of prisoners when they left prison.  We have an agent for discharged prisoners.  The Deputy will see that there is a payment of £75 made to an agent for looking after discharged prisoners and getting them in touch with prisoners aid associations and associations of that kind.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the food in prisons was bad and that because the cost of maintenance was falling, therefore, the prisoners must be receiving worse treatment than before.  The reason why the gross cost of maintenance, I think I made it clear, is less than it was, is because the prison population is less than it was.  The prison population is steadily sinking, I am glad to say, and naturally the sinking of the prison population will mean a decrease in the gross cost of maintenance.  In Portlaoighise some of the food consumed in the prison is produced there.</P>
    <P>A question was also put by Deputy Davin as to a prisoner named Murray in Portlaoighise who is in a very precarious state of health.  He was sentenced to death some years ago for wilful murder and his sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life. He is undoubtedly in a very precarious state of health, but what can be done to alleviate his present condition is being done and everything that can be done to alleviate it will be done.  But it is not a case in which the man after this comparatively short period of time could be released, if that is what the Deputy means.  I think I have dealt with all the points at issue.</P>

I was interested in the matter, and I think I gave a frank, honest statement in connection with this matter to the House. Does the Minister deny that prisoners were employed to keep order owing to the fact that a sufficient number of wardresses were not present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy knows the facts, because he received a statement.  He said he spoke very candidly to the House, but I could not agree.  It was not alleged by the ladies that they were assaulted by prisoners, but they alleged that one or two of the female prisoners used a poker to break open the door of the cell in which they had improperly confined themselves.  The ladies never alleged they were assaulted.</P>

      <P>I did not.  The Minister said that I alleged no more violence was used than was necessary with Mrs. MacDermott, and that she never alleged it herself.  She could not allege it herself because she was brought away in an ambulance from Mountjoy to Mercer's Hospital, where I saw her. I did not say it was the result of a beating.  It was a few days after the hunger-strike that I saw her.  She was suffering from black marks on her legs and arms.  I ask the Minister did he think that that amount of violence was necessary to remove her to her cell because I saw she was not in a fit condition to tell me at the time I was speaking to her.</P>

      <P>I move the adjournment of the House until Wednesday. I understood that we were to <Col N="395" /> have finished the Estimates to-day, but there is still one Estimate which is on the list furnished for discussion that has not been taken.  That one remains over.  Then there is the question of the Appropriation Bill next week.  I should like to know if we could get any indication of the time that will be occupied with the remaining Estimate, that is, the one that completes the list furnished, Vote 66.  We would require to have at least two stages of the Appropriation Bill taken on Wednesday, and on that day I propose to allot private members' time from a quarter to ten to enable Deputy Murphy to wind up on his motion.  It was understood that a day would be given to the motion on the paper in the name of Deputy Ryan.  The only reservation that I would make in regard to that is, that it is rather pressing that Item 4 should be passed.  The Minister for Education has also pressed me with regard to his Bill.  The reservation I make is that these Bills should be advanced a stage to enable us to complete the programme in a reasonable time.</P>
