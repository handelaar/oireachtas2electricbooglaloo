      <P>asked the President if any representations have been made to him on behalf of shareholders in the Wolfhill Colliery Co., Ltd. (in liquidation), and if the Government proposes to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain informal representations were made to me a year ago in the interests of the shareholders of the Wolfhill Colliery Co., Ltd. (in liquidation).  It would appear that the call upon shareholders who were liable for calls in arrear was made pursuant to an Order of Court dated 17th October, 1927, and consequently the matter was not one in which the Government could intervene.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The President is aware that when this company was started persons who subscribed for shares in it did so very largely not for investment purposes but to help what they thought would be a useful Irish industry, and in many cases they are proceeded against and in some cases their goods seized for the balance of the shares due by them?  Does the President know that in many other cases the shares were subscribed for by branches of the Sinn Fein Organisation but held in the names of particular individuals and these particular individuals are now proceeded against for the moneys due; and in view of the fact that grave hardship is being caused by that in special circumstances, <Col N="1122" /> would it not be possible to devise some means by which that hardship would be mitigated and some relief brought to the individuals in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the fact that certain branches of the Sinn Fein Organisation subscribed for these shares in the names of certain of their members, but if the Deputy says so I accept it as a fact.  But this is simply on a par with any other public company in respect of which shares would be sold for a useful industrial concern of any sort or kind, and I do not see that it would be possible or politic to interfere in one case in the interests of shareholders and not in all.</P>

I should add, however, that in a large number of these cases the refusal of payment was justified on grounds which do not depend on the terms of Section 9.</P>

    <P>A large number of these pensioners are in receipt of old age pensions, the increase to which they were entitled under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, and Section 6 of the Superannuation Act, 1923, having been reduced in many cases in order that they might be granted larger old age pensions, and so receive the largest possible income from the two pensions.  Furthermore, many of the disablement pensioners retired under the Rules of 1897, and were awarded lump sums, and, in addition, small pensions which were subsequently commuted.  The pensions of which these pensioners are at present in receipt were granted under the Rules of 1914, and are in addition to those previously awarded and commuted.</P>
    <P>As regards the concluding part of the question, it is not intended to introduce proposals for legislation similar to the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1924, passed by the British Parliament.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is a fact that at the open competitive examination for writing assistants held on 23rd October, 1928, at the Convocation Hall, Earlsfort Terrace, no artificial lighting was provided, and if, as a result, about sixty candidates who attended that centre were seriously prejudiced by having the time allowed to work the last paper set in History and Geography curtailed by a period of about fifteen minutes; and, if so, whether reasonable allowance will be made in marking that particular paper, by way of compensation for this disadvantage, or what steps, if any, he proposes to take in this matter.</P>

      <P>No artificial light was provided in the examination hall on the day referred to in the question, because it was anticipated as the result of previous experience that there would be sufficient daylight to finish the examination in the time available.  As the afternoon proved to be exceptionally dark, it was arranged by cutting out an interval of 15 minutes which would otherwise have been allowed between the papers set in the last two subjects of the day, to terminate the examination 15 minutes earlier than the scheduled time.  Although full light was not available towards the end of the period allowed for the last paper, the light was sufficient to enable the candidates to finish without difficulty, and the candidates themselves stated that they were able to finish their papers in the light available.  The time allowed for the last paper was not curtailed, as suggested in the question, and no candidate has complained that she was unable to finish the paper for want of light.  The Civil Service Commissioners inform me that, in the circumstances, they propose to deal with the papers of the candidates in question in the same way as those of candidates examined at other centres.</P>

Curragh Camp, to the General Military Hospital, on the 4th January, 1928, was left in violent pain without any medical assistance for two days; that repeated requests for medical attention were made by his wife, without avail; that it was stated to his wife on the 9th January, 1928, that an operation for appendicitis had been successfully performed; that subsequently two further operations were performed by a Dublin surgeon, after which the lieutenant died, and that this surgeon is reputed to have said that the appendix had not been removed in <Col N="1133" /> the first operation; and whether, in view of these allegations, it is proposed to hold an inquiry into the circumstances of the late Lieutenant Lanigan's death and to make a grant or give financial assistance to his widow.</P>

In accordance with the best surgical teaching and practice the appendix was not removed at this operation.  Its removal was deferred until the 9th January, 1928.  Owing to complications arising, a further operation was necessary.  This third operation, I am sorry to say, failed to save the patient's life.  I am not aware that on the 9th January, 1928, it was stated that an operation for appendicitis had been successfully performed. Such a statement, if made, would not have been at variance with facts.  The first operation was performed by a military surgeon.  The second and third were performed by a Dublin surgeon (attached to the Army as consultant). This Dublin surgeon repudiates the suggestion that he made any suggestion relative to the case which could be construed as a reflection on his military colleague.  I am aware that allegations have been made as to neglect in the medical attention given to the deceased. These allegations have been fully inquired into, and I am satisfied that they are without foundation.  I regret there are no funds at my disposal from which financial assistance could be granted to Mrs. Lanigan.</P>

Following the usual procedure the allottees were informed when the lands were being divided that they would be required during the coming winter to erect sod fences between the allotments and that an allowance would be made for all fences built to the Land Commission specifications. There has been no delay in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission completed their part of the improvement works last July; the necessary drainage and fencing of rights-of-way being done by direct labour.

Of this sum £1,056 has been expended. The roads and drains are at present in a good state of repair, but before handing them over to the tenants for upkeep the Land Commission propose next summer to give the drains a final cleaning and to repair any small defects that may appear in the roads during the coming winter.

I do not know what procedure should be adopted to have the matter raised formally. There was a report circulated a week or so ago from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges announcing that the Committee had decided the practice heretofore adopted should not be altered, and, therefore, that we should continue to sit on those days of obligation, Catholic holidays.  We are up against the question again.  So far as this week is concerned a holiday will occur to-morrow.  I do not know whether the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be discussed now by leave of the Chair, or leave of the House, or whether I would be permitted to move now that the House adjourn until Friday morning next.  According to the decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we would have to meet as usual to-morrow.  We would be glad to have your ruling, sir. as to whether I would be in order in moving the matter now, or whether we could discuss it on the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's statement raises two questions. One is whether the House should sit to-morrow, and the second is as to the method by which a decision of the House with regard to the general question of sittings of the House on holidays of obligation can be obtained.  I will take the general question first.  The <Col N="1145" /> matter of sittings was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and the report of the Committee was presented in dummy to the Dáil on the 11th October.  On the 19th printed copies of the report were circulated to Deputies.  The report is in favour of continuing the present practice.  If a decision of the House is required on the recommendation contained in that report, I think the Deputy, or some other Deputy looking at the matter from the point of view of Deputy O'Kelly, would have to table a motion to the effect that the Dáil disagree with the Committee in its report, and that the House should not in future sit on holidays of obligation. That would be an ordinary motion by a private Deputy, which would arise for consideration in private Deputies' time.  I think that is the only way a decision could be obtained on the general question.</P>
      <P>With regard to sitting to-morrow, Deputy O'Kelly would not be in order in moving now that the Dáil should adjourn until Friday.  The time allotted is Government time, and the Deputy would not be in order in offering any motion in regard to the adjournment of the House.  On the question of an adjournment over to-morrow, a decision could not be reached to-day, and a decision on that question would not decide the general question.  In regard to the general question, a motion would have to be tabled in order to obtain a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not.  The motion for the adjournment will be taken at 10.30 this evening, and the President need not move the motion until 10.30 p.m.  A division cannot be taken after 10.30, so the position is that no amendment can be decided in that way.  What it amounts to is that the prerogative regarding the adjournment of the House belongs to the Executive of the moment.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges did decide in a particular way only by a majority of six to <Col N="1146" /> five, I suggest that the question of bringing that question up for decision of the House should not be left to a private member by putting a motion at the end of a long list of motions.  I suggest, having regard to the obvious difference of opinion in the Committee, that the Government should give the House facilities to raise that question. To do it in the way you suggest means that it cannot be raised, as the motion would be right down at the far end of a whole list of motions.  Our experience of private members' motions is that they take a lot of time to be reached.  In practice, the remedy you suggest is a denial of remedy.  I suggest under those circumstances, without saying anything one way or another as to the merits of the decision, that having regard to the even difference of opinion in that Committee, the Government might very well facilitate the House in coming to an early decision.</P>

      <P>That is a separate question altogether.

But no provision is being made in the present Bill, which, as I said, is to complete the housing proposals of the Government in connection with the policy which has been in operation since 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the question because the President has made public pronouncements upon the matter, and we are now waiting.  I think, thirteen months for the making available of the facilities promised in September, 1927.  Reading through the President's <Col N="1149" /> pronouncements here and outside in regard to the housing question, one is inclined to think that the solving of it in the rural parts of the country must necessarily wait until there is some agreement on the question of building costs in the three or four cities.  The President knows well, and if he does not know the Minister for Local Government knows, that there are numerous demands in the Local Government Department from local authorities in the rural areas for long-term loans.  I fail to see, especially if the President's statement is true, that money is available, why these facilities cannot now be afforded to the local authorities who are prepared to go ahead with schemes if money is made available.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If it appears to the Minister that the number of houses, the erection or completion of which is begun and completed within the period prescribed by Rule 5 of the First Schedule to the Principal Act as amended by this Act, is such that the aggregate amount of the grants payable under the Principal Act and this Act is less than Eight Hundred Thousand Pounds, the Minister may by Order fix such dates later than the 17th day of October, 1928, and the 18th day of October, 1929, as may appear to him expedient for the purpose of ensuring that the aggregate amount of the said grants will be, as nearly as may be, Eight Hundred Thousand Pounds, and such other corresponding dates as appear to him proper for the purposes of the note at the end of Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the Principal Act, and upon the making of such Order, Section 5 of this Act shall have effect as if the dates so fixed were substituted for the dates specified therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment speaks for itself, and there is no necessity for me to explain it except to say that the purpose of the amendment is to secure that the £200,000 which the House is giving shall be fully spent.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I expressed a doubt as to whether the £200,000 would be spent.  So far as we understand, the last of the money allocated under this Act was allocated in April or May.  Intimation was given to people building houses in, I think, about the month of May that no more money was available, and that it had all been allocated.  I am not sure that a sufficient number of houses have been built or were started between that time and the 17th October to absorb the full £200,000. and all the amendment seeks to do is to give the Minister the power to extend the date if he finds that the number of houses that will have qualified <Col N="1154" /> for the grant up to the 17th October would not have fully absorbed the £200,000.  It gives the Minister power to extend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments in Deputy Morrissey's name, so far as they go.  But my objections to them and to the Bill we are now discussing is that they do practically nothing, because to pass this Bill in its present form, even with these amendments, would be applying a very small plaster to a very large wound.  The Housing Act of 1925 is sought to be amended by the Bill now before the House.  That is, it is a winding-up of the present housing policy of the Government, but it creates a hiatus between what has been done in the past and what remains to be done in the future.  We will be left completely in the dark if this Bill as it stands is passed, as to what the housing policy of the future is to be.  It seems to be suggested by some Deputies here, and the President seemed to accept the view, that before we can get on with the housing problem we must first get prices down to an economic level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. RICE Mr. RICE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out the objection to the Bill, and the amendment, in the fact that they are stopping the policy which was in existence up to now, and substituting nothing new for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the expending of a sum not exceeding £200,000, and Deputy Morrissey's amendment is moved to ensure that that sum at least shall be spent.  By this amendment he proposes an extension of the date to provide for that.  I submit it is in order for me in discussing <Col N="1155" /> it to point out that this is not a remedy for the situation intended to be dealt with, and that the Government before they attempted to pass this Bill with or without the amendment should announce what their housing policy is to be in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>In Committee on this Bill it would be quite out of order for the Government to announce their policy for the future. Nothing could be further from what may be discussed on the Committee Stage of the Bill than a statement of that nature.  On the Second Stage the Deputy would be quite in order in making the speech he is endeavouring to make now, but he cannot make it at this Stage.  The very limitations of the Bill itself, of which the Deputy complains, limit the Deputy's rights of speech on such lines at the moment.</P>

      <P>I suggest instead of Deputy Morrissey's amendment and the dates 17th and 18th October a later date, say, the 1st of April or May next year.  No doubt that would let in a number of people who could not come in under the Bill or the amendment. It would mean a further expenditure of money on the project, but it would carry out a little further the policy contemplated by the Act of 1925.  I ask the Government earnestly to consider doing that and if it is not in order to refer to the suggestions that I have already put before them that before passing this Bill, with or without amendments, they should consider announcing their new policy whatever it may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that Deputy Rice is correct when he says the present Bill is no remedy for the situation with which it is intended to deal.  I suggest that it is a remedy that will completely and effectively deal <Col N="1156" /> with what it is intended to deal.  There is no use saying that this Bill does not continue the Government's building policy.  The first thing that was done was that £1,000,000 was granted and no one complained that nothing more was done.  Certain further proposals were brought in in May, 1924, and continued in 1925 and 1926.  As the President said, this Bill is to bring these proposals to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The position is that the 1926 Act which allotted certain additional amounts of money gave people, in the first place, twenty-eight months in which to complete their houses.  It gave an additional four months in certain circumstances.  That Act which it is proposed to wind up gave people actually thirty-two months to wind up their building schemes.  The present Bill takes into consideration that people were slow in taking advantage of the Acts and by the time all the money under the 1926 Act was used up there were people who might have entered into commitments and expenditure and in some cases begun the building of their houses.  That was so far as private persons were concerned.  Certain local authorities, it is recognised, purchased ground and had taken up very elaborate schemes which had been sanctioned by the Department.  It was pointed out that a number of houses had actually been begun before 17th October and it was thought that commitments to build houses on the part of local authorities ought to be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The number of houses people were committed to under the facilities granted under the 1926 Act amounted to about 800 in the case of private individuals and to about 1,600 in the case of local authorities.  It is proposed to wind up, definitely, that matter.  As well as the twenty-eight months originally given to people to complete their schemes they are now given an additional twelve months and in all reasonableness I suggest that is quite sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There need not be any fear in the mind of Deputy Morrissey that the £200,000 will not be spent, because if there is any falling off in the building of houses by private individuals <Col N="1157" /> money will be available for local authorities who are not bound by any considerations as to length of time in which to complete their schemes, so that whatever is saved from individuals can be used by local authorities.  So far as that is concerned there is no question of money not being used.  With regard to the question of time it is undesirable that people should not be clear as to what is required of them in order to get the grant under this scheme. Prior to the announcement being made about June last that further moneys would be available under this particular scheme, there was a certain amount of excuse for people doubting that they were about to get money, but there is no excuse for them now not realising that they must have had their houses started by a certain time and that they must be finished, at least, by the 17th October, 1929.  From that point of view, I think it would be undesirable for them that the Minister should have power to vary the date. There may be a case for removing the date from the 17th October, 1928, and passing it on for a short period.  I would be prepared, between now and the Report Stage, to consider the advisability of changing that initial date.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Changing that particular date, in the case of a number of houses for which there are commitments, would involve an additional expenditure of money.  There can be no doubt about that.  I am not prepared to accept Deputy Morrissey's amendment as it is unnecessary and undesirable but I would be prepared between now and the Report Stage to consider a change in the date from the 17th October, 1928, to a subsequent date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you what it would do.  A certain number of local authorities have entered into commitments and the Budget has been made accordingly.  If we do this in a loose way and if a large number of private persons are induced to come in, the question of their being entitled to receive grants will arise, so that the number of persons coming in in that uncontrolled way would be large, and they might be left without money which they thought they had a reasonable chance of getting.  Otherwise, you would have to cut down the moneys which local authorities expect or else exceed the £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not leave the date in a loose way.  The dates in my amendment would not be looser than they are in the Bill, which gives the Minister power also to alter the closing date.  I do not think that people will be under any misapprehension. It will be quite clear that it is only in the event of there being a surplus that the Minister will have power to alter the dates.  My only concern is that £200,000, at least, will be spent. If the Minister can assure the House that a sufficient number of houses were in process of being built up to the 17th October to absorb the £200,000, and if he is satisfied that the local authorities will carry out their programme and will avail of the £200,000, I would not press my amendment.  It is one thing for local authorities to talk about acquiring sites and it is another thing for them to build, because very often they do not build.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Budget is concerned, with regard to local authorities it is based on certain definite schemes, and I have every confidence that they are going ahead with them.  There is no limit of time in regard to them.  I would ask the Deputy to consider the position of a private individual beginning to build on the <Col N="1159" /> 1st November this year, and saying that he did not know whether he was going to get a grant.  That would be an impossible position and the only reasonable way of meeting it would be to shift the date from the 17th October, 1928.  When I get an opportunity I will go into the matter.</P>

      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that not later than the 17th day of October, 1928, the plans for the erection or reconstruction of a house had been submitted for approval in accordance with Rule 8 of the First Schedule to the Principal Act or that other substantial preparation for the commencement of the work of erection or reconstruction of a house had been made, and that, in either case, the commencement of the work was not unreasonably delayed, the Minister may direct that the erection or reconstruction of the house shall be deemed to have been begun not later than the 17th day of October, 1928.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with a different matter.  In the Bill reference is made to a building begun before the 17th October, 1928.  I submit that there are a number of people who had started to make preparations for building houses some months prior to 17th October. In many cases plans would be submitted to the local authority and there might be considerable delay before such plans would be returned, before the contracts could be placed or building started.  If the Minister is satisfied that there would be no unreasonable delay, I am suggesting, if a person proved that his plans had been deposited with the local authority and that a reasonable effort was being made to start building, but that there was an unavoidable delay, the Minister should have power to extend the date.</P>

I think that that question is too wide to answer here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated here on the last day on which this Vote was under discussion that I objected to the proposals contained in Deputy Kerlin's speech.  In that speech I detect two proposals, one for a territorial force and the other for a volunteer force. These two things, to my mind, ought not to hang together.  I objected to a volunteer force, and I approve of a territorial force, apart from the system of volunteer enlistment, under the control of the proper authorities and organised under a well thought out scheme.  I do object to the volunteer system in a territorial force.  It is quite possible that within the next few years the time will be ripe for this Government or any other government, to launch out into the formation of a territorial force, but I do not think that time has arrived yet.  I say that for one reason only.  I think that we had better get away from the atmosphere of two or three years ago, get away from the actual people who took part in the events of that time and begin with a new generation.  I say that for the reasons which I advanced <Col N="1162" /> on the last day.  Habits have been acquired, and things have been done and the people responsible would be the first who would come in if a voluntary method were adopted.  I prefer at the moment to have a paid army than an army that would come together with the idea of paying itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kerlin spoke on the last day as if there were no people in the State and no party in this House which had a national outlook except Deputy Kerlin's Party, but as far as I could see from his speech, the only distinction that he made was that in the achievement of national ideals he would rely altogether on force.  That suggestion is contained in every line of his speech. Force, it seems to me, was his only argument, and he did not put a tooth in it.  I do not know that diplomacy is a strong point with Deputy Kerlin. He is candid enough; he certainly gave warning to any enemy he had.  That is a good thing for the other fellow.  I would like to read some extracts from his speech.  Speaking about the Army, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>What purpose is it for?  What can it do at present?  As the Deputy said, if this country were attacked tomorrow by any big European power equipped with all the latest methods of warfare, what effective resistance could the present Army offer to such an invasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might very reasonably be asked what resistance either could be offered by an Army of 500,000?  Does any sane man at the moment think that the problems of this country are going to be solved by the use of force?  Of course, if he has that opinion he is right to stick to that policy and to tell the country that the only line by which his object can be achieved is by the use of force.  I say that 500 men will give you the same results, as far as the ultimate end is concerned, as 500,000 men. The only difference will be that you will have more corpses with 500,000 men. You will have 500,000 instead of 500 dead, and it will take a week or ten days longer to lay the country waste. That is the only difference, but it will be done more thoroughly.  The country will be more thoroughly laid waste, if we come to loggerheads with any European <Col N="1163" /> country.  I want to point out that there is no possibility of coming to loggerheads with any small Power.  We are not surrounded by any small Powers.  Our country is not situated in the Balkans.  It is situated in the Atlantic convenient to the shores of England, and if any Power ever landed here for the purpose of conducting a war, it will be a first-class Power.</P>
    <P>At a later point Deputy Kerlin states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Cooper has justified the merits of a parochial force as a real territorial force should be. It should be organised in districts under local officers, of course supervised by officers from headquarters.</P>
    <P>There again we get his idea of what a territorial force should be; it should be in parochial units.  It may or may not be effectively controlled from headquarters. It is easy to talk about control from headquarters, but I do not think you can get effective control.  I said a few moments ago that Deputy Kerlin seemed to have only one method of remedying the ills of the country.  He found fault with the Minister's declaration. He talks of a famous declaration of loyalty to the British Empire &ldquo;a declaration of satisfaction with our present status, and a declaration that his Party intended to take no further steps in the matter of attaining complete freedom for this country.&rdquo;  He asked: &ldquo;What conclusion can we come to? The conclusion is fairly obvious that this Army and the proposed extension of it, as far as this reserve is concerned, is just for the same purpose.&rdquo;  Evidently Deputy Kerlin's idea is that it should be an Army of aggression, that it should be an army to take advantage of certain opportunities when they arise.  There we have a diversity of opinion between Deputy Kerlin and some of his own front benchers. Deputy Fahy said that a defence force is a very apt description, that it appealed to him and was what his ideal of a force should be, that we wanted to attack nobody.  Deputy Kerlin and some other Deputies took a very different line.  Their idea is an aggressive force ready to seize opportunities whenever they come their way.</P>

      <P>That is a question for these great military men and not for old veterans like you or me.  Deputy Kerlin seems to be the Commander-in-Chief or the Chief of Staff.  We are too timid for that sort of thing.  He said: &ldquo;I suppose the present Government has left all thoughts of making any advance behind. What about the protestations of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in 1922?&rdquo; I am quoting the Deputy's words.  If there is any fault it is with the Deputy's words, or at least the notetaker took them down in that way. Now, it is quite evident what the Deputy meant, even if he did not put it into the best language.  I am not questioning it at all; it is quite good enough and quite intelligent enough for me. He takes that as evidence, that because we are not eager for a large, aggressive army we have left all thoughts of national advance behind and that there is no road open to an advance nationally except the road of force.  There is one thing at least we are very anxious about&mdash;the disappearance of the boundary line.  We are very anxious about unity, and when&mdash;I am speaking for myself&mdash;the individuals who say that the road to unity is through force, that unity is to be effected in our time, or in the time of our children, by force, I hope I am not offensive when I say that I do not think they are very responsible individuals, that they have more or less taken leave of their senses, that they refuse to exercise the faculty of common sense.  If it ever comes that this country should go out against the British there are a few people who will go out without squealing.</P>

I do <Col N="1165" /> not recollect that the Deputy introduced the question of partition and its solution by force.  That is a very wide subject.  To be quite frank, I am prepared to do my best to keep that subject from being introduced into the debate by anybody.  I do not think Deputy Gorey should introduce it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention. When these intellectuals have expended their energies in interruptions I am prepared to go on.  When I hear a Deputy suggesting the formation of a large, effective and adequate army, and coupling with that the suggestion of an advance nationally, I take it that the only logical conclusion to come to is that he means to make the advance nationally by the strength of the Army, and that is force.  In my opinion, physical force, the force of the Army, underlies every word that he has said and every suggestion that he has made.  If that is not a correct interpretation of what he has said, I apologise.  In the latter part of his speech the Deputy dealt with the formation of a territorial force and at the same time a volunteer force.  He said: &ldquo;Of course, the question of compulsory liability for military service is a different one altogether, and is one which should be discussed at another time.  But you could have a territorial force, based mainly on a voluntary system, and perhaps you could even go as far as adopting the system that they have in South Africa, where, if they are unable to get voluntarily the number of recruits they require every year, they have a ballot by districts for the remainder.&rdquo;  That is where he emphasised it that in the first instance his territorial force should be mainly a volunteer force, and there is where I join issue with Deputy Kerlin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. KERLIN Mr. KERLIN">

      <P>What does the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if there is to be a territorial force at all it should be selected indiscriminately on some other basis.  As I said earlier, we know that if a territorial force was decided on now, to be constituted by voluntary enlistment and voluntary rushing to the colours, it would be composed of people who, in many cases, <Col N="1166" /> would not be desirable.  The Deputy talked about economy.  I do not think there would be much difference, from the point of view of economy, between such a system and the Minister's suggested system.  The Minister said that 5,000 would be the proper force to aim at.  From Deputy Kerlin's point of view the proper force would be 3,000 of a permanent staff, with 5,000 for training every year.  I am prepared to give credit for earnest intention to Deputy Kerlin.  I think his speech, whether we agree with it or not, was a well-thought-out one.  He seems to have devoted a great deal of care and a fair amount of understanding to the subject, but I doubt if the reasons that he has expressed here are the only reasons behind his suggestion.  I know from the formation of his Party, with the assistance that he has in his Party, he would be delighted to put something to the test.  We know that with a territorial system, apart from a voluntary system, we would have all kinds of pleas made and reasons given for not serving&mdash;using all the tricks and schemes to avoid service.  That is a usual thing in any army, and on the principle that it takes a shirker to catch a shirker, or a thief to catch a thief, I think that the Fianna Fáil Party as at present constituted would have a first-hand service in that direction.</P>

      <P>I withdraw.  I am absolutely in your hands.  But I do point out that it may be one of the causes of their anxiety to have a new scheme. We know that there is pulling of strings, representations, influential people employed to try to get people from serving, from doing their duty to their country.  There have been several cases of that.  We know that in the recent great war Ministers in England were got at, or attempts were made to get at them.  Whereever a string could be pulled it was pulled, and men were kept out of the Army for years.  After all their representations they had to be dragged in ultimately to serve in the labour battalions. One of them is now sitting on the Fianna Fáil benches.  They will have at their elbow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is more or less reluctantly that I am intervening in the debate on the Army Estimate, because is has been of considerable duration, and has eaten substantially into the time available for the discussion of other Estimates.  I think it has become quite obvious from the debate, as far as it has proceeded, that it is likely to prove one of the most important that will take place during the present session. I was not here on Thursday or Friday last when this debate was proceeding, but I have carefully read through the report of the speeches made on both sides of the House, as they appeared in the Official Debates, and I must say, personally, that I am much less clear as to what the Army policy of the Executive is than I was before the debate commenced.  On Wednesday last, if I had been asked by any Deputy, or by any person outside, what the policy of the Government in relation to the Army was, I could have pointed to a definite statement made in this House by a responsible Minister and say: &ldquo;You will find it contained within that statement.&rdquo;  I could not refer any person to that statement now, because during the course of this debate it has been revealed that there has been, apparently, a complete reversal of that policy during a very recent period.  I am intervening in the debate to ask the Minister for Defence to answer certain definite queries which I am now about to put to him.  On the 6th May, 1926, the then Minister for Defence, in response to demands from various sections in this House and outside it, uttered a statement on Army policy.  It was a considered statement. <Col N="1169" /> It was not the personal statement of a particular individual who happened to be Minister for Defence at the time. It was a statement on Army policy which, he was quite clear to convey to the House, had the approval of the Executive Council.  It was as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Well, I have no hesitation in stating the policy now.  It is this: The organisation of our defence forces should, in the first place, be such that it would be capable of rapid and efficient expansion in time of need to the maximum strength of the country's man-power.  This will necessitate the training of all ranks in duties of a more advanced nature than those normally associated with each rank.  The Army must be an independent national force, so organised, trained and equipped as to render it capable, should the necessity arise, of assuming responsibility for the defence of the territory of the Saorstát against invasion, or internal destructive agencies, or against violation of neutrality on the part of an enemy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement was made by the Minister for Defence on the 6th May, 1926.  In the debate upon the Army Estimate for last year that statement was referred to by the President.  He moved the adoption of the estimate and said that that statement contained then a concise and clear definition of the Army policy of the Executive Council.  In introducing the estimate this year the Minister did not deal with Army policy as such.  He confined himself to dealing with matters of detail in relation to the Army, and he made one important and significant statement to which, in view of what happened since, I would like to refer:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have moved on so quickly during the last year towards the normal that we have come across many facts we were previously unaware of, and here I have to make a slight confession, and it is that our outlook on certain points, from close observation, has changed considerably.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Minister made no reference <Col N="1170" /> to Army policy.  That was apparently left to another Minister, the only Minister, I think, who has spoken in the debate, the Minister for Agriculture.  Now, the Minister for Agriculture is a member of the Executive Council, and we know that members of the Executive Council have collective responsibility.  The whole Council is responsible for the acts and words of each member of the Council, and we must assume that when the Minister for Agriculture stood up and enunciated the Army policy here on Thursday last he was speaking with the sanction of the Executive Council. I would like to remind the House now of the Army policy enunciated on the 6th May, 1926:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Army must be an independent national force, so organised, trained and equipped as to render it capable should the necessity arise of assuming responsibility for the defence of the territory of the Saorstát or against invasion or against violation of neutrality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, speaking last Thursday, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Army is not for the purpose of defending us in a military way against any first-class Power that wants to attack us.  It is quite useless for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In those days and in our circumstances at the present moment force will not be a remedy between us and any other country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, it appears to me that these two statements are diametrically opposed. We cannot have the Army maintained as an independent national force, organised, trained and equipped to defend the territory of the Saorstát against invasion, if a responsible Minister can come to the House and tell us that the Army which exists is quite useless for that purpose.  The Minister for Agriculture is in a position to know more about the Army than we do.  We assumed that the Ministry had made some attempt during the past two years to put into operation the policy which it declared to be its <Col N="1171" /> policy in 1926.  But, at the end of two years, during which that policy was presumably in operation, we have a responsible Minister coming here and telling us that the Army is quite useless for the purpose of implementing that policy.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised here as to the equipment of the Army and as to its effectiveness.  It was pointed out that it had no independent source of munitions, and that any enemy that succeeded in cutting our communications with England, or that happened to be in alliance with England, could render our Army inoperative in a very short period by depriving it of the munitions of war.  The Minister for Agriculture was, at any rate, quite logical.  He points out, or at any rate implied in his speech&mdash;I will read the quotation&mdash; that the fact that munition factories were not established here was due to deliberate design, because it would not mean that the Army would be any more effective by their establishment&mdash; that it would be useless in any case. The words are: &ldquo;Will the Deputy also explain to me why it is that our Army, small, cramped, without any tanks, with a small air service, without any of the modern appliances for propagation of poison gas, if it is no good at all, what is the use of establishing a few munition factories?  Is it not only playing with the situation?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the Minister for Defence in his reply to tell us definitely if the Army policy enunciated on the 6th May holds good.  I want him to tell us whether he, the particular Minister in charge of the Department, takes the side of the President, if the President still holds to his declaration in regard to the Army policy, or the side of the Minister for Agriculture, which, incidentally, appears to be the side of Deputy Gorey.  Is the Army being maintained for the purpose of defending the territory of the Saorstát against invasion or against violation of neutrality, or is it, as the Minister for Agriculture tells us, quite useless for that purpose and is being maintained for an entirely different reason?  The Minister cannot possibly reconcile both statements.  I know he is a very astute <Col N="1172" /> debater, and he will try to, but he cannot reconcile the irreconcilable; he cannot ride both horses at the same time, because they are going in opposite directions.  He has to stand by the policy declared by his predecessor and reaffirmed by the President last year, or otherwise he has to stand by what was said by the Minister for Agriculture in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has already been repudiated by one member of his Party.  He is now being supported by another member of the Party although, perhaps, Deputy Gorey's exact affiliation to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is somewhat doubtful. I should, perhaps, say that the Minister for Agriculture is supported by the late leader of the Farmers' Party.  Is it a fact, as would seem to appear, that there is a division in Cumann na nGaedheal on this question of Army policy; that there are two sections, one believing the Army should be maintained to defend the island against invasion, and protect the people against any violation of neutrality, and the other believing that it is a waste of time, energy and money in attempting to establish an army, even an army of 500,000 men, for that purpose, as Deputy Gorey says?  The Minister for Agriculture says that the Army is quite useless.  He says, in as many words, that the Army is being used for the purpose of maintaining internal order; an auxiliary police force of 12,517 men of all ranks for the purpose of assisting the Civic Guard should the Civic Guard at any time require their assistance in maintaining internal order, and for no other purpose.  The Minister for Agriculture was quite clear about that. It is useless to think, was his argument, if this country should be attacked by any foreign enemy, of looking to our Army for a solution of the difficulty which would then arise.  He contends that we are never going to settle any of the issues in our present circumstances, under actual world conditions, until conditions change here and in other countries, and we are not going to settle issues that lie between ourselves and other countries as issues lie between practically all the independent countries of Europe, by force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> If any foreign Power attempts to violate our neutrality, attempts to put maintenance parties at our ports, attempts to demand from our people an annual tribute of £5,000,000, attempts to impose on us a Governor-General whose signature and assent will be necessary to validate the acts of the people's representatives; if any foreign Power attempts to violate our neutrality and places a border across the country, saying on one side that certain conditions shall exist and that different conditions shall exist on the other side, we are not to look to our Army for a solution.  We must settle it by other means, settle it, presumably, as a similar question was settled in the past, by accepting whatever the enemy is prepared to offer and by coming back here and calling it a damn good bargain.  That is the only meaning which can be taken out of the speech of the Minister for Agriculture.  We are maintaining this Army, we are equipping it with aeroplanes and eighteen pounders&mdash;Deputy Cooper wants us to have howitzers as well&mdash; we are building up reserve forces not to defend the country against any outside aggression, but for the sole purpose of acting as an auxiliary police force should the 7,000 Civic Guards be incapable of maintaining order.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said: &ldquo;So what is the Army for?  Why is all this money being spent?  I will tell you: to see to it that the people of this country have a right to do wrong. That is all.  That is what the Army is for.&rdquo;  He added: &ldquo;It exists for the purpose of seeing that the laws passed by the majority elected by the people of this country prevail in this country.&rdquo;  It appears he is getting somewhat confused in his argument. The Army is not to prevent any outside aggression; it is useless for that purpose.  If any such outside aggression should be attempted we are going to settle it by negotiations, by giving in.  We are not to attempt to settle it by force.  At the same time, this selfsame Army is being maintained to ensure that the laws passed by the majority elected by the people of this country shall prevail in this country.</P>
    <P>If the majority in the Dáil decide <Col N="1174" /> that there is to be no Governor-General, decide that the privilege given to the British Army to maintain maintenance parties at our ports is to be withdrawn, or is to decide that the payment of a tribute to England is to stop, apparently this Army is for the purpose of seeing that the will of the majority will prevail in the matter. But the Army is quite useless and, unfortunately, it is not merely an internal question.  The will of the people to decide on these matters might be contested by a foreign country, and that foreign country might forcibly interfere.  It has done so in the past.  It might interfere to ensure that the laws passed by the majority elected by the people in this country do not prevail in this country. It is not one hundred years ago since the elected representatives of the Irish people met in council and passed laws which did not prevail in this country, and which are not prevailing in this country now.  It is quite clear that it is not such laws to which the Minister for Agriculture is referring because he, perhaps, saw that he was leaving a loophole in his argument, and he carefully modified it in another sentence: &ldquo;If we were absolutely certain that you could face up to the fact that in this country no one would challenge the majority will of the people there would be no need for an army.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Army is not to ensure that we will be free from invasion.  It is useless for that purpose.  It is not even to ensure that the majority will of the people will prevail in respect to the laws which they want enacted.  It is only to ensure that nobody in this country will attempt to interfere with the expression of the will of the majority.</P>
    <P>If any section of the people of this State attempt to prevent the enactment of any law that has been freely arrived at by the majority of the people's representatives, then it is only quite right that some instrument should exist to prevent them doing so.  But I contend that if we are going even to continue the pretence that we are a free country then it is also necessary that some instrument should exist by which we-will be able at least to offer some effective <Col N="1175" /> opposition to any attempt by people outside this country to prevent the enactment of laws which are desired by the majority of the people. The policy of the Executive Council, heretofore at any rate, has appeared to be along that line.  They claimed that they were endeavouring to maintain an Army that was an independent national force, and that was organised, trained and equipped so as to be capable of assuming responsibility for the defence of the State against invasion.  But it was only a claim.  We may perhaps be justified in assuming that the Army policy which was outlined by the Minister for Agriculture on Thursday last is not the policy of the Executive Council. Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture has already been hauled over the coals by his superiors and asked to account for the blatant nonsense he talked on that day.  I do not know.  I hope the Minister for Defence will tell us whether he has or not.  It would be undoubtedly a very wise thing for Cumann na nGaedheal to teach the Minister for Agriculture that unless he has something sensible to say he had better say nothing.  It is not the first time that the Minister for Agriculture has landed his Party in the soup and someone else had to come along to extricate it.  But if I leave the Minister for Agriculture out of it, if we leave his Army policy aside as being the policy that he holds with Deputy Gorey and Deputy Gorey only, and assume that the policy enunciated by the predecessor of the Minister for Defence in 1926, and reaffirmed by the President last year, still holds good, then we must examine that policy and see if any serious attempt has been made to put it into operation.  &ldquo;The Army must be capable of rapid and efficient expansion to the maximum of the country's man power.&rdquo;  That Army consists at present of 732 officers and 9,500 men in the regular Army, 1,072 in Class A reserves, and 1,213 in Class B reserves, making a total of 12,517 in all ranks. &ldquo;The Army must be capable of rapid and efficient expansion to the maximum of the country's man power in time of war.&rdquo;  That was the policy laid down in 1926, and here in 1928 we find that the maximum to which the Army can <Col N="1176" /> expand in time of need is 12,517.  Not merely is the capability of the Army to expand limited to that number, but I see that no attempt has been made to ensure that under any conceivable circumstances would the Army be able to expand beyond that figure.  What does the putting into operation of that policy require?  It does involve, in the first place, that the manhood of the nation should know that they are expected in time of need to give military service to the State.  Has any single Executive Minister attempted to expound that policy?</P>
    <P>Has any campaign been conducted in the country to get that idea into the minds of our young men?  Does the Government desire that the young men of the country should get that idea into their heads, the idea of giving voluntary military service to the State in time of need?  Surely if the young men of the country do not know that they are expected to serve in time of need, how can you have an army capable of efficient and rapid expansion to a maximum of the country's man-power?  Even if the Executive Council had succeeded in conveying that idea to the people, even if such a campaign as I have indicated had been conducted in the country, and it was generally known that the Executive Council expected such response from the manhood of the country in time of need, do you think you would get that response if there was not in the minds of the people of the country confidence in the military policy of the Executive Council?  Does that confidence exist?</P>
    <P>We have seen here in this House a member of the Executive Council stand up and enunciate a military policy completely at variance with that laid down by the President of the Executive Council.  We have seen Deputy Gorey, a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;I hope I am not incorrect in referring to him as such&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

      <P>We have seen Deputy Gorey, a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, supporting the Minister <Col N="1177" /> for Agriculture in a view which was repudiated by another member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, Deputy Esmonde.  If there is to be public confidence in the military policy of the Executive Council it is a sine qua non of that that we know what that military policy is.  I hope that the Minister for Defence in reply will remove any doubts that exist in this matter and that he will say definitely what the military policy of the Executive Council is.  He should know.  He should state also whether it is the policy enunciated by the Minister for Agriculture or the policy laid down by the President.  It cannot possibly be both.  &ldquo;An army capable of rapid and efficient expansion to the maximum of the country's man power.&rdquo;  If we are to have an Army of that kind, it is surely necessary to provide that some elementary military training would be given to the young men of the country; that some scheme should be devised by which every man who is expected according to the Ministerial declaration to give military service in time of need would be capable of giving that military service; that he would know one end of a rifle from another; that he should know, as the Minister for Defence does not know, that you cannot fire half-crowns out of a rifle, that you must have certain equipment before one can go soldiering. We have had considerable military experience in this country, but at the same time I do not think it can be claimed that even if the machinery existed by which the entire man power of the country could be called up for service in time of need that we can be certain that the actual individuals would be capable of acting as soldiers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's understanding is almost human.  The statement continues that &ldquo;the Army must be an independent national force so organised, trained and equipped as to make it capable, should the necessity arise, of assuming responsibility for the defence of the Saorstát.&rdquo;  In the course of this debate a number of Deputies have asked how you could have an independent national force without an independent supply of ammunition?  The Minister for Defence was asked that question, I remember, in a previous debate, and he replied &ldquo;if we have not got the ammunition at least we have the money to buy it.&rdquo;  When you have mobilised your twelve thousand men and put Class A reserve in Athlone and Class B reserve in Cork, the Minister for Defence, accompanied by the Minister for Finance, will proceed to issue half-a-crown or five shillings to each man to buy ammunition and fight.  What <Col N="1179" /> else could the Minister have possibly meant?  Undoubtedly while the lines of communication are open, while we can go to England, Germany, France and America to buy ammunition and to transport it here, we will have it, but we are maintaining an Army which is to be capable of defending the country against invasion.  But can an Army which has no independent source of supplies be capable of defending this country against invasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If members of this House are prepared to vote the sum of two million pounds or thereabouts for the purpose of maintaining an army, surely they want an army that can fight.  They do not want merely a collection of individuals in green uniforms who will parade with empty guns and fixed bayonets when angels of peace think it worth their while to visit the country. They will want something more than a mere collection of men wearing uncomfortable and probably unhealthy green uniforms.  They will want an effective force capable of defending the country against invasion.  You have not got it, and in so far as that was part of Government policy, no attempt has been made to put it into operation. That brings us, of course, up against the wider issue of what exactly that Army is capable of doing.  What is the Army capable of doing if any attempt is made by an outside power to invade the country, an army of twelve thousand men organised on Continental lines.  Such an army as that would not be able to stand for five hours against any force which any possible Power attacking this island would send.  It could not do it.  Deputy Gorey was right for once when he said that we cannot get an army capable of defending this country against invasion by any Power that is determined to invade it.  We are not strong enough to do so.  But I maintain that we can get an army so organised, trained and equipped that it will not be possible for any outside Power to rule in this country.  We cannot keep them out They will come in in spite of us.  If our Army is only 12,000 they will come in.  If we had an army of 500,000 they will come, though, as Deputy Gorey <Col N="1180" /> said there will be 500,000 instead of 12,000 dead before they succeed.  But if France, Germany, America or any of the great military Powers were to embark on a campaign of conquest no force that we could put into the field would be able to keep them out.  What we could do is, we could provide, and have shown that we are capable of providing, an army that would make it impossible for that outside Power to rule in comfort here.</P>
    <P>I say it is a wise national policy to organise, train and equip your Army on a basis that will provide the most effective resistance.  That can be done on the lines that I have indicated, and that is the only effective resistance that can be offered.  We can build up an army that will have its roots in the people.  It must have its roots in the people if it is to be effective.  We must have the confidence of the people in the Executive Council.  The people must believe that the Executive Council is prepared to resist aggression on the part of an outside Power. That confidence will not be established by making such statements as were made in the Dáil on Thursday last by the Minister for Agriculture.  The people of this country are prepared to resist by every means in their Power. aggression from an outside Power. Those who maintain otherwise are only trying to colour the attitude of the people by their own cowardice.</P>
    <P>We know that there are men in the country who will take any terms an enemy stronger than they would offer. We know that there are men in this country who, in any crisis that arises, will take the safe course and go whining for mercy instead of standing up for their rights.  But the vast majority of the people of the country would be prepared to resist, and be prepared now to pay whatever is required, to maintain an army capable of resisting. That army does not exist yet, but such an army can be brought into existence.  It can, however, only be brought into existence on the lines that I have indicated.  It must be a territorial force, having its roots in the people.  It must be a volunteer force inspired with the idea of voluntary defence of the nation in time of need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> The present Executive have not that idea in view.  They have another policy. I am referring now to the policy which we were told was in operation heretofore. Even that other policy of theirs, which might have been made of some use, has not been put into operation. They have now a new policy.  If we are to take it that the Minister for Agriculture was speaking for the Executive Council, that new policy is to decry the effectiveness of the force that does exist, while maintaining that force whose one and only function is to act as an auxiliary police force.  I hope that the Minister for Defence will tell us, when concluding, whether he believes that the existing Army is capable of effectively resisting any attempt at the invasion of this island. I hope he will also tell us whether he thinks it is possible, following his present policy, to create in this country an army capable of doing that, and whether it is the intention of the Executive Council to use the Army to resist an invasion if such should be attempted.  I hope that the Minister will make it quite clear whether he personally stands for the Minister for Agriculture or the President, and which of these two represents the mind of the majority in the Executive Council even though there is not unanimity in that body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this issue was very well put by the Minister for Agriculture a short time ago when he asked what was the Army to be used for.  If the Twenty-six Counties are asked to contribute close on £2,000,000 for an Army that, in the words of the Minister for Defence, is to be used as a portion of the Army of the British Empire, then we know where we are; or is it that the Army is going to be used according to the policy of the Minister for Agriculture?  If the Executive Council looked a little before them they would see that the time is coming when the farmers of this country will no longer be able to pay interest on the millions that are being borrowed to keep up this Army and pay the salaries attached to it.  That will be the result when the agricultural policy of our Agricultural Minister for War is followed out to its logical conclusion, that <Col N="1182" /> agricultural policy which has let 187,000 acres go out of tillage since 1922, and caused 167,000 people to leave the rural areas.  When that policy is followed out to its logical conclusion there will be no people left on the lands to pay this extraordinary sum of £1,800,000 for the upkeep of the Army. When we examine into this figure, and see how it is spent, we find that there is only £46,000 for warlike stores. Then, we wonder where we are going to arrive if the policy of the Army is the policy which was read out to us a few minutes ago by Deputy Lemass from the speech of the Minister for Defence.  If that is the policy, I wonder what preparations are being made to arm the civilian population in the event of their being needed?  Are any preparations being made towards providing arms for them?  What preparation is being made to train the young men of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see the policy that is being adopted throughout the country towards Fianna Eireann on the one hand and Deputy Cooper's Boy Scouts on the other.  When we see that we know who are going to get the arms if they are needed.  When we see the persecution of any young boy who dares to have the ideal of a free Ireland in his mind, and when we see, on the other hand, how the Baden-Powell Scouts are winked at, then we know where we are.  I tell the Minister for Defence that we cannot afford to spend £1,750,000 every year on the Army.  The farmers are running into bankruptcy owing to the agricultural policy of the Executive Government.  When it comes to the question of a volunteer army we see the volunteer army persecuted by every means in their power by their C.I.D.  Utilise the volunteer army in the country, and disband your army, which is useless, and hand over your arms to the Irish Republican Army, an army that would cost you nothing and that can be relied upon whenever the country is in difficulty.  Whenever it is faced with foreign aggression that army can be relied upon to fight its corner.  When we realise that out of a sum of £1,800,000 only £46,000 is being spent on warlike stores, and when we further realise that the cartridges for every gun must be bought from England, <Col N="1183" /> we will find that at that rate the country will be in the position that it will no longer be able with a wave of the hand to conjure up another £10,000,000 to pay all the Imperial charges that have been shoved down our throats, and not only will we be no longer able to borrow the millions but we will not be able to pay the interest on what has been borrowed.  This is a question that must be approached in some sane manner, and it is assuredly not doing so in a sane manner to spend £1,800,000 on an Army which, in the words of the Minister for Agriculture, is absolutely useless, and which must depend absolutely for its munitions of war on a foreign power.</P>
    <P>I think that is a situation that must be remedied at once if the Army is to be of any use whatever.  If I saw half a million of that money devoted to starting a munition factory here, then I would say there was some sense in the proposal.  That factory would provide munitions of war when needed, so that we would not be, as we are, absolutely dependent on foreign powers for our arms and ammunition.  There have been many schemes and proposals put forward on which the money that goes to the Army could be spent with benefit to this country, instead of spending it in an absolutely unreproductive way.  I can realise the difficulty of the Minister for Defence and of the Executive Council, who are devoid of any idea of starting industries which would absorb the unemployed.  I suppose they have the same idea at the back of their minds about the Army as they have with regard to the Civic Guards.  They put restrictions on the publicans in order to provide jobs for the Civic Guards around the country in looking after the publicans.</P>
    <P>The same idea is at the back of their minds with regard to the Army, that the members of the Army cannot be turned loose as they can get no employment for them.  If the Executive Council applied £1,000,000 towards starting an industry that would absorb more than 8,000 men in the Army. If that sum were devoted to agriculture, if, for instance, it were given as a kind of bonus for tillage, it would mean there would be more than the <Col N="1184" /> 8,000 in the Army absorbed in tillage work.  There would be some reason in doing that rather than spending it on an absolutely useless proposition, to use the words of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Before I begin replying to the various speeches, I would just like to say, as I am dealing with the Army Estimates, that if I refer to the Party opposite as the Fianna Fáil Party I do not want it to be understood that I recognise their right to take that name.  A convention of Irish Volunteers was held, as far as I remember, in the Abbey Theatre in 1914, in the month of October.  A resolution was moved by The O'Rahilly and seconded, as far as I remember, by myself, &ldquo;That the words &lsquo;Fianna Fáil&rsquo; be recognised as the Irish equivalent to the words &lsquo;Irish Volunteers.&rsquo;&rdquo; That was agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>That though for convenience I am referring to the Party opposite as the Fianna Fáil Party, the title Fianna Fáil in this country must be recognised as applying only to the body which is the successor of the Irish Volunteers, and that is the National Army.  I produce an Estimate representing a reduction of £387,734 from last year.  I said that the figure estimated by the Minister for Finance as a fair sum for normal Army expenditure of 1½ million pounds per annum was certainly realisable. Naturally I awaited the policy of the official Opposition with interest. They have attempted to set forth their policy at great length.  Economy of diction is certainly lacking on that side.  Deputy MacEntee, who was the first speaker and who, I presume, was more or less authoritative, borrowed the voice of cataracts so that one thought that something really important would be forthcoming.  He produced mostly gelatinous phrases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His Party claims all credit for the reduction that is made.  &ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; says Deputy MacEntee, &ldquo;are not due to the Minister, nor to the <Col N="1185" /> Government, but to the Republican Party upon these benches.&rdquo;  And again, &ldquo;It certainly is a very practicable tribute to the effectiveness of the criticism that the Minister has encountered from these benches that inside something like nine months the Government should so far have reconsidered their position as to come to the conclusion ... to permit three-quarters of a million to remain in the pockets of citizens.&rdquo; He says that &ldquo;the Army is going to be reorganised on the basis as suggested from these benches,&rdquo; and Deputy Little says, &ldquo;He has made certain reductions which I am perfectly sure are due to the strong influence which has been brought to bear on him from this side of the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is, of course, quite impossible to understand what Deputy MacEntee means by nine months.  More than two years ago, the Minister for Finance analysed the annual expenditure, dividing it into normal and abnormal. His purpose was to indicate how far actual expenditure should be met out of current taxation.  Had he underestimated current expenditure he would, of course, have put this country in the position of meeting recurrent costs out of capital.  It was necessary, therefore, that he should be conservative in his estimate of what might be regarded as abnormal.  After very careful consideration and adverting to the defence force needs of this country, and to the most effective and efficient form for that force, he decided, and I and other Ministers concurred with him, that one and a half million pounds might safely be regarded as a figure sufficient to cover normal defence expenses in normal years when normality was reached.  How Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Little can suggest that the Minister in prophetic vision could anticipate the long-winded speeches that were to be inflicted upon this Dáil after the lapse of two years is more than I can conceive.  We decided on a form for the Army and on a cost to meet the Army in that form. During the last twelve months we have been moving rapidly towards that estimated cost and that anticipated form.  The Opposition may pat itself <Col N="1186" /> on the back, but I hardly think anybody else will pat its back for it.</P>
    <P>The Opposition policy is a big army. Deputy Kerlin says: &ldquo;We want an adequate and efficient army to protect us against outside aggression and in particular against the Power which has interfered with our rights and liberties in the past and will have no hesitation whatsoever in interfering with those rights and liberties in the future if her own interests suggest it.&rdquo; Deputy Carney says: &ldquo;We cannot afford to talk of total abolition of war so far as this country is concerned until such time as we are free.  There must come a time when it will be absolutely essential.  If our demands are not met in an honest and open way they must be backed by force.&rdquo;  Deputy O'Reilly wants no army.  Deputy Kerlin thinks that the ideal army of his dreams should cost about one and a quarter millions.  Deputy MacEntee thinks it should cost less than three-quarters of a million.  Deputy Carney thinks that as we are not free we must fight England by guerilla tactics. Deputy Kerlin apparently anticipates that Great Britain will attack us without any hesitation whatever when her own interests suggest it.  Deputy Fahy wants guaranteed neutrality.  He says: &ldquo;If we were in power we should have a policy of neutrality guaranteed for this country.&rdquo;  Deputy Little goes further and tells us that &ldquo;the countries that would guarantee our neutrality would of necessity be America, England, Germany and France&rdquo;; so that while Deputy Kerlin prepares to make war on England with guerilla tactics, Deputy Little would presumably take his seat in the British House of Commons and be urging that country to guarantee our neutrality, and even when he had succeeded in doing that, nothing would persuade Deputy Kerlin that the &ldquo;British would not attack us as soon as their interests suggest it.&rdquo;  I must confess that this policy leaves me a bit bewildered.</P>
    <P>To come to what I might call practical suggestions.  Fianna Fáil propose, in the interests of economy, to have conscription.  It is true that their conscription seems to be an incompatible <Col N="1187" /> medley of compulsion and volunteering. Deputy MacEntee says: &ldquo;Does the Minister accept the principle that all able-bodied men shall be compelled to give&mdash;or, preferably, give voluntarily&mdash;military service in time of danger?&rdquo; He informs us that his Party have accepted, and are prepared to give effect to, that principle.  The principle is that the citizens of this State would render military aid to the State without fee and without reward. Deputy Kerlin seems to go not quite so far.  He suggests the South African system where, if unable to get voluntarily the number of troops they require, they have a ballot by districts for the remainder.  This conscript army is to be very big&mdash;as big as the man-power of the country.  Deputy MacEntee urges us to be guided by Switzerland in making our conscript army.  And Switzerland is actually particularly indicated as being a country with guaranteed neutrality. The Deputy conveniently forgets his figure of three-quarters of a million and quotes the almost 3½ millions that the Swiss Army costs the Exchequer directly.  He does not mention that to that 3½ millions must be added the loss to the unfortunate conscripts giving their services without fee and without reward.  I presume that that form of taxation in service instead of in money would represent at least another 3½ millions, or 7 millions in all.  He apparently intends to be as economical with the people's money as he is with his words.  Incidentally, I may point out that his costing per man of the Army for this year is only a little more exact than his nine months.  On the figures given by me in my opening statement, I think he will find that £135 per man is more correct than £146, and naturally, as the reserve grows, the cost per man of the whole Army will grow less, though, as I do not anticipate that the present Government will make conscription a part of its policy, and as I do not anticipate that in our lifetime we shall have an army of 260,000 men at 3d. per man per day, it may happen that we shall not get as low a cost per man as Switzerland any more than we shall put up the cost of <Col N="1188" /> the Army in this country to a par with that of Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little said that &ldquo;guaranteed neutrality would make a reduction in the expense of our Army a possibility.&rdquo;  It may seem strange to less enlightened Deputies that Switzerland, with its guaranteed neutrality, pays very much more for its army than does this country.  I am, perhaps, more cynical, more worldly-minded than Deputy Little.  I certainly would not agree to take over his job of rousing the people of four foreign countries to enthusiasm for guaranteeing our neutrality on the argument that it would make it possible for us to reduce our Army expenses, because, of course, if we are going to cut down our Army and leave it to these others to see to the protection of our neutrality, it is to be presumed that we shall also insist that they maintain sufficient armaments to give us that feeling of easy reliance in knowing that not only do they guarantee our neutrality but that they have the men and the guns to protect that neutrality against all and sundry.  Unfortunately, so far, that generosity which Deputy Little so naively pre-supposes has not been shown to my knowledge by any country.  I cannot help feeling &mdash;human nature being what it is&mdash;that any country pledging herself to protect our neutrality by force of arms would expect us to give some earnest of our own intention to assist in the maintenance of that neutrality.  I can conceive that if, for instance, England guaranteed our neutrality, she would want to know from time to time what size army and armament we had available to do our share in protecting our neutrality, particularly at times when it might seem likely that another country was going to violate that neutrality.  Our neutrality may be of interest to other countries, but we cannot complacently assure them that it is of no interest to us.</P>
    <P>Deputies MacEntee, Kerlin, Briscoe and Lemass are much concerned about the manufacture of arms and munitions in this country.  It may be that this country may at some time have large industries manufacturing machine guns, war-planes and other <Col N="1189" /> things implied in the cliché &ldquo;panoply of war.&rdquo;  I suppose that depends on whether they can be economically manufactured here, and whether we have a good and steady market for those products, but if, as those Deputies apparently imply, nothing can be done unless this country produces all that may be necessary for her warlike equipment, even when cut off completely from the rest of the world, I am afraid that the prospect is hopeless.</P>

      <P>We have had a lot during the last few days.  War equipment requires many other things. Besides steel, I doubt if all the constituent elements of cordite are found in this country.  Even if we had arms factories all over the country, I am afraid that in the event of a complete blockade those factories would run short of raw material.  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Deputy MacEntee, &ldquo;take any army you can think of, multiply it by ten, and it is absolutely useless unless this country can produce all its own warlike needs irrespective of blockades.&rdquo; And yet Deputy Kerlin would spend one and three-quarter millions, and Deputy MacEntee says three-quarters of a million of the taxpayers' money in maintaining an army in this hopeless country whose natural resources did not include all that armament demands. What a pity Deputy MacEntee has never convinced, say, Italy, of the futility of that country in attempting to maintain an army when it has no iron mines, and what a happy idea it would be for Deputy Kerlin to explain to the French people how absurd they are in having military aeroplanes when they have no petrol wells in their country.</P>

Apart from the absence of raw material for war stores or of factories in this country, Opposition members ask: Can the Army make a resistance to any Great Power or combination of Great Powers?

      <P>Some joined the Fianna Fáil Party.  In the case of attack from outside, I do not think that the line of reasoning is to consider what is the possible complete strength that could be mobilised by a conceivable enemy or enemies, and to say that unless we can guarantee a greater strength than they could put against us it is quite hopeless.  I think a sounder line, particularly for those who like guaranteed neutrality, would be to say. <Col N="1191" /> what strategic or other advantage would such Power or Powers expect to gain, and what resistance here would make it advisable for such Powers to forego that advantage?  I think that it is possible for us to maintain an army that will be sufficient to make any belligerently-disposed Power rule out the soil of this State as a scene for their warlike activities.  I have proposed a standing army as cadre of something in the neighbourhood of 5,000 men.  Of course the Opposition say 3,000.  The Minister for Finance said nearly two years before the Opposition entered the House that the Army should be maintained at a cost not greater than 1½ millions.  Of course, the Opposition say a lesser sum &mdash;in fact, several lesser sums.  The difference between us is not a matter of figures, but the fact that we are dealing with realities while they talk in the air.  Another difference is that we cost on the basis that the labourer is worthy of his hire.  They propose conscription&mdash;the conscripts serving without fee and without reward.  We do not propose conscription without fee and without reward.</P>

I remember a member of the Dáil, early in 1922, explaining his habit of raiding post offices by stating that as the Minister for Defence was not forwarding money to pay men who were trying to subvert the State, he seized money in the post offices rather than have his men without smokes and without drinks.  I understand from the Press that that gentleman is now likely to be a Fianna Fáil candidate for the Seanad.  I think that the Government method of paying men from taxation is more economical.</P>

      <P>No.  It will be voluntary.  I do not know what the response to it will be, and, of course, its success depends on that response.  I propose organising the Army on lines that will make it capable of rapid expansion, because I believe that when the State needs it all the voluntary assistance that is required will be forthcoming.  Our defence policy visualises only defence.  There are no agreements concealed behind the last Imperial Conference.  We are not committed to nor have we plans for military action overseas.  The Army exists for the defence of this State on the soil of this State against all possible enemies of this State whether internal or external.  For that purpose, the Army is the servant of the people, and is to act under the orders of whatever Government the people choose to put in power.  The Army costs the people of this State less, both actually and relatively, than the vast majority of armies in the world.</P>

      <Col N="1193" /> I will now try to deal with the general policy of the Opposition and also try to give a fairly clear statement of the Government policy.  I may have to supplement that, later, for the information of Deputy Lemass.  I am, however, in a slight difficulty.  On Thursday or Friday, a Deputy on the other side, named Carney, dealt with points raised in the Appropriation Accounts. I feel that I am not justified in dealing with the matter here, as ordinary good manners, if nothing else, ought to indicate that it should be left to the Committee.  The Deputy misrepresented two things.  He talked about horses being bought for jumping that were crocks.  One of these horses won a fairly substantial prize recently for jumping at Biarritz.  The Deputy read from the Appropriation Accounts to the effect that an Army officer drew pay after he left the Army without pay and that he resigned the next year. Either by accident or design, the Deputy spoke afterwards of that officer drawing pay after he left the Army, but he slurred over the fact that while the officer was in the Army the pay which he had overdrawn was repaid to the State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony suggested a system of deferred payment.  Under the existing law I have no power to withhold pay from soldiers except in cases arising out of offences against discipline. If the soldier desires I can hold back a certain amount of his pay, but we can only do it when he desires it. We have no power of enforcing that. Since the last estimate was introduced, early this year I think it was, we did make an arrangement whereby soldiers who have two and a half years or more of continuous service get twenty-one days' leave at the end of their service. That is to say, they really leave the Army with three weeks' pay in their pockets.  Those who have served one and a half years continuous service get fourteen days' leave.  In other words, they leave the Army with two weeks' pay in their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked me a whole lot of questions about the speech of the Minister for Agriculture.  I take my mind back to many years ago, when I lived in very close proximity to certain graphic artists who became famous afterwards.  They had often to tell people who came and talked with them that in order to produce character you have to have a certain amount of caricature.  We know that the Army, as I have said, exists for the defence of this country and all that it implies, whether against external or internal foes.  If we saw external aggression threatened I would naturally <Col N="1195" /> stress, or caricature, if you like, the function of the Army against external aggression.  Now, the Minister for Agriculture, like myself, suffered listening to a lot of speeches, very relevant most of them, and he wished to bring out to the Deputies opposite one side of their function, if you like, like the painters' caricature.  He stressed that to the exclusion of character Deputy Lemass, who, I believe, is the sole Deputy on the other side with a glimmering of a sense of humour, would have understood the thing perfectly well if he were here, granted he is honest.  Of course we know that when we get up and wish to bring out one side of a thing it puts the other people in the position of saying: &ldquo;You said so and so,&rdquo; whereas it often depends on the tone of voice or the look in the eye.  The Minister for Agriculture wished to bring out to the Deputies opposite, and through them to other people, that the Army was in no way to stand any nonsense anywhere.  He stated that side convincingly, and he left the other side to imply things that were not there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>

Poor Deputy Maguire talked of how wrong we were in maintaining an army and how hypocritical it was to imply, in going over to the Peace Conference in Geneva, that we believed in the abolition of all war.  One of the League of Nations' methods is the application of sanctions, and, strictly speaking, as far as the League of Nations is concerned at present, it does imply the maintenance of a certain kind of armed forces by a certain number of countries.  There is nothing hypocritical in that.  I would like to explain some time how harmful people are to the League of Nations who talk about it as if it were something which it is not.</P>

      <P>People object to our buying horses for jumping.  Quite frankly I do advert in this matter of jumping to the matter of national advertising, and to the fact that we produce horses in this country, and that the selling of those horses is a matter of business.  It may be considered rather beneath the dignity of an army to consider such commercial matters, but I am only a civilian in the Army, and I do advert to those things.  Deputy Anthony and Deputy Tubridy referred to my recent uniform order.  Deputy Anthony said that it excluded the poor man's son.  I cannot see how that arises.  The officers, just as the men, are under military law, and I consider that it is good for discipline in the Army, that the men should realise that all the time.  I know it is only human nature that if you wear a uniform, which implies that you are under a rigid discipline, as you take it off, you have the feeling that you shake off discipline at the same time.  Officers get a grant of £50 the first year, and £20 every subsequent year to assist towards paying the difference between the cost of ordinary civilian clothes and the cost of a uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that if an officer wears a uniform for the time that he would wear his ordinary clothes, the cost to him for this uniform will not exceed the cost that he would have incurred in buying civilian clothes, by more than £20 in the year.  I consider that the order was very good and very beneficial in the interests of discipline in the Army, and in the interests of the Army in every possible way.  It does not exclude the poor man's son.  It does not seek to set up an officer class. It does not imply that officers must incur expense that they otherwise would not.  The only rule, as I might say, governing whether an officer travels first class or third class, or where he goes to in a theatre, or the only indication he receives from the Minister is in the matter of the pay he gets.  He is only expected to live at the ordinary standard indicated from the pay he gets.  Nobody asks an officer to <Col N="1198" /> maintain a standard beyond the standard implied by his salary.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahy spoke about the proportion of officers to men.  As I said the other day, we are reducing the size of the Army. From 50,000 we are moving on to a standing Army of 5,000, and we are comparatively near that number.  In reducing an army like that there must be a certain amount of symmetry between the various branches.  It is impossible to reduce an army in a given time to one-fifth its size and make the reduction in the various branches identical.  As an army gets smaller it follows that the proportion of officers to men will be greater than is the case in countries where the major part of the army is a standing army.  As to Deputy Dr. O'Dowd's statement, I would not like to hurt Deputy Davin's feelings, but I might say that the epithet used in the reply given in the Seanad to a speech of his here might also apply to Deputy O'Dowd.  It is easy to get up and fling figures around. Deputy Dr. O'Dowd said that whereas a dispensary doctor deals with 5,000 people, a doctor in the Army&mdash;his figures were, of course, wrong&mdash;only deals with 194 men.  There is no parity between the work of a dispensary doctor and that of an army doctor.  To begin with, Deputy Dr. O'Dowd took the number in the Army, divided it by the number of the medical staff, and said that that was the number of people a doctor in the Army had to deal with.  Although I believe that the Deputy has some experience of an army not of this State, he, did not advert to the fact that besides soldiers there are soldiers' wives and families. I do not know a great deal about dispensary doctors, but I believe that when a case is fairly bad it is sent to hospital.  We have cases coming to hospitals from all parts of the country. In the Army, hospitals are included in our costs.  As a matter of fact, the cost of our hospitals compares favourably with most hospitals of which we have accounts.  We pay all our medical <Col N="1199" /> members whereas the hospitals, with which the Deputy drew comparison, do not pay their senior members. Hospitals usually charge a certain amount to their patients and they also have charitable bequests and money from other parts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was wrong in the number of medical officers.  I do not want to go into the details of his argument, but since the last Estimate was produced we have reduced the medical staff by 15 medical men and 12 nurses.  I cannot undertake to reduce staffs more quickly than that relatively.  There were comparisons also between the cost per man in our Army and that in the British Army, but, just in the same way as Deputies opposite do not seem to be able to read our own Estimates and will quote Estimates of previous years, so they do not seem to be able to work out their figures.  The average cost per man in our Army, according to the Deputy who referred to it, was, I think, £146 per man.  Of course, it is not.  It is about £133.</P>

      <P>If you take the cost of the British Army, including Territorials and Reserves, but excluding those serving in India, the average cost per man in the British Army is £214.39, while, including Territorials and Reserves and including those serving in India, it is £181.7; so that the Deputy's argument, as he tried to base it, is rather creditable to us.  The cost of our regular Army along with the Reserves is £133 per man.  Deputy <Col N="1200" /> MacEntee spoke about the economy which there was in Switzerland, where they ran a conscript, non-full-time army at £22 per man.  The average cost of the Reserve with us is £10.2.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Lemass said that we have no independent source of supplies, and Deputy Briscoe said that we were bound to buy all our munitions and all our warlike equipment from Woolwich Arsenal. That is like his 20,000 rifles.  Deputy Lemass, who, I believe, is more serious and more important, says that we have no independent source of supplies. That is capable of two explanations. He may have meant that we have not within this country sources of supplies making us independent of the whole outside world, or, on the other hand, he may have grown up in the school of Deputy Briscoe and he may believe that we have no independent source of supplies because we are bound to buy from Woolwich Arsenal or from England. If it is the first that he means I am sorry.  I did not make this country; God made it.  If this country does not produce all that is required I cannot be blamed for that.</P>

I am trying to answer Deputy Lemass and Deputy Briscoe&mdash;not that Deputy Briscoe matters a great deal&mdash;but I am trying to answer them both if they mean the same thing.  We have an independent source of supply inasmuch as we can draw on those parts of the world that, either in raw materials or in finished products, are in a position to sell us things that are required.</P>

I think it is possible to create an army in this country capable of resisting any invasion that is humanly likely to happen, but, as I said before, we cannot undertake in this country, any more than any other other country can, to be able to assert that we are able to resist all and sundry who may come against us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. Years ago I had to explain in a previous Dáil that Spain was not invaded because the British had Gibraltar, and that, as a matter of fact, a country can make an arrangement by treaty with any other country.  An invasion is coming by force of arms to <Col N="1203" /> seize without any treaty arrangement at all.  That is what I mean and understand by invasion.  I think Deputy Lemass will agree that between the policy of the Army now, and the policy on the 6th May, 1926, that he quoted, there is not a great deal of difference. I gathered from most of the Deputies opposite who spoke that when it was stated that the Army was capable of expansion, they understood by that an idea of conscription or universal military service.  That is not implied in the statement.  Deputy MacEntee complained of the small progress made with reserves.  As a matter of fact, I suppose in one year the reserves moved from practically none to about 5,000. I think that is moving fairly quickly.  If we had 5,000 every year we would almost move up to Deputy MacEntee's or Deputy Kerlin's figures.  The idea of the expansion of the Army was that you could have an Army of only 5,000 <Col N="1204" /> capable of absorbing and training men quickly in their various units.  It can do that.  But it does not follow when you say that the Army must be capable of expansion to the greatest possible limits that you should apply universal military service.  I was asked to accept the principle that the Government should expect the people, in case of emergency, to give military support. Of course, it does.  That is ordinary ethics.  Deputy Lemass complained of people going around and telling young men that in the event of the country being threatened with subversion inside or outside they had a duty, to give whatever service they may be called on to give.  That is ordinary ethics.  I presume they learned that, more or less, in the Catechism.  I have spoken at considerable length, but in dealing with heads one takes longer than one might usually be justified in doing.</P>

      <P>To some extent the matter dealt with in this Vote overlaps the matter dealt with in Vote 11&mdash;Public Works and Buildings.  I expect that any discussions that are likely to take place will take place upon the latter Vote.  The only matter that I intend to refer to here is the fact that there is a reduction in this Vote.  The net total shows a decrease of £5,521 on last year.  The total decrease, omitting Appropriations-in-Aid, is £6,021.  The greater part of the decrease is in respect of Sub-heads A and E (1), which is less by £4,200 and £771 respectively. This decrease is largely accounted for, first of all, by the engineering branch. There has been a considerable reduction in the number of temporary engineers required in connection with the Barrow drainage.  The preliminary <Col N="1207" /> work for the Barrow required a greater number of engineers than is now required for the work we are doing there. The next reduction is in connection with the architectural branch.  There is a reduction in staff of one quantity surveyor and one temporary assistant to the furniture clerk.  As a matter of fact, there are four reductions of temporary assistants to the furniture clerk at the present time, but we expect to fill two of the vacancies shortly.  There is also a reduction in the staff of temporary inspectors in connection with land improvement, and the automatic decrease in bonus accounts for approximately £2,500 of a decrease.  The difference between the other casual increases or decreases goes to make up the balance of the total decrease on last year's Vote.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that it is impossible to criticise this Vote without considering at the same time the services rendered in respect of the salaries and wages paid in the Office of Public Works.  That is to say, we cannot dissociate the discussion on Vote No. 10 from a discussion on Vote No. 11.  In that connection I think that in order adequately to discuss No. 10 we should compare it with the Votes in the preceding years, and particularly with the actual expenditure upon works for which the services of the engineering and architectural staffs in the Office of Public Works were retained.  The last year for which I have been able to secure complete returns for the works done was the year 1926-27.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the principal item in this Vote that attention is being concentrated on is J2&mdash;Arterial Drainage.  In order to enable Deputies to discuss the matter I will make a statement on the work of the Arterial Drainage Act to date. There has been a certain amount of criticism about the delay in putting this Act into operation.  In that connection I would like to point out that this is not by any means the first attempt by Government to deal with the drainage of this country.  We have had various legislative measures to deal with that matter beginning with the year 1840.  We had active drainage operations carried out for a period over something like eighty-five years, so it is only reasonable to suppose that during that period most of the important schemes were dealt with, and any measure brought in by this Government or any succeeding Government may be looked upon largely as a gleaning measure.  We are dealing <Col N="1210" /> with schemes that, in one way or another, happened to be overlooked, or schemes that happened to be uneconomic in former years, but owing to a new development in machinery and better methods of carrying out those operations they happen to be economic now.</P>
      <P>The present Arterial Drainage Act depends for its success or failure, in the ultimate, upon the people who have land to be drained, the Government helping in the matter, and under the Act it is intended that county councils should help.  In some cases the county councils have been very helpful, and in others they have not; but even where the county councils have been willing to give one hundred per cent. help we often find that the people whose land it is intended to benefit by drainage operations are not in favour of the schemes and accordingly we are powerless to put the Act into operation. One of the things that militates against putting this Act into force throughout the country is the fact that labour has increased very much in cost. The work carried out by manual labour costs very much more now than in former years.  Most of the drainage operations were carried out in the period between 1840 and 1880.  In the period between 1840 and 1860 it is estimated that the work carried out by manual labour was approximately one-fifth the cost that the same work could be carried out at to-day, and in the period between 1860 and 1880 it could be carried out at one-third the cost at which it can be carried out at the present time.  That is an important factor. Another important point is that money could be borrowed at a much cheaper rate for those early schemes than now. The money was borrowed under a previous Act at 3½ per cent.  We are paying 5½ per cent. under the present Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding those difficulties considerable progress has been made with the 1925 Act.  A great many preliminary operations have to be carried out before the schemes can become effective.  We have to ascertain when the proposal is made to see what works are required, what they will cost, what benefit to the land these works will produce, how that benefit and the proportionate <Col N="1211" /> payment will be divided among the farmers concerned, whether the Government or the county council are ready to pay part of the cost if it appears to be greater than the benefit to the farmers and, finally, whether the farmers concerned understand what they are prepared to do, what the scheme is expected to cost, and whether the majority of them are in favour of going on and are willing to bear their share of the charge.  Naturally all these inquiries, calculations and plannings take a considerable time.  After that, we have to deal with the owners of eel weirs and people with other interests, and this naturally delays operations still further.</P>
    <P>At this date the position with regard to this Act is that we have received 576 petitions.  That is up to the 30th of last month.  Of these 49 were not recommended by the county councils, thus leaving only 527 for our examination. The stream of petitions has been slackening for some time past, and very likely the total may in the end not much exceed 600.  Of the 527 petitions sent us for examination, 385, or 73 per cent., have formed the subject of preliminary inspection by our engineers.  This is the first step in the examination.  The 385 petitions were amalgamated on examination into 313 schemes.  Of these 313 schemes, 111, or over one-third, are reported by the engineers as probably not exceeding £1,000 apiece in costs. They will, therefore, presumably drop out of the ken of this Act and be dealt with, if at all, under the Arterial Drainage (Minor Schemes) Act.  Out of the 313 schemes 52 schemes, or one-sixth, have been rejected by us as uneconomic or for other reasons.  That works out, we may take it, at 313 schemes (less 111, plus 52) equal to 163.  Taking that 163 from 313 leaves 150.  These 150 schemes represent the outcome from 385 petitions examined by the engineers, and are presumably to be brought before the Department of Finance if found suitable.  Of these 150 schemes 70 have, so far, been submitted, either to the Department of Finance or the county councils, and 80 have not yet been submitted.  The reasons why one scheme gets ahead of <Col N="1212" /> another are many, but one of them is a deliberate selection on our part of the more promising and the largest schemes to put forward.  I should think it probable then that the 70 schemes which had been submitted to the Department of Finance or the county councils represent more than one half of the total number&mdash;that is, more than half of 150 which will be so submitted. But if we put it at one half it will be within the mark to say that of the mass of the 527 petitions sent us to examine between the passing of the Act and the 30th of September last, we have taken up the examination of practically three-fourths, and that of the schemes examined and not rejected we have brought one-half to the point where an estimate of the cost and value can be presented to the Department of Finance or to the county councils.</P>
    <P>When we consider the amount of work that has to be done in every place between the presentation of petitions, which is a mere indication that works are desired, and the submission of a worked-out scheme and estimate, I think this is a record of achievement on which we may congratulate ourselves, and for which much credit is due to our staff of engineers responsible. Especially when we remember that while these engineers were doing their part of this work they were also carrying out restoration works in 61 drainage districts under the Act of 1924.  I think we may consider the initial stage in the administration of the Act as completed.  It is still necessary, of course, to carry on the examination of petitions and the preparation of preliminary estimates of cost and value, so as to submit new schemes to the Department of Finance. But that will, I think, be henceforth the less important part of our work. The more important for some time to come will be getting estimates before the occupiers of land and the actual execution of work in these schemes to which they assent.  Up to the 30th of last month 20 schemes have been put before the occupiers of land.  The works had actually begun in four cases. There were ten other cases in which the occupiers had assented, five cases in which they had refused assent, and one <Col N="1213" /> case in which the result had not then been known.  If, accordingly, we look at the works before us and divide it into sections according to the several stages which the schemes have reached, we find them as follows:&mdash;There are four cases in which work had begun. These are Akeragh Lough, Co. Kerry; Awbeg, Co. Cork; Carrowreagh, Co. Roscommon, and Clonlish, Co. Offaly. There are ten cases in which the occupiers have assented, but we have to examine the objections and revise the schemes and submit them for confirmation to the Ministry of Finance, if suitable, before works can begin.  These are Ballivor, Co. Meath; Bawn, Co. Monaghan; Cush, Cos. Laoghis and Offaly; Greese, Co. Kildare; Hurley River, Co. Meath; Lough Gill, Co. Kerry; Newmarket, Co. Clare; Rampart River, Co. Louth; Teermaclane, Co. Clare, and Tully, Co. Monaghan.</P>
    <P>It is to be expected that several of these will be confirmed and ready for beginning work next spring.  There is also the case in which the result of the voting is not known&mdash;Banna, Co. Kerry.  Then there are four schemes needing a grant not exceeding one-third costs which have been approved by the Minister for Finance but not yet submitted to the occupiers.  These are Ballymore, Co. Westmeath; Riverstown, Co. Westmeath; Rochford Bridge, Co. Westmeath, and Blackwater, Co. Louth.  There are ten schemes for which the county councils have offered the necessary free grants, but which have not yet been brought before the occupiers of land.  These are Lonnogs and Donnbane. Co. Cavan; Doonbeg, Co. Clare; River Graney (Scariff), Co. Clare; Sixmilebridge, Co. Clare; River Robe, Co. Mayo (not fully petitioned for yet); Derrycreevy, Co. Monaghan; Seloo, Co. Monaghan; Tyholland, Co. Monaghan; Blackwater, Co. Monaghan; Castlebernard, Co. Offaly.</P>
    <P>In these 14 cases the preparation of schemes to bring before the occupiers of land is proceeding, or will proceed as staff is available.  There are 80 cases in which schemes have not yet been submitted to the Department of Finance or the county councils.  These have to be examined, and those which <Col N="1214" /> prove suitable submitted.  There are 142 petitions for schemes which the engineers have not yet inspected. There is an unknown, but probably not a large, number of further petitions to come in.</P>
    <P>That is the position under the Act to-day.  It is only natural that the preliminary work should take a very considerable time.  There is no doubt but that from this forward schemes will be brought to a point at which they can be voted upon at a much more rapid pace than in the first year or two years during which the Act was in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>In opening the discussion on Votes No. 10 and 11 it would, I think, be well to remind the House of the amount involved in each case.  The amount under Vote No. 10 is £117,944, and under Vote No. 11, £813,150, making together £931,094.  I think, in the circumstances in which the Exchequer finds itself at the present moment, this House would be entitled seriously to consider whether it is getting value for the money which it is now proposed to expend.  The cost of the Office of Public Works, which comes under Vote No. 10, is, as I have already said, estimated next year to be £117,944.  We can only satisfy ourselves as to whether we are justified in expending that money by examining the record of that office in its relation to works carried through and completed in previous years.  We cannot consider Vote No. 10 in its immediate relation to Vote No. 11 for the year 1928-29, because Vote No. 11 deals only with the estimated cost of certain projected undertakings which may not reach that figure, but which may, on the other hand, possibly exceed it.  But we are entitled to go back to the latest returns submitted to this House in regard to the actual cost of works carried out in connection with the Votes for the previous years.  If we do, and if we examine the cost of the Office of Public Works in relation to the cost of undertakings projected and carried out by them, we will reach, and are bound to reach, the conclusion that the Office is much too costly for the work that it undertakes and completes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the office may be divided <Col N="1215" /> into three divisions: architectural, maintenance and engineering.  I have considered the salaries and the expenses of the architectural branch in detail, and I find that the total cost of the architectural work carried out by the Office of Public Works in the year 1926-27 amounted to something like £68,272.  Of course, that is not apparent from a first reading of the Estimates, because we find that under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries and Wages&mdash;the total cost of the architectural salaries, as distinct from the cost of running the architectural office, is £20,870.  It would be a mistake, therefore, to suppose that that is the actual net cost to the State of the architectural services rendered to it by the Office of Public Works.  First of all, we have to add to that figure the bonus.  Taking it at 30 per cent. of the total bonus figure of £25,291, it amounts to £6,245, so that the total for professional salaries alone works out at something like £27,061.  As well as that, there is the expenditure under other sub-heads properly chargeable against the architectural branch.  We have portion of the cost of the secretary's branch, and we have portion of the cost of the accountant's branch and other incidental expenses, as well as the cost of telegrams and telephones.  The total cost of all these services is something like £65,462.  It is true that that expenditure has to be divided over the three principal divisions of the office. Some portion of it has to be allocated to the cost of the architectural branch, some to the maintenance branch, and some portion of the cost to the engineering branch.  But considering it in relation to the value of the works undertaken by each of those branches, we may say that, properly speaking, something like 60 per cent. of the total amount should be allocated to the architectural branch.  And, proceeding upon that basis, we find that we have to add to the £27,000 odd for architectural salaries, expenditure under other sub-heads amounting to £41,211, making the total cost of the services rendered by the architectural branch of the Office of Public Works to the State something like £68,272.</P>
    <P>We have to compare that with the total cost of the work carried out by <Col N="1216" /> the Office of Public Works and the work carried out under the supervision of the Office of Public Works.  When we do that we find that the total amount expended on new works, alterations and additions, according to the Appropriation Accounts for the year 1926-27, was £494,613.  Upon that you had to pay architectural costs amounting to £68,272.  Every person knows that if you go to any architect's office in town that he will be quite content, and very well pleased indeed, to give you the very best of his service for something like 5 per cent. upon the completed cost of the works.  For that 5 per cent. he has to carry on his office, he has to look after the accounts, he has to provide a drawing office staff, and has to pay for fuel, light, rent, rates and taxes, as well as all the other incidental expenses which are borne by the Office of Public Works.  He does that, remember, for 5 per cent. upon the value of the completed works.  The figures which I have just quoted in regard to the Office of Public Works show that it costs the State something like 13.8 per cent. upon the value of the completed works in order to secure those architectural services which a private citizen, fully qualified in this State, would be very glad indeed to give for a fee of 5 per cent. upon the value of the completed works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that, considering all the circumstances, there is no reason whatsoever why the architectural services in the Office of Public Works should cost almost three times what it would cost if a private individual were carrying out that work for another private individual in the State.  First of all, there is a good deal less time lost in discussions and negotiations in regard to details.  Everything is there and is at hand.  In most cases, when projects are decided upon there is very little difficulty about securing sites.  In many cases the sites, owing to events of recent history, have been already provided.  There is also very little trouble or difficulty in negotiating with local authorities.  The whole staff, or at least practically all <Col N="1217" /> the architectural staff, is centralised here in Dublin, and discussions about points of detail can be carried through without any loss of time.  That is not so in the case of any architect in private practice.  The greater part of his time is devoted to interviews with his clients, discussing with them points of taste and of style with which, in a considerable number of cases, they are unfamiliar and about which they require often a great deal of persuasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters like that do not arise in the Office of Public Works, and, therefore, because there is not that loss of time which is incidental to carrying on a private practice, I suggest that, so far from costing more than this work would do if carried out by a private individual, architectural services given by the Office of Public Works should cost the State something less, but, as I have endeavoured to show, the actual total cost of the architectural branch of the Office of Public Works so far from being rather less than would be the case if a private individual were doing the work is almost three times as much.  You have on the one hand five per cent. on the total value of the contract if carried out by an architect in private practice, and 13.8 per cent. on the completed value of works when carried out by the Office of Public Works.  What is the explanation of that?  There must be some explanation for it.  We are told often by members of the Government that the public services are in many cases under-staffed and over-worked.  We have heard pathetic stories about that, and I do not want to be cynical in the matter, but when one has the figures in these Estimates before him if he is not a cynic in regard to the stories he must be something of a fool.  If he does not disbelieve them, then I am afraid that he is altogether too simple for this cruel and wicked world.  But when we hear about officers in the public service being over-worked, and when we come in contact, as I have come in contact recently, with cases such as I am now about to refer to, then we must say that the political heads of the Departments who come here to this House and tell us that their permanent officials are over-worked <Col N="1218" /> must have forgotten the way to their offices.  Otherwise I feel that they would not come into this Dáil and make a statement of that sort.  The figures which I have given want a good deal of explanation, and I think we are entitled to have that.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary like to have my explanation of these figures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here in my hand a list of architectural commissions undertaken by architects employed at the Office of Public Works for private individuals.  I am not going to read the names of the officers or of the individuals concerned, but if the Parliamentary Secretary would care to have particulars of the abuses that I am going to relate I am perfectly prepared to give them.  I have here in this list the name of one architect and the names of six clients for whom he undertook eight or nine architectural commissions in one year.  The total value of these architectural commissions was £29,900.  The fees which he would have derived from these commissions, if he had carried them out in accordance with the usual professional scale, would have amounted to £1,495.  That particular individual in one year carried out contracts amounting to £29,900 for one individual.  If he charged for them, and I do not know whether he did or not, at the usual professional scale, he would have drawn in fees something amounting to almost £1,500.  Many an architect in the City of Dublin would be very happy to maintain a staff and to devote the whole of his time to earning £1,500.  The problem I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to solve is this: how did that gentleman earn £1,500 from private individuals and earn his salary from the State at the same time?  That is enough of work for one man for one year, and if that individual rendered that service honestly to the clients from whom he took those fees, how was he in the position to give service to the State which, as a permanent whole-time official, he was bound by his contract of service to give?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That case is the most glaring of those which I have in the list, but there <Col N="1219" /> are others.  There is another case of an architect who did work for a client, who built something like nineteen houses, at a cost of almost £10,000. There is another case of an architect in this Department who rendered architectural services to another person, and there is a fourth architect who has been doing the same sort of thing. Admittedly these things happened in 1926, but I know the practice has not ceased, although I believe representations were made by the professional Association here in Dublin to the head of the Department on the matter. Furthermore, it was quite patent to any person who knew the circumstances and who saw in the papers some little while ago a photograph of an official of the Board of Works standing side by side with the Minister for Local Government.  That official of the Board of Works was photographed beside the Minister for Local Government in his capacity as an architect for a housing scheme that was being carried out somewhere in Drumcondra. I am not sure whether he presented the Minister with a silver trowel or not, but apparently the State has presented that particular gentleman with a good many silver pieces for services he is not rendering to the State.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the explanation of the fact that the architectural services under the Office of Public Works cost the State 13.8 per cent., as compared with 5 per cent. for which the private individual would be glad to do the work, will be found in the facts as I have recited them from this schedule.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the practice that I know is common in the Office of Public Works of public officials doing work for private individuals, extends to the other departments of this Office. There is just the possibility that it does.  I am not in this case able to furnish definite proof that it does, but the figures which I have extracted from the Estimates would seem to indicate that it does.  The total amount expended on engineering works under Vote 11 in the year 1926-7 was £164,310.  Of that, £120,000 was represented by work carried out under the <Col N="1220" /> Drainage Act of 1924; £17,000 by work carried out under the Barrow Drainage, and £26,000 by work carried out on the Owenmore Drainage.  The total cost of the engineering services in the Office of Public Works for that particular year was something like £37,307. The services carried out by that engineering branch included not only the drainage works which I have recited but also the preliminary examination and the preparation of the preliminary report in the case of 116 applications under the Drainage Act of 1925.  I do not know how detailed the reports made under that Act are, but from my own personal knowledge I should say that most engineers would make a very satisfactory report upon a proposal of that kind for a fee of about £50.  If we take those 116 cases in which engineering reports have been made, and charge them at £50 per report, we have a sum of £5,800 to be deducted from the total cost of the engineering services in respect to these particular reports and services.  That will leave the total cost of the engineering services at £31,507 upon works which, to carry out, cost £164,310.  That is something like 19 per cent. on the value of the works.</P>
    <P>The same criticism applies to this branch of the office as applies to the architectural branch, that any engineer in practice would render the services that this branch renders in respect of these public works for a fee of 5 per cent. on the total value of the completed work.  You have that figure of 5 per cent. in this case to compare with the figure of 19 per cent., which is the actual cost of these engineering services to the State.  As I said, in this particular instance I am not able to adduce any evidence that the abuses that I know to exist in regard to the architectural branch of the office exist in regard to the engineering branch. But the figures, as I have set them before the Dáil would indicate that there is in the case of the engineering branch good grounds for an inquiry into the operations of that branch, and good grounds for an inquiry into the operations of the whole office, because if these things are done in one branch, <Col N="1221" /> they are bound to be done in another. As you see, the consequence of them is that in each case the State is paying an altogether exorbitant charge for services rendered to it.</P>
    <P>I feel, having set these facts before the Dáil, that the Dáil, which, we must remember, owes a duty to the people from whom this money is collected, that the Dáil, which, as I said on the Army Vote the other day, was asked to refuse even to contemplate providing a sum of £750,000 for pensions for widows and orphans, cannot allow the criticism that I have passed upon the office and cannot allow these instances of professional mal-practice&mdash;for that is what they amount to&mdash;to go unexamined, and because it cannot permit those things to be done, I submit that it cannot accept the proposal of the Minister for Finance and cannot grant the sums asked for in Votes 10 and 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is nominally, at any rate, the head of the Department for which in these two Votes a sum totalling £931,094 is being asked.  The point I want to bring to the notice of the Dáil is that we are entitled to an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary, if not from the Minister himself, that the amount asked for will, as far as the Department is concerned, be spent within the year for which the money is being asked.  The reason I put that point before Deputies is that, looking over the Appropriation Accounts for 1925-6 and 1926-7, you find that there has been very loose estimating on the part of this particular Department.  I feel perfectly satisfied from my experience on the Public Accounts Committee that no other Department is given the same latitude in regard to money as the Office of Public Works. In the year 1925-6 the Dáil voted £870,716 for this Department, and in that year a sum of £252,004 17s 9d. was returned to the Exchequer as unexpended. That shows, at any rate, that there was very loose estimating, or, on the other hand, that no real attempt was made to carry out the works for which the money was passed by the Dáil with the very best intentions. When we asked the Minister for Finance a few days ago, to bring in a <Col N="1222" /> scheme for the relief of unemployment, he told us that it would mean increased taxation and that he could not dream of doing it.</P>
      <P>To come back to that particular Estimate, I must presume, for the sake of argument, that what has happened in the past two years will happen this year unless we get a very definite assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary. A good deal of the money asked for by the Office of Public Works, particularly under Vote 11, is for the erection of buildings, particularly barracks, schools, etc.  In 1925-26 the sum of £420,965 was voted under the sub-head for new works, alterations, etc., and only £322,660 11s. 10d. was spent, leaving £98,904 8s. 2d. to be returned to the Exchequer, for items that could have given very valuable and useful employment to people out of work to-day.  Coming to the years 1926-27, we find practically the same state of affairs.  The sum of £1,013,906 for public works and buildings was voted by this House, and out of that sum the sum of £686,055 0s. 1d. was spent, leaving a total of £327,850 19s. 11d. to be returned to the Exchequer at the end of the financial year.  In reality that figure was larger than shown here under the head of sums surrendered at the end of the financial year, and why?  Because at the end of the Vote, sub-head M&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;we had an Estimate for £182,700, whereas the Vote realised £300,276 5s. 9d.  Turning back to any other Vote on Account, we cannot see that there is any other Department dealt with in the very lenient way that this Department has been.  It has shown bad estimation, to the disadvantage of the taxpayers of this country.</P>
      <P>I did not, at the time, contest this Vote, believing when I voted for the amount that a genuine attempt was going to be made to spend the money for which the House was asked.  Are we to have the same state of affairs in the present financial year?  I ask the Minister to answer that question definitely and clearly, and if he does not do so I am not prepared to vote for loose estimating, as on a previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1926-27, under sub-head B&mdash;New <Col N="1223" /> Works, Alterations and Additions&mdash; the sum of £673,790 was voted, and out of that the sum of £494,613 16s. 7d. was spent, leaving under this particular sub-head a sum of £179,176 3s. 5d. unexpended at the end of the financial year. We sometimes talk in millions, but this is a case of hundreds of thousands. Deputy M.J. Jordan is looking curiously at me, but I am sure the poor farmers of Wexford would feel annoyed if they knew that Deputy Jordan and others were prepared to pass amounts, for instance, for which there was no work to be done, or if the work was available that it was not to be done by the end of the financial year. I certainly protest against this loose estimating, and I am not prepared, without further explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary, to allow the sum of £931,094 to be voted in the present financial year.  I want to know definitely from the Parliamentary Secretary whether on item B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Buildings&mdash;it is intended to carry out the work or to start the work for which this £561,500 is now asked.  I think that is a fair and straightforward question, and if the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to give an assurance on that point, I do not think the House should agree to give him the sum of money he asks for.  I have harped on sub-head B in the Estimate for the past three years, because I realise if the money were spent it would have been expended on the erection of barracks, Four Courts, schools, houses, and so on, and by being spent in that way would give very valuable and useful employment to skilled and unskilled workmen.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of the Arterial Drainage schemes and the work carried out so far under the 1925 Act, I candidly confess the figures that the Parliamentary Secretary read out to the House forced one to the conclusion that so far as the figures were concerned there was no answer, and that he does not deserve, from the point of view of the figures at any rate, to be criticised so far as the administration of the Act is concerned.  Speaking of this Estimate and on the work of the Board of Works in general, I realise the present Parliamentary Secretary is not <Col N="1224" /> responsible for what happened in 1925-26 and in 1926-27, and his responsibility only starts from a recent date. But I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will, at any rate, shake up the people at the Board of Works responsible for not having spent the money voted to them in the previous financial years. When I talk of the failure or the so-called failure of Arterial Drainage, I do so with knowledge at my disposal so far as the administration of that Act is concerned in my own constituency. The constituency of Leix and Offaly consists of two counties.  Up to recently a Commissioner administered the affairs of Offaly county, whereas the affairs of Leix were administered by the elected body.  The Parliamentary Secretary read out figures showing that one scheme has been carried out in Offaly and two others are on the way to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that while the Commissioner was administering the affairs of the Offaly County Council he was encouraged by every means&mdash;and he deserves credit so far as he is concerned&mdash;to devote the money of the County Council, in other words, the ratepayers' money, towards getting on with the work.  One scheme has been carried out, and another, which partly affects both Leix and Offaly, is about to be started unless some slight objections which were lodged at a recent inquiry are going to hold it up.  In Leix, nine schemes were submitted by the County Council to the Board of Works, but in none of these has an attempt been made to start the work.  There is one case which I brought under the notice of the House several time, and I think Deputy Gorry mentioned it also, namely, the case of Erkina, in which a scheme was submitted by the County Council shortly after the passing of the Act in 1925, but up to the present I have been unable to get an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the work will be started.  It is one of the biggest schemes submitted by the County Council. As I say, not one of the schemes submitted from areas in which elected bodies are operating has been carried out, but where the Commissioner operated, the ratepayers' money, and <Col N="1225" /> rightly so, was devoted to carrying out the schemes.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will, perhaps, deny that encouragement was given to the Commissioner to carry out schemes, or may say that the same encouragement was given to the local authorities, but let him give proof of that if he can.  The Parliamentary Secretary also referred to the question of whether certain schemes were economical.  It is hard for an ordinary layman like myself to understand the departmental meaning of the word &ldquo;economical&rdquo; so far as it affects drainage schemes.  In my area there has been no case in which a local authority turned down any scheme submitted by the Board of Works.  The one carried out in Offaly has been carried out under the direction of the Commissioner while he was operating in that area up to the last county council elections some time about last June. The Parliamentary Secretary also put up the case that the failure to go forward in the way originally intended was due to the fact that they found out that the labour cost was five times more than the cost of schemes in the year 1840.  Do not go back to the year 1840 for a good example in such matters.</P>

      <P>If the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary is wandering in the period of 1840 I am afraid that he will not carry out many drainage schemes.  He also talked of a question which affects Deputy Flinn, the question of the interest which capital must get on its money.  I suppose that is all right, as if we do not get money we cannot carry on any scheme, but with the help of Deputy Flinn and his democratic outlook I hope that the people who have money to lend will in future be prepared to take 3 instead of 5½ per cent. interest.  I would like also to know whether it is intended to follow the procedure adopted during the last two financial years and to go slow in the way of carrying out works for which such large sums have been provided under sub-head (b).  Unless the <Col N="1226" /> Parliamentary Secretary can give an assurance that there will be some shaking up in the section of the Department which has been responsible for surrendering hundreds of thousands of pounds each year which should have been devoted to drainage I will challenge the Vote and refuse to give him the sum he asks for.</P>

      <P>I notice that in the accounts branch there are 67 officials.  It strikes me that it is rather a big number for a department of that kind.  It would, of course, be all right if all the accounting in the case of new buildings, such as barracks, etc, was done there, but I understand that that is done by the contractors who undertake the work.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will state the reason for having such a large number of officials.  I have no idea as to what work is required to be done in the secretarial department, where there are 97 officials.  That is also a big number.  There is an opinion in our Party, and I think it is shared by members of the Government Party, that the time of the staff is taken up in doing inter-departmental work in regard to accounts.  We believe, and it is fairly well known, that a good deal of that is due to having several supply departments in the State.  There are three or four different departments which supply various articles for the public service.  If, for instance, there is a requisition for certain articles sent to the Board of Works stores, and if every article on that requisition form is stocked in that department it will be all right.  If, however, all the articles are not stocked there, there is what is called &ldquo;extracting&rdquo; done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A clerk extracts from the list the various articles which are not stocked by that department, and that is sent on to another department, where it involves the time of more officials.  I suggest that many of the staff have to devote their time to that work.  I am told that there was an inquiry some time ago as to the advisability of amalgamating the three or four stores departments&mdash;the Post Office Stores, the Board of Works, and the Stationery Office, and also, I think, the Local Government <Col N="1227" /> Department.  I understand it was practically decided to amalgamate them, but that a hitch occurred when it was found that certain indispensable favourites' sons had to be dispensed with.  That may not, however, be the case.  It seems ridiculous in a small country like this to have clerks going through forms extracting a list of articles not stocked, and having it sent to another department, which, in turn, sends it to some other department.  I am not told what occurs when all the articles required have been obtained, whether the process has to be reversed and whether all the articles are sent back through the various departments or whether they are short-circuited and sent back direct.  In the British time I know that they used to be sent back to the various departments through the same tortuous channel, but I do not know whether that is the system now, as it is kept a secret.  I know that in the British days there was no short circuit back.</P>
    <P>I think that the Accounts Branch requires careful looking into, and the Government should be able to consider also the question of amalgamating supply services.  They would find that in that way there could be a great saving in book-keeping, etc.  It will be too bad if they have to displace some of the heads of the Departments, but the nearest and dearest have to part sometimes.  It will have to be faced. I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary might consider taking a step of that description.  I would like to know also whether anything is being done at present in regard to farm buildings, such as haysheds, etc., and what is the position in regard to them.  Then we come to the question of buildings for the Civic Guard.  I do not know whether I could suggest anything in regard to those buildings on this Vote, or whether they would not come more appropriately under the Vote for the Gárda Síochána.</P>

One would have thought that with an increased mobility of modern times there should be fewer of these buildings.  The Guards can be summoned to any area within a very reasonable time.

      <P>Then it will come on later.  In connection with these buildings, I would like to know how the Estimate in each case has been arrived at.  Is the figure mentioned opposite each Civic Guard building a tentative figure, or is it an indication to the contractor how much he may expect?  Is it a guide to him as to the amount that is likely to be given, or is it arrived at as a result of tendering?  There is an item here of £1,450 for an ex-R.I.C. barracks. How is that figure arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We next come to the Governor-General's establishment, and I find that there is an allowance of £1,000 for furniture, fittings and utensils.  I would like to know what became of the old ones, or who is the lucky man who gets them.  This is a big item for furniture, and should keep the place going for several years.  I had not an opportunity of going over the Estimates for other years, but I would like to know whether a sum of £1,000 is necessary for furniture and fittings in a house which was so well fitted up for the ex-Governor-General a few years ago.  Surely that amount is not required every year.  The Executive Council wants £400 more.  I can understand that that we are here now.  On page 55 there is a total of £6,999 for coastguard stations.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what use the Government is making of coastguard stations, and if they are <Col N="1229" /> the property of the Government, to let us know what they are for.  I asked a question some time ago about certain emergency holdings which are dealt with by the Board of Works.  Of course, I realise that different Departments deal with them, but there was an attempt made to sidetrack this question.  I put the question twice, and when I finally got an answer the Minister for Finance came back in half an hour and said that he gave me the wrong answer.  These emergency holdings were handed over by the British when they were giving over their possessions in the Free State to the Government.  I asked for information with regard to one of them about the 2nd May last.  One of these holdings was referred to to-day.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for information with regard to one particular holding which the owner had been letting to the State for £400 a year and the State, in return, was reletting it to him for £100, giving this gentleman £300 a year for nothing. The Minister for Finance said on the 2nd May that the letting was only for one year.  I asked the Minister &ldquo;For one year?&rdquo; and then he came round again and said he had given me a wrong answer.  I expected that.  For three years a particular gentleman was paid £400 per annum for his holding and it was re-let to him for £100.</P>
    <P>I would like to know is that the position in regard to the aerodrome at Killeagh, Co. Cork.  The net annual cost is £877 14s. 8d.  It is let for grazing at present.  Is it let on the same basis as the holding for which the Government was paying £400 a year?  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would let us know how this Killeagh aerodrome which costs according to this Estimate £877 14s. 8d. is let for grazing.  I understand that it is not proposed to retain this for military purposes, if I understood the Minister's answer.  I would like to know why this sum has been paid out.  I expect it has been an annual payment since 1922 or whatever year it was handed over.  Is it being paid to the man from whom they got the farm?  I do not know myself, but I did know the facts in the other case. It might be due to inertia on the part <Col N="1230" /> of the Board of Works that they have not got rid of it for the last three or four years, but surely in view of the demand for economy an item of £877 might well be taken into consideration. They were considering it on the 2nd May, and the costs are running up all the time.  I understand that there are several of these holdings, but I only got information about four.  I got a verbal promise when I last mentioned the matter.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give me more information when he is replying.  Seeing that the item for Civic Guard Barracks would be more appropriate under the Vote for the Gárda Síochána, I content myself at present with the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, I would be glad if he would inform the House if it is the intention of the Board of Works to do anything by way of the electrification of the pier at Dun Laoghaire. I understand the local council made a representation that it should be lighted, and, in any case, it is a matter that I would like to draw attention to. The council has gone to a great deal of expense in connection with the promenade, but the pier is rather dangerous. It is not lighted, and it has been brought to my notice recently that, at least, three people have fallen from the higher portion of the promenade. I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would inform the House if it is the intention of the Board of Works to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrSeanTubridy" hpid="Dr. TUBRIDY Dr. TUBRIDY">
      <NameTxt>Dr. TUBRIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>As under this Vote we are dealing with proposals to expend £20,000 for the purchase of sites and buildings, mostly for the erection of Civic Guard barracks, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would take the precaution of seeing that the buildings acquired are fit buildings, and that he is getting value for the money.  In 1926-27, £32,891 was spent on the purchase of sites and buildings, mostly for Civic Guard barracks. In the area that I come from I know that one barrack was bought for £1,050.  I heard since that the building is now condemned as unfit and unsuitable for a barracks, that the woodwork <Col N="1231" /> and the stonework are crumbling away. A sum of £1,050 should never have been paid for that building.  In 1925-26, £28,638 was spent on the acquisition of barracks, and in that year a house in my area was acquired for £650.  I know that that house, as well as the land attached to it, was offered for £400 some months before that.  The individual who bought the house and land paid probably less than £400, and he has now sold the house for use as a barracks for £650, without the land, for which he probably got a good price also, as I believe he has sold it.  A little more care should be taken in the expenditure of money in country districts before purchasing houses for Civic Guard barracks.</P>
      <P>Considering that we cannot get money for housing in the Gaeltacht, and for the other pressing problems, I think too much money is spent on buildings to be used as Civic Guard stations. Over £322,000 was spent in 1925-26, and now £561,550 is to be spent.  Looking over the Estimate, I find that most of that money is for Civic Guard stations. The time has come when large barracks for Civic Guards in different country districts are totally unnecessary. Complaint is made, when we ask for money for housing in the poorer areas, that no money is available, but I think a lot of these barracks are unnecessary, and I hope that never again will we be asked to spend so much money building barracks, in country districts where there is really no necessity for them.  I see in the Estimate a sum of £3,000 for boat houses in connection with Civic Guard barracks.  I would like to know for what purpose these boat houses are to be used, and in what areas they are to be built.</P>
      <P>There is a large sum in the Vote, £4,250, for the Department of Defence for the provision of a military college. Surely a military college could be set up in any of the barracks that are not being used?  It is rather extraordinary that so much money should have to be expended on a military college, considering that the Army policy has now been defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the expenditure on the Governor-General's establishment, I see that there is £8,000 estimated for <Col N="1232" /> supplies, and £1,400 for fuel, light, water and cleaning.  That appears to be too much.  That cannot be defended by anyone, I imagine.  For my part, I do not see the necessity for that grant at all.  I would like to know, as Deputy Boland has already asked, why it is necessary that £1,000 should be spent on furniture for the Governor-General's establishment every year, or am I to take it that Tim took it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the question of preserving ancient monuments, the Estimate here being £2,000 for restoration work and £8 for rent.  I presume that I am entitled to discuss the question under the heading of Ancient Monuments. It seems strange that only £2,000 should be devoted to the preservation of monuments of such great value from the educational and historic point of view.  I suppose of all the countries in western Europe, we have the most valuable collection of ancient monuments, and for that reason I believe the time has come when we should take definite steps to preserve them, and not only to preserve them, but to look after others which have been left in a derelict condition.  For that work, a certain number of experts are required, as otherwise serious injury might be done to the monuments.  I understand it is not many months since very serious injury was done to one of these monuments in the South of Ireland, where a marble slab covering an ancient tomb was destroyed.  It is not too much to ask that this matter should receive more attention.  To-day it is impossible to get any definite information as to what Department is really in charge.  If these monuments are left without some form of protection perhaps future generations will blame us. These monuments were preserved largely in the past owing to superstition, and it is not so many years since the Board of Works took whatever little action that has been taken.  I take it that the superstition which existed is no longer in existence, and that it is necessary that we should take definite action for the preservation of the monuments.  I do not believe £2,000 is sufficient to spend on work of such historic importance and of such <Col N="1233" /> great educational value.  Something more should be done, and I believe that, at least, we should have legislative proposals for the preservation of these monuments.  There does not exist any means by which foreigners could be prevented from removing such monuments from the country.  That is a very sad state of affairs, and I hope that some action will be taken to preserve them.  I wonder to whom the £8 rent is to be paid.  I also wonder what is the arrangement between the Board of Works and the Land Commission in these matters.  I know that the Land Commission is in the habit of setting the land surrounding these sites.  If the Board of Works are in possession of the site, but not of the land surrounding it, a crux arises, because in the ground surrounding some of the monuments may be found other monuments of great value.  I am not quite clear as to what is the position between the Board of Works and the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Boland's suggestion, that as there is a Committee in existence for examining ways in which economies can be brought about in the public service, some effort should be made to amalgamate the different supply offices in the State.  That question was raised here before, and the answers that were given have not shown that it has really been considered as it ought to have been.  It has been said here that the economies which have been suggested are, in a great many cases, minor ones, that they only affect small sums of money, but, as Deputy Boland has pointed out, if all the small sums of money involved are put together they come to something big.  In the case of the engineers, you have engineers in the Land Commission, you have engineers in the Board of Works, and you have engineers in the Local Government Department.  We are told that in such cases these engineers have to concentrate on special work for which they are specially qualified, that, for example, the engineers in the Local Government Department would not be suitable for work under the Public Works Department.  I think it is a fact which will not be contradicted that the <Col N="1234" /> majority of these engineers are young men out of the universities, and that they are qualified to work in any of these Departments.  In any case, even if we assume that engineering work of a different character has to be pursued in each Department, why not bring them all together?  Surely there must be a good deal of loss of time where two branches of the Engineering Department are brought into contact.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Barrow drainage, for example, there is no proof, from what we have heard of the progress of the work up to the present, that the engineers are so well equipped and so experienced that they have been able to get anything wonderful done.  I do not blame the engineers; I know that there are great difficulties in the way, but nevertheless we are inclined to believe that the work in all cases is not of such a highly technical character that an engineer in one Department could not be changed to another Department. Therefore I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that some economies might be brought about if these Departments could be amalgamated for such purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the higher staff of the Board of Works. There is a Chairman and two Commissioners. I understand that one of the Commissioners has died.  If these offices are essential, well and good, but we would like to know if they are essential. Is it absolutely necessary for us to have these three Commissioners, as well as having a Parliamentary Secretary, in charge of the Department?  If the three offices could be abolished, even if you had to pay full pensions, it is estimated that a saving of nearly £2,000 could be effected.  I desire to support Deputy Boland's remarks about estimating.  This is one of the Departments where it is almost impossible for a Deputy, in going through the Estimate, to make out a case.  He finds himself confronted with blocks of figures representing buildings that have to be erected, or work that is being done.  We know that the amounts which are being made available are gradually increasing.  We know that the overhead expenses in connection with the preparation of these schemes <Col N="1235" /> are also increasing at an appalling rate.  We know, as Deputy Davin has pointed out, that very often the work has not been completed in the year for which the money was made available. If we take the cost of two very big schemes, for example&mdash;the Custom House and the Four Courts&mdash;we are inclined to ask: How exactly are the estimates arrived at?  We are presented with a figure of, say, £200,000. How is that figure got?  Not alone is that figure, to my mind, entirely tentative, but it is very often revised, and a figure that we had last year for the erection of a building or buildings is very often changed, so that this year we have something entirely different. I think, therefore, that in this case the question of Parliamentary control over expenditure practically amounts to nothing; it is merely a sham.  We are presented with these figures; we have only a vague idea of what is meant by them, and in respect of one of the most important parts of the programme of the Board of Works, as far as I could understand from Deputy Davin, the Board of Works have not yet been able to make up their minds as to what schemes under the Arterial Drainage Act are to be considered uneconomic and what are to be considered economic.  Of course, the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; knows all about it, but we have not been furnished with copies.  But I do agree with Deputy Davin that the principle of comparing the cost of a scheme now with the cost in 1840 is preposterous, and that we ought to have something more definite as to what the policy of the Board of Works is in regard to drainage as a whole.  If it is not possible to go on with drainage schemes, well and good, but let us not be wasting the time of county councils and overburdening county surveyors with work in connection with the preparation of schemes which it is not intended to carry out; let us not be wasting the time of the Dáil in passing Drainage Acts which will never come to anything.</P>
    <P>In regard to the preparation of estimates for buildings, as we have no definite grip of the situation here and as we do not know how these estimates are arrived at, I suggest to the <Col N="1236" /> Ministry that the only way to deal with this situation and to reduce expenditure is to have some committee&mdash;let them be representatives of the Department of Finance, representatives of the Executive in some other capacity, or representatives of this House&mdash;to go into the estimates of such a Department as the Board of Public Works, where you have very large sums of money spent on supplies.  Let us see whether these supplies are actually necessary or not. Even if they are necessary, even if the work that is stipulated for will be performed, I have no doubt whatever but that an examination beforehand of these estimates by persons conversant with building construction, and so on, would mean a considerable reduction. When the Appropriation Accounts are published next year, if the amount of money voted has not been expended and the work has been completed at a lesser figure than that estimated, we will be told that it is a saving.  It will not be a saving, because there is no proof that the estimating was correctly done in the first instance.  I see no hope of an improvement in that situation unless the House is let into the secret of the programme which the Board of Works actually has before it, until we are allowed to discuss the programme which it is really meant to carry out, to discuss the cost of materials and the cost of labour in connection with which the expenditure is proposed.</P>

      <P>I was about to state that I apprehended when Deputy Boland, with that boyish enthusiasm of his, rose to his feet, the question of policy with reference to the Gárda would come up on the Gárda Síochána Vote, but the actual quality and the size of the house in which the Gárda ought to be asked to live, the size of the barracks, can only be debated upon this particular Vote, Deputy Dr. Tubridy has suggested that the houses in which the Gárda are being housed, the Gárda barracks, are too expensive.  He says that, considering the difficulties that ordinary housing meets with, that buildings of such a nature should not be erected.  With that view I cannot at all agree.  The standard Gárda barrack, which gives accommodation for a married sergeant, or a married man at any rate, and four Gárda is as small a building as is consistent with the performance of the duties which the State owes to its servants. It is the duty of the State to see that its servants are housed under sanitary conditions.  It is the duty of the State to see that the men who serve it loyally, serve it efficiently and serve it well are not allowed to live under insanitary conditions.</P>

      <P>The duty of this State, which erects these houses for its servants, is to see that these houses are sanitary, and that the persons who serve it are not to be left in insanitary surroundings.  It would be an absolutely wrong thing if the State were to set an example by its erection of insanitary buildings&mdash;buildings which would be insanitary owing <Col N="1238" /> to the want of space for the persons who reside in them.  If you go into any one of these standard barracks you will discover that there are married quarters, constituting, as it were, one house. In addition there is a dormitory, a small bedroom, and, what is necessary also, an office for the sergeant.  That is not necessary in an ordinary house. But it is necessary in a barracks.  There must also be a day-room, a kitchen and a lock-up.  These are things which are necessary in a barracks, but which are not necessary in ordinary houses.  What is necessary in these are living and sleeping accommodation.  The living and sleeping accommodation in the barracks must be such that the Gárda will live under sanitary conditions.</P>
      <P>That is precisely what the standard barrack aims at.  It aims at that, and it aims at no more.  Deputy Derrig said that no efficient control over building schemes could be carried out by this House, because there is simply given the gross sum which is to be paid for the erection of the building.  He complained that none of the details were given.  I do not know whether Deputy Derrig means that for every Gárda barracks that is to be built, or in the case of the building of the Custom House or the Four Courts or any other building that is erected, there should be circulated to every Deputy here a copy of the plan, the specification and the bill of quantities.  To my mind that would be absolutely impossible, and I am afraid that to the overwhelming number of the Dáil it would be unintelligible.</P>

      <P>Of course a Deputy can.  I want to know what further thing a Deputy can get here except a list of what the estimated cost of the building will be? Everybody knows that one cannot say that such and such a building is going to cost £1,500.  There may be difficulties in the site or in the foundations. In these, certain difficulties may crop up and there may be necessary extras. I do not suppose any house is ever calculated to within the shilling or the sixpence, or within £20 or £30 of the original estimate.  The only way in which an estimate can be drawn up is as has been done.  I think it is obviously common sense that a competent architect is required to draw up an estimate.  It can never be anything than an estimate which may be justified to within a very short amount.  But you never can explain a thing like a house.  Even if you draw your plan and bills of quantities with the greatest care you never can expect that that will work out exactly to the penny. That is substantially the only intervention which I wished to make in the debate. The intervention has been made for the sole purpose of putting forward what I, at any rate, take to be a sound principle, and that is that in erecting a building in which its servants are going to live, it is the duty of the Government to see that its buildings are proper and sanitary.  I think I may even go further than this and say that the Government, in building, should give a good example rather than a bad example to private builders.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to the statement made by the Minister for Justice.  I have before me a copy of the Estimates, and I am paying <Col N="1240" /> particular attention to the Estimates for the erection of Civic Guard barracks in Cork City.  I notice that for the Cork City Bridewell and ex-R.I.C. barrack, the total estimate for the work is £15,000, and for the Elizabeth Fort Military Barrack restoration and adaptation the total estimate is £12,500.  The total estimate for Mac-Curtain Street ex-R.I.C. Barrack is £1,700.  We have there a total of £29,200 for three Civic Guard barracks in Cork City.  According to the figures given here a few nights ago on the housing debate, that amount would build 73 five-roomed houses for the citizens of Cork.  At Cobh Junction a new barrack will cost £1,550.  During the past six months I have seen houses built in that district.  I have seen a farmer's house built there containing a dining-room, a kitchen, a parlour and a pantry downstairs, and four bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, at a cost of £850.</P>

I consider a proposal like this, coming before the representatives of the people, at a time when we are told that we cannot find money for housing or for financing any particular proposal brought before the House, no matter what the necessity for it may <Col N="1241" /> be, should not be granted.  I think that the proposal to spend £27,500 on two Civic Guard barracks in Cork City is not only a scandal but an impertinence on the part of the Minister.  It is an impertinence on his part to come here with such a proposal.  The Minister knows he has behind him&mdash;he thinks he has&mdash;a cut and dried hidebound majority which will be driven in to vote here without any consideration of either wrong or right.  I ask Deputies when they vote here to think of their own districts, to think of the labourers' cottages that are needed and of the unfortunate people living in two-roomed houses.  Can they tell those people quietly &ldquo;Oh, it is all right; you can continue to live in those places, but we have voted £1,550 for 17½ rooms for four Civic Guards at Cobh Junction.&rdquo; I ask Deputies to consider that very seriously when they are voting on this matter.  What kind of a building is going to be erected for £15,000?  I would like the Minister to elaborate that a little.</P>

      <P>I regret the interruption. I know the house in which the Civic Guards are living at Cobh Junction. It is a gentleman's house, owned by a cattle dealer, a very large cattle dealer.  The house they are living in contains 27 rooms.  I suppose that is not large enough for the social services that they render to the community. If we are going to find in every little country parish houses built at a cost of £1,550 to accommodate four or five Civic Guards, apart altogether <Col N="1242" /> from their salaries, etc., I think it is a tax that the people cannot bear and that the people will have to put an end to.  If Deputies will look up the Estimates they will observe that the amount for Civic Guard stations in my constituency alone would absolutely finance a full scheme for labourers' cottages&mdash;more than finance it.  The President stated a few nights ago that you can build a five-roomed house at a cost of £495; that was the price in 1927, and the price for 1928 has decreased to £443.  If you can build a five-roomed house for that, what in the name of goodness is the idea of spending £1,550 in a rural district for a Civic Guard station to hold four unmarried men?  Where is the sense of it?</P>

      <P>The Minister, no doubt, when he considers his own salary, believes that men with salaries like the Civic Guards should have good houses.  The Minister thinks in thousands instead of thinking along the lines of what the people are able to pay.  I challenge any Deputy to show how the people of any small parish can pay £1,550 for a Civic Guard station.  It is a scandal that should be put an end to by every Party in the House.  If Deputies are prepared to vote £15,000 for a Civic Guard station, the sooner the people of the country get a chance to say something the better.  It is a scandal, and there are right-minded men listening to me over there who will not tolerate it no matter what pressure may be brought to bear upon them by the official Whips. Every Deputy has a copy of the Estimates and he can see the portions that <Col N="1243" /> apply to his own constituency.  He will notice the amount proposed to be spent on Civic Guard stations.  Let him ask himself quietly if the people of the parish are able to pay.  I know the people of my parish and I know that they are absolutely unable to do it.  They are unable to spend these large sums in order to house four gentlemen who turn out on their bicycles and motor-bicycles in the morning to go off to the local dance. I think it is time that this kind of thing was put an end to definitely once and for all.  We are about sick of it. It was bad enough to have any peaceable district plastered with four or five Garda who waltz about the place, without having to put up a mansion for them.  I think in the present condition of the poor of our country, and especially in the present housing conditions of the poor of our country, that the £27,500 that I have mentioned and that is there in the Estimate would be very well spent in the slums of Cork instead of spending it on two Civic Guard barracks in the City of Cork.</P>
      <P>I think it is an outrage that the Minister should introduce an Estimate for such a thing.  In my opinion, he is guilty of impertinence in thinking that he is going to get the House to agree to the spending of £27,000 on two Civic Guard barracks in Cork city while the poor there are living in tenements. I hope when Deputies examine this Estimate and see what is going to be spent in their districts on Civic Guard stations, that they will not vote for it.  It would be a scandal to do so.  I am sure that Deputy Daly, who, I see, is anxious to speak, will not vote for it.</P>

      <P>As one who represents the same Division as Deputy Corry, I must differ altogether from him.  I will not go into the question of police barracks.  I do not know very much about them, but I know that every human being is entitled to a sanitary house.  I avail of this opportunity to thank publicly the Board of Works for assisting me and coming forward on my representations to improve the national schools in my district.  They did so on every occasion that I put a <Col N="1244" /> case before them.  There were a number of national schools in my district in a very unsanitary condition.  When I made representations in connection with the matter at the Office of Public Works, they sent their engineers along promptly, and, I am happy to say, put those schools, which are the most important buildings in any district, into a sanitary condition, as well as comfortable, for the children.  They also responded to representations that we made with regard to the Awbeg river. When the County Council put forward a scheme for that, they at once took up the matter, with the result that, within the past six months, hundreds of men have been employed on the scheme from Buttevant, Doneraile and other districts around.  They have improved thousands of acres of land.  That is due to the friendly co-operation that exists between the Cork County Council, of which Deputy Corry is a member, and the Office of Public Works.  I do not think that I would be doing my duty if I did not stand up and give honour where honour is due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to wedge oneself in between two Cork Deputies, but there are a few items to which I would like to refer in connection with this Vote.  There is a sum of £3,000 mentioned in the Vote in connection with boats and boat-houses.  I would like to have some information on that. I wonder if it is a fact, as has been stated in this House on more than one occasion, that boats which are in perfect working order and for the use of which applications have very often been lodged by competent fishermen, particularly along the western coast, are lying idle.  I am aware that time and again these fishermen have lodged applications for some of those boats to be given to them with which to do some fishing.  The boats, as I have said, are in perfectly good condition and still they are held up.  Evidently, it is now costing the Board of Works the sum of £3,000 to keep them held up and prevent them doing any work.  If that is the position, I think it is a scandalous state of affairs.  Perhaps it is the Fishery Department that is in the wrong.  If it is, the case is still worse when we find that it costs £3,000 <Col N="1245" /> to keep the boats stored away from the fishermen who require them.  I would like, at any rate, to have from the Parliamentary Secretary some statement in regard to that £3,000. There is also an item of close on £7,000, as mentioned by Deputy Boland, for coastguard stations.  I would like to know if those coastguard stations are to be the same as some of those mentioned in the West of Ireland and what useful purpose they serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that instead of expending £7,000 on coastguard stations it would be much better to have some kind of defence system organised among the fishermen if better methods than those existing at present cannot be employed by the Departments concerned to protect the fishermen along our coasts from foreign trawlers.  The £7,000 mentioned here for coastguard stations would go a long way in doing something in that direction.  The foreign trawlers come in along the West Coast and take away the fish, while our local fishermen have no boats or nets to go out and fish themselves.  I think that that sum of money could be better spent than in providing coastguard stations.  There has been some talk about Civic Guard barracks.  Perhaps enough has been said about them by Deputy Corry.  I observe that there is a sum of over £9,000 to be voted for new Civic Guard barracks in County Mayo.  There is one item of £1,500 for a new Civic Guard barracks in the town of Bangor-Erris.  Deputy Daly has been speaking about the sanitary condition of the schools in his constituency. He said that he went to the Board of Works and that they obliged him by sending down engineers who put the schools in his district in a sanitary condition, and remarked that the schools should be the most important buildings in any district.  It surely is as important that the schools in a district should be kept in as good sanitary condition as the Civic Guard barracks. In the case of the County Mayo one could not safely make a favourable comparison as between the sanitary conditions of the schools there and the class of buildings which the Minister for Justice proposes to provide for the Civic Guards.  I think, at least, that the sanitary conditions of the schools <Col N="1246" /> should be looked after in the first instance.  At least, the children are as much entitled to have healthy conditions provided in the schools as those occupying the Civic Guard barracks. In the Bangor-Erris area and all over the County Mayo, and I suppose the same thing applies in most other counties, the schools are in a most disgraceful condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention any schools but the schools in my own district. The work done in them by the Board of Works could not be improved upon, and they are now in a most sanitary condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. CLERY Mr. CLERY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we would not expect Deputy Daly to go outside his own constituency when talking about the schools.  We know that if all the money that the Government collected were spent in his constituency that he would be glad, but he should at least agree that others would get a look in now and again.  The expenditure of £1,500 on a new Civic Guard barracks in Bangor-Erris, which is in the Gaeltacht, should not, I think, be tolerated.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Justice that when barracks are provided for the Civic Guards they should be in a good sanitary condition.  No one would think of building new insanitary houses for anybody, not alone for those fine fellows in the Civic Guards, but I think the schools should get some little attention. In Bangor you have very good houses which would make fairly decent barracks, and these houses are a long way superior in sanitary matters and other respects to practically any school in the whole area.  I think the £1,500 would be much better spent for the State as a whole in improving the sanitary condition of the schools.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give some information regarding the items I mentioned&mdash;the £7,000 for coastguard stations, and £3,000 for boat-houses.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Estimate of £100,000 for building, enlarging and enclosing schools, I would like to know the basis upon which that sum has been arrived at.  It cannot have any reference to the necessities of the case, because we have it <Col N="1247" /> that there are at least 350 new schools required immediately, in addition to some 500 that require to be enlarged. Taking the average figure required to replace existing schools, something between eight and ten times the figures down here would be necessary to meet the requirements.  I would like to know upon what basis the Parliamentary Secretary has worked in framing this Estimate.  At what rate does he hope to proceed?  In how many years does he hope to solve the problem of the existing necessities, not to speak of the necessities that may arise in the meantime? I would like, too, if he could tell us whether he has any hope that even the sum set out will be expended in the current year, or whether, as in former years, if we are to judge by the Appropriation Accounts, a very considerable sum, amounting in some cases to one-third, will be unexpended at the end of the year; and, also, if he would give us some particulars as to the average number of years, not weeks or months, it takes from the time an application is made for a new school in a particular district until the school is completed.  I am sure the Minister has these particulars at his disposal, and it would be very interesting if he would disclose them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for intervening in the debate is I have heard a rumour that one branch of the work that has hitherto been carried on by the Board of Works is shortly to be transferred to the new Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I would like to know is that a fact.  I understand that the land improvement loans for the improvement of farmhouses and offices are in the future to be operated through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That would be very serious.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would state whether it is proposed to do that without asking the sanction of the Dáil. It would mean that so far as loans for that kind of work are concerned the Dáil will have no right to criticise the conditions, or even to get information about them.  In fact, what it would mean is that that very useful work <Col N="1248" /> would be dropped by the State, or that it would possibly mean a considerable check on these activities.  Those of us who are familiar with the working of the Agricultural Credit Corporation so far as it has gone are not optimistic about the great benefits that are likely to accrue in the immediate future.  I do not want to criticise the Corporation unfavourably as it is a new department and has to be very careful in its work, but it seems to be operating slowly.  If the valuable work the Board of Works has been doing with regard to land improvement loans is to pass into the hands of that Department, I think there are many Deputies here who would regret it very much.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more required at the moment than that the Department should be encouraged as far as possible to improve all farm houses and farm buildings.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have an encouraging word to say on that matter.  While I am speaking about it, I suggest that if the Board of Works is to continue to give loans for the improvement of farm houses they should insist on some little standard of appearance, and they should encourage artistic instinct in regard to buildings of that kind.  It is a shocking thing to see a farm house built by the loan of public money presenting an appearance that is not creditable to the taste of the people, and that is not going to improve the taste of the younger folk.  I suggest the Board of Works might insist upon a better standard of housing so far as appearance goes than they have been insisting on up to the present.  I would like to inquire about one of two other matters that have not been touched upon.  How soon will the various Government Departments be definitely settled in permanent offices?  We have seen in recent years a constant change from place to place, and we have seen a very great expenditure of money in rents which might have been avoided. I think it would have been worth while for the Government to have purchased property, especially property in poor repair, and reconstruct it for Government purposes rather than have availed of makeshift buildings as they have done up to the present.</P>

      <Col N="1249" /> I think they might even at this hour take a leaf out of the book of the Fianna Fáil organisation, which instead of renting offices and paying very big money for them each year, purchased a more or less derelict house and transformed it into a substantial and valuable building.  I think the Government should at least have had as much imagination as the Fianna Fáil organisation and might have done that in a good many cases with considerable advantage to certain districts, where the houses are gradually decaying and where reconstruction would have had an effect not only on the house immediately concerned, but on other houses adjoining. Certainly, I think it is time that the offices were more or less congregated in certain centres.  The manner in which they have been distributed all over the city during recent years has not led to the convenience of the people, who often find it difficult to locate them.  It does not seem a good advertisement that everywhere you go through the city you find Government departments.</P>
    <P>In connection with the General Post Office we should like to know whether it is intended to locate in that building the Broadcasting Department, whether all branches of Post Office work are to be located in the one building, and whether the building is to be confined to the trade business of the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the drainage work done by the Office of Public Works.  I have heard a great many complaints as to the policy which has resulted in the most activity prevailing at a time when harvest work creates a demand for workers.  In the Athy district there have been a great many complaints that it caused a considerable shortage of labour, and that the Government could easily have arranged that the drainage work could be done at a more convenient time.  That is a point worth considering with regard to future schemes.</P>
    <P>On the question of Civic Guard barracks, probably sufficient has been said, but it is worth while to bear in mind that there is a general feeling growing up that the State is merciless; that in everything the State is doing for its own immediate employees it is insisting <Col N="1250" /> upon a standard out of all proportion to the means of the people.  It is creating a feeling that the only people who matter are those who are in the immediate service of the State, and that those who have to pay are looked upon with contempt.  That is a very dangerous feeling.  While it is easy to joke about this question of Civic Guard barracks, and perhaps to exaggerate the extent of the extravagance, I think the Government should bear in mind that there is a very great feeling, probably caused by the depression in agriculture and in industry, that the Government is quite unscrupulous with regard to its expenditure on the requirements of its own immediate employees.  It would be a very dangerous thing if such a feeling were created, and probably it would not be very easy to remove.  For that reason, the Office of Public Works might well bear in mind that, while sanitation and health requirements should be carefully attended to, simplicity in regard to buildings and to comfort generally is a thing that the people would very much appreciate.  If the Government were to set that standard the people would respond to it, and it would rob the discontented, at least, of a weapon that they will perhaps tend to use more and more in future.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Moore in urging the Parliamentary Secretary to give further information as to the policy of his Department with regard to public buildings in Dublin.  I am glad to see that progress is being made in the reconstruction of the three great buildings which were destroyed.  But, in proportion as these three buildings are rebuilt, certain vacancies occur in other buildings.  Perhaps the Secretary might tell us whether he has prepared a definite scheme as to the permanent housing of the great Departments of State, or whether he is living from hand to mouth in the matter. For instance, when the Four Courts are re-built, a large section of the Castle will become vacant, and in other parts of the city similar vacancies will occur.  I note here that considerable sums are to be spent on the reconstruction of three houses in <Col N="1251" /> O'Connell Street, 14, 15 and 45.  There is also the reconstruction of Maple's Hotel.  There may have been, but I did not see any reference in the Press as to how that site is going to be used. These are very valuable sites, and I presume that, in the general scheme of reconstruction, the Department has decided upon a policy as to what are to be the final homes of the Departments of State.</P>
      <P>I was not present when Deputy Corry was speaking, but I understand that he was referring to the Civic Guard Barracks.  All I can see from the Estimates is that there is something undoubtedly wrong with Cork&mdash;that either the people of Cork need more policing than the people of other parts of the country, or else that they have succeeded in extracting, as usual, far greater grants from the Government than any other place.  While in Wexford we are only getting a miserable £2,000 for this work, the people of Cork have succeeded in persuading the Department to spend fabulous sums in the reconstruction of barracks in that part of the country.</P>
      <P>There is a small matter which, I think, would arise on the Oireachtas item in this Vote.  There is a certain object in front of the main entrance of this building which I would like to see removed by the Office of Public Works. It is an object which is not in any way artistic and which is liable to give rise to misunderstanding on the part of distinguished strangers visiting this Parliament.</P>

      <P>There is a doubt as to exactly what it is.  Some people say it is a statue of Dame Britannia sitting upon the Free State Government. Others say it is a statue of a well-known lady politician of this country sitting on Fianna Fáil.  My theory is that it is a symbolical statue of the spirit of obstruction.  In any case, if it does represent the lady that some people say it does represent, and who was no particular friend of this country, I do not think that it is fair for us to pursue that vendetta beyond the grave and insist upon showing such a horrible object as this as the official representation of that distinguished lady.  I think the cost would not be very great.  I urge upon the Board of Works to remove it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. MAGUIRE Mr. B. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>In the various duties that the Board of Works undertakes, my objection is that they are not <Col N="1253" /> strong enough, or that they are not wide enough, in their views in the matter of drainage&mdash;I mean drainage on small farms or holdings in the West of Ireland.  Some years ago the Department of Public Works did a good deal of useful work in that direction, but in latter years they ceased altogether to comply with that branch of their duty. I consider that this is the most important part of the duty of any public department that undertakes it, and that the continuation of it would be a very useful service.  I urge very strongly that the Board of Works should undertake the work of ordinary drainage on ordinary holdings as part of their duty, and that they should develop it on lines suitable to the requirements of the individual farmer.  To do that effectively the rate of interest payable would have to be reduced.</P>
      <P>The small farmer cannot afford to pay the present rate of interest which is charged, nor can he afford to repay the money except the time is extended. That the work is practical work and shall ultimately be of benefit to the farmer is without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in addition to that, I urge that the Board of Works might take a broader view, and that they might be more useful in devising schemes in the various localities if they took the local conditions more into account rather than the technical point of view as to how the work should be carried out. I have in mind various schemes that would be useful if carried out.  But when the Department is advised of such schemes they send down their engineers, and their engineers draw plans and schemes, with the result that the estimate prepared makes the work prohibitive. I have in mind a case that occurred in Leitrim a few weeks ago, when a river overflowed its banks. Some years ago a suggestion was made that the river should be drained, but the cost was prohibitive for that poor area.  The result was that the work was never carried out, and a few weeks ago the river burst its banks and utterly destroyed several farms.  What I suggest is that in a case of that sort the local conditions should be taken into account, and the engineers responsible should first of all prepare their <Col N="1254" /> schemes, not based technically on what would be required as essential for carrying out a big drainage scheme, but a scheme the ordinary expenditure on which would be such that the people could bear.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I think that in applying their schemes for building and for improving houses a similar view should be taken.  There is no use estimating for, or holding out for a standard in building a farmhouse or out-offices on a small farm of poor land in a poor district that might be justified in a better district with better quality land and where the people would be capable of bearing larger expenditure.  The result is that you have farmers in the West and in the congested parts who can take little advantage, if indeed they can avail at all, of grants for building or improving houses from the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>I would say that while it is desirable, as the Minister for Justice pointed out, that the State should provide sanitary and suitable accommodation for all its people, I am afraid he had in mind, and I think he said so, a certain class of people&mdash;namely, Civil Servants, Civic Guards and so on.  If there is anxiety on the part of the Government to make improvements in farms and dwelling-houses in the West of Ireland there is no question of those farmers ever being able to build houses according to the suggestions of the Board of Works.  A scheme should be specially prepared in connection with which the Board can lend money to such farmers to improve their houses according to their local requirements and according to their ability to meet such improvements.  A scheme of that kind could be developed along the right lines, and these are the only lines on which the Board of Works can be of any practical use to a certain big section of the people.  The Board of Works ought, to my mind, to be more flexible in their attitude.</P>
    <P>I have here before me a case in which the Board of Works a good many years ago undertook a big drainage scheme in Leitrim.  The works were known as the Black River Drainage Works, and portion of the scheme involved the setting up of a weir.  The history of the thing is rather striking.  The scheme <Col N="1255" /> was started in the year 1842.  A big portion of the country was involved. The result of the drainage scheme would have been very effective, but it would mean drawing away a stretch of water or lake that had been useful to Lord Leitrim for the purposes of adornment in his demesne.  Consequently the drainage scheme was altered so as to make provision that the lake should remain there.  The result of that was the setting up of the weir, and the setting up of the weir meant that the drainage was practically useless, and a big tract of country is flooded ever since, year after year. This matter was taken up with the Board of Works, and within the last two years a good deal of correspondence took place with no result.  We find now that the successor of Lord Leitrim still maintains the right to hold that weir there, notwithstanding that this drainage scheme was carried out at the expense of that part of the community and that the farmers still continue to pay tribute each year as a result of the drainage.  Through the influence of Lord Leitrim and his successors that drainage scheme is of no benefit to them.  I believe the Board of Works, if they are to serve any useful purpose, should be more flexible than they have been; they should see that that weir is removed, even if it means the removal of a certain part of the attractions of Lord Leitrim's demesne. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly opposed to this measure.  I regard with some suspicion the method of its introduction.  The Government does not care to face the introduction of the measure, which is nothing short of tyrannical legislation.  Therefore, it is left to two popular Deputies on the Government benches to introduce a measure imposing disabilities on the legal profession, a profession which they admit they know very little about, and which they had not the courtesy to consult before they brought in the measure. I hope, therefore, the House will have sufficient common sense to reject the measure at this its Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call this tyrannical legislation because it interferes with the rights of learned bodies to fix a curriculum for their students in whatever way may seem best to them.  We hear a great deal of talk from time to time about the tyranny of the British Government over Ireland for 750 years.  I want to say this: Let us be careful that now we have the making of our laws in our own hands, we be not accused of oppressive legislation.  In my opinion the great mistake is being made of forcing Irish on the people, and, in the case of the legal profession, if this Bill passes, a great and harmful measure <Col N="1259" /> will, in my opinion, be forced upon them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Doctor Hennessy in thinking that the half million pounds that is being spent in the teaching of Irish by compulsion would be better spent in improving the economic and social conditions of the people. Deputy Buckley and others were ashamed that anyone would oppose compulsory Irish in the Dáil.  On the other hand, I am ashamed that we are spending money in compelling children to attend schools and spending money in compelling them to learn Irish, while some of the schools are in such a condition that children could not possibly learn anything for want of ventilation and warmth, to say nothing of food. Further, the sanitary accommodation in many parts of the country is a disgrace to civilisation and a menace to the health of the young.  I say that the money would be better spent in encouraging industry and finding employment for the unemployed and the young people who are leaving the country, as we know, by hundreds every month.  The exit from my house abuts almost on the Visa Department of the United States Consul, and three times a week I am faced with the problem of passing some thirty to forty fine young people who want to emigrate to the United States.  I say to myself as I pass them: &ldquo;Why is it necessary that these young people should leave the country?  Why are we doing nothing to keep them here?&rdquo; And again I say: &ldquo;What is the good of forcing compulsory Irish; what is the good of teaching them Irish when they are emigrating to a country where they will have to seek their bread amongst people of other countries?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, thank you. I have been attending the poor for nothing for forty years in hospitals, and I can stand up here with a clean sheet and say that there are no crocodile tears so far as I am concerned. Since I came here I think everyone will admit that I have stood for the social improvement of the people.  Someone said that we had not the courage of our convictions.  I stand up and say that I <Col N="1260" /> have the courage of my convictions, and I am placing them before the Dáil, so I hope there will be no more talk about crocodile tears.  I say that the money would be better spent in encouraging industry and finding employment for those people.  Someone, I think Deputy Carney, spoke about an ascendancy crowd or an ascendancy gang who were bent on opposing everything that was Irish or against the Gaelicising of the Free State.  I want to say, with regard to Trinity College, the institution with which I am concerned, that there has been a Professor of Irish there for many years and for the last twenty or thirty years there has been a Lecturer in Irish, and prizes and sizarships have been given for Irish.  There is an Irish society running in the College, of which the Professor of Irish is the head, and the Society is run for the purpose of encouraging the study of the Irish language.</P>

      <P>As I say, I do not know.  There is a Gaelic Society there, with a Professor of Irish at its head, encouraging the study of Irish at Trinity College.  In the second place I say, with regard to the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, that at the request of the President of the Gaelic League, twenty-five years ago, we placed Irish as an optional subject on our list, and at a later period Deputy de Valera was appointed an examiner. I want to say that there is no sign there of any ascendancy gang setting their faces against the study of Irish.  I am in favour of the teaching of Irish, but what I am opposing at present is the compulsory teaching of Irish.  My reasons for opposing this Bill are numerous. In the first place, the legal profession does not seem to have been consulted in the matter.  In the second place, it will be a distinct injury to the Law Schools.  It was pointed out by one Deputy that at one time we had large numbers of students coming to <Col N="1261" /> our Law Schools from other countries. I do not think that it is any harm that they should come here to pursue their legal studies.  Their coming here will. undoubtedly, be interfered with if this measure is carried.  In the third place. I am sure that it will be harmful to the reciprocity which exists between the Free State and Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  In the fourth place, in my opinion, the Dáil has no right to interfere with the education of these students.  In the fifth place, there is what I consider the serious blot referred to by Deputy Jasper Wolfe, who pointed out that there was going to be placed on the shoulders of one man the responsibility of saying whether candidates should be allowed to practise the profession of a solicitor, or whether barristers should be allowed to take up their profession at the Bar.  That is a serious blot, and I hope it will not be persisted in if this Bill is carried further. Finally, let me add a word to those who have spoken regarding the effect of compulsory Irish upon the unity of the country.  I think I am in a position to speak more freely than almost anyone else in this House on what the attitude of the North will be. I read some time ago that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party had stated that the North must be brought in, either by persuasion or by force of arms.  At a later period, last week.

I do not believe that the North will ever be brought in, either by cajolery or force, but that, if it is to be brought in, it will be brought in by the economic development reaching such a stage that it will seem to the North to be worth their while to come in.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw the statement if Deputy de Valera states that he never made it.  I am very glad to hear it.  In my opinion, the policy of compulsory Irish is playing ducks and drakes with primary education.  Take the absurdity of the situation as you have it to-day in the answer to the question put by Deputy Good.  The answer to his question was that there are 1,240 schools in which, during the infant stage, everything is taught through Irish.  Those children are coming at the age of ten and eleven into the senior schools.  When they get into the senior schools, I understand the subjects are taught through the medium of English and Irish.  It seems to me therefore absurd that these children, who have been taught purely through Irish during the five or six years that they have been attending school, are now to be asked to turn <Col N="1263" /> to learn English in order that they will be able to understand the subjects partly taught through English.  I want to say that, as far as the secondary schools are concerned, they are trying to do their work.  They are trying to follow out the policy of the Minister for Education in very difficult circumstances, even the difficulty of getting teachers.</P>
      <P>To leave that subject, I think what we should aim at is efficiency; efficiency in the man who is going forward for any profession, that he is efficient in the particular profession he has chosen. I would very much prefer to have a doctor who could recognise diphtheria at once and inject the curative antitoxin immediately, but who could not speak Irish, than a man who would be very slow about making a diagnosis and in giving treatment, but who had a knowledge of Irish.  I frankly admit, however, that an efficient doctor who could also speak Irish would secure my admiration and vote if necessary.  I would give my vote to the man who could speak Irish if he were as efficient as the other man.  I readily admit that it is desirable that solicitors, barristers and doctors who are working in Irish-speaking districts should have a knowledge of Irish so that they could enter into conversation freely with the native speakers of Irish, but it is quite a different matter to make it compulsory that everyone should have this knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said or suggested&mdash;and I do not like the attitude&mdash;from the Benches opposite that anyone who did not want to learn Irish should clear out of the country.  I do not think that is a fair attitude.  At all events it is not the attitude of the late Mr. Arthur Griffith.  Mr. Griffith said that there was room for everybody, room and work for all sections of the people in the country, and that they should get a fair chance.  That is what I claim. I say that if I do not believe in compulsory Irish I should have a perfect right to say so and have a position in the country just as much as if I were a strong advocate for it.  I might be persuaded to a different point of view by Deputy Derrig if I understood a single <Col N="1264" /> word he said.  Unfortunately you have not made it compulsory that Deputies in this House should understand Irish, and therefore a great deal of the eloquence is lost upon me.  Possibly, as I say, I might be persuaded to the opposite view if I understood it.  I ask the House to use its common sense; to reject this measure now in its Second Stage, and to leave it to the authorities who are responsible for the professional education of the students to decide the curriculum that is best suited to anybody taking up a professional career.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  In doing so I want to say that it is my opinion that this House will be only carrying to their logical conclusion the assertions and the proclamations made by the House on previous occasions when the Dáil made Irish the official language of the State.  In doing that they did not say that the Irish language was the official language for that portion of the country where there were Irish speakers, but that it was the official language of the State.  That is a point that Deputy Sir James Craig and other people really do not take cognisance of at all.  A great deal has been said about the injustice of making the legal profession learn Irish.  I do not think it is any injustice.  Nobody has shown that there is an injustice.  I I think it is the duty of the Government, and of the House, once they proclaimed that the Irish language is the official language of the State, to see that the legal profession, who live not exactly by the law, but on the laws which are made here&mdash;they live on the law in the institutions of the State, which are the courts&mdash;are proficient, and by proficiency I mean that they are qualified to take up a case in all its phases, and everything in relation to the law, and that they would be able to deal with it in a proper manner.  I am surprised that there is any opposition at all to the measure, because everybody who has come here has supported the Constitution in which Irish is stated to be the national language.  Still they cannot see that in the outposts of the Government, which are the courts, that the interpreters of the law in those courts should have a knowledge of the <Col N="1265" /> language.  I think it is a most illogical position for anybody to take up to say that the members of the legal profession need not have a knowledge of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. BRENNAN Mr. BRENNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Professor Thrift can do that.  Deputy Sir James Craig has mentioned what the British Government did in this country.  I think it is time that Sir James Craig and other people realised that the British Government is not here now, that what is here is an Irish Government that has been built on the graves of the men of 1916, the men of 1920 and 1921.  We are living in a State that is founded on the principles that were responsible for those days, and it is well that everybody should realise that.  I do not think that this House, or any Government of this country, wants to penalise anybody so far as the language is concerned.  It is not a penalty, any more than it is a penalty to live in the country which has a national language.  Consequently, I think that the House is actually obliged to see that the legal profession is fully qualified in this matter to carry on the business of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jasper Wolfe said that if this Bill were passed, it would, in his opinion, be passed through lack of moral courage on the part of some Deputies, who really wanted to vote against the Bill but were afraid to do so.  If Deputy Wolfe scented a lack of moral courage somewhere, he was not far wrong.  There is some moral cowardice somewhere in connection with this matter, and I would be inclined to agree with Deputy Sir James Craig that the Executive Council is guilty of moral cowardice.  I think that this measure should have been brought in by the Government, that it was their duty to bring it in, and that they ought not to have left it to some private members.  However, they did not do that, and it is all the same to us who brings it in.  Probably moral cowardice is also shown by some people, particularly some members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, those people who have subscribed to the Cumann na <Col N="1266" /> nGaedheal programme, which lays down certain things with regard to the Irish language.  I do not know, of course.  I am not concerned with the political programme of Cumann na nGaedheal or of anybody else.  I know what value to place upon a political programme.  But if these people had moral courage they would have said, when they were going into the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, that they would not stand by the language when they are not prepared to stand by it now, and apparently they are not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper told us of his attempt to learn Irish and said that he failed.  Why did he fail?  I have not the smallest doubt but that if the Irish language was at that time compulsory in the professions.  Deputy Cooper would not be in the humiliating position in which he now finds himself in not being able to understand the Irish language.  The same might be said of Deputy J.J. Byrne.  I am afraid that the Minister for Justice took the wind out of Deputy Byrne's sails badly.  I thought that Deputy Byrne was speaking for the Benchers, but apparently the Minister for Justice did not agree with him.  Deputy Byrne said that amongst those who think intellectually &ldquo;it is folly to interfere in matters in which one has no knowledge.&rdquo;  I think we will all agree with that, and I think it was folly on the part of Deputy Byrne to interfere in this debate, because he has no knowledge of the subject.  Apparently he did not grasp the significance of the fact that the Irish language is the official language of the State.  It would be quite possible for this to happen, that a son of Deputy J.J. Byrne's might be in this House representing Dublin, and, as the worthy son of a worthy father, we would not like him to be humiliated through not knowing the Irish language.  He would probably be following the same learned profession, and I think Deputy Byrne ought to see to it that the Irish language is compulsory so that his son would not be in that humiliating position when it came to his time to represent Dublin City in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point that the learning of the Irish language is a handicap <Col N="1267" /> upon students, if Deputy Sir James Craig and other Deputies would only look up the results of the scholarship examinations through the country, they would find that those people who scored the highest in Irish were in almost every case the highest in everything. That was our experience in Roscommon.  We had two sets of scholarships under the County Council, and, in every case, those who scored highest in Irish were highest in everything else.  I am not one of those people who say that the Irish language tends to broaden the minds of the Irish people more than anything else, and these results I speak of are probably due to the fact that these children have better brains than the others.  But it was not a handicap in any shape or form to have them taught Irish, and the same applies to the young children with whom Deputy Sir James Craig has so much sympathy.  I am the father of some of those children with regard to whom Deputy Good asked a question, and I am proud to say that those infants are learning the Irish language: not alone that, but they are learning the English language as well.  Deputy Sir James Craig is apparently astray about that.  He says that those infants between the ages of six and eight are learning nothing but Irish, and when they come to the age of fifteen or sixteen-they have to learn English.  That is not a correct statement.</P>

    <P>The debate upon this Bill will do a large amount of good.  It will act as an advertisement for the Irish language. It has got everybody talking; and when you have everybody talking it is an advertisement.  Another very good thing about it is this, that it will show us the alignment which we would have had in this House had there not been a civil war.  The result of the vote will show the alignment and the line of demarcation that there should be in this country and that should be the natural line of demarcation.  I <Col N="1268" /> have said practically everything that I wanted to say, except to refer to my friend Deputy Hennessey.  Deputy Hennessey was so zealous to have this Bill defeated that he really could not wait to vote against it, but defeated it through the columns of the daily Press. I think it would only be fair, in view of his exertions, that the House should give him some title.  I would suggest that he should be called the Knight of the Firbolgs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRENNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little of it, apparently. The reason he assigns for that is that, because the Firbolgs, from whom he is directly descended&mdash;and a very good specimen he is&mdash;were defeated by the Milesians, and so on, we have really no native language at all. I am not sure that Deputy Hennessey has gone back far enough.  He should have gone back a little further and told us that these Milesians were descended from Magog, son of Japheth, the famous son of Noah, and that the man from whom they were descended was the inventor of letters.  If Deputy Hennessey had told us of that, I think he would have confused himself so much that he would hardly have written his letter at all.  However, Deputy Hennessey seems to think that because his ancestors, the Firbolgs, were defeated by the Milesians we have no native language at all.  It may be interesting to Deputy Hennessey to know that if we go back to the days of the Assyrian Empire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill that has been introduced by Deputy Conlon and Deputy MacFadden.  I think that they have done a good service, not alone to this House but to the Irish language and the cause of its revival, by bringing this Bill in.  I would like to say another thing, ma's maith, is mithid é. The Bill has been criticised on the grounds that the Deputies who introduced it know little or nothing about law, and because of that they were not competent to introduce a Bill to deal with this noble and honourable profession, as it was described by one Deputy. As the Minister for Local Government put it the other night, the people who criticise this Bill know little of the spirit of the Irish nation or little of the spirit of this people.  We have come to the parting of the ways in this country. It has been long delayed, but the sooner these people, who seem to have formed an alliance in this country to endeavour to retard the progress of the language, realise that when the Minister for Local Government spoke of the spirit of this people what he meant was the changing of the tide that has resulted in bringing to this country, during the last five or six years, the triumph of the Irish language.  The sooner they realise and accept that the better it will be for everyone, and particularly for the section that still clings <Col N="1270" /> to the traditions of the British Empire Deputy Cooper said that by proceeding too hurriedly we might easily do harm. To whom?  This Bill is not going to inflict any undue hardship on anybody. I agree with certain Deputies who said that it did not go far enough.  Certainly it is not going to inflict any undue hardship on anyone in this State. The only people Deputy Cooper is afraid it is going to do harm to are the people who still cherish in their hearts the return to this country of the British Empire and all that it stands for&mdash;not that it is gone.  He said that if the Bill was passed the English would be given a good excuse for breaking off the reciprocal arrangement by which Irish barristers could be admitted to the English Bar, and <i>vice versa</i>, without further examination.  There has been a lot of talk of toleration in this House. There has been a lot of talk of what England would or might do if such a thing happened.  I think it is nearly time that we got away from that point of view.  I think it is nearly time this House should adopt an attitude of self-respect, stand on its own legs, and not mind what England or any other country would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be only right that Deputy Cooper, or anyone else who has information, should furnish to this House, before this debate concludes, an estimate of the number of students who would be really affected, even supposing that the reciprocal arrangement was dropped.  The Deputy stated further, that the sole qualification for entering any profession should be fitness to enter it.  I agree, but there should be another qualification, that for any citizen the real qualification should be a knowledge of the language of this country, and I would go so far as to say that no position in the gift of the Civil Service or of the Government, no position in the gift of any local authority, should be given to anyone who has not a competent knowledge of the Irish language. Either we mean what we say about it or we do not.  Either the money spent on the language by this Government and State for the past five or six years has been spent with the intention of saving it or it has not.  Let us be honest.  If there is no intention of putting <Col N="1271" /> the language on its feet and bringing it back to the position it once occupied, making it the spoken language of the people, the sooner we know that the better, and the sooner we stop fooling about it the better.  I believe there is an intention to save it.  I believe we will save it, and because of that I say, as I said before, that we have come to the parting of the ways, that we must make an effort to ensure that the Irish language will not be treated with the scorn and contempt with which it has been treated, and is treated, even at the present time by a certain section of the people in this State, after all these years of war and turmoil for a principle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Redmond and Deputy Good spoke a lot about compulsion, and I think Deputy Matthews and some other Deputies backed them up in that argument. Deputy Redmond said that compulsion was not the proper means of securing that this country will be Irish-speaking again; that it would make the language more obnoxious to the people. Well, this statement may cause a little bit of a shock amongst some people who speak so much about tolerance.  There is no lack of moral courage here as far as I am concerned.  As the Minister for Finance stated in the course of the debate, the Irish language has been pushed into its present deplorable position by long-continued persecution on the part of an alien Government.  It has been put into its present position by penalties inflicted on the people during four or five hundred years of alien rule.  It has been put in its present position, and brought to the gateway of death, because of material disadvantages imposed on it by an alien Government. I say that we have now got a native Government, in twenty-six counties of this nation anyhow, and, if necessary, the very same methods that were used to kill the Irish language should be used to bring it back.  I say that the people of this State, and the members of this House, should be quite prepared to stand over that.  Even if it is found necessary, and if there is such an organised opposition to it as to make the efforts being made by this Government and by the Dáil inoperative, <Col N="1272" /> I say that we should not be a bit ashamed or afraid to go back to the same methods that were made to kill it, in order to restore it, and they would restore it quickly.  Deputy Redmond described the Bill as inconsistent and unnecessary; that it did not go far enough.  I agree that it does not go far enough; I believe that the age limit as too low.  In my opinion it should be 18 instead of 16 years.  I quite agree with Deputies who urged that for the engineering profession, the medical profession, and even for the Dáil, after a certain year a knowledge of Irish should be essential for membership.  I believe if every public position is given only to those who have acquired a knowledge of the Irish language, and if people are made to wake up to the fact &mdash;especially the section that is organising opposition&mdash;that there has been a 1916, and that there has been a 1921 in this country&mdash;if they are made wake up to the sacrifices made during these years to ensure that a Gaelic Ireland would arise out of the chaos and ruin&mdash; then the logical conclusion we may draw is that Irish will be absolutely essential for every public position, and even for membership of the Dáil and Seanad.  I do not see why anybody should be a bit afraid to visualise that prospect.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have spoken about the legal profession and the terrible hardship that we are going to inflict on the members of that profession; the awful insult that was imposed on them when we did not consult them before the Deputies opposite introduced this Bill.  We were told what terrible consequences it would have; that you would have everything Irish, and all this sort of bosh.  Accidentally in the Library I came across a speech delivered by Charles Stewart Parnell at the National Club in Dublin after the Kilkenny election.  His opinion of the legal profession stands as my opinion of it to-day, and perhaps it would be no harm to quote his opinion: &ldquo;The Bar of Ireland was at one time a patriotic body, but it undoubtedly ceased to be a patriotic body when we lost our independence, and it will never again be a patriotic body until a future Irish nation shows these legal gentlemen that the <Col N="1273" /> only way to preferment is through the hearts of their fellow-countrymen.&rdquo; This Bill is going to show them that the only way is through the hearts and aspirations of their fellow-countrymen. I do not see why any self-respecting, sane Irishman, with any hope for the future of this country, with any belief in a Gaelic nation, should object to the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good, in the course of his attack on the principle of the language, said that at least five years' notice should be given of the introduction of the Bill.  Deputy Good is a man of intelligence; he is a man who occupies a high commercial position in this country; a man who undoubtedly can read and does read the newspapers; he has been in the Dáil for a considerable number of years, and I am sure that Deputy Good will realise&mdash;I am certain that he does realise, but for some reason or other he has omitted to say it&mdash; that the policy of this Government for the past six years has been a policy tending towards the Gaelicisation of this part of the country anyhow.  Deputy Good knows very well that the other principal political party in this country has always stood for the same principle.  On that principle at least there is unity, and Deputy Good should not try to delude the members of the Dáil with the statement that at least five years' notice of this Bill should be given.  I may say six years' notice, and even twelve years' notice, has been given since the Proclamation of Independence in 1916.  Due notice has been given, and, if the people principally concerned have not observed that notice, it is their funeral.</P>
    <P>There is another point which was mentioned by a Deputy here.  The Chief Justice of Saorstát Eireann some years back lectured before the Irish Bar on the policy of the Government. There has really then been no lack of notice given to these gentlemen, and if they are kicking against the traces now and will not take their beating like men, I, for one, will not have any sympathy with them.  There cannot be any complaint on the score that they have not got notice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good proceeded to say that more was being made of the Irish-speaking <Col N="1274" /> problem than was really justified. That is the sort of talk that we heard in this country for many years back, and it is the sort of talk that we hope we will not hear again in the present position of things.  Deputy Good, as well as many other Deputies who have spoken in the same strain, should realise that there is not enough made of the Irish-speaking problem.  As Deputy Clery reminded the Dáil, if something is not done very quickly there will not be any Irish-speaking problem to be faced in a few years.  If some great effort is not now made, all hope of saving the language will be shattered.  The fountainhead of the Irish language, the last stronghold of the Irish language, is the Gaeltacht, and if the Gaeltacht goes then the true Irish language goes.  You may have the Irish language as it is spoken now in the cities and towns, but you will not have the real inspiration direct from the source.  That is the real fact of the matter, and yet we hear this talk about too much being made of the Irish-speaking problem and we are advised that we should not devote all the attention that we are devoting to the subject. All that sort of talk is so much bunkum.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that it was a hardship on the young men of the middle classes whose custom it was to be educated in schools outside the Saorstát for generations.  I do not know why that was the custom.  Certainly Deputy Craig, Deputy Alton and Deputy Tierney, and those others mixed up in the teaching profession here, should be able to satisfy Deputy Good that there are in the twenty-six counties of what was once known as Ireland, schools as good, if not better, than any of the schools to which they could send their middle-class children, as they have been doing, according to what we are now told, for generations.  There are here, in the twenty-six counties, schools in which middle-class children will receive a really Gaelic, national training, and schools to which, if Deputy Conlon will only extend the Bill, they will be compelled to send their children, and in which those very children will be made good citizens of Ireland and not good citizens of an empire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> Deputy Anthony sent up a lonely banshee type of wail about the working-class children suffering severely from this policy.  He made a grand phrase in the course of his statement, when he said that this generation was being sacrificed educationally.  The results of tuition in the schools, as the last Deputy who spoke mentioned, have certainly disproved that.  The teaching of Irish is no more a hardship on the working-class children than it is on anybody else.  The teaching of the Irish language, so far from being detrimental to their education in other respects, has improved their education. I come from an English-speaking district where the Irish language went down with the Gaelic nation at the Battle of Kinsale.  I have visited several schools in my own district during the past four or five days, and I have discussed this question with the teachers in those schools.  I have submitted Deputy Anthony's statement to them, and also the statement of another Deputy, to the same effect. Those statements declared that the Irish language was injuring the education of the children.  In every case the responsible teachers, who have years of experience and have taught the Irish language in those schools, especially since 1923, assured me that far from doing any harm to the intellects of the children, and far from being detrimental to their education, the teaching of Irish has broadened their views, and has done no harm whatsoever to them. That, I think, deals with the complaints made about the results of Irish teaching and the hardship that is being done to the children, according to Deputy Anthony.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect, and that is that the boy of to-day is the citizen of to-morrow, and if that boy is not given a good sound training he is not going to be a good, sound citizen.  The only way we can achieve a true Gaelic State is by ensuring that the boys and girls of the present generation will have a sound and a thorough knowledge of the Irish language.  If it is necessary&mdash;I do not believe it is&mdash;I will mention to Deputy Anthony that we would be quite prepared&mdash;at least I would&mdash;to exclude Latin from the curriculum of <Col N="1276" /> the schools, or any other language for that matter, in order to make certain that the Irish language would become the spoken language of the people in the next generation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance struck the right note when he said that they were not going to hold up the language policy for the sake of the convenience of a few individuals.  I believe that these few individuals represent only the minority in this country, who still cherish in their hearts the return of the British Empire.  If there is any attempt to hold up the language policy, I say that the three big parties in the country standing for the language should resist that attempt with every available resource in the hands of the Government Party, and the other parties combined.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.J. Byrne, in his usual melodramatic style, questioned what particular qualifications Deputies Conlon and MacFadden had to force this curriculum on a great profession.  He said that the great services to this nation rendered by the legal profession entitled them to better treatment, and all that sort of stuff.  Many other things were forced on the people of Ireland and they were not consulted.  The legal profession, as was indicated in my quotation from Parnell, must wake up to the fact&mdash;and Deputy Byrne must, too&mdash;that it is not going to be made a sort of close borough, and it is not going to escape.  Those who now say that this is a hardship being inflicted on the children should endeavour to realise the true situation.  The sooner they wake up to facts the better.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the shining star of the whole bunch.  Deputy Jasper Wolfe, who painted a dismal picture of what was going to happen in this unfortunate partitioned country if this Bill is allowed to pass.  He told us that he tried every Irish speaker he knew to translate a name, and he failed until he came to Deputy Gearoid O'Sullivan.  I am certain that Deputy O'Sullivan, who knows the country from which Deputy Wolfe comes, will be able to bear me out when I say that Deputy Wolfe must not have tried very many Irish speakers <Col N="1277" /> or otherwise he would have got a translation.</P>

      <P>As to Deputy Jasper Wolfe, he discoursed about a lot of things.  He stated that only on two occasions in forty years did he meet people who could not speak English, and that they had long since gone to their eternal reward. Might I express the hope that Deputy Jasper Wolfe had nothing to do with sending these people to their eternal reward, because it would be a terrible thing if he had.  Now I want to come to his statement that he always stood for the unity of Ireland from Fair Head to the Mizen, and he argued in his speech that the Bill making Irish obligatory for legal practitioners was a Bill against the unity of Ireland.  In passing I wish to say that Deputy Jasper Wolfe has influence with people who stand for the partitioning of this nation, and if he spends his time in working against that partition and in endeavouring to convert them to a united Ireland he would spend it better than he is doing in attacking those who stand for the revival of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One time there was a great Cardinal and he stated a thing that should be recognised as a fact, a true statement of the position that exists in Ireland to-day, and that was Cardinal Manning. He said that the garrison must give place to the nation.  Deputy Wolfe should recognise, even at this late hour, that there are men in this country who are determined to see. <Col N="1278" /> whilst it lies in their power, that the garrison will give place to the nation. Certainly Deputy Jasper Wolfe will not be attacking, joking and sneering at the revival of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>As to the cheap sneers that he indulged in at the expense of the Party on these benches, I am not going to refer to them except to say that he has no grounds whatsoever for most of them. I hope we will hear no more of them: and it is a sorry day for the country when Deputy Jasper Wolfe can get up and sneer at the men on these benches. Deputy Matthews was troubled because the Bill annoyed a large section of the nation.  He wanted respect for the other fellow's opinion.  We have heard a good deal about intolerance and having respect for the other fellow's position.  There has been enough of that cheap sneering at the people of this country for the last sixty years. We have had enough of it for five generations. We have done it but the other fellow has not respected our opinions. It is about time we had done with it.  If the other fellow does not respect our nation, and if the chief organ in the Press of the other fellow does not respect our nation, and if the other fellow's platform orator has no respect for our nation, the sooner the other fellow falls into line with the people the better it will be in the end for the other fellow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cole exhibited the typical slave mind which still lives on in this country when he said that we in this country should realise the blessing which the English language conferred upon us by enabling Irishmen who went abroad to secure employment at once as a result of their knowledge of what he calls a universal language.  The Deputy stated that the language teaching was estimated to cost £500,000 a year.  That is half a million pounds. The only sad thing I see about it is that it is not enough.  The recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission, if put into force, would cost more than that. Deputy Cole will some day or other have seventy-five fits in three minutes if the Government ever get the moral courage to put the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission into force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir James Craig also spoke of the tyrannical legislation and <Col N="1279" /> oppressive tyranny.  The unity of Ireland and fair-play also came into his speech.  All I should like to say in respect of that is, that in a certain section of this country there is tyrannical legislation and oppressive tyranny, and there is no protest against that tyranny from Deputy Sir James Craig or the people he represents.  If Deputy Sir James Craig would use the influence which he undoubtedly possesses in conjunction with Deputy Jasper Wolfe, in the influence which he possesses. against the tyrannical legislation and oppressive tyranny in another portion of this country, then I would see some sense in his coming here to criticise this Bill on the grounds of tyrannical legislation and oppressive tyranny.  The Deputy discussed the possibility of the Bill and its influence on the Boundary question and how it may operate against the coming in of the North. Deputy Sir James Craig should realise that that has nothing whatever to do with it, because that position will only be ended when England is prepared to give up her bridgehead in the North, or when we can make her do it, one or the other.  The Deputy said he did not like the attitude on this Bill.  He talked of compulsion, and he quoted Arthur Griffith on that matter.  There is one thing that Deputy Sir James Craig should realise, and the same applies to the other Deputies who believe with him on this question, and that is that Arthur Griffith stood in this country for a self-respecting, self-contained economic and Gaelic nation.  All his writings prove it; all his actions prove it.  If Deputy Sir James Craig, or anyone else here, wants to quote a man who stood for the Gaelic nation, they should give us the quotation to prove that he stood for anything else.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I am glad that Deputy Martin Conlon and Deputy McFadden brought in this Bill.  I support the Bill strongly, and I hope it will receive a large majority of the votes of this House.  And I say that if the Bill has been introduced. it is about time, that it was introduced; but better late than never.  The Deputies who brought in the Bill have done a good service; and even if they have <Col N="1280" /> not done anything but to make a section in this country, who do not believe that there is any possibility in the future of reviving this language, the section who do not believe that there is any hope in the future for the people of this Nation but to cherish a return to the Empire, realise their position, it will have done much good.  Even if this Bill only acts as a danger signal to those, it will have done good in this respect, that it will make them realise that the tide is with the Irish language. The times have changed in Ireland, and even though it is a partitioned nation to-day, some day it will be a united nation, and in that day the language will be Irish.

      <P>I have just a few words to which I wish to give expression in connection with this Bill. When I disapprove of the present policy of which this Bill is the exponent I do so entirely on educational grounds. Unfortunately many of the lines of opposition that have been taken to that policy make it difficult to keep the discussion upon this subject simply on educational grounds, and in an unbiassed way.  Some of the speeches made by the opposition to the Bill have, in fact, made the speech of the Deputy who last spoke possible.  I do not wish to discuss the general question at any great length, but I wish to put, in as clear a way as I can, what my position in the matter is.  My objection is not anti-national, whatever may be thought to the contrary.  I object entirely because I believe the policy is damaging to the education of the country.  My experience does not confirm in any respect the experience as stated by the last speaker.  My experience is that general education in the primary schools is deteriorating, and that it is having an effect upon the secondary schools also, and that that deterioration is passing from one to the other. I am in a position to judge, because I know a great deal of the kind of candidates for secondary school scholarships that come from primary schools. I repeat that my objection is not anti-national. I respect the ideals put before <Col N="1281" /> us, for instance, by the Minister for Local Government, and, if I might say so, put before us in a way I admire and heartily approve.</P>
      <P>What I regret is that it is thought, and I think wrongly thought, that there is any need of this forcing policy in order to further those ideals, or that their development will be encouraged by the forced programme this policy engenders.  I believe that is unnecessary and damaging to the State. In my opinion, language is, as I may put it, an accident of nationalism and not an essential at all.  The whole trend of the world is away from the Tower of Babel and not towards it. I see no traces of a diminishing fervour for nationalism in any quarter of the world, but I see a strong trend towards a closer union between nations, a closer means of communication. Everything is towards the conclusion that what will tend to closer communication is an advantage and anything that would tend to prevent it is a disadvantage.  I admit frankly that the opposite belief has been strengthened by extremists on both sides, but I claim because extremists on both sides agree in thinking that view wrong that their agreement does not make their view right in that respect. In my opinion, the policy of forcing the language will fail, and is failing, and the policy of forcing the language will retard and perhaps frustrate the policy of the development of the ideals which the Minister for Local Government and so many others desire.  I do not suppose I shall persuade anybody by what I am saying.  It will probably take the experience of generations to show whether I am right or wrong, but personally I am convinced that inevitable reaction will come, that the difference between force and natural growth will be plain to those who come after us, and that the next generation will suffer from this policy, which I believe to be its most damaging effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to speak at greater length on the general policy, but I would like to say a few things about the Bill before us.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that to carry out the object of the Bill this is not the right way <Col N="1282" /> of doing it.  I think consultation should have been held with the governing bodies of those two professions. I agree with Deputy Redmond and others in saying that so far as there is any demand for Irish-speaking members of the legal profession that a corresponding supply will very quickly come.  I agree with those who regard it as a serious inconsistency, on the one hand, to decry and deplore the exodus of brains and men from the country, and, on the other hand, to take steps which can only further increase that exodus.  The principal point I wish to speak about, and which has been only partially referred to already, is in reference to the standard of Irish which it is supposed this Bill will make compulsory.  Some speakers obviously believe that all that was intended was that there should be an examination of a more or less elementary character passed by those who propose to enter either of the professions.  Other speakers believe the kind of examination was one that no one could enter either of these professions but fully-qualified Irish speakers able to conduct cases in the Irish language, but I defy either to show from the Bill what standard is required.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this is one of the most extraordinary Bills ever brought into the House either by a private member or by the Government.  What does it propose to do?  I am speaking quite impersonally.  It proposes to leave in the power of one person, who cannot be challenged by this House for any action he takes, not alone the decision as to what standard of the Irish language shall be required, but any decision as to the nature of the examination that shall be passed.  It simply gives him the power of saying: &ldquo;I will not admit X to the profession of solicitor or call Y to the Bar.&rdquo;  And if anybody says: &ldquo;What is your reason?&rdquo; It is only necessary to say: &ldquo;I think he did not know enough Irish.&rdquo;  You put that power in the hands of a person who is definitely outside the criticism of this House.  That is not an accident in this Bill, and if you try to work out any other plan through the Bill you find that the provision of machinery in the <Col N="1283" /> Bill becomes extremely difficult.  Regarding it as a fundamental part of the Bill, I say that it is a thing that no democratic House ought to assent to.  I hope members, before they come to vote in favour of this Bill, as it is obvious the great majority will do, will consider to the full what the vote means in that respect.</P>

    <P>The few remarks which I desire to make in support of this Bill are made in English because it is the language the House understands best.  I entirely disagree with the suggestion put forward that a knowledge of Irish should be compulsory for membership of this House.  There is no educational standard and there is no examination of candidates at a general election. The only handicap where an intellectual standard in any way enters comes under the Electoral Act.  The persons who sit in this House sit here because the people of Ireland have sent them here.  We are now discussing quite a different matter and we should discuss it on a different basis entirely.  The necessity or the desirability of a knowledge of Irish for membership of this House has got nothing to do with it.  I support the Bill because I believe that it is desirable. I will not go as far as some Deputies have gone and say that it is necessary. I say that it is desirable&mdash;we say in five years hence, and nobody can be called to the Bar or admitted to the solicitors' profession under the age of 21&mdash;that at the end of that period persons entering the legal profession should have a knowledge of Irish.  I think it was the Minister for Justice who stated that a knowledge of English is not necessary for admission as a student to the King's Inns.  English or Irish is required.  I must say that I support the Bill for one chief reason that Irish was, and I desire it should be, the language of this country.  It is our language, and without making further apologies I should like to say that I entirely disagree with what many supporters of this Bill have said. <Col N="1284" /> The British Empire has got nothing whatever to do with this Bill.  It is very regrettable that the sentiments expressed in speeches made last week and even to-night were not realised some years ago.  It is a great pity that people did not then say: &ldquo;Cuir i bhfeidhm an polasaí nua.&rdquo;  It was a great pity that in those years it was not realised that what did happen in 1921 did give to the people of Ireland the right to decide whether or not they would have Irish.  I say this without in any way drawing up the question as regards what Deputy Brennan said about the civil war.  He said that if the civil war had not happened that the alignment in this country would have been so-and-so.  I would appeal to anyone who votes against this Bill to dissociate himself from any such thing.  I think it was Deputy Mullins who talked about the return of the British Empire. That, I presume, is a confession that the British Empire is not here, notwithstanding all that we have heard during the past six years.  We have heard to-night that Deputies who vote against this Bill will be standing for the return of the British Empire.</P>

      <P>The Irish language is a vital matter to our people and to our country.  I do not desire, as I have already said, to make this a political matter; but had not political divisions been so keen and so acute <Col N="1285" /> during the past ten or fifteen years, the Irish language would be in a better position to-day than it is.  Persons have said&mdash;and said, I must say, with a certain amount of truth&mdash;that the language revival movement has not been a success.  It is interesting to examine the causes of the absence of success&mdash;it is really the intensity and desire to give expression to political thought, especially if it is party political thought.  I happen to be very interested in the Gaeltacht.  I professionally visit the county which has the greatest number of Irish speakers, namely, the County Galway.  But when a political party&mdash;it unfortunately happens to be on the other side of the House, but that is not why I say it&mdash; wants to put its policy before the people of the capital of that county, and when they want to speak in Galway, they issue handbills saying: &ldquo;Men and women, the greatest orator since O'Connell's time is coming to address you.

We think very little of Ireland or of the Irish language when we do those things.  I say that the Irish language should be above party.  It does not belong to one political party in this country or to any particular section in this House.  That is why I appeal to members who propose to vote against this Bill to dissociate themselves from the suggestion made here to-night that it is an argument for the return of the Empire, qualified <Col N="1286" /> I am told by &ldquo;which has not gone yet.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Bill in its present form is desirable.  I desire to say that no sensible reason has been put forward in this House as to why persons who are now sixteen years of age could not and cannot, at the end of five years, have a knowledge of the Irish language sufficient to come within the description of &ldquo;a competent knowledge of Irish.&rdquo;  I agree with one suggestion that it is unfair to any individual&mdash;in this particular instance the individual is the Chief Justice, who is entirely outside the criticism of this House&mdash;to ask him to be the person who should say what is or what is not a competent knowledge, and to say whether the person has or has not that competent knowledge.  In view of the fact that sixteen years of age is the ending of the secondary school period and that persons may have left the secondary school without having studied or begun the study of Irish, I would go to this extent and ask the proposer and seconder of this Bill to accept an amendment to the effect that the age of fourteen should be substituted. Fourteen happens to be, roughly, the middle or the half-way period in the secondary school period, and it is only fair, if we insist on this question of a knowledge of Irish at the end of five years, that a person should get due notice.  Therefore, there is no question of making war on the legal profession.</P>
