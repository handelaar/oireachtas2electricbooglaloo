      <P>asked the President whether the Executive Council has under consideration any measure for the purpose of assisting farmers in the present depressed condition of agriculture and consequent depreciation in the value of land; if he is aware that farmers requiring capital to re-stock their land or carry out necessary improvements find it impossible to satisfy the demands now being made upon them in the matter of security owing to the restriction of credit by the Joint Stock Banks, and further instanced by the fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, in cases where a first mortagage on land, otherwise unencumbered, is offered, have in addition asked for the names of two solvent sureties willing to enter into a bond for the repayment of loans; and if he will state when proposals for legislation for the extension of Agricultural Credit will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) (for the President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has continuously under consideration proposals for the purpose of assisting farmers in the present depressed condition of agriculture, and has within the past few years made provision for the granting of loans to co-operative societies on easy terms, for the making of loans to co-operative creamery societies, for the re-organisation of the dairying industry, and for the establishment of the beet sugar industry, and has provided the major portion of the capital of the Agricultural Credít Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that complaints have been made to the effect that in some <Col N="1504" /> cases farmers requiring capital to re-stock their land or to carry out necessary improvements find it difficult to obtain such capital owing to the requirements of the Joint Stock Banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the matter of security.</P>
    <P>The experience of the working of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1927, is not yet sufficient to enable a sound judgment to be formed as to what extension, if any, is necessary in the provision of Agricultural Credits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'HANLON Mr. O'HANLON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the provision already made through the Agricultural Credit Act adequately covers the question of Agricultural Credits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not yet satisfied that a change is necessary.  The Act has really been a comparatively short time in operation, and certain parts of the Agricultural Credit Corporation's functions have hardly been begun, so that it is too early to judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is his intention to take steps to alleviate in some way the position of numerous farmers who are seriously indebted to the banks owing to the action of the banking policy of deflation commenced in 1921, other than by the provisions of the Land Act, 1927, or by loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which are only applicable to a small number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the only practical method of affording financial assistance to farmers who are indebted to the banks is through the medium of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and I cannot accept the statement of the Deputy that the method is applicable only to a small number of cases.  The Corporation have power to make a loan to any farmer for the purpose of paying off a loan originally made to him either for the purchase of land or for any purpose for which the Corporation may now lend, and the Corporation are prepared to give the most favourable consideration possible to all applicants.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that question, I want to ask the Minister whether it is a fact that the State intervenes as arbitrator between groups of citizens, for instance, between landlord and tenant and between capital and labour, and would the Minister not consider it advisable that the State should intervene between these particular groups of farmers and the banks. These farmers are much more numerous in the Midlands, at any rate, than he believes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state if the Agricultural Credit Corporation has yet taken steps to grant loans to farmers whose land is not vested, or who hold under temporary agreement, and, if not, whether there is any other means of helping this class of farmer, so that holdings could be improved and production increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation inform me that they have made many loans to farmers whose lands are not yet vested, and numerous other cases of this kind are under consideration where, it is hoped, loans can be made.  The Corporation are in close touch with the Irish Land Commission <Col N="1506" /> in regard to these matters, and arrangements have been made to facilitate as far as possible applicants for loans whose lands are not yet vested.</P>
      <P>As regards the cases of applicants who hold their lands only under a &ldquo;Letting for Temporary Convenience,&rdquo; it is not possible for these farmers to give a valid charge on their lands to the Corporation as security for a loan, but the Corporation are prepared in such cases to consider applications on the basis of personal security.  In addition, farmers of this class may obtain money from Agricultural Credit Societies which, as the Deputy is aware, are assisted by the loan of money from the State on easy terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is yet in a position to state when he will introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Blind Persons Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to indicate a date for the introduction of legislation.  Great difficulty has been experienced in framing provisions which would substantially meet the suggestion made by the Committee of Inquiry without either departing from the fundamental principle that the Act is to apply to blind persons or bringing in a much larger class of persons than the Committee appear to have had in mind.  A way out is, however, still being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I want to ask the Minister whether he is aware that it is over two years since he promised to introduce this legislation, and is he further aware that great hardship has been inflicted upon a number of people as a result of that delay; and will the Minister, in view of the particular type of cases affected, see what he can do to expedite the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much hardship, because the present provisions of the Act are being administered in the most favourable possible way.  Applicants on the border-line or who are doubtful cases are being most <Col N="1507" /> sympathetically considered&mdash;I mean there are no provisions being so sympathetically administered.  The great difficulty in this matter is that certain solutions which might otherwise be satisfactory would really land us into the principle of invalidity pensions, which would be a very big thing.  The Deputy will realise that once we depart from a principle that is laid down in the Act, the drawing of the line is a difficult matter; the whole question has been the subject of discussion and consideration both by my Department and the Local Government Department since or almost since.  After the promise was given there was a certain lapse during which it was not pursued, but for a considerable time past the matter has been considered between my Department and the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that Mrs. Murphy, Ballygarvan, Co. Cork, an old age pensioner, who was committed some months ago to the Mental Hospital, was at the date of her committal entitled to arrears of her old age pension, and whether payment will now be made to her husband, who is in receipt of home assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of the arrears of pension due in this case was sanctioned on 27th August, 1928, subject to the production by the pensioner's husband of the proper form of authority from the local Pension Committee, as required by Regulation 35 of the Old Age Pensions Consolidated Regulations, 1922, entitling him to receive the sums payable to his wife.</P>
      <P>The authority was not received by the Pensions Officer from the local Pension Committee until 8th October last and payment of the amount due was made on 13th October.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received a petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of the portion of the Blackwater River from a point immediately below Headfort Bridge for a distance of about 3½ miles down stream.  This scheme has been examined by the Commissioners' engineer.  From his report the scheme appears to be too expensive to be carried out, as it would cost about £35 for each acre of land improved.  The Commissioners are considering whether any alternative scheme can be suggested.</P>

The Detective Officer was engaged in making certain inquiries about the peace of the district.  I find there is no foundation for the allegation that Mr. Shanley was threatened in any way.</P>

      <P>I have received a report about this matter.  I find that on the night of October 15th the movements of Seán O'Farrell, Dromod, mentioned in the question, attracted the attention of a Detective Officer, and, in the light of other information, the Detective Officer, in the discharge of his duty, approached O'Farrell and asked him to accompany him to the local police barrack.  O'Farrell was searched and questioned as to his movements, and was then set at liberty.  I am informed there is no ground for the allegation that O'Farrell was assaulted or seriously beaten.</P>

I would like to ask the Minister is it not a fact that Mr. O'Farrell was arrested at an Irish class in the town of Dromod, arrested at a meeting of the class; that when he was arrested all the Irish books that were in use at the class were seized and taken to the barracks?  I would like also if the Minister would tell us what is his source of information to the effect that Mr. O'Farrell was not assaulted in the barracks?  Did he, for example, ask any of the fifty or sixty people in the town of Dromod who are in a position to give information as to Mr. O'Farrell's appearance after he came out of the barracks?</P>

As far as the Deputy's other question is concerned&mdash;the seizing of Irish books&mdash;that is not mentioned in the question at all, and I have no information on that matter. If the Deputy wished to get information on that subject&mdash;really wished&mdash;I apprehend he would have asked for it in the question also.</P>

      <P>On the evening of the 30th August the police received information which showed that a group of Communists were organising a hostile demonstration against the Peace Pact and against a distinguished foreign visitor. Part of the plan was to organise a procession through the streets calculated to lead to a breach of the peace.  A number of placards and sticks with offensive and treasonable inscriptions thereon were to have been carried. These are the articles which were seized.  It is not proposed to return them.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the articles seized included the roll-book of members of the club and <Col N="1513" /> a copy of a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Imperialism,&rdquo; by Eleanor Glynn&mdash;by Eleanor Byrne?  I should like the Minister to say if this pamphlet is considered seditious matter likely to be distributed amongst the people of this country? Is it a pamphlet which requires suppression in the interests of the progress of the Free State Ministry?  Is that a policy which they have set out upon? I would like also to refer to cardboard posters.  This demonstration was being organised under the auspices of the Connolly Workers' Club&mdash;call it a Communist demonstration if you will. There is no law that I am aware of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is the Connolly Workers' Club not at liberty to organise demonstrations to propagate their point of view as advanced thinkers in the working-class movement?  I would like the Minister also to inform us if it is the intention to have the pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Imperialism&rdquo; suppressed?</P>

      <P>As far as the pamphlet to which the Deputy alludes is concerned, I have never seen it, and therefore cannot express any views upon it.  As to whether this was a Communist procession or not, I derived that information from the nature of the placards seized, containing phrases like, &ldquo;Up Red Russia!&rdquo;&ldquo;Long Live Soviet Russia!&rdquo; etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been called to a report in the Press as to statements regarding &ldquo;speeding&rdquo; by buses, made by the District Justice at Julianstown, County Meath, District Court on Saturday, 3rd November, in the case of Superintendent Kelly v. Edward O'Hare, Newry; whether, in view of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the control and regulation of Road Traffic regarding the speed for heavy motor vehicles, it is the intention of the Gárda Authorities not to prosecute motor bus drivers in future unless the speed exceeds 25 miles per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in the Press of the case mentioned by the Deputy and I have consulted the Minister for Local Government and Public Health who, on consideration of the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Road Traffic, is of opinion that in certain circumstances a speed of 25 miles per hour is not excessive for a single deck omnibus.  I intend accordingly to issue instructions to the Gárda Síochána not to prosecute in future in such cases on the sole ground that the speed of the omnibus exceeded 20 miles per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand for the future that it is the opinion of the Minister for Local Government that counts rather than the existing law? Is the Minister aware that the justice in this instance had three cases before him against the same individual&mdash; Edward O'Hare, of Newry; that he refused to convict in two cases where it was proved that he travelled at speeds of 22.5 and 21.42; and that he imposed a penalty of 10/- in the case where the speed exceeded 25 miles, and gave <Col N="1515" /> definite instructions to the police not to prosecute in future except the speed exceeded that limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>A District Justice is not in a position to give definite instructions to the police. The legal speed limit for 'buses at present is 20 miles per hour.  The Deputy is under a misapprehension as regards that, as he mentioned that it was 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the speed exceeded 20 miles by a very small fragment, as the Deputy will see&mdash;a mile or something like that.  Undoubtedly, at present, as the law stands, if these 'buses are driven at over 20 miles per hour, just like any ordinary motor car, there is an infringement of the law; but the Statute law very often lags behind actual requirements, and I think it is the general requirement of the community that 'buses of this nature should be allowed to travel at a reasonable speed, and 25 miles is the reasonable speed which has been recommended. We may be forestalling legislation by a very short period, but the Deputy must be aware of the fact that a great number of Acts have already fallen into disuse.  To take an extreme example: to sell ice cream on a Sunday is an offence.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand that if the Minister says it is right for licensed traders to remain open until 11 o'clock at night the justices will not be entitled to impose a penalty, even if the law says that they should close at 10?</P>

It was reported that the claimant owned and resided on a farm of 100 acres (poor law valuation £13 17s. 6d.) carrying the usual stock.  The pensioner was allowed the usual opportunity of submitting evidence on his own behalf.  He failed, however, to do so, and on 13th December, 1926, as it was not clear that his means were within the statutory limit the question for the stoppage of the pension was allowed.</P>

      <P>Since the transfer of the Land Commission to the Free State Government on 31st March, 1923, 712 holdings in Co. Meath, comprising 32,384 acres, have been vested under the Land Acts, including 304 under the Acts 1923-7.  The work of checking, surveying and inspection preparatory to vesting the remaining holdings under the Acts 1923-7 is being proceeded with as rapidly as possible, and a further 790 holdings, comprising 42,078 acres or thereabouts, have already been gazetted for vesting as soon as the statutory requirements have been complied with, and any questions as to area, occupancy, title, turbary rights, &amp;c., have been determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I view with great alarm the amount which the Minister for Justice is seeking for the upkeep of the police force in this country, considering that the farmers are the principal contributors of the rates and taxes. Every farmer Deputy knows well that the farmers principally depend on their harvest to pay their rates and annuities to the Land Commission.  What do we find this year after the harvest has been cut?  One of the most deplorable and lamentable harvests in the country for a number of years.  Our oats crop is not half what it used to be; our barley is practically unsold and our potato crop is twenty per cent. less than the previous year.  I doubt if, in the coming season, we shall have any seed to put into our ground; cattle are unsaleable at present and the farmers, the principal contributors to this huge Estimate, are asked to shoulder another burden of taxation while they are <Col N="1538" /> already groaning under taxation of a similar kind.  Personally speaking, I have nothing whatever to say against the Guards of this country.  To my mind, they are as fine a body of men, both in physique and ability, as you can get in any other country in the world, but when we come to consider that we have to foot a bill of £1,588,373 and take into consideration the deplorable plight of the misfortunate farmers, I say without fear of contradiction, that a great portion of this Estimate could be reduced, by reducing the police forces in the rural districts of the country.  I know they have often being called on to do unpleasant duties such as assisting the sheriff's officers in collecting land annuities and other debts.  I know some of them, if they had their own choice, would refrain from doing this work.  Nevertheless, when we consider the deplorable state of the farmers while they are already groaning under taxation, I say the Minister for Justice should go more minutely into the details of this Estimate before putting such a burden on the ratepayers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question with reference to barley was raised here last week by Deputy Corry.  I heard the Minister for Agriculture say that it was time for the farmers to change their system of farming. I say that it is time for the Government to change their system of farming by cutting down such Estimates as this by at least thirty to fifty per cent.  I also heard Deputy Corry saying that there was a police barracks going to be built in his parish that would cost £1,500.  I have not much to say to that, because a great deal of this money will go into the artisans' pockets and to a great extent relieve their families.  There is one thing for which Deputy Corry should feel relieved. When he is up here in the Dáil advocating the cause of the down-trodden and oppressed the Guards would keep an eye on his farm and keep away those light-fingered gentlemen who are becoming noticeable lately making raids on farm houses.  At all events, as I said before, when this Estimate will pass this House and when the farmers will see that they have shouldered the burden of £1,588,373, when they are <Col N="1539" /> already groaning under the weight of taxation, it will be such a shock and a strain on their nerves that there will be many sudden and unprovided deaths in the Saorstát.  I think it is time for the Ministers in charge of every Department in this Government to reduce their Estimates to such an extent as the people of the country will be able to bear.</P>

They are, and always will be, a living tribute to the memory of the late Minister for Justice, who was responsible for their successful establishment. During the course of this debate unfair criticism and, in one case at least, untrue statements have been made about them.  I refer particularly to the statement of Deputy Kennedy which appears in the Official Debates of 1st November, page 1400.  On that occasion Deputy Kennedy asked: &ldquo;Is the Minister aware that a certain superintendent in the Midlands spent a fortnight before the last two elections addressing envelopes in Cumann na nGaedheal headquarters, and that his car was at the disposal of Cumann na nGaedheal on election day?&rdquo; Mr. Hogan in reply said: &ldquo;I am not aware of it.&rdquo;  Mr. Kennedy added: &ldquo;I am aware of it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Very well.  It was at my request that the superintendent of the Civic Guard came to the election rooms, and the reason I was obliged to get him tó come was that motor cars which were outside the Cumann na <Col N="1540" /> nGaedheal rooms on the night before were slashed with knives, the tyres were cut, and the cars were punctured, and my own car was also interfered with, so that I, amongst others, had to walk home.  The reason I brought the superintendent with other Guards there was to prevent a recurrence of that kind of blackguardism and not to address envelopes.  Deputy Kennedy has also stated that the superintendent's car was used on election day by Cumann na nGaedheal headquarters. The car is a two-seater Morris-Cowley, and the statement that it was used by Cumann na nGaedheal headquarters is also without a shadow of foundation. In view of the statement which I have made I think Deputy Kennedy ought to withdraw what is really a slander. He made that statement here in a privileged place where the superintendent cannot answer.  Before proceeding further I will ask him to withdraw.  I will also read a statement made by the constituency director of Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
      <P>The Superintendent of the Guards visited the Cumann na nGaedheal election rooms at my request.  I sent word, asking him to call, as I wished to see what could be done to prevent the slashing of the tyres of cars left outside our offices by voluntary helpers.</P>
      <P>He prevented a recurrence of this by having the vicinity of the offices patrolled each night, and calling at our offices frequently to satisfy himself that there were no complaints.</P>
      <P>Regarding the allegation that the Superintendent put his car at the disposal of electors on election day, it so happens that his car (which was a two-seater, and consequently of little use to carry electors to the booths) was on each polling day employed by himself personally visiting the different booths throughout his area, in the ordinary discharge of his duty.</P>
      <P>On no occasion did the Superintendent either write envelopes or in any way whatsoever help in our election rooms, or assist the work of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> The above statement I am prepared to testify on oath if necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say anything further than to ask the Deputy in view of that statement to withdraw what is a foul slander without a shadow of foundation.  I have the greatest pleasure in supporting this Vote, which is an assurance that the peace which now exists in the country will be continued.</P>

      <P>Very well, to prevent a recurrence of it.  I agree with Deputy Jordan and Deputy Kent that the number of barracks could be diminished in the country and the cost of the force reduced.  I will give one example.  There is a place which Deputy Shaw knows well, the Crazy-Corner Barracks.  Deputy Shaw will agree that there is not a more Cumann na nGaedheal spot in Westmeath than that.  The ballot box that comes in from there is always a delight to Cumann na nGaedheal.  That barracks is situated in a rural place.  There is not a house within half a mile of it.  There is an unoccupied demesne opposite it, and the Guards simply rusticate there from one end of the year <Col N="1542" /> to the other.  The traffic problem, to which Deputy Gorey referred, does not exist there.  It is only a few miles from Mullingar, so that with increased transport facilities the district could be served by means of a motor car from Mullingar and there would be no need to have a barracks in such a place. That holds good in a great number of cases up and down the country.  I am not going to reiterate the statements made from these benches.  Indeed, I did not mean to speak at all on this Vote were it not for Deputy Shaw's reference to the slashed tyres.</P>

      <P>The Vote before the House is one of the most important of the Votes which come up for discussion here.  It represents one of the major activities of government, the preservation of law and order, and, at the same time, it involves the expenditure of a considerable portion of the taxpayers' money.  Considering its importance, I would have expected from the Opposition Benches criticism of the Vote in a more sensible and constructive fashion than we have heard.  I have listened to the criticism coming from the Opposition Benches, and I have heard statements put forward that in the interests of economy and in the interests of the preservation of existing social services, or the extension of future social services, reductions could be effected in the amount expended on the maintenance of the Gárdaí.  I expected to hear one Deputy, at least, on the Opposition Benches entering into a detailed and exhaustive analysis of the Vote and pointing out where at least one pound could be saved.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ruttledge and other Deputies mentioned that on a former occasion I and other Deputies proposed an amendment that the Vote should be reduced.  In one case we moved for a reduction of £400,000 and in another something like £126,000.  We were twitted with not being prepared to follow up our arguments on that occasion.  I would have expected that Deputy Ruttledge and his Party who claim that this Vote could and ought to be reduced, would at least have taken pains to put forward an amendment showing where reductions might be made.  If the Deputy, when he went to the trouble of reading the previous debates, had examined the amendments put forward from the benches on which I sat on that occasion he would have noticed that our proposals embraced two aspects.  The first aspect was that in respect of the pay, allowances and upkeep of the Gárdai.  We maintained that certain economies could be effected in that direction.  The other aspect was in regard to the numbers and strength of the Gárdai, and we maintained that the condition of the country was such that it was not necessary to maintain such a number of effective Gárdai.  When putting forward those amendments we, at least, went to the trouble of getting facts and figures and attempting to substantiate the facts and standing over them. The amendment of ex-Deputy Wilson showed that a considerable amount of examination had been given to the Police Votes in this and other countries, and, speaking on behalf of the farmers, he put forward definite constructive suggestions for a reduction of the Vote.  On that occasion Mr. Wilson was speaking on behalf of a Party of 15, a Party which had very small financial resources. Deputies from the benches opposite are speaking on behalf of a Party of 57.  I presume that all the members of that Party are not front bench men and are not extremely busy.  Therefore, I believe it would be possible for members of that Party, if they really believed that definite economies could be effected and <Col N="1544" /> definite cuts made in this Vote, to examine it in detail, and having done so to put the opinions and conclusions they had formed before the House. That would give the House as a whole an opportunity of considering the question whether or not such cuts or economics could be effected, and whether if any constructive proposals were submitted they could be employed. But the Party opposite has done nothing of the kind.  Instead, they have uttered sweeping generalities, sometimes accompanied by semi-veiled charges, against the members of the Gárda Síochána.  In that connection it is to be observed that attacks of that kind were very few.  From almost every side of the House there was general appreciation of the good work done by the Guards, and I personally want to associate myself with the words of appreciation spoken in that connection.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that, physically, we have the best police force in the world, and that, intellectually, mentally and morally, we have a police force equal to that in any other part of the world. That always has been my opinion, but at the same time I should like to say this: that we must not regard the police force as above criticism.  I feel, and always have felt, that our police force, however good it is, and it is very good, has certain imperfections.  As a new force, raised up, one might say, from the ground, on a foundation that, at the time, had no existing personnel as regards officers and in very large numbers, it was bound to have certain defects. That might be expected in such a force, taking into account the conditions under which it was raised and the conditions that existed in the country during the period that it was being recruited.  I think, in view of all these circumstances, that we can heartily congratulate ourselves, and also congratulate the officers in charge on the wonderfully effective police force which they have produced.  I believe that it is a force that will improve from day to day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to how reductions might be effected in the cost and strength of the force, we might, as I have already <Col N="1545" /> pointed out, have expected that members on the benches opposite would have put forward certain constructive proposals&mdash;proposals of the nature that we put forward and that we might expect them to put forward.  I, personally, am deeply interested in this matter, but as, at the moment, I am engaged in dealing with the aspect of this question of reduction of expenditure, I must regard this particular matter as being sub judice.  I am a member of an Economy Committee which is dealing with the question of economy in all departments of State. Doubtless at some period of our deliberations the Vote that is now under discussion will come up for consideration before us.  I had hoped, but my hope has been in vain, that I would have got in the course of this debate some indication of lines to work along in effecting economies.  I regard any indications of help given in that direction in the course of this debate as being absolutely negligible.</P>
    <P>On the occasion that I have referred to the Party to which I then belonged brought forward a motion the effect of which was that the strength of the Gárda Síochána force should be reduced, and the cost for its maintenance, etc, by the sum of £400,000.  When that motion was moved, we pointed out that the sum indicated had not been arrived at after any close examination of the figures that went to make up the total amount of the Vote, but that we put forward a figure mainly in the nature of a token Vote, arrived at in a rough and haphazard manner so as to give us an opportunity of stating our views as well as an opportunity to the then Minister for Justice of stating his views on the question of the permanent maintenance of the Gárda Síochána force at its high level and strength.  On that occasion I put forward certain opinions which I held then, and still hold to a very considerable extent.  The statement made at the time by the then Minister for Justice led us to modify our views to the extent that we did not put our motion to a division.  Apart from that fact, later happenings which followed almost immediately after the discussion of our motion led me to modify my views to a certain extent and to <Col N="1546" /> realise that, although it may not be advisable to retain a permanent police force at its present numbers in this country, the conditions then existing were such that I could not stand up and recommend a reduction in the strength of the force.  Within a few weeks of the discussion on that motion the sad duty was cast upon me of forming one of the party that walked after the funerals of two members of the Gárda Síochána. One of them was shot in my own county at a place called Hollyfort.  The other Guard was shot in another county.  I then began to reconsider my position. I felt that I could not honestly put my hand on my heart and say &ldquo;The conditions in this country are such that we can, at the present time, reduce the strength of the force,&rdquo; and I began to have my doubts about the matter.  I want to say that the slayers of those two Guards have never been apprehended.</P>
    <P>At a later date in the following year I had again to give very serious thought to the motion which we then put forward as to whether we would be justified in asking to have the strength of the force reduced.  I had the sad and unhappy duty cast upon me of following the funeral cortege of the very Minister for Justice who had defended the Vote for this force in the Dáil on the occasion that our motion was discussed, the Minister who argued for the retention of the force at its old level.  Having taken part in that sad cortege, I again felt that I could not put my hand on my heart and say that I honestly believed that the conditions then existing in this country were such that we could at once proceed to reduce the strength of our police force.  Again, I may point out that the perpetrators of that deed are still at large.  I still believe, however, that the strength of the police force that we have in this country is too large for the requirements of the country.  Taking into account the economic conditions of the country as they exist to-day, as has been pointed out by Deputy Kent and others, I believe that the burden which the maintenance of this force casts upon the main taxpayers of the country, who are the farmers, is too much.  We must, however, take into <Col N="1547" /> account whether the conditions that exist at present, and are likely to exist in the future, are such that the strength of the force can be reduced.  Personally, I have doubts as to whether we would be justified in saying that the conditions that at present exist are normal and are such that the strength of the force can be reduced.  I believe that we have not yet developed a sense of civic responsibility, of the necessity for co-operating with the guardians of law and order, or a sense of personal responsibility in the maintenance of law and order such as would enable us to guarantee that we can carry on with a smaller police force than we have at present.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies on the opposite benches are really anxious, and I believe they are, to reduce the force, because apart from any question of political propaganda they must know as everybody in touch with the conditions in the country knows, that a reduction in the strength of the police force for economic reasons is essential, then they should try and create an atmosphere and a sense of civic spirit which would make the ordinary man realise that the police force is not the force of a Party but the force of the Government and of the country, and that it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen to offer help to the police when his assistance is required.  When that day has arrived, when the sense of civic responsibility has grown to such an extent that the people will freely and willingly give their aid to the police, then the question of a reduction in the strength of the police force might be considered, but it would be too soon to consider it before that.  I am of opinion that it would be unwise, both in the interests of economy and of the future social and political welfare of the country, that the force should be stereotyped at its present numbers.  I think the day will and must come when we can bring the policing of this country and the observance of law and order in line with that which exists in other countries.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that two conflicting points of view exist on this subject. We should take a definite side in regard <Col N="1548" /> to these views.  One view is that the police force should be maintained at its present strength, and that if duties are not there for the police to perform then duties must be provided for them.  Measures passed by this Dáil have added to the duties cast on the police, which increased the necessity for the maintenance of the present strength of that force.  Extra duties have arisen out of the development in transport conditions in the way of regulation of traffic.  Then new Acts, such as the School Attendance Act, have the effect of imposing additional duties upon the police.  As I have said, there is that point of view, that because of these extra duties cast on the police they must be maintained at their present strength.  On the other hand, it is said that instead of throwing on the shoulders of the police new duties from time to time we should avoid doing anything of the kind, and that as conditions improve the numbers of the police force should be reduced to a number commensurate with the capacity of the country to maintain.  I hold that view. I hold that we should not stereotype and make permanent the existing strength of the force.  I think both from the point of view of economy, and the point of view of the political and social welfare of the country, it would be well that people should learn there is a certain responsibility cast on them as citizens for the observance of the law and the maintenance of order, and that the man who gives information to the police now cannot be regarded, as he too often was in the past, as an informer and a renegade to his own people.</P>
    <P>Certain criticisms were put forward from the opposite benches with regard to the political activities of the Gárda Síochána.  I gathered that those criticisms generally did not apply to the uniformed forces, though certain criticisms were made of the uniformed force tending to associate them with political activities.  I do not think that was a widespread opinion, but it was definitely put forward from the opposite benches that members of the non-uniformed force were acting as political agents.  It seems to me that is a simple matter.  It depends upon the <Col N="1549" /> question of what is political.  If the activities of the Guards are confined to carrying out their normal duties I cannot see how their use in that connection could be regarded as taking part in political activities.  If political activities mean the building up of secret organisations for the purpose of using force and attaining ends which certain parties wished to attain, certainly it is the duty of the C.I.D., or of the uniformed force, to take all the steps they can to get information regarding such activities.  It was suggested that owing to activities of members of the C.I.D. freedom of speech was not allowed at the elections.  I happened to be a candidate for election on many occasions.  I was first a candidate on behalf of the Farmers' Party, and later a candidate of that Party when it had entered into alliance with the existing Government Party.  When I was a Farmers' candidate pure and simple I never had the slightest difficulty in making myself heard.</P>

At the last election, when it became known that I was appearing as a member of a Party in alliance with the Government Party, I immediately began to encounter organised obstruction, which consisted of noise and interruptions that prevented me from being heard.  There were no C.I.D. at those meetings, for I had not previously given notice that I intended to hold these meetings.  One of my supporters was assaulted at one of these meetings. I went to his rescue, and I was physically assaulted when I did so.  I believe I would not have had the slightest possibility of conducting the election campaign without the help I afterwards got from the uniformed Guards and the C.I.D.  That was my experience.  I am convinced that only for the support I got from the police I would have received the same treatment in 1928 as in 1922.</P>

Until that feeling disappears we will not have freedom of speech unless we have protection.  In that matter, as in many others connected with the welfare of the country, and from the point of view of the future of this force and its cost, I say that there is an onus and a responsibility cast on all Parties in the House, and that not the least, but perhaps to the greatest extent, the responsibility for endeavouring to inculcate the necessary civic spirit, which will make it possible to reduce the force, lies with the people on the opposite benches.</P>

      <P>I do not want to criticise the Guards in any way.  I do not come into contact with them very much.  I have always found them very satisfactory.  I want to know on this Vote if the Minister for Justice will clarify in some degree the position regarding the speed of motor buses and the instructions given to the Guards. Deputy Davin asked a question to-day, <Col N="1551" /> and I gathered that the Minister stated that the legal speed of buses is twenty miles an hour, but that he does not wish that prosecutions should be instituted unless buses exceed 25 miles an hour.  I do not know if that is what the Minister stated, but perhaps when replying he will let the House know what instructions were given, because some buses travel over forty miles an hour.  A case occurred the other day where a man was not fined for travelling at forty miles an hour, and I am afraid, from what the Minister said, the bus drivers will take it that they are free to go at any rate they wish, as long as they do not travel to the danger of the public.  There is another small matter that I want to refer to.  Some time ago about 250 Guards went to Rome.  I know that they went at their own expense and there is no objection to that, but if they were all drawn from the Dublin area it would seem to suggest that there may be too many Guards in Dublin.  Possibly they were drawn from all parts of the country, and that they were on their ordinary leave.  If not, it looks as if we had too many Guards in Dublin.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion on this Vote I made some suggestions. I do not think they have been acted upon since, possibly because they did not deserve to be acted upon. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has referred to the duties performed by the Civic Guards in addition to their police duties.  When he is replying, I would like to know from the Minister if it is the policy to extend the inclusion of other duties besides police duties to the Civic Guards.  To my mind, they would make admirable health inspectors, rate collectors and perform duties under different Acts, such as the National Health Insurance Act. Many of these offices to which I refer are whole-time offices and are discharged by men long beyond the state of physical fitness at which they could efficiently discharge them.  The Civic Guards, in addition to being a fairly well educated body of men, possess a very high standard of physical fitness, and if that physical <Col N="1552" /> fitness with their discipline, intelligence and general training was put at the disposal of the local authorities it would work towards economy in this Vote.  I want no officials dismissed or placed on pension, but according as vacancies would arise the positions might be filled by Civic Guards.  The duties would not take up all the time of the Guards.  I do not believe they would interfere with the discharge of their police duties proper at all.  The Guards would be going through the country discharging one duty and they would be also able to discharge their police duties.  Already the Guards have done very good work, work that would go far to justify some of the expenditure.  We know the work they do with regard to sheep dipping, the prevention of sheep scab, and also when there are outbreaks of foot and mouth disease.  I do not want to detract from those who are mainly responsible for discharging these duties, the veterinary surgeons in the Department of Agriculture, but certainly under the direction of the veterinary surgeons the Civic Guards have done excellent work. I would like if the Minister, on the first time that I have addressed a question to him since he came into office with regard to this Vote, would indicate if he would adopt the policy of extending the work of the Guards in the way I suggested on every possible occasion.</P>

      <P>In rising to oppose this Vote, despite the pessimistic speech of Deputy Heffernan, I am fortified by no less an authority than the editor of the newspaper which has the largest circulation in southern Ireland. I am sure Deputy Heffernan will agree that it is just as staunch a defender of Saorstát Eireann and the Government, and just as staunch an advocate of the return of peaceful conditions in that territory, as himself or anyone else.  It said in the leading article on Saturday last that a substantial reduction could be made in the numbers of the force.  I think the Minister for Justice should sit up and take note, because after all the power of the Press is great.  I am not going to traverse the road travelled by many Deputies in their criticism of this Vote.  I think nearly <Col N="1553" /> all that could be said on it has been said, but I would like to support the argument that there are too many barracks, and that, as Deputy Micheal O Clerigh stated, it seems to be the policy of the Government to blaze a trail throughout the country on the lines of the old Royal Irish Constabulary barracks, that everywhere the old R.I.C. had an outpost it is the policy of the Ministry to ensure that there shall be outposts of Saorstát Eireann set up as Civic Guard barracks.  The suggestion for the elimination of some barracks should commend itself to the Minister. The Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána has been abroad recently, and I am certain that his experience of police forces on the continent will be at the disposal of the Minister in framing any new policy with regard to this matter.  The suggestion with regard to motor cycle patrols is one that certainly could be put into effect and insure a saving in the cost of transport, and the cost of barracks in different areas.  There are certainly too many Guards.  In the town that I come from we have a Gárda barracks.  It is a very law-abiding town, and there has not been a serious crime in it for the last fifteen years.  I think that three Guards would be quite sufficient for that district, but there are nine.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why there could not be a reduction.  All this talk of Deputy Heffernan's with regard to the creation of a civic spirit is all so much bosh, and Deputy Heffernan knows it. I am not going to attack the Gárda Síochána.  I want to state my belief that they are a splendid body of men. I want to say that I have found them, in my dealings with them, in the main, courteous and ready to oblige on every possible occasion, but I want to state also that, just as in the case of every flock, there are certain black sheep among them and it would be well if the Minister would take his courage in his hands and get rid of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief point I want to make in connection with this Vote is in regard to the gentlemen who have been described as the auxiliary police force, more familiarly known to us as the C.I.D.  There is an item in the Estimate <Col N="1554" /> for the maintenance and running expenses of the detective branch transport outside Dublin.  It was £1,440 last year, but it is down a little this year, since they caught Con Healy, I suppose, but the fact remains that that item is accounted for, and I am certain the Minister for Justice knows it is accounted for, mostly by the political activities of this force.  During the past few days there has been a wholesale series of raids, searches, arrests and hold-ups throughout the twenty-six counties.  I should like the Minister to inform us&mdash;because it might come in handy&mdash;if he has got any information as to whether there is another Gunpowder Plot, or any Bolshevik plot, since we do not recognise Russia, or what is the meaning of this recrudescence of raids, arrests and searches which has been taking place throughout the country over the last week-end. Down in Bantry, in portion of my constituency&mdash;a very law-abiding and a very peaceful district&mdash;the C.I.D. commenced raids on Saturday night, and in some of the cases I think the raids were not finished until Monday night. Despite Deputy Heffernan's appeal to us to create a civic spirit, the men who were held up and searched were all executive officers of the West Cork Comhairle Dáil Ceanntar of Fianna Fáil, and one raid occupied something like two and a half hours.  This raid was on the house of a man who was a Fianna Fáil candidate at the last general election.  As I said, the district is a peaceful one, and so disgusted were the members of the local authority of that town that on Monday night, at the meeting of the Bantry Town Commissioners, at which was present a Cumann na nGaedheal County Councillor, the following resolution was passed unanimously:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That we, the members of the Bantry Town Commissioners, protest against the provocative action of the Civic Guards and C.I.D. in raiding the houses of members of this body and houses of respectable citizens, as we consider such raids so carried out in this peaceful district are unnecessary and not conducive to the peace of the locality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> That copies of this resolution be sent to the Press and our local T.D.'s.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan has appealed to us to play our part in creating a civic spirit.  Those men whose houses have been raided in the last few days were doing their best to create a civic spirit. They belonged to a constitutional movement, so described, and they have taken an active part in this organisation since its inception.  No case whatsoever has been made out for raids on their houses. These raids have taken place in the twenty-six counties during the last week-end on the houses of prominent Fianna Fáil supporters and of prominent Fianna Fáil election organisers. A telegram received from Sligo, which Deputy Holt mentioned a few moments ago, referred to the raids that took place in Sligo during the week-end as follows:&mdash;</P>

Brown, seconded by Michael Nevin: That we, the members of the Sligo Corporation in meeting assembled, desire to enter our protest against the manner in which raids on the citizens of this town are being carried out by the authorities, and that this protest be wired to the T.D.'s for the area.</P>
    <P>Passed, Alderman Jinks dissenting.</P>
    <P>I presume Alderman Jinks did not want any information to leak out as regards the little transaction he was implicated in twelve months ago.  To-day, in the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; which is pretty reliable as far as this sort of thing goes, we find that Munster, Connaught and Leinster were the scenes of operations over the week-end by the auxiliary police force known as the C.I.D.  Towns as far apart as Killarney, Tralee, Charleville, Kenmare, Daingean, Dungarvan, Wexford, and Ballina were raided and searches were made for documents and arms, I suppose. In Ballina the excuse given for the raids on every Republican house in the town was that the barracks were attacked, the C.I.D. evidently forgetting that it was Guy Fawkes night and that somebody may have used a slap-bang to irritate somebody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> The main point with regard to this whole position is that the C.I.D. are the cause of a tremendous amount of friction, and it is the common belief that they are being retained to ensure that peaceful conditions shall not come about.  They are an undisciplined force. Incidents that took place from Cork to Donegal during the past four years have definitely proved that beyond contradiction. The C.I.D. are a force which have not had the training of the Gárda Síochána; they are a force which are armed with guns, and guns in the hands of undisciplined men are very dangerous weapons, especially in this country.  The Minister should give us some information&mdash;I think the House is entitled to it&mdash;with regard to the series of raids, arrests and hold-ups during the week-end.  Some months ago when the Vote on Account was taken, I protested against the activities of that force at the burial of a Republican soldier in West Cork.  I stated then&mdash; and I want to state it again&mdash;that the only possibility of creating any sort of civic spirit of the type that Deputy Heffernan speaks of, the only possibility of ensuring that the police force will be respected, is to take from them every appearance of being an adjunct of the political organisation which controls the present Government.  The only possibility of making them a force which the people will look up to as one which merits their support and assistance in the apprehension of wrong-doers, the only way in which they can be made a force which everybody will assist by giving information of crimes, is by taking from them all appearances of being a political auxiliary to the present Government, and the C.I.D. are certainly that.</P>
    <P>There is only one other thing that I should like to say, and that is that this talk about civic spirit, about looking up to the police force, and all that, is all right, but it is my firm conviction that you will never have that civic spirit of which Deputy Heffernan speaks while this country is unfree and until a free Irish nation exists in place of the partitioned remnant of what was once Ireland. But until that comes about there <Col N="1557" /> is no reason why a genuine effort should not be made to ensure that the police force, for which the Irish taxpayers are paying, should be efficient and should receive the co-operation of the people in its lawful duties.  Its lawful duties do not include the hunting down of Republicans because of their political opinions; its lawful duties do not include the irritation of election workers in an organisation in opposition to that of the Government, and its lawful duties do not include searches, raids and arrests, and the constant persecution of certain people against whom no evidence of any degree has been or can be produced.  I should like the Minister to state whether he has any information of any plots to overthrow the State, or whether he has received any information that there is to be an invasion of Bolsheviks, of whom he seems to be very much afraid.  I should like him to state whether or not it is a fact that the gentlemen of the C.I.D. have certain definite instructions to keep a tally of the movements of prominent and active Republican workers in different areas, and whether, in keeping that tally, they have not often got out of hand and done things which reflected discredit on the force and which make the title &ldquo;C.I.D.&rdquo; stink in the nostrils of every honest Irishman.</P>

      <P>I am in thorough agreement with this Vote, and I desire to emphasise the efficient and courteous manner in which the Guards discharge their duties to everybody.  I do believe that the Guards recognise their responsibilities to every person in the State, irrespective of what the political views of people may be.  That is my experience of the Guards, even at election times.  I never observed anything but independence amongst them.  Unlike the case mentioned by Deputy Heffernan, in my district the Guards never have to intervene, because the political parties there are about fifty-fifty; they are just about able for one another without any interference from the Guards.</P>

      <P>It has been said that the Guards go out of their way to assist the Cumann na nGaedheal candidates. They do not go out of their way, and my experience of them is that they are quite independent.  Their greatest opponent in the House here, who comes from East Cork, must admit that.  It has been pointed out by Deputy Hennessy that it would be well if the members of the force were allowed to travel a little outside their every-day duties. I remember that six months ago a sergeant of the Guards travelled six miles and met me in the town of Fermoy. He told me, in my capacity as a member of the Home Assistance Board, of a family in distress.  He found out on his beat that a family living on the mountainside was in distress.  He and I immediately got that family relief. We went to the relieving officer and he saw that necessaries were at once given to the poor people on the mountainside. The action of the sergeant is one that will commend itself.  He went outside his duties, strictly speaking, but his action on that occasion was certainly commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to reduce the numbers of the force.  To my mind, nobody but the people of the country, by their conduct, can reduce the numbers of the force.  When the people as a whole recognise that the Guards are a national force belonging to no political party, that they are the servants of the country, and that it is the bounden duty of the people to assist the Guards, then the time will come when a reduction will be possible.  When a proper civic spirit is shown in this country it will be time for the Government to contemplate by how many they can reduce the strength of the Civic Guards. Until there is a strong civic spirit in the country you cannot reduce the <Col N="1559" /> force with any safety.  We are told that the Guards are an expensive force, but I hold that they are giving good value to those who pay for them. They are a protection for the people, and some of the people in the country districts especially are delighted to see the Guards coming around in the evening time.</P>

      <P>The publicans are fixed and there is no necessity for the Civic Guards to look after them.  Some Deputies say there are wrong-doers in the force.  Perhaps there are.  There are wrong-doers in every section of the community, even here; a great many Deputies would not be here only they were, and that is what brought them here.  My experience of the wrong-doers in the force is that they are immediately punished and put out of the force.  In that way you have a truly Irish force, and you have as well-disciplined a force now as you have in any other country.  We can truthfully say that we are proud of our force just as they are in other countries.  In recent years a certain revolution in the way of traffic took place.  You now have buses flying here and there through the country, getting around dangerous corners, and so on, and the Guards have to look after the children to prevent them being run over.  Every court day you have prosecutions for driving at high speed, for over-crowding, etc.  At the moment I will not say anything about the other circumstances. Certain things are beginning to wear away&mdash;at least some of the other circumstances that made it necessary to maintain the force.</P>

If there is a real effort to be made to reduce the force, that can only be done at the hands of the people.  Let them look upon the force as a national force, <Col N="1560" /> as the servants of the people, and not the servants of one party; let them assist the Guards, and let the criminals know that the people are behind law and order in this country, and in that way you will go far to stamp out the criminal; in that way you will do a lot towards reducing the force to such numbers as will only be necessary in a country where you have got back to the real law that should be established long ago, at least for the last three years.</P>

      <P>I was reported last week, I think it was on Thursday, as having spoken on this particular Vote, and I was reported as having criticised the action of the Civic Guards with reference to the tearing down of posters.  Fortunately, in my constituency there does not appear to have been a great deal of that, and when it did take place I think it took place more through enthusiasm perhaps on both sides.  As far as I know, the Gárda Síochána have conducted themselves, at least in my constituency, with honour and credit.  But as to the other department, the C.I.D. as it is popularly known, I must say that they seem to be a body of men without any responsibility.  There does not seem to be any particular control or head over that body.  I do not know of any more dangerous machine in the State than the plain-clothes constables or detectives of that description. Countries a good deal older than ours find considerable difficulty in managing that machine.  I believe that a good deal more attention, care and precautions should be taken in manipulating this particular machine. Otherwise we may drift, one of those days, into rather dangerous channels. I have seen in the papers to-day reports of numerous raids all over this country.  I wonder what is at the bottom of these raids?  Are they necessary, or is there any particular head who has to order such raids?  I want to draw the attention of the House, and the people of Ireland in particular, to the effect in foreign countries of such <Col N="1561" /> raiders and such raids.  We are a nation who are hungry for capital. You are constantly listening in this House to pleas made for credit in the case of farmers who are in such a pitiable plight.  We had such pleas even to-day.  Except credit can be got inside the country, it will certainly be difficult to get it outside if such raids continue.  I believe that it is necessary, therefore, that some substantial reasons be given for these raids.</P>
      <P>With reference to the numbers of the Gárda, I want to say that Deputies are well aware that the constituency from which I come is not overpopulated. Certainly to the passer-by the number of Gárdaí employed there seems to be altogether out of proportion to the number of the people.  I believe that substantial reductions can be made in the Gárda, at least in my constituency.</P>
      <P>As regards the activities of the Gárda, there are a few points that I would like to bring before the Minister for Justice, for his own information. One particular point is the control of traffic.  My country is a county that has large tracts depopulated. Motorists from perhaps other counties are inclined to what they call speeding when passing through that county.  I believe that some attention should be paid to that. As far as the remarks made by Deputy Heffernan about the Gárda not having the necessary respect&mdash;that the necessary respect is not there for the Gárda, or what he calls civic spirit&mdash;I believe that will not be brought about except through the action of that body themselves. It will be through their efforts, and through their efforts alone, that that civic assistance and respect will be achieved.  I have nothing further to state.  The main thing that brought me to my feet is to emphasise, as far as possible, the necessity for a reduction of this Vote in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielCorkery" hpid="Mr. CORKERY Mr. CORKERY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORKERY</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to agree with some of the speakers who have thrown so many bouquets at the Gárda.  My experience of the C.I.D. and the Gárda in my constituency has been mostly the other way.  I will give <Col N="1562" /> the House a few instances.  About two years ago the C.I.D. held up two young men on the bridge in Macroom one evening and threatened to plug them. They gave one of the young fellows a bit of rough handling.  He went some hours afterwards and reported the matter to the superintendent.  I do not know if the superintendent has any control over the C.I.D.  Evidently he has not.  He promised this young man to hold an inquiry into the case.  He told the young man that he would be called in evidence.  That is nearly two years ago but the inquiry has not since been held.  Some time afterwards this young man's father, who is a member of the Urban Council, raised the matter at the council meeting and a protest was made.  Still the inquiry has not been held up to this date.  About twelve months ago two Gárdaí alleged they were fired at near the village of Ballyvourney. About ten or twelve men were arrested that evening or the following evening and taken to the Ballyvourney barracks.  Some of them were beaten and one of them was so badly beaten that he brought an action for damages against a C.I.D. man.  In that action he was awarded £10.  I do not know if the ten pounds has as yet been paid but the C.I.D. man is still there.  Those ten or twelve young men were released and on the day after two brothers were arrested.  They were brought before the local Justice and remanded.  Deputy O'Leary on the other benches and I went bail for them. We knew these men were innocent. Everybody in the district knew they were innocent.  The Gárda knew they were innocent.  Still the Gárda swore point blank that these two brothers were the men who fired at them.  These men were brought before the District Justice seven or eight times.  They had to bring in witnesses and they were put to considerable expense, both legal and otherwise.  After being brought before the Justice the case continued for, I think six months, and in the end they were returned for trial to the Circuit Court.  The case was withdrawn by the State a day or two before it was to come on for trial.  These men have never been compensated for their <Col N="1563" /> losses in time and money.  The Gárda have since been removed.  I do not know if they have been promoted.</P>
      <P>To show how hard up the Gárda are for something to do down in our district I will mention a case which happened last June.  I might explain that it is the custom down there on St. John's Eve to have a bonfire.  It is an old custom and I am glad it is being kept up.  For some time before St. John's Eve the young lads collect dead wood, turf and so on to make a bonfire. Last year they went round as usual and collected some wood which they stored in the house of one of their parents. Some days afterwards, without going to the parents, the Gárda went to the school and arrested ten or twelve of these young fellows aged from twelve to fourteen years.  Notwithstanding the promises to the schoolmaster that they would let the young fellows go to the barracks before them, as soon as they got outside the school they marched them as criminals through the streets.</P>
      <P>When they went to the barracks they pretended to ring up the Governor of Cork Jail to ask him to have so many cells ready for these &ldquo;criminals.&rdquo; After a few hours the boys were released.  One of them was ill for some time afterwards from the fright he got.  They actually tried to put these children through the &ldquo;Third Degree,&rdquo; because they had gathered a few rotten sticks to make a bonfire.  Some time afterwards, so hard up were they for work, that after Mass on Sunday two of them went into a portion of the Church that is not supposed to be open to the public and remained there until the church was locked up watching the back-door of a publichouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I was in Cork City on private business and happened to be in a house when some of the C.I.D. raided it.  They searched some people that were with me, and attempted to search me, but I objected.  They told me that I would have to go to the Union Quay Barracks, and I agreed.  I explained that I had a good deal of business to do, and asked if they would bring me to the barracks as soon as they could. <Col N="1564" /> They told me I should stay there until they were ready, and they kept me there for an hour, after which I was taken to the barracks and released. They charged me with not giving my name when asked, but I was not asked for my name until taken to the barracks. Anyway, they should know me, because they have seen me often enough.</P>

      <P>On Monday last my house was raided and my assistant searched.  When he went to his own house for lunch he found them raiding it, and they searched him again.  We hear a lot about civic spirit, but those are my experiences of it.  We are told that they are a national force.  I, for one, do not believe it.  The C.I.D. are a purely political force and are not serving any useful purpose&mdash;not even a political purpose.  The majority of the Guards are all right, but there are too many of them.  My idea is that a dozen men or less in a town of, say, 5,000 population, would be sufficient, with proper transport, to police a district within ten mile radius of the town. Instead of that you have anything from half a dozen to a dozen barracks scattered around at a short distance from each other.  What they are for nobody seems to know.  The Guards have nothing to do but watch public-houses, and, as Deputy Daly said, the price of drink is prohibitive.  These are some of the things for which we are asked to pay close on £2,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. KERLIN Mr. KERLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, I should like to add a few remarks to what already has been said by Deputy Briscoe and others in connection with the C.I.D.  Since the formation of that force their main activities in Dublin and throughout the country have been political.  I am sure the Minister will agree that if there was no trouble of a political nature, if there was no political unrest, the main reason for the existence and maintenance of <Col N="1565" /> the major portion of the C.I.D. would automatically disappear.  I suggest that the members of the C.I.D. have gone out of their way, and are going out of their way, to create trouble and maintain political unrest.  There have been suggestions from these benches before of the C.I.D. employing agents provocateurs.  So far as I remember, when the suggestions were made the Minister refused to entertain them or to believe that there was any truth in them.  During the last year or so I have paid particular attention to this matter, and I have a few particulars with reference to certain people who I suggest were acting in that capacity. There was one individual named Booker who about two years ago was going around Dublin trying to sell parcels of guns and who entered various premises.  He was at one time in the premises of a Republican trying to sell some of these guns when the C.I.D. immediately came on the scene. Fortunately the parcel happened to be in his own possession, and the C.I.D. did not succeed in getting anyone into trouble.  There was another individual named Fitzgerald, who, as far as I recollect, was attempting to organise an escape from Mountjoy.  He brought together three or four young men, and supplied them with guns and a rope ladder, and got them to assemble at a certain place on a particular morning. When they arrived there they were met by a squad of C.I.D., who promptly took them under arrest.  This same individual, I think, organised an armed raid on a publichouse in Drumcondra. He gave certain people guns and instructed them to be there next morning. When they turned up they were promptly arrested.  There was another individual&mdash;I think his name was Hardy&mdash;who organised raids on post offices and supplied people with guns to take part in them.  Last, but not least, we have the notorious Harling, who, from the evidence given in the Coghlan shooting inquiry, had been going around amongst certain people in Dublin suggesting the formation of organisations and certain practices which would undoubtedly come into conflict with the law.  In fact, I remember <Col N="1566" /> definitely that at least on two occasions Harling called to my house and proffered certain letters, or what he termed despatches, to members of my family.  I am quite sure that if these had been accepted, within half an hour the C.I.D. would have been raiding the premises.</P>
      <P>There is another phase of the activities of the C.I.D. to which I should like to refer, and that is a practice which was in existence last year of arresting certain young men suspected of being attached to Republican organisations, or of instructing them to call to the detective headquarters at Pearse Street.  When these young men were either arrested or, acting on instructions, called to the detective headquarters, they were offered employment or money if they could supply certain information which members of the detective force wished to obtain. In fact, on these occasions the members of the C.I.D. went so far as to threaten these young men that they would be arrested for various criminal offences that had taken place throughout the city, and when they failed to get any of these men to give the information they required they threatened them as to what would happen if they did not keep these interviews a secret.  There was one particular case where a person concerned came to me and made a lengthy statement which I put in the form of an affidavit, but when I went back finally to the young man to get him to sign it, he said he was afraid.  He said if this matter was brought up here in the Dáil or in the court, the threats which the C.I.D. made against him would undoubtedly be put into effect.  Terrorism was employed to prevent these matters coming into public light.  Of course, the Minister for Justice will say these things could not happen, but they have happened, and they will happen again, and, therefore, I would like the Minister to give these complaints serious consideration.  He cannot get rid of them or render these activities nonexistent by saying that they do not exist.</P>

      <P>I wish to enter an emphatic protest against the manner in <Col N="1567" /> which raids have been carried out by uniformed and plain-clothes men of the Gárda Síochána in my constituency during the past week-end.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if it is part of the Government's policy to encourage the Civic Guards to carry out these raids on such a lavish scale as they are carried out so as to justify the enormous amount of money that is being spent upon this force.</P>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan spoke of the necessity for the inculcation of a civic spirit by the people on these benches. It is very hard to expect people on these benches to do anything when the Civic Guards deliberately go into the houses of prominent Republicans, all through the country, and toss their furniture and their houses about for hours on end.  In my own constituency it was singular that the houses that were raided were houses of prominent members of this organisation.  In the district of Ballinameen, the houses of the President, Treasurer and Secretary of the local Fianna Fáil Club were raided.  The same thing in Mantua and other districts round about North Roscommon. That was no mere accident. We are asked by Deputies on the other side to inculcate a civic spirit and to go out of our way to praise this Civic Guard force.  I do not intend to do so. It strikes me that the policy of the Gárda Síochána&mdash;the individual members of the Gárda are not to blame&mdash; but the policy behind them and the people spurring them on is the old R.I.C. policy of creating crime.  It is the policy to defend their own existence, to show justification for the fact that we are spending enormous sums of money&mdash;to justify the numbers at present in that force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs spoke of organised obstruction at political meetings.  He said that when he was a Farmers' candidate he could address meetings anywhere he liked, but the moment that he announced that he was an ally of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party he found considerable difficulty in speaking.  That is one side of the question.  But there is the other side.  Armed roughs in the town of <Col N="1568" /> Boyle tried to prevent me and my colleague, Deputy Gerald Boland, from speaking, but they were not interfered with by Civic Guards who were present and stood looking on and never tried to prevent them breaking up our meeting. The same had been done in other towns.  In Ballaghadereen at a famous election meeting, which subsequently became the topic of discussion in the law courts, there were numerous C.I.D. and plain-clothes men present, yet armed roughs came along and deliberately broke up the Fianna Fáil meeting, without one bit of interference from the Civic Guards.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said that he had got great assistance from the Civic Guards in that election campaign. I can absolutely testify to the truth of that, because I spent a whole evening in the town of Ballaghadereen stitching heads as a result of the great assistance which the Minister got on that occasion.  I had occasion before to point out&mdash;and I am referring only to the individual members of the Civic Guards who may have been guilty&mdash;that in the town of Ballaghadereen at the election last September, it was a singular thing that every driver without a driver's licence, and every owner of a car that had not a licence, working in the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party, were brought before the next court.  Drivers without licences and owners of unlicensed cars working in the interests of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were not noticed at all.  In Strokestown the same thing occurred. They went so far as to summon to court the owner of a car who had a driver's licence because the boy who drove the car had not a driver's licence.  In that particular town, under the eyes of the superintendent and other Civic Guards, several unlicensed cars were plying on behalf of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I can give the Minister if he likes&mdash;I do not wish to give it in public&mdash;the name of a superintendent of the Civic Guard who actually had an unlicensed car of his own out in the Cumann na nGaedheal interest that day.  Yet, we are told that there is no political bias. Of course not.  There is no organised <Col N="1569" /> obstruction, except on one side.  It strikes me very forcibly that the civic spirit, of which we have heard so much this afternoon, will never be what it should be until we have a police force that the people can respect and that is non-partisan and unbiassed.</P>

      <P>One thing strikes me listening to this debate and it is this: that last week-end a number of raids took place in the west, east, south, and north of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister particularly to dwell on those raids and tell us did the C.I.D. in each of the provinces have a brain-wave to raid certain people on the same day, or was there someone at the back, some central power, that issued an authority to the Guards and C.I.D. in each area to have these raids carried out.  If it were number one, that they merely had a brain storm that these raids should be carried out and that each superintendent of the Guards in the different areas thought this was a suitable time for having the raids, how is it that they had this brain-wave while we were discussing this Vote?  If it were the second &mdash;that there was some central authority responsible for issuing orders to the effect that these raids were to be carried out&mdash;what information was at the disposal of the central authority on which they acted for issuing orders for these raids?  Is there any plot to overthrow the State, or has the Minister for Justice any information to the effect that we are going to be invaded by England, Soviet Russia, or whatever the country may be?  Let the Minister not treat the matter lightly and wave his hand over it?  Let us have some information.  We are tired of these accusations, we are tired of hearing &ldquo;When there is an increase in civic spirit, when these things die down,&rdquo; etc.  We want definite information that there was a plot, and definite information as to what caused the Minister to have these raids carried out.  Let us adopt the principle of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.  He wants us to come down to bedrock and give specific instances of where there might be a decrease in expenditure.  He wants us <Col N="1570" /> to get down to twopence-halfpenny and not talk of the Guards scattered through the country villages, which in England would have only one constable responsible for the peace and order of the community.  Let the Minister get down to something definite in the same way. Let him not wave his hand, but tell us what the plot is.  Let him tell us, when there were a number of raids on a number of people against whom no evidence could be found, why the raids were carried out.  We want to hear that from the Minister, and we do not want any vague generalities.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes I may state one specific case. A gentleman named Maguire, a C.I.D. man who was very active in my constituency some time ago, was sent up to Dublin for promotion.  On his return home, celebrating his promotion, he alighted at Limerick Junction, went into the restaurant and fired several shots.  He was knocked down and disarmed by the telegraph clerk, a Mr. Mahony, who was commended by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for his action.  Maguire was then conveyed to a lunatic asylum.  He is at present walking round the streets of Cork, presumably in the C.I.D., and carrying arms.  Is that one of the trusted individuals who is going to raid our houses at night?  I want to know if he were tried for his action, what steps were taken against him, or how it is that he is back in the force and carrying arms.</P>

      <P>This discussion has taken up a very considerable amount of time, and I have listened to a very large number of speeches, some of them very dull, some quite humorous.  We had some very long speeches, and, thank goodness, some very short and terse ones also.  I think I may safely say one thing has characterised the whole of this debate that &mdash;apart from vague generalities that we have too many Guards in barracks, and that the barracks are not properly placed&mdash;we had no real criticism of the Estimate itself.  The expenditure has not been criticised.  Granted that <Col N="1571" /> the number of men are necessary, and that the force is properly dispersed, it appears obvious from the course of this debate that the greatest skill, care and efficiency have been shown in spending the money.  We have had, of course, some very queer suggestions.  We had the magnificent suggestion from Deputy Holt that all it was necessary to do in a town was to have an energetic sexton.  As soon as a crime was committed he would toll the bell.  The whole community would then turn out and the crime would cease.  We had a few suggestions of that nature, but of real practical efficiency we had no suggestions.</P>
      <P>This debate, however, was particularly interesting to me on the first day owing to the speeches delivered by Deputy Ruttledge and Deputy Lemass. Deputy Ruttledge's speech was a very pleasant speech for the larger part.  I do not know whether Deputy Allen was quite pleased because more than half of Deputy Ruttledge's speech was taken up with quotations from Deputy Gorey and Deputy Heffernan.  He is following them very closely.  He reads out their speeches as the proper course to be adopted.  That is very admirable and excellent.  I am glad to see Deputy Ruttledge following along the footsteps of Deputy Gorey and Deputy Heffernan. I wonder he does not put on a little spurt.  He is two years behind. Why is he so far behind?  Why does he not get his political philosophy from the speeches of those two Deputies as delivered now?  I think he would be reading in a sounder school of philosophy then.</P>

      <P>He is coming on admirably.  I have great hopes of Deputy Ruttledge.  He will improve enormously.  Deputy Lemass seems to have given a little shock.  We now discover where Deputy Lemass gets his facts and fictions about Irish life.  It is hard on poor Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly and his poor little paper, &ldquo;The Nation.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass is not going to him for his information.  No, he is <Col N="1572" /> going to the &ldquo;Sunday Times.&rdquo;  When Deputy Lemass wants facts or fiction about Irish life he goes to the &ldquo;Sunday Times.&rdquo;  I am afraid Deputy Allen will have to take him to task.</P>

      <P>He could go to the &ldquo;Freeman&rdquo; with great profit.  For the present, he is confining himself to the &ldquo;Sunday Times.&rdquo;  If Deputy Lemass would allow me to say so, he used the fiction&mdash;for I cannot call it fact&mdash;which he got out of the &ldquo;Sunday Times&rdquo; with great skill, with great humour, and I think I rather know why he was inclined to use it.  To borrow a phrase from Deputy Lemass&mdash;a beautiful little mixture of metaphor in which he indulged during the Army debate&mdash; I think he used this &ldquo;Because Deputy Little had landed himself in the soup.&rdquo; How you can land yourself in liquid I do not know, but I quite understand the meaning which Deputy Lemass had in mind when using that expressive phrase.  Deputy Little landed himself in the soup because he went on to talk about the civilian clothes worn by Civic Guards, how they appeared too well dressed and how people would be jealous of them.  That, to me, is a bit of a conundrum.  Deputy Anthony went on the same lines.  Everybody, apparently, is interested to know where the Gárdaí get their civilian attire.  It is not sufficient, according to Deputy Anthony, that they buy their clothes from Irish tailors and that they are made out of Irish materials. They must also take the greatest care that their clothes are stitched in Ireland.  I suppose in future they will have to get affidavits from their tailors stating where the stitching is done.  I do not think that that is practicable.  If you go to an Irish tailor and order Irish material, it ought to be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Little objects to them being in decent clothes, and apparently wants them to go in rags.  That is very much of the same type of argument we hear&mdash;that they are not to <Col N="1573" /> have decent barracks, that there is too much expenditure on them, and that, as Deputy MacEntee says, you cannot eat your loaf and have it or spend the same pound twice.  The Gárdaí are not to be properly housed because, unfortunately, there are a great number of people who are not properly housed. The Gárdaí should not be properly clothed because, unfortunately, a great number of people are not properly clothed.  I notice, however, that Deputy Little himself is always one of the most neatly-dressed Deputies in the House and is as well-dressed as a superintendent or chief-superintendent of the Gárdaí.  Why this vicarious charity?  Why is charity to be carried out at the expense of the Gárdaí only? Why do these people who say that the Gárdaí should not be properly clothed and housed not give an example themselves? If these good, true and honest servants of the State&mdash;that is the almost universal opinion of the House about them&mdash;are not to be properly dressed and properly housed owing to the poverty of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Somebody, for instance, comes to Deputy Little and asks him for half-a-crown, and he says, &ldquo;Oh, yes, but I must subtract it from the next Civic Guard.&rdquo;  Now I come to that part of Deputy Ruttledge's speech when he came out as himself and abandoned a better school of political philosophy than that in which he is now standing, and, with certain other Deputies, including Deputy Little, whose extraordinary ideas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, the Minister completely misrepresents me.  I was comparing the appearance of the old R.I.C. with the extremely good dress of the present men.

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the Deputy's speech.  Supposing the Gárdaí spend money on clothes, why should these young, self-respecting men, if they think that they should appear in public properly dressed, not do so?  I come now to the original parts of Deputy Ruttledge's remarks, original inasmuch as they were part of his own philosophy and particular method.  He was followed along the same path by Deputy Little, and then Deputy Holt came trotting along a very bad third.  They dealt with the cost of the R.I.C.  The Estimate of the R.I.C. for all Ireland in the year 1919 was £1,443,422, according to those Deputies, but if you look at the Appropriation Accounts for 1918-19 you will find that, in addition to that Estimate mentioned by the Deputies, there was a Supplementary Estimate of £134,105 and a sum of £325,096 allocated from the Vote to provide remuneration for public servants whose pay <Col N="1575" /> was not adjusted to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
      <P>The total grant for the R.I.C. for the year 1918-19 was £1,902,623.  That is quite a different figure from that which the Deputies put before the House. The grant for the D.M.P. for the same year was £167,248, making a total of £2,069,870, out of which £2,065,000 was actually expended.  When you compare the Vote for the police for the year 1918-19 you must bear two things in mind.  The first point is that their numbers had been slightly reduced owing to members of the force going on military service.  Secondly, the increased pay granted to the police forces in Great Britain and Ireland in 1919 did not affect the expenditure during the financial year 1918-19, as the new rates were payable only on the 1st April, 1919.  To find a proper basis of comparison between the cost of the Gárdaí and that of the R.I.C. and D.M.P., I think it would be better and fairer to turn to the year 1919-20.  The total grant for the police forces for the year 1919-20 was £3,340,592, out of which a sum of £3,242,045 was actually expended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I cannot tell you.  But we must bear in mind that this was not in the Black and Tan days.  They did not come in until the next year.  It was not until the year 1920-21 that they came on the scene.  The Appropriation Accounts show that the actual total expenditure in connection with the R.I.C. for that year was £5,967,101, while the actual expenditure on the D.M.P. during the same year jumped to £336,765, as compared with £165,600 for the year 1918-19.  I am taking what is really the last year before there was any Black and Tan increase, and that shows how utterly erroneous the figures of Deputy Ruttledge and of other Deputies are. As I have already said, in 1919-20 the total cost of the police forces in Ireland, the R.I.C. and the D.M.P., was three and a quarter million pounds.  I will now give a figure which, I think, <Col N="1576" /> will rather surprise the House.  If the Saorstát were now policed to the same extent that the whole country was policed by the R.I.C., and if the police here were paid at the Royal Ulster Constabulary rate, this Estimate would be increased by £600,000.  In other words, by cutting down the number of police and reducing the scale of pay we have reduced the cost of policing the Saorstát by about £600,000 a year. That is a very big reduction.</P>

      <P>Yes. The Government of the Six Counties bears the whole cost itself of its police <Col N="1577" /> forces.  Deputy Lemass made a rather surprising statement that he had information that the pay of the English police was very much lower than the pay of the Civic Guards.  He said that he had some document which could show it.  Well, that comes as an astonishing thing to me, because all the information at my disposal is this: that the pay of the English police force is identical with the pay of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and that is a very much higher rate of pay than that given to the Civic Guards.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, I know, different English police forces, but if my information is correct, they are all paid a flat rate of pay. My information is that a flat rate of pay was introduced some years ago for the police forces all over England.  I now propose to give some figures with regard to the different rates of pay in force here and those paid to the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  All the higher ranks in the Royal Ulster Constabulary are paid a much higher rate of pay than the higher ranks in the Gárda Síochána in this State.  The rate of pay for a Guard here goes from 60/- to 83/- a week, while for a constable in the Royal Ulster Constabulary it ranges from 70/- to 95/- a week.  The rate for sergeants here goes from 87/- to 98/6 a week, while for a sergeant in the Royal Ulster Constabulary it goes from 100/- to 112/6 a week.  The rate for inspectors here is from £280 to £300 a year, and for a head constable in Northern Ireland the rate is from £310 to £355 a year.  It must be known, of course, that inspectors here do more important work than a head constable in Northern Ireland, because they have to take the place of officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ruttledge wondered very much why we wanted 126 superintendents in this State.  I might inform the Deputy that we cut down the number of superintendents compared with the number of district inspectors here in the days of the old R.I.C.  There used to be 163 district inspectors serving in the area that is now covered by these <Col N="1578" /> superintendents.  Deputy Jordan remarked that these figures should not be taken as figures of any real substantial value because, he said, the land war was going on then.  As a matter of fact, in the figures which I have given I did not take anything like a peak figure at all.  I took the lowest figure for the Royal Irish Constabulary. When the land war was on the figures were very much higher. For instance, the figures for the whole of Ireland in the year 1897 show over 2,000 more men roughly&mdash;that is, 12,000 men as against 10,000 in the year 1914-1915.  As Deputies will remember, the Liberal Government was in office in that year, and it was the policy of everybody to see that there was no disturbance of any kind.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attack has been made upon the Civic Guards because they are said to be a political force and that they did political work for the Cumann na nGaedheal Party at the last election.  I deny the accuracy of those accusations.  I was glad to hear the more serious one withdrawn in the most unqualified fashion to-night.  Deputy Lemass put a definite question to me.  He picked me out personally and asked if I received any assistance from the Civic Guards at the last election.  I am in a position to say that I did not receive any.  Many of my colleagues have said that they did receive assistance from the Civic Guards inasmuch as they desired to have their election speeches delivered in a quiet atmosphere, and that if there had not been Civic Guards there that there would have been interruptions.  I am in a more fortunate position, because I must say that in my constituency during the September election I was never interrupted once.  I was allowed to carry on my meetings in the utmost peace and harmony, and I think that every political party who spoke in the South Mayo election would say exactly the same.  We fought out our election without any disturbance or row of any kind.  Deputy Lemass also said&mdash;I do not know where he got the information from&mdash;that the Guards in my constituency tore down election pamphlets and placards.  That is not correct, as far as I know.  I do not believe that on <Col N="1579" /> any side were election placards torn down.  I think that all parties did allow each other's placards to remain up to do whatever useful work they could do and to make as many converts as they possibly could.  I think that on this particular occasion, and in this particular instance, that Deputy Lemass has allowed his imagination too much free play.</P>

      <P>You cannot fill up 1,100 places with 800 barracks. Deputy Jordan spoke about Co. Galway.  I am in a position to give the actual numbers as regards that county. I find there are 62 Gárda Síochána stations in Co. Galway, compared with 94 R.I.C. barracks in 1914.  Deputy <Col N="1580" /> Jordan led the House to believe exactly the same number of barracks were in Co. Galway now as in the days of the R.I.C..  The strength of the Gárda Síochána in the Co. Galway, including all ranks, amounts to 385, as against the R.I.C. strength of 900 on the 1st January, 1914.  We have reduced the number of barracks by one-third, and the number of police serving there by more than one-half.  Deputy Kilroy came to the Co. Mayo.  As a matter of fact there are 46 Gárda stations in Co. Mayo, and there were 63 R.I.C. barracks in 1914.  The authorised strength of the Gárda Síochána in Mayo is 291, as against the R.I.C. strength of 404 on the 1st January, 1914.  Of course it must be understood that where there is a reduction in the number of stations it becomes necessary to make a rearrangement of certain districts.  In some cases this may involve the establishment of a new station at some more central place than the station it replaces. That explains how in Co. Mayo there may be barracks where there was not one before&mdash;that is because the area has been altered, and where you had three barracks before there are two now, one in a new place.  If you kept the barracks in the old places you could not sufficiently supervise the work in the new areas.  Other Deputies say there are too many barracks, and that we could do with a far and away lesser number of them, and that if we had a more mobile force with a number of men with motor bicycle, and with the use of telephones, as suggested by Deputy MacEntee you would lessen the necessity for having the present number of barracks.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider the work the Guards have to do.  They have to go out at night, remain around public houses and watch against the commission of crime.  The sudden passing of a patrol on motor bicycles would be insufficient.  People would say &ldquo;the patrol has passed and we are safe for the rest of the night.&rdquo; They have to go along quietly, or remain in ambush, and watch out generally. They could not do that with a couple of noisy motor bicycles announcing that they have arrived.  They <Col N="1581" /> could not cross fields and walls and go into certain villages if tied down to motor bicycles.  Any Deputy who comes to consider the question seriously will see that the bulk of the Guards' work must be done on foot, or done with the assistance of the ordinary push bike. As far as telephones are concerned, they would be very useful if every country house had a telephone.  In the cities you have telephones but not in the country districts.  There are huge areas where between one small country town and another there would not be a single telephone.  Deputy MacEntee is living in Dublin, and he seems to know nothing about farm houses.  No farm house has a telephone, and it would be necessary for the person who wants the police to go to the Guards' station. That is why the Guards must be conveniently stationed where the people can get them when needed, and where they can report crime if they know that crime is happening and there is a clear necessity for having that crime reported.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word here with reference to a remark made by Deputy Ruttledge, to the effect that a statute cut down the police rate in Dublin at the rate of a penny in the pound in the year and the City Commissioners were taking false credit for that reduction. In the rate struck after the 1st April, 1925, by statute the rate for the Dublin Metropolitan area, which is not the same as Dublin city, goes down by a penny in the pound in the year.  Of the sum which appears in the estimate of £32,400 a sum of £23,731 is struck off the city, and £8,769 from the surrounding areas.  The following figures show the speed at which the rates have come down.  In 1924-25 the rates were 19/2 in the pound; 1925-26, 17/2; 1926-27, 16/-; 1927-28, 15/6; 1928/29, 14/8; and to say that a drop of 4/6 in the pound is due because successively for two years a penny in the pound has been taken off the police rate is grossly unfair.  I am sure Deputy Ruttledge did not do so on purpose but it appears to be very unfair to the City Commissioners. A considerable number of attacks have been made on the Civic Guards because, it is said, they have been misconducting themselves in the force.  We have had old cases and a <Col N="1582" /> certain number of new cases brought forward.  We had from Deputy Ruttledge the old Newport affair, which was dealt with a long time ago.  Deputy Ruttledge said that Guards fired into their own barracks.  That charge was fully investigated and it was found they did not fire into their own barracks.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that a Guard actually fired at a barracks in which his own wife and children were residing, endangering their lives.  That charge has been brought up here, unsupported by any evidence, although it had been fully inquired into.  Subsequent action after that barracks had been fired into that was not proper by the Gárda was fully gone into, and the Guards in question were fully and properly dealt with.  I want to take this opportunity of saying here, clearly and definitely, that if any person considers that he has been aggrieved by anything done by any Guard, the courts are open to him and he has his redress.  If a Guard commits an assault upon any individual, that Guard is as much liable to such punishment as the law provides as any other member of the community.</P>

Deputy Gorry is very anxious to intervene.  Deputy Gorry intervened in this debate a short time ago.  I think that Deputies should have a little regard for facts.  Deputy Gorry talked to us about the capture of a man whom he called by the very pleasant title of the &ldquo;One-eyed Gunner&rdquo;&mdash;a very beautiful title for a man to possess; a very unlikely title for a law-abiding citizen to possess, but I pass by that.</P>

I asked him what he had been charged with, and he answered: &ldquo;With attempting to escape.&rdquo;  Deputy Byrne asked was he not charged with attempting to kill, and Deputy Corry said: &ldquo;No, he was charged with attempting to escape.&rdquo;  That man comes from the Deputy's constituency, and the Deputy had been speaking in <Col N="1584" /> this House about him again and again. It had appeared in the papers, if nothing else, and the Deputy knew that that man had been sent for trial on a charge of attempted murder, and yet the Deputy gets up and makes a statement of that nature, which he must have known to be untrue.</P>

      <P>We had a great many attacks upon the detective branch of the force, and, by the way, I may inform Deputy Lemass that he made a very considerable mistake when he was dealing with this branch of the force, because seeing that there was an allowance to officers and men upon detective duty of 7/- a week, and that there was also a plain-clothes allowance for 336 men&mdash;235 being the other figure&mdash;he assumed that these figures were cumulative. They are not cumulative; the 336 includes the 235, because detectives also receive a plain-clothes allowance.  The plain-clothes allowance is, of course, given in lieu of uniform.  Several Deputies have talked about that branch of the force.  I want to say, clearly and definitely, that we have one police force, and one police force only, and that every single member of our police force has to be a detective if the necessity arises.  Some of them are put upon plain-clothes duty; some of them are not.  It is the duty of every Guard to detect crime&mdash;every single one, without exception.  Some of them are put <Col N="1585" /> on plain-clothes duty.  They are just as well trained, they are just as well disciplined, and they are just as highly efficient and as honourable men as any other men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked many questions about raids which took place recently. One would really think that Deputies opposite lived up in the moon, that they never came down to earth, that they do not know what is happening around them.  Are Deputies opposite ignorant of the fact that there is a considerable number of dangerous and desperate men in this country who are trying to upset the established order of things by force of arms, who wish to upset the established Constitution by force of arms, and who, in order to carry out their design, are willing to stop at very little&mdash;indeed to stop at nothing?  Are Deputies opposite ignorant of the fact that within the last few years, unfortunately on more occasions than one, individual unarmed Civic Guards in their barracks have been shot dead, have been murdered?  Are Deputies ignorant of that?  Are Deputies ignorant of the fact that one of the most appalling crimes, not only in the history of this country but in the history of Europe, was committed little more than a year ago, when one of the brightest brains and one of the noblest characters that this country ever produced was foully murdered?  Are Deputies opposite entirely ignorant of that? Does not every Deputy know that underneath the surface there is still seething this evil spirit?  Do Deputies not know that there are a considerable number of men in this country who are anxious, if the opportunity comes, to indulge in crime again to achieve their ends?  I do not believe that there is a single Deputy who, although he may not say it, is blind to the existence of that state of facts.  And it is the duty of the whole of the Guards, the detective branch and every other branch, to see that conspiracies of that nature shall not come to a head and that crimes of murder shall not be committed. Deputies asked why did these raids take place last week, and they asked me to give them, nicely and quietly, the information which I have got at my disposal.  I do not intend to do anything of the kind.  I am not <Col N="1586" /> going to help criminals by allowing precisely what is known to be publicly circulated, even for the information of Deputies.</P>

      <P>Possibly not.  To get down perhaps to less interesting matters of detail, Deputy Davin asked me about the speed of motor cars.  Deputy Murphy put the same question to me.  Deputy Murphy seemed to think that motor buses could go at any rate they liked.  That is not so.  The law at the present moment is <Col N="1587" /> that no motor bus can travel over twenty miles an hour, but an important Committee has recommended that twenty-five miles an hour is a fair and proper speed at which to go, and I believe the whole community is behind that view.  People do travel in motor buses and they know that twenty-five miles an hour is a fair rate on an open road.  Of course, that would not be allowed in the city; but to institute a prosecution because a bus was going at twenty-three miles an hour on an open road would, I think, make the community laugh.  What we want is to have our legislation up-to-date.  Of course, it will be brought up-to-date, but everything cannot be done at once. If we keep the buses to twenty-five miles an hour it will be a very hard thing to do&mdash;and only prosecute when they are going over twenty-five miles an hour&mdash;and I think we shall be doing extremely good work.  I believe the House approves of allowing them to go at twenty-five miles an hour.  I do not think that anyone would substantially object to it.</P>

      <P>Certainly. Every bus that travels over twenty-five miles an hour will be prosecuted, and we are giving strict instructions that that is to be done.  I know that it has been stated that that is dispensing with the existing law.  It may be necessary on occasions, pending legislation, to keep in complete touch with public opinion.  For instance, I may say that in England orders were issued that the police were not to prosecute for first offences of a small nature.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey asked me how many Guards were engaged on transport duty.  Taking an average for the whole year, there are somewhat more than 250 men employed on week days on some form of traffic control, and on Sundays the number is increased to nearly 350.  That cannot be regarded as a completely accurate figure.  It must be taken as an estimate.  Naturally the number will vary from time to time.  Deputy Anthony was very strong as to whether foreign articles were imported for sale to the Guards. I may say that the Board of Works who supplied these articles informed me that all the furniture supplied during the last three or four years was manufactured mainly in the Saorstát, with the exception of fenders and lamps.  The Purchasing Department for bedding materials is the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The contract for these materials since May, 1927, amounted to the value of £4,854 8s. 1d., of which only contracts to the value of £314 were placed outside the Saorstát, these being almost entirely for cotton pillow-cases, where the price was less than the lowest Saorstát tender by thirty to forty per cent.  It would appear that every effort is being made, as it ought rightly be made, to see that articles used by the Guards are purchased in the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee made some allusions to the raid at Roebuck House.  I answered the Deputy very fully in a question that he put to me, and there is nothing that I can add to the information that I then gave.  He was very ingenious in spinning out suspicions, but we have already had a little example of Deputy MacEntee's suspicions.  In the Coughlan case Deputy MacEntee was most suspicious, <Col N="1589" /> and gave us a whole lot of suspicions which were most ingeniously worked out, but when an inquiry was held the utter worthlessness of Deputy MacEntee's suspicions, and how baseless they were, was clearly demonstrated by the court.  I do not pay very much attention to Deputy MacEntee's suspicions when directed against the Guards.  Deputy Sir James Craig made a complaint about there being no supervision over publichouses in Tramore on Sundays.  I will have inquiries made into that matter.  I believe a great number of people go there from Waterford on Sundays, and if there is not adequate supervision we will see that adequate supervision will be applied.  Deputy Clery spoke about Irish in the Guards, and seemed to suggest that Irish was being neglected. That is not the case.  Everything is done to encourage Irish amongst the Guards.  Where possible, Irish speakers are sent to Irish-speaking districts, and Guards who know a smattering of Irish are sent to these districts also, so that having a foundation they may be able to build up a sound knowledge of the language.  These are the only matters that I think it is necessary to refer to in detail.  I am not going into every charge that was made against the Guards, such as the mysterious gentleman who is in the position of being husband of a postmistress, and does not seem to have any other personality, whose wife appears to have been interviewed by someone who may have been a Civic Guard, that Deputy Goulding told us about.</P>

A Deputy gets a letter from the husband of a postmistress and he asks here in the House that a solemn inquiry should be held, simply because he gets that letter and believes the contents of it.  That is the type of application we are getting, and that is just the class of evidence that is being presented to us for the purpose of holding investigations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, and the courts are open to them; but I am not going to hold an investigation simply because somebody writes to the Deputy.  As regards the matters put forward by Deputy Corkery, I shall be glad if I am able to deal with one of the cases he brought up.  He brought up a matter about Ballyvourney barracks, and he said that in a case arising out of matters down there, there was a decree given against the Guards for £10.  There were men arrested, and one was so badly beaten that he took an action against the Guards and got a decree for £10.  We happen to know a good deal about that case because it was the subject of a question here some time back.  The jury found that the assault was trivial and they awarded £10, obviously giving what we might term vindictive or punitive damages. If Deputies read the report of that case and saw the nature of the injuries alleged they would observe that the man had a black and blue shoulder. That is the only injury alleged.  If it had not been a Guard the amount would have been about 10/- and not £10.  What kind of violence did it take to make a man's shoulder black and blue?  I wonder are there any Deputies who have not had their shoulders black and blue? I have had mine made black and blue and green and yellow simply because I fired out of a gun that kicked because the cartridge was wet.  In circumstances like that one will discover the extraordinarily small amount of violence that it takes to discolour the skin of his shoulder.  Any Deputy who <Col N="1591" /> has shot a snipe will agree with me, and I am sure at some time or another Deputies have fired at snipe.</P>

      <P>I may tell the Deputy that where serious injury is done to a person by the Guards the Guards are dismissed from their posts for it.  It is within the knowledge of several Deputies who have spoken to me on the subject that Guards have been dismissed from the force.  Persons they assaulted were very anxious that they would not be dismissed, because by being dismissed they are not a mark for damages, and if we retain them they are a mark for damages.  That is not, however, a matter that we can look into.  If a Guard misconducts himself he must be punished, and the punishment will, as nearly as possible, be commensurate with the particular crime with which he is charged.</P>

    <P>Deputy Kerlin got up to-night and made certain charges that there were agents provocateurs attached to the Guards.  I entirely repudiate that the Guards employ, or have ever employed, agents provocateurs.  To my mind nothing more shocking could be done <Col N="1592" /> by the members of any police force than to employ agents provocateurs, to employ a man who deliberately will have crime committed.  That class of man we do not employ.</P>

      <P>I have had to leave out a very considerable number of things mentioned by Deputies in the course of the debate, but I cannot forget Deputy Moore.  It would be a great pity were I to forget Deputy Moore.  His heart is wrung because some poor lady had her licence taken away for the crime that she did not sell Bass in bottles.  Deputy Moore got up full of indignation and asked if it were a crime in this country that persons should not stock Bass and that this lady was to be persecuted for that. One would think that this lady was a martyr enduring punishment simply because she did not stock foreign-made beer in bottles.  The instructions issued to the Guards&mdash;and this also answers Deputy Davin&mdash;is that the publichouses which do the smallest amount of business are the ones which are to be extinguished first.  The policy is to begin with the small ones, obviously the ones that are too numerous, and then go on to the bigger ones.  That is the policy all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular lady happened to own a publichouse which had always been well-conducted.  She was doing the smallest amount of business of any publican in her particular town.  She, accordingly, was the one that was fixed upon to have an order made in respect of her premises, and her licence was the <Col N="1594" /> one to be extinguished because she was obviously doing a small amount of business. One of the tests to be applied in these cases was: what does the publican stock?  That was a natural test.  Now the country publichouse which does not stock Bass is not doing a great deal of business.  As a matter of fact, this particular case was adjourned to see what sort of stock the lady had ordered for a considerable time past.  The case, however, never came on for a hearing because, by consent, the licence was extinguished.  Her solicitor wrote saying he would not contest the order of the Justice.  This was a very natural test.  &ldquo;Is the publican selling Bass, Guinness's stout, or whiskey?&rdquo; These are the three drinks that are most in use.</P>
    <P>I think I have really gone through as many of the smaller items as possible. I hope I have not left anything very material out.  I am very glad, however, that, taken as a whole, there has been with very few exceptions a genuine appreciation expressed of the Gárdai and of the work the Gárdaí are doing. That appreciation has come from all Parties in the House and it is extremely pleasant and gratifying.  It has been stated that the Gárda Síochána are political.  It would be absolutely wrong that they should be political.  The policy of this Government is perfectly plain.  The Gárda must not be political. They must not belong to one side more than to another.  I think a clear proof has been given of that policy and in the carrying out of that policy by the action which the Executive Government took some time ago.  If it had been the desire of the Executive Government that they should have a partisan force, the last thing they would do would be to disfranchise the force.  They have disfranchised the Gárdaí.  No member of the Gárda Síochána has a vote.  The reason of that is so that they may not be partisans by adherence to any political party.  There may be men here and there who may break out, who may have strong political views.  Everyone has political views and people may on occasions do a little more than they should.  But that the force, as a force, is impartial is, I think, pretty well established, and I believe it is pretty <Col N="1595" /> well known.  Deputy Tubridy stated that two sergeants were removed from Galway because they refused to be partisans.  That is not so.  As a matter of fact, I happen to have read the file of this sergeant.  He was a very good sergeant but he did not get on very well with the people in his neighbourhood, and he did not get on with the landlord of the barracks; there was a great deal of friction between them, and it was thought better to remove the sergeant to another station.  He was removed to a nice station in the County Roscommon and if you go from the wilds of Connemara to the centre of Roscommon I do not know that you are doing very badly.  It was Lord Halifax who talked about being kicktd upstairs.  That would be very much like being kicked upstairs, so most people would conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I inquired into this matter very carefully. It was one of the first things I intended mentioning, but there was an enormous mass of items and I overlooked it.  I have seen the file in that case, and also the newspaper report.  What happened in that case was: A charge of poteen-making was brought against a father and son.  The sergeant and a Guard were examined.  They swore to a certain state of affairs.  The defendants were examined and swore to another state of affairs.  The District Justice, in making up his mind, decided that he would give the benefit of the doubt to the defendants, and that in consequence he could not believe and would not act on the stories of the Gárdaí. The Deputy must know that when there is a question of oath against oath no one particular individual, a District Justice or a jury, can ever be certain which side is telling the truth when <Col N="1597" /> the evidence on either side cannot be corroborated.  That matter was carefully investigated and carefully gone into by the superior officers of the sergeant, who came to the conclusion that every single word that the Gárda and the sergeant had stated was true.  The sergeant especially, and the Gárda also, are men of the highest character and the greatest probity; they are men whose reputations stand very high in the force.  Their officers and superiors were perfectly satisfied that in that particular case they had not committed perjury.  A District Justice, like anybody else, is fallible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>From the day it was handed over, Haulbowline presented a first-class economic problem which has since proved insoluble.  On the one hand, the island dockyard, with its dry dock, wharves, workshops, buildings, etc., represents an immense capital outlay which, although the general trade depression at the time rendered it unproductive, might, with a trade revival, become a great asset to Cork and the State.  Two possible courses were then open to the Government: either to discharge the remaining remnant of the staff, evict them and their families from their houses, and close down and abandon the works and plant to rapid deterioration, or to re-engage a sufficient number of the dockyard staff to form a care and maintenance party to preserve the plant and buildings and use the yard for the execution of such Government work as could be economically undertaken.  The Government, no doubt influenced by the great amount of unemployment then existing at Cobh and the surrounding district, due to the sudden termination of British naval and military operations there, and reluctant to add to the hardships of the workers and their families, <Col N="1601" /> but, perhaps, chiefly because the idea of abandoning the concern to ruin was repugnant, adopted the latter course, and the plant and buildings have since been maintained in good condition, fit to be quickly opened up to their full capacity for any purpose for which they are adapted.  In addition to maintaining the plant and buildings, the maintenance staff carried out extensive repairs of Government vessels, and the facilities of the dockyard have constantly been afforded to local ship-repairing firms to enable them to undertake ship repair work which could not otherwise be undertaken in the district.  In this way local labour has benefited considerably.  Haulbowline was used for some years as a Free State garrison station, and before the opening of the new military hospital at Cork the naval hospital on the island was used as the Southern Command hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great extent of Haulbowline and the isolation from the mainland, entailing the maintenance of an extensive ferry service, place it at a great disadvantage from a commercial point of view, and it is difficult to imagine any one firm operating there economically. It has, however, possibilities of sub-division, and with a trade revival it might be possibly worked by a number of firms or individuals.  But it must be remembered, when thinking of Haulbowline, that the existence of the dry dock and the oil installation are its chief advantages from the commercial point of view.  Apart from these, it is doubtful if the site has any attraction for a commercial firm.  However, in view of the inadequate dry dock facilities in the port of Cork, and the great percentage increase of oil burning vessels, these are weighty considerations and definitely preclude the policy of abandonment.  If the present policy with regard to Haulbowline is continued, and so far as we can see it is likely to continue for some time, the maintenance cost must increase considerably in the near future, owing to the necessity for expensive repairs and renewals to the dock and jetties.  On the other hand, considerable economics in the running of the service, especially the power station, could be effected by renewals entailing a comparatively <Col N="1602" /> small outlay, and at the present time we are taking measures to bring about these economics.</P>

      <P>I would like a little more information than the Parliamentary Secretary has given us. I see here a figure of £10,000 as cost of dockyard maintenance.  Of that the wages of the staff is £9,500.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that there were extensive repairs done, to Government ships, I understood.  I do not see anything about that here.  But I see that there is ship repairing work done at a cost of £100, and the wages of the staff were £9,500.  I suppose there was other work done, but we did not get the value of it, as far as I can see. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will explain.</P>
      <P>There is an item for fuel, light, and water, £1,900, to do what is down here as £100 worth of work.  Alterations also of plant and buildings £5,000. Would the Parliamentary Secretary say what that item is, and what these alterations were?  I have a suspicion at the back of my mind that this dockyard is kept for one purpose, that is, that the British may have it in proper working order whenever the exigencies of the moment may require it.  I am glad to find there is such tenderheartedness on the part of the Department with regard to the staff, which makes me suspicious that the staff is of a particular type also.  If the same solicitude was shown to dismissed railway workers and others, some of us would not have much cause of complaint. There was £9,500 in wages to do what is here represented as £100 worth of work, and £1,900 for fuel, light and water, and also alteration of plant and buildings £5,000.</P>

      <P>I want to ask particularly for information.  I am very interested in this particular place.  It happens to be right opposite my house, for one thing, and I happen to have a certain amount of knowledge of it from different points of view.  It has always seemed to me a very, very difficult problem indeed to get value out of what ought to be an asset of value.  It is an example of a thing which is very common in life, of things which, undoubtedly, have value but which you <Col N="1603" /> have not the means of turning into value.  I am not suggesting, for one moment, that the problem of turning this to useful purpose is an easy problem. At the moment I want to know whether that asset is being kept in a condition to be used at a reasonable cost when the opportunity does come? As far as I can see on the face of the Estimate, it is not obvious that that is being done.  I am going to ask the Parliamentary Secretary now to tell us exactly how this £9,500 of wages are made up.  I want to know the number of people employed, their trade, what they are paid and what they do?  I want to know who is living upon this island and who is paying the rent, or if any rents are being paid, for the occupation of the houses, on that island? I want to know for whose benefit and for what purpose in relation to this country the ferry service is maintained and its cost?  You have here, as Deputy Boland said, a charge of £1,900 for fuel, light and water.  I want to know whether that is justified by the actual work which is being done on the island?  I do not want to make a speech on the subject at the moment because I happen to look on Estimates possibly from a different point of view from most.  If the Chair permits me to say this, the custom which the House has of members making long speeches as a preliminary on Estimates does not to me seem to provide the best results. What happens is a man has a grievance in his constituency or some other matter which he wants to inquire about.  He has to state the case probably as given to him from an interested source.  He then has to imagine the answer which the Minister is to give to that complaint and he then has to provide the answer to the answer he imagines the Minister is going to give. That is what very largely happens in the debates here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I suggest is, as far as possible, to take the line of regarding the Minister in charge of an estimate as being not guilty until he is proved guilty, and that our business should be to give many definite questions to which answers can be given and of which the <Col N="1604" /> information should be in the possession of the Minister.  Then when we have received the answers, if we are satisfied, well and good.  If not, we are in a much better position to deal with the matter.  It is in that spirit I ask the Minister to tell us what exactly is going on in Haulbowline, what exactly the money spent on Haulbowline is being spent for and what value we are getting for it.  We ought to have some details as to what this £5,000 is expended on and whether the Parliamentary Secretary imagines that the money is going to be reproductive in any way. I ask him to tell us what is going on inside Haulbowline Island at the moment that is costing the community as a whole £21,120, that is, £17,000 in the Estimate, and £4,120.</P>

      <P>I have not the advantage enjoyed by Deputy Flinn of living opposite Haulbowline, nor have I the disadvantage of living so far away from Haulbowline as Deputy Boland, but at any rate I have taken the trouble to inquire into the conditions in Haulbowline and I am anxious to ask one or two questions of the Minister.  The burden of the speeches delivered by Deputy Boland and Deputy Flinn appears to me to be that the dockyard is uneconomic and that, consequently, it should be scrapped.  I am not going to subscribe to that view at the moment in view of the fact that I have certain information so far as employment in that dockyard is concerned.  Perhaps it would be of information to Deputies concerned that in the dockyard at present there are something like 89 workers, made up, as far as I can gather, as follows:&mdash;There are 14 mechanics.  Under that head would be included boilermakers, fitters, etc. These are in receipt of wages from 52/3 per week to 124/- per week.  There are riggers, shipwrights and carpenters in receipt of wages from 56/- to 70/8 per week.  There are 24 skilled labourers having from 45/- to 54/- per week, and <Col N="1605" /> 10 others at 42/- per week.  There are 13 men manning ferry boats at from 52/6 to 80/- per week; 6 storemen at from 47/6 to 60/- per week&mdash;the total number employed being 89.  Whilst not suggesting, as has been suggested, that this dockyard was kept there for any other purpose than that of repair and maintenance work, I am not going to suggest that it was there as one of the outposts of England.  We have so frequently heard that, that to me, at any rate, it is becoming nauseous.  I would prefer to have my information from the Minister without imputing to the Minister and the Government that they are keeping this institution alive for any other purpose than that of maintenance or repair.  I reject these kind of insinuations. I think any man who takes even a little interest in the affairs going on around us in connection with this dockyard will admit that, at the moment, there is not sufficient work or that the dockyard does not get enough work in that particular line.  I would ask the Minister to amplify what he has said and state his future policy in regard to Haulbowline.  The dockyard at Haulbowline could, with very little expense, be converted into an up-to-date dockyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one regrettable feature which I hope the Minister will explain. A good deal of machinery and plant in the dockyard as handed over by the British has been dispersed and I understand that more machinery is now in the course of demolition.  That is a very serious state of affairs.  We have in Cork Harbour a magnificent dockyard and one which with very little expense could be put into a state of efficiency and utilised for some purpose at least.  It was stated here, or at any rate we were told in Cork, that Haulbowline, if no other work could be found for it, would be converted into a factory for the manufacture of wireless parts and accessories.  That promise has so far not been fulfilled.  When I say that an election in Cork was won by a representative of Cumann na nGaedheal on that promise it is time that the successor of the late Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should see, if he has any influence with the Executive Council that that promise is even partially fulfilled.  Haulbowline at that <Col N="1606" /> time in addition to giving employment to a number of people in Cobh also gave a good deal of work to the residents of the surrounding district. Though it is not in my constituency, I feel that the Government have sadly neglected their opportunities so far as Haulbowline is concerned.  They talk a good deal about industrial development and about looking for sites for factories but we have in Haulbowline a place eminently suited for any business or industry requiring cheap methods of transit.</P>
    <P>There is one of the most magnificient harbours in the world there with a splendid train service and other means of transport.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should take into consideration the fact that much of the machinery will of necessity get into disrepair, that is, any that is left in the dockyard at all, and that it would be unwise to proceed further with the dispersal of any plant or machinery there.  The time may come, and I hope it will come soon, in the history of this country when, if we will not have enterprising Irishmen looking for sites for factories and workshops, such as shipbuilding yards, we will have people from outside anxious to establish industry here.  In view of that, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should give a little more serious consideration to the potentialities of Haulbowline Dockyard and not proceed with any further dispersal of whatever plant and machinery may be left there.  I do not think that I could depart from this question without drawing attention to an incident which occurred there some years ago.  When some ships had to be disposed of, of the type that were used by the British during the Great War, a considerable amount of mystery seemed to surround their disposal.  My information at that time, and it was vouched for by reliable and competent authorities, was that these ships were bought at a certain price and were disposed of some time afterwards by a private person at considerable profit.  There was a good deal of suspicion, to use a very mild term, in relation to the whole transaction.</P>

      <P>I understand that, but I mentioned the matter of that deal because there might be a danger that a deal might be made concerning some of the remaining machinery which might not be very creditable to those engaged in it, and it might be done without the knowledge or consent of the responsible Department.  I hope that the Minister will give this matter more serious consideration than he has apparently done.  Haulbowline, during the time of the British regime, gave an amount of employment, but since the evacuation of the British troops and ships the amount of employment has fallen from a little over 1,000 to 90 men.  We believe that the dockyard could be put to some use.  The activities of the Free State to-day are such that the Government would be able to find useful employment there for at least five times the number of those now engaged there. There are, I think, many avenues which the Minister should explore.  I mentioned one of the promises given by the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in relation to it, and I suggest that that, or something like it, should be carried out.</P>

      <P>I would like to inquire whether the Government has at any time approached any of the oil companies with a view to getting them to rent the tanks which are in Haulbowline for the storage of oil.  What is more important, has the Government ever considered taking advantage of that storage capacity to endeavour to get an oil refining industry established? I think it is quite possible that some of the half dozen companies operating in this country and importing oil might, if a favourable offer were made, consider its acceptance.  At present there is one company refining oil <Col N="1608" /> in Dublin.  It is able to carry on in spite of intense competition, and it gives a fair amount of employment and is apparently making a success of the business. It is, however, only dealing with a small part of the requirements of the Saorstát.  It does not seem impossible, so far as my limited knowledge goes, that we could get a good deal more of that oil refining business.  It should, at least, be the aim of the Government, when motor spirits and other oils are costing the country a vast amount of money, to try and get something out of that.  The volume of trade for motor spirit alone being over 20,000,000 gallons, it looks at least a possible industry to the State.  I presume that the Government have considered the subject, but I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether that is so or not, and, if it is not a feasible proposition, what are the difficulties in the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on the spur of the moment.  Until the year is completed we cannot say what the expenditure will be.  The Government is doing a considerable amount of repair work in Haulbowline.  We repaired the vessel &ldquo;Dainty&rdquo; which, when it went into Haulbowline Dockyard was valued at about £4,000.  It has since been valued at £13,000.  Since the repair work was carried out on it it has been hired to the Canadian Government at £500 a month.  There is a certain amount of useful work being carried on there, but we are not denying at all that Haulbowline is a white elephant so far as the Government is concerned. All our energies are being directed towards disposing of the place, if it is possible at all to do it.  Up to the present <Col N="1609" /> we have not been successful in doing so.  Before deciding on advertising Haulbowline for sale we thought it advisable to employ an expert engineer to find out his opinion as to the exact position down there as well as to give us an estimate of the machinery that would be required and of the machinery that could be got rid of.  There was no use in expending large sums annually on machinery which was redundant. Accordingly, we sent down an engineer to draw up a report on the position.  I will quote from the report of that engineer as to what his views are on the present position in Haulbowline.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The report states: &ldquo;My investigation leads me to the following general conclusions: the only type of commercial firm likely to find the premises attractive would be one engaged in shipbuilding or ship repairing. The portions of premises most suitable to such a firm is situated east of a line drawn north and south through the hospital Camber.  Much of the existing machinery, even in this portion of the island, is superfluous, and greatly in excess of any possible demands for commercial ship-repairing, and could be sold.  The existing machinery is badly balanced.  Great attention has been paid to the engine and electrical side of the works, but the shipbuilding and iron-working side has been neglected, with the result that a large proportion of the machinery in this section is obsolete, while the use of some of the larger machines is restricted, due to the fact that the size of the material which could be worked is already limited by the small size of machines available for other processes.  It would not be, in my opinion, a wise policy to attempt a new lay-out of the yard, partly for reasons quoted under paragraph 4, and further, owing to the fact that in the event of the yard being taken, any new management would almost certainly make alterations to suit their own views.  The concentration which would be effected would be very small, and by not carrying out such an operation, <Col N="1610" /> I am satisfied that the prospects of disposal would not be impaired. There is nothing to be gained by incurring a very heavy expense in making a general shift round of machines, such as has been mooted.  The question of power plant and pumping plant wants special consideration, and in doing this, the possible results of the Shannon Scheme must be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a large quantity of scrap of all kinds in the yard, much of which is valuable, consisting of such things as copper pipes and the like.  This could be readily sold, and for purposes of sale, I suggest it should be carefully sorted.  As to the possible future lay-out of the premises at the east of the Camber, I am of opinion that, generally speaking, a possible occupier would do little as far as actual rearrangement of the existing shops is concerned and, in my opinion, the alterations which would most likely be carried out would be to find storage accommodation in the way of a general store by taking either the workmen's dining hall, the paravane shed, or the present electrical fitting shop for this purpose.  It might also be an improvement if the loan tool store and latrines at the back of same were removed so as to give slightly better access from the smithy to the dock side.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are acting on the engineer's report. The staff, in addition to their other duties which are largely of a maintenance kind, are collecting this redundant machinery and getting it ready for sale.  We feel that it would fetch a much better price if put up for sale in that way than if it had to be sold as scrap.  In addition, there is a certain amount of salvaging being done there.  There is also important work being done as regards breaking up the hulk Garnet.  It is very little value as it is, but it will be of some value when broken up.  It has a copper bottom. The men are also engaged on salvaging the Coralis.  I am sure that Deputy Flinn or anyone who knows the position in Haulbowline must clearly realise that a very large staff is required to maintain the machinery down there.  The machinery is very valuable and it requires a good deal of looking <Col N="1611" /> after.  I do not think it is necessary for me to state in detail the various kinds of machinery there.  Deputy Anthony has, in his statement, given as much detail as I could give.  I gave information to Deputy Flinn, who asked for it, as well as to some other Deputies who I thought would be particularly interested as to the number of staff engaged there.  I do not think there is anything further I can add on that.</P>
    <P>The oil-tanks that Deputy Moore spoke about are of very large capacity &mdash;about 17,000 gallons.  Two of them, I think, are of a capacity of 5,500 gallons each, and there are two others with a capacity of 500 gallons.  If we could we would let the whole lot of them, but at the moment there is no prospect of any firm taking them over for the purpose that the Deputy has suggested.</P>
    <P>I may say that our whole object, if we can possibly do it, is to lease these premises on favourable terms.  In the meantime it would be a very serious matter to cease doing the necessary maintenance work and thereby allow these valuable premises to become dilapidated.  Amongst other people with whom we have been in touch in trying to dispose of these premises in a favourable way is the firm of Messrs. Henry Ford. of Cork.  They have informed us that the place is too far away from their present plant and factory. For the moment there is nothing for us to do except to carry on and try and keep down expenses to a minimum, while at the same time seeing that the machinery is kept in a suitable condition in case any firm comes the way to take control of it.</P>

We are spending £9,500 apparently in keeping a staff to maintain machinery which, according to the engineer's report, is largely obsolete, and possibly would not be used by any lessee who might take the yard for shipbuilding purposes.

      <Col N="1614" /> That is a statement which I, as one who has some knowledge of engineering, was trying to get from the Parliamentary Secretary.  If that is so, is it not the case that most of this staff is being maintained for the sake of maintaining it?</P>

      <P>It is too late to eliminate the redundant part of the machinery now.  The policy is to eliminate what is redundant, and only maintain what is necessary for ship repairing. Originally, when Haulbowline was a naval dockyard, a lot of the machinery was suitable for warships, but not suitable for merchant ships. That has added another complication.</P>

      <P>Frankly, the explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary has not been satisfactory.  I do not want to press him hard, for I think it is perfectly obvious that the intimate knowledge that ought to be in his possession he is uncertain of.  I have here a letter addressed to Deputy Mullins, and it is an example of the type of thing that is going on. He sends a letter to Deputy Mullins telling him that he is sending him some information which he has already given to Deputy Flinn.  It seems that Deputy Flinn is the only person who has not got that information, though he went to the trouble of writing three times for it.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered any of the questions that were asked.  He has not told us what work these boilermakers and coppersmiths are doing.  I can see what the plumbers have done on the houses, which apparently were part of the machinery, but I cannot see any justification yet for the maintenance, at a cost of £10,000, of a staff of between eighty and ninety people, and I do not think that any justification for it has been shown to the House.  It is all very well for Deputy Anthony to go on the principle, &ldquo;I will keep up the number of people employed by the Government at any price, anywhere.&rdquo; That is perfectly easy for him to say, and it would be perfectly easy for me to say.  But the fact that this happens to be near our own constituency is no reason in the wide world why we should not face the fact that every unnecessary expenditure that can be saved must be saved, and that it is our business to contend that it should be saved, whether the contention is popular or unpopular in the districts from which we come.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was asked whether the amount was only £100 he said it was very much larger than that &mdash;very much larger in relation to a total expenditure of £21,000.  It was only when he was cross-examined that he thought it might be larger by £200 &mdash;£300 instead of £100.

I know the difficulty of Haulbowline, and I know what preposterous nonsense my colleague from Cork, Deputy Anthony, was talking when he said that it was an easy problem, when he said that the site was suitable for nearly any industry, and when he said that transport was an easy matter, and was one of the assets.  Transport is the really big difficulty.  If there was any land connection we could do something.

If he does not he is privitively ignorant; he is ignorant of the things he ought to know, before he, a representative from Cork, knowing something about that district, comes to this House to speak about a district in Cork to people who do not know it, and to tell them of the splendid transport <Col N="1618" /> facilities which make Haulbowline such a great asset.

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, if it lost me every vote I ever got, and if it were to lose me every vote I will ever get, I will not ask the Government to spend money which this country cannot afford in maintaining those who are not giving value for it.  I say quite sincerely that if the Government will show that they are getting value in the maintenance of the actual plant; if they will show us that the eighty-eight people who are employed there are doing a day's work, and are, as a result of that day's work, providing value to the State for the £21,000 which is being spent upon this thing, I will back the Government in doing it.  But certainly no attempt whatever has been made by the Government to do so.  How are they going to justify an expenditure of £4,000 on a transport service merely to maintain people who are questionably maintaining things a good many of which, according to them, ought to be scrapped? The maintenance of running machinery is a matter which may require considerable expenditure.  The maintenance of non-running machinery is largely a question of the amount of knowledge and skill which is put into doing something which will last for quite a considerable time.  The amount of money which is required to be spent form day to day on the maintenance of the machinery which is lying idle in Haulbowline ought to be very small.  I had the experience some years ago of buying some machinery, and I brought it to Ireland.  I could not use it, so I put it in a certain store, and three years <Col N="1620" /> afterwards the question of its sale arose.  A man came to see it, and after doing so came back and said: &ldquo;That is a lump of scrap iron.&rdquo;  That is what it looked to him.  He offered me £1,700 for the machinery, and I sold him that scrap iron for £2,500.  That is the difference between maintaining machinery and appearing to maintain it.  I told him then: &ldquo;I thought you would send somebody to inspect that machinery who did not know anything about it.&rdquo;  I might have painted and polished it up, but because I thought he would send an engineer to inspect it I left it in the condition in which an engineer would have left it after maintaining it for that time.  That is the truth with regard to your machinery. You can cover down the most valuable portion of the machinery, and the actual cost of maintenance will be very small, or you can keep footling around it day after day.</P>
      <P>I know Haulbowline fairly well, and there is no evidence whatever given to this House to justify the maintenance of the existing plant there at the cost at which it is being maintained.  No information has been given to the House.  We are anxious to have that information.  We certainly started out to treat it very sympathetically, and if the Parliamentary Secretary will still give that information we will be glad, but if he does not, on public grounds, and quite apart from whatever anybody may think of my action in doing so, I will oppose the Vote, because I think it is the duty of every member in this House in every matter of public expenditure&mdash;and especially in relation to every matter of expenditure in his own constituency&mdash;to see that value is got by the State for the money.  If a satisfactory explanation is not given, I, for one, will vote against this estimate.</P>

      <P>We are very anxious that the Government, at the earliest date, will do something with this place, either by leasing or letting it, so that it will be of some use. It will be much easier for the Government to get rid of this place if the machinery is well maintained and in perfect condition when leasing it or letting it.  If the Government decided two or three years ago to vacate this yard altogether and to allow the very valuable machinery there to be neglected&mdash;and anyone who visits there will set that there is very valuable machinery there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If these were allowed to fall into disrepair, what would we have to offer to anyone?  I do not think Deputy Flinn is quite right in his statement that the men there have nothing to do. I think each man is allotted particular work.  I have gone there on various occasions to investigate these matters, and I am satisfied that each man is allotted certain work.  I do not think there is a single man there who does not do something to justify his week's pay.  There are also boat services.  I do not know if Deputy Flinn considers them extravagant. There are a number of families living on the island.  Are they to be left there sealed up in the place?  What is to transport them backwards and forwards to the mainland so that they may carry on their ordinary avocations? Surely, the service is essential.  I think the Government is thoroughly justified in this expenditure, and I hope they will continue it and keep Haulbowline in reasonable order until such time as they are in a position to dispose of it.</P>

I asked the Deputy the value of it.  I want to know what is the value of the machinery being maintained at a cost of £10,000 yearly.  It is not a question of letting the machinery go to scrap.

I would also like to point out that on the island there is a school and other little institutions of which Deputy Flinn must know.  Again, I would point out that as an ordinary business proposition would it not be worth while maintaining Haulbowline as a going concern, even at a cost of £10,000, until such time as it could be disposed of as a going concern to someone with enterprise in this country or outside it? Again, we should not forget the fact that a hundred people would be unemployed and would be thrown on to what is called the dole or unemployment benefit.  These are facts which should appeal to Deputy Flinn.  I am not appealing to his humanitarian instincts at all, but to his business sense</P>

      <P>We have listened to a great many questions tonight about the details connected with this Estimate.  It is the easiest thing in the world to ask questions.  A question has been asked about the value of the machinery.  It is quite as easy for Deputy Flinn to get the value of the machinery from the engineer, if he is so anxious to get it, as from Deputy Hennessy.  I must congratulate Deputy Flinn on the successful way he has practised his usual tactics of leg-pulling and exercising the mentality of his friend on my left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there has come out of this debate, as I had hoped there would, any useful suggestion from the other side to help the Ministry in what is obviously an extraordinarily difficult and very singular job.  Haulbowline, as we know, is a huge problem and it is a hugely uneconomic problem.  It is a problem where you have a large amount of capital value involved and immense difficulties in the way of turning the whole project into a profitable one for the country.  There is only one thing to do as far as I can make out, and that is to maintain it in the most economic and efficient fashion, so that when the time ripens and use can be made of the place, it will not be a mass of ruins but will be well maintained, an efficient economic unit that can be worked.  Besides the machinery that Deputy Flinn has harped about so much, he must know well that there is an immense amount of capital involved in the building, in the houses, in the stores as well as in the machinery.  We all know how quickly empty houses fall into disrepair and go to ruin.  There are empty stores there of immense value that would cost probably sums running into six figures to-day to re-erect. These places cannot be let go out of condition; they must be maintained. There are one hundred and one other problems of various sizes.  If all the details were gone into, I believe it would be seen that this problem was being treated in an economic fashion, <Col N="1624" /> that the money is not being wasted, and that the men are being usefully employed in maintaining a unit of capital and of national value to the country.</P>

      <P>I wish, in the first place, to thank the city Deputies for their fatherly interest in us, as far as Haulbowline is concerned.  As one who visited Haulbowline on occasions, I wish to say that I always saw the men there working.  I never saw any idlers hanging around there at any rate.  I realise that this is a problem that has to be faced and a problem that has to be dealt with.  But I must agree with Deputy Flinn in saying that we are not getting value for the money.  I would suggest that we have a lot of repairs, and as regards the famous gunboat that does not fire any shots, the boat that goes out after the trawlers and travels half their rate, I suggest when it requires a little repairs, that she be sent into Haulbowline to have them carried out.  There are also dredgers around the coast which could be brought in there, and the repairing of which would give employment for those men employed there and would bring down the overhead charges.</P>
      <P>We have in the harbour of Cobh a first-rate harbour.  But it has now become a third-rate harbour&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because of the want of facilities for supplying oil to oil-driven vessels coming in there.  I would suggest to the Ministry that the oil tanks there should be stored with oil for that purpose, and I think it would be of assistance to the harbour if the oil-burning ships could be supplied with oil there instead of, as at present, having to go away for it.  I think all these overhead charges could be brought down, or, at least, that we could get sufficient employment, sufficient work in Haulbowline, even as it stands at present, in repairing Government vessels.  This would cover the cost of maintenance, and it would not allow the harbour yard to be the dead log it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> I do not know whether there is any truth in the rumour we hear as to different firms, German and others, who are going to take over this yard at each different election time.  At each election time there was a new tribe coming to Haulbowline, and yet not one of them came.  I suggest seriously here that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, not you.  But there were very definite statements made. There were also articles in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner&rdquo; about the Germans coming there.  These used to appear a couple of months before the election was on. We all know what it meant.  I honestly believe that there is a lot of Government work that could be done there. There is, for instance, furniture being made for the different Departments here which could be made there.  There is a lot of work of that description that could be done there by the staff that is employed there at present, and it would prevent the yard from becoming obsolete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make clear that our general attitude on these benches is that we want the people to be kept on at Haulbowline, but we want them to do something for their keep.  At the present moment, there are 89 or 90 gentlemen there who live lives of leisure.  They are provided with private yachts to run them over to the mainland when they want to go there. They have thirteen ferry boat marines at their disposal.  The whole attitude of the Ministry towards the residents of Haulbowline seems to be that they deserve well of the nation, and that they are to be maintained in comfort for the rest of their lives.  We, who speak not for a Cork constituency, but for other parts of the country, have a duty to our constituents, and that is a duty to see that any part of the national funds that are expended will secure a due return.  I think I have said that I do not wish in any way to cast a reflection upon the unfortunate <Col N="1626" /> people who are compelled to live in the present circumstances in Haulbowline. But I do think that the whole attitude of the Department of Finance, and particularly of the sub-Department for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible, is to blame in this matter. They seem long ago to have abandoned the idea that any adequate return can be secured for the amount of money that is being spent in Haulbowline.  We heard for the first time in this House the report of the engineer who had inspected the plant there.  I think that very fact, that it is only in the year 1928 that that report has been secured, is in itself a condemnation of the whole attitude of the Government upon this matter.  Surely the report which informed the Government for the first time that a large part of the plant which it has been maintaining, at the expense of the public purse, is obsolete could have been secured in 1923, and would have enabled them to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary mean to tell me that steam-roller mills were used as beds for patients, that they could not be disposed of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOURKE Mr. BOURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not be disposed of because there was a hospital on the island.  What sort of manipulative surgery was going on that would require steam-roller mills to be kept going as a hospital?  I think that the interruption of the Parliamentary Secretary only indicates the type of mentality that is responsible to the Dáil for the expenditure of this money for the past five years.  He tells us that because there was a hospital in the island, they could not consider at all the question of disposing of the obsolete shipbuilding plant that was there.  The real fact of the matter is, if the Ministry had made up its mind to get rid of the obsolete machinery, that instead of depreciating the value of Haulbowline they would have been enhancing it, because any prospective purchaser who goes there and sees the obsolete plant will realise at once that <Col N="1627" /> if he purchases the place there is a contingent liability imposed upon him of getting that plant out of the way, that it is going to be an expense and a liability, and not an asset.</P>
      <P>These men have been drawing sums varying from £13,000 in 1926-27 to £9,500 in wages from the State, and that plant has been allowed to remain there cumbering up the site which a lessee or purchaser might possibly require for valuable machinery.  The same applies in regard to the electrical end of the undertaking.  We have been told that the engineer has stated that the electrical plant is altogether out of proportion to any conceivable requirements of a future purchaser.  Surely the Department long ago could have made up its mind to dispose of that plant when possibly its market value was very much higher than it is to-day, because every day that that plant remains it is depreciating in value until in the course of another two or three years it will be just as obsolete as the shipbuilding plant which the engineer has reported upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the question which the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary brought forcibly to my notice.  I am not satisfied, even when the new policy which apparently is going to be adopted in regard to this yard is put into operation, that it will be pursued with sufficient energy to make it remunerative.  We were told that in consequence of the engineer's report, and in order to reduce net expenditure as much as possible upon this dockyard, they had commenced to break up the hulk &ldquo;Garnet&rdquo; and to consider salving the collier &ldquo;Alice.&rdquo; I asked when work had begun to break up the hulk, and we were told it began in spring.  Six months and possibly more have gone by, and in that time they have recovered ten tons of copper. I do not know what the market price of copper is, but I would not think it would average much more than £80 per ton.  The total net returns as a result of spending £9,500 is something like £800 at the very most for scrap copper. Surely, if the work on that hulk had been prosecuted with sufficient energy and carried out efficiently, it would <Col N="1628" /> have been disposed of before now, and instead of putting it to the Dáil that this work was going on at the present time, the Parliamentary Secretary would have been able to say that at the beginning of the year they started on this particular item, that they had finished it, and as a result they were £800 to the good.  The work, however, has been allowed to drift on, and I feel sure that the same policy will be adopted in regard to the machinery it is proposed to dispose of.</P>
    <P>We do not wish to oppose the Vote and deprive people of a livelihood; but we would like some assurance that whatever policy the Government has decided on in relation to the dockyard &mdash;and it is time they had some policy&mdash; that it will be prosecuted with vigour and will be carried through so that the net cost of maintaining this undertaking will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOURKE Mr. BOURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say in conclusion.  The present policy of the Government with regard to Haulbowline is to maintain it as a dockyard.  Maintaining it as a dockyard is a different thing from maintaining plant merely.  We have to keep it in such condition that a ship coming there at any time can be dealt with in the ordinary way, in the proper way for a first-class dockyard.  We have dealt with quite a number of ships belonging to Messrs. Furness and Withy, with whom we had an arrangement.  We have also re-commissioned and repaired some of our own vessels and some dredgers.  It has been our policy to keep the place in perfect repair as a dockyard so that we can dispose of it as such whenever an opportunity arises. In order to dispose of it to advantage, we, on the advice of our engineer, got rid of superfluous machinery and material. If, after getting rid of superfluous material, and after having advertised it for sale, we are not able to get rid of it to advantage, then we will consider whether we will do with it as Deputy Flinn seems to suggest&mdash; cease to maintain it as a dockyard and only maintain the machinery.  We must do it at a much lower figure or else we will have to scrap the place altogether. In the meantime we consider that it is worth while maintaining <Col N="1629" /> it as a dockyard until the fullest opportunity has been given to people who might be interested.  We intend to advertise it in Germany and America as well as in England and Ireland, in order to see if any firm is interested. Up to the present we see no very great prospect of proceeding in that direction.</P>

We have no idea, and evidently the Government have no idea, what they are going to use it for. They have taken no steps, apparently, to use it during the past year.  This is going to go on, as far as I can see, year after year, and Deputies will be faced with the alternative of either granting the sum or turning out the present workmen.  As far as I am concerned, I take the view expressed by Deputy Flinn.  As public representatives, we are bound to see that money like that is not being spent without a definite purpose and a definite policy, with some hope of realisation of that policy at the end, and I see none at present.</P>

      <P>The Stationery Office Estimates for the year 1928-29 show decreases spread practically over all sub-heads, amounting in the aggregate to over £13,000.  This Department provides for the use of the Public Services: (a) stationery such as paper and small stationery, stamping instruments, typewriters, duplicators and duplicating and accounting machinery, leather bags, etc., etc., under the Sub-heads J and K: (b) paper for printing, printing  for Departments, Oireachtas, Dáil and Seanad Debates, Bills, Acts, &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil,&rdquo; Sub-heads E, F, G, I; (c) binding, Sub-head L; (d) published books for use of Departments and Oireachtas, Sub-head M.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of supplies to each Department, which is a figure based on the expenditure of the last completed previous year, modified by Departmental expectations for this year, is shown at the foot of each separate Departmental estimate in the Estimates.  The above services are generally free, that is, the cost of them is borne by the Stationery Office.  The Stationery Office also supplies printing, binding, stationery and publications for a number of services the cost of which is borne elsewhere.  The Shannon Development Branch of Industry and Commerce, the Electricity Supply Corporation, the Currency Commission, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Savings Bank, the Roads Department of Local Government, provision of textbooks in Irish for Department of Education, Sub-head F, Vote 47, provision of General Readers in Irish, Sub-head C 1, Vote 49, come under this head.  In these cases the Stationery Office meets all charges and recovers the total cost from the services periodically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Stationery Office does not provide for any requirement of public bodies.  There is one exception, however, and that is the printing of electors' lists, claims and objections, and registers of electors under the Electoral Acts, Sub-head H, page 86.  This is, however, more in the nature of a <Col N="1635" /> national service, and has been undertaken by the Stationery Office since 1918, and the annual register includes the list of qualified electors for Dáil, Seanad and local government elections and those persons entitled to act as jurors.  Four-sevenths of the cost of printing under this service is recovered from the local authorities, as will be seen from Sub-head N, page 87.  Also pages 85 and 87 give in detail the anticipated expenditure and receipts shown on page 85.  Pages 88 and 89 show the actual expenditure of the Stationery Office on supplies to each Department in a previous year, for the information of the Oireachtas and the public, that for 1926-27 being the latest available year.  It would not be possible to have given the year 1927-28, for the reason that the Estimates were prepared in December and January last.  The expenditure of the Stationery Office on page 88 is shown as £32,238.  As, however, will be seen from the footnote, these are mostly purchases for stock to meet Departmental demands.</P>
    <P>The prices of Stationery Office publications have been reduced very considerably in recent years so as to attract the largest public support. Every avenue of developing Irish manufactured stationery is being explored.  This Department at present obtains exclusively from Irish manufacturers its total supplies of writing and fountain pen inks, leather goods such as gusset bags, attaché cases, etc.; gum and office paste, with the exception of small supplies of specialised articles such as glucine; cords and twine for wrapping purposes, rubber stamps, inkstands&mdash;wooden, ink baskets, wooden rulers, metal filing boxes, metal cash boxes, metal deed boxes, metal damping tins, pocket diaries, wood and cord folio boxes, canvas bags, metal seals.</P>
    <P>The expenditure in Ireland on printing, binding, paper and envelopes, amounted to £90,000 approximately in the year 1927-28, the bulk of which represents payments to those actually employed&mdash;Printers, Binders, &amp;c., &amp;c. &mdash;in the production of the work.  With regard to the formulation of Estimates for this Vote, the Stationery Office exercises <Col N="1636" /> the utmost care.  The general service figures are based on the estimates furnished by each Department to the Stationery Office in November of each year, which figures are subjected in the Stationery Office to a close scrutiny in comparison with the most recent figures of actual expenditure on each Department.  Provision must, however, be made for expenditure which it is anticipated will arise as a result of the legislative activities of the Oireachtas, a matter impossible of accurate and at times of even remotely approximate forecast, the only criterion in this case being the actual expenditure on the last complete preceding year. Another factor of prime influence on departmental expenditure is that arising from the number of new Acts of the Oireachtas.  In most cases when an Act becomes operative law there follows considerable departmental activities involving expenditure by the Stationery Office on, say, printing and printing and binding; these may include the printing of Statutory Rules and Orders, Official Notices in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiuil&rdquo; (Sub-head G.S.O. Vote), the extent of which it is impossible to anticipate. It will be understood that there is, unfortunately, now no alternative to the purchase of paper outside our own borders, with the exception of higher grade certain correspondence papers and brown wrapping paper, satisfactory supplies of which, at favourable prices are secured from home sources.</P>
    <P>It will be clear that such items as pens, pencils, typewriters, calculators, adding machines and proprietary articles generally, in default of Irish competition, have to pass to other competitors. Proprietary articles are never purchased, however, where it is possible to obtain something equally good of Irish manufacture, and it is interesting to record that the Stationery Office has in recent years replaced proprietary special binders by articles equally satisfactory made at home, at satisfactory prices.</P>
    <P>The Estimate figures for this Vote for the past four years are:&mdash;1924-25. £187,029; 1925-26, £170,385; 1926-25 £155,325; 1927-28, £137,289; while for 1928-29 the figure is £123,999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not wish to say very much about this Vote because we realise that this Department, though possibly unavoidably expensive, is nevertheless, indispensible and the only thing we would like to be certain of is that the greatest possible return is secured for the money expended. There are a considerable number of publications which have to be issued for the convenience and information of the members of this House who wish to keep in touch with the administration of the various departments. Many of those, we think, have a very high educative value and if they could possibly receive more general circulation, while we do not think it would lead to an actual reduction in expenditure, we think nevertheless, the return which would be secured in the shape of a deeper and more real interest on the part of citizens in the administration of the Government services would more than compensate for any extra expenditure incurred in circulating them.  I remember the time when the price of the Estimates was something like 7/6 per volume.  It has been reduced, I notice, to something like 2/6.  The Appropriation Accounts were equally expensive and the cost has also been reduced in this case.  For myself, I regard it as a tribute to the Department that that reduction in the cost of the official publications has been secured without any increase in the expenditure of the Department.  At the same time, most of us feel that even at 2/6 per copy the cost of these publications is prohibitive.  We also feel the force of the argument, which was advanced on the last occasion, I think &mdash; particularly by Deputy O'Connell&mdash;when this Vote was under discussion, that after the number of copies it is essential to print for the service of this House has been provided, the cost of printing extra copies is comparatively small.  We would like the Estimates, Appropriation Accounts and all those records of official expenditure should be, so far as possible, within the reach of every citizen and taxpayer in the country because if we can once awaken an intelligent interest among those taxpayers <Col N="1638" /> in the expenditure of the public money then I feel we will have gone a long way to arouse a democratic feeling in this country and will have done something to make democracy an effective governing principle in the country.  For that reason I would like to urge on the Ministry and the Parliamentary Secretary the desirability of circulating those two official publications, so far as possible, gratis even, to clubs, public libraries and other centres of social and educational intercourse.</P>
      <P>We are particularly glad to see that the Department, so far as possible, has given a very marked preference to Irish manufacture.  We only regret that the general policy of the Government in relation to a number of industries in the country does not permit the Department to extend that preference, say, to all classes of printing paper.  We feel the Government in that regard should have realised that under present-day conditions paper is almost as essential an article of life as clothes, because people have been accustomed to a widespread publicity of certain matters, to look upon that publicity as essential as other things, in order to enable them to carry on their ordinary, every-day lives.  We would have thought the Government would have considered earlier the advisability of imposing a tariff on paper so that the one mill which was manufacturing printing paper in this country might have been kept going and not allowed to close down.  If that had been done we would have been able in addition to congratulating the Department on the fact that it uses notepaper of Irish manufacture, to congratulate them on having all their official publications printed on Irish-made paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that certain provincial and other printers frequently try to evade, and often successfully, the conditions governing the Government printing contracts, inasmuch as they do not endeavour, at all times, to carry out the Fair Wages Clause.  Two or three instances have been brought to my notice in connection with some of the contracts provided for in this Estimate where great difficulty was experienced, when employing <Col N="1639" /> printers in the provinces, and, indeed, in one case in Dublin, to make them observe the conditions governing the contract.</P>
      <P>There are just one or two comments I would like to pass, more or less of a domestic character, concerning the issuing and numbering of official papers, etc.  A good deal of inconvenience is caused to librarians and others by the system in operation in numbering official papers, such as the returns presented to the Oireachtas, reports of Commissions, etc.  In this case we have an outstanding example in the Report of the Liquor Commission, in which it was very difficult to ascertain where the evidence of one witness ended and where that of another began.  To anybody who has occasion to do research work, it will be found most difficult in that respect, and one's task is increased tenfold.  The British Stationery Office issued from time to time a Guide to Official Statistics. In that Guide they gave a summary of the subject dealt with, and in that case it was quite easy to find at any time the subject dealt with and the name of the speaker, whereas here, unless one has the exact date on which the discussion on a particular subject took place, one is in great difficulty to get the desired information.  In the case of official documents, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that sufficient attention has not been paid to indexing and numbering so as to make them readily accessible to anyone seeking information, such as Deputies here have to seek from time to time.  It would be very useful in future to have such indexing and numbering properly done.  I feel sure that any little extra trouble or labour that would be involved in that direction would be cheerfully given by the Staff of the Stationery Office.  Indeed I must say that this Department is one of the best worked Departments in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer, namely, the advisability of issuing booklets to Deputies.  These need not be of an expensive kind, but they ought to contain the telephone numbers of the various Government Departments, and those of the Ministers and Private Secretaries. <Col N="1640" /> Information of that kind would be very useful, and would result in saving a lot of time.  A Deputy has often to ring up a Minister or his Private Secretary.  He is in the hands of the telephone operators who are also very agreeable and obliging, but it would facilitate him if he had a booklet with the required numbers in it.  So far as this Vote is concerned, I agree with Deputy MacEntee that there is very little to be said.  I join with him in hoping that all official documents and publications will soon be printed on Irish paper.  I would also suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, if it comes under his aegis, that more care should be exercised in regard to the Merchandise Marks Act.  Perhaps the proper place to deal with that would be on the Vote for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but I desire to say that a large amount of printing is coming into the country bearing no marks of any kind to indicate the place of origin.  Printing worth thousands of pounds is being imported in that way, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should cooperate with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in preventing the importation of foreign printing of this kind when so many printers are unemployed in the country.</P>

Since these two institutions were set up they have not, I understand, been regarded as Government Departments, and if one asks a question here about one or the other of them, he gets a reply to that effect, but now it appears that in the Estimates for the Stationery Office, at any rate, they are regarded as Government Departments.</P>

      <P>My only intention in intervening on this Vote is to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the printing of the registers of electors.  I understand that in the case of the majority of the constituencies the registers are printed in Dublin, but I would prefer as far as possible, where there are printing works in the various constituencies, that these registers should be printed there.  Some time ago we had occasion to raise the question of the registers for County Dublin being printed in England.  I am glad to know that they are now printed in Ireland.  I read a Press report some time ago in which it was stated that the President promised so far as Cork City was concerned to make arrangements, if possible, to have the registers printed in Cork.  That principle should, I think, apply to all the constituencies and the printing should not be centralised in Dublin.  While we recognise that there is unfortunately unemployment among printers in Dublin we must also remember that there are also printers unemployed throughout the country.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have the registers as far as possible printed in the various constituencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday last, when speaking on this Bill, I think I was referring to the fact that so far as the restoration of the Irish language was concerned, time and time alone would be the only thing that would restore it.  Certainly this Bill will not suffice.  According to Section 5, no person is to be admitted a solicitor by the Chief Justice unless, before such admission, the Chief Justice is satisfied that such a person possesses a competent knowledge of the Irish language. Naturally, it may be assumed that a person who has a competent knowledge of Irish will be able to conduct his cases in the courts wholly in Irish.  Unless future solicitors have a real, competent knowledge of the language, such as will enable them to present their cases to the court in that language, the Bill will not achieve its object.  Assuming for the moment that solicitors will have this competent knowledge of the language, there is no provision in the Bill to ensure that the judges hearing any particular case will have a competent knowledge of Irish, so that we will then <Col N="1643" /> have the extraordinary position of a solicitor presenting his case in a language that is not understood by the judge.  It is provided in this Bill that the Chief Justice is to be the sole judge as to whether persons qualifying for the legal profession have a competent knowledge of Irish, but there is no provision in the Bill to ensure that the Chief Justice himself will have a competent knowledge of Irish.  Taking the Bill as a whole, I believe, as I said in the beginning, that all this is a waste of time and an unnecessary expenditure of money that could be more usefully employed.  When one considers the present economic condition of the country, the numbers of people out of employment and the thousands of families in need of good housing accommodation, I think that it will be agreed that the Government should be slow in spending public money unnecessarily on the restoration of the Irish language.  I think it would be in the interests of the language not to bring in a Bill of this nature at all.  I think, as I said before, it is a question more or less of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds at one and the same time.  I believe in calling a spade a spade.  It is better to be honest and entrust the work of the restoration of the Irish language to those people who, by virtue of their position, are the only people who can restore it.  I was rather surprised to hear one of the chief Opposition Deputies declare that the expenditure of half a million of money was not very much on the restoration of the language.  I fail to see when we in this country became so rich that we can afford to spend half a million of money and yet consider it very little.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would permit me to interrupt him for a moment, I know that the figure of half a million has been bandied around, but as a fact the annual amount that is being spent on the restoration of the Irish language is much more like one-tenth of that sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. COBURN Mr. COBURN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that, but I was only quoting what had been stated in the House.  I would <Col N="1644" /> be surprised if it were a fact that half a million was being expended.  It may be the opinion of Deputies opposite that that sum should be expended, but it is not my opinion, for the simple reason that we cannot afford it.  We cannot afford to expend any considerable sum of money on the restoration of the Irish language.  Not that I am against the restoration of the language, but I want to see first the economic position of the country improved.  I want, if possible, to see an increase in the employment given, and a good housing Bill introduced into this House, as well as the carrying out of other works that are very necessary at the moment.  I am opposing this Bill because I believe that in the long run it will defeat the object aimed at.  There is no doubt that, notwithstanding the fact that at the present time we are entrusted with the government of our own affairs, the spirit of nationality seems to be less evident to-day than it was ten or fifteen years ago.  Now I ascribe all that to the policy of compelling people to do what they are not prepared to do; in fact, compelling them to do what they will do without compulsion, and what they are prepared to do.  For these reasons, I oppose the Bill, because I believe it would be much wiser in the interests of the language itself if such a measure as this had not been introduced.  I think it would have been much better if instead of introducing this Bill Deputy Conlan, or the Government itself, had consulted the Incorporated Law Society and let that society know what the intention was.  In that way some form of agreement could be come to that would have obviated the necessity for introducing this Bill at this particular time.  For those reasons I am opposing the Bill, although I am convinced that it will be passed by a majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelConnolly" hpid="Mr. CONNOLLY Mr. CONNOLLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOLLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill.  I think it meets a long-felt want.  Irish is the national language of this country, and the Bill is approved of by the Deputies of this House, with the exception of a few who may be relegated to the category of cranks.  They pretend to be supporters of the language, but at the <Col N="1645" /> same time they will not support this Bill.  Because Deputy Conlon, an ordinary Deputy on this side of the House, introduced the Bill, is no reason why reflections should be cast upon his enthusiasm. Irish being the national language, there is no reason for complaint if every profession and every member of the community are asked to be proficient in the language, and that members of the legal profession should be able to state the case for their clients in that language when the necessity arises.  As to the suggestion that the study of Irish is a hindrance to children in the study of other subjects, it is the universal experience that children who have been taught through the medium of Irish have been very successful.  In schools where they teach through the medium of Irish there is evidence to prove that their pupils top the lists in the Intermediate examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many excuses are offered by children to their parents when they have not succeeded in passing an examination. They may say it is the fault of the Irish, but if you challenge those children on that particular statement and put them tests in mathematics, English, geography or history, you will find them deficient in all these subjects.  On the other hand, take the children who have been in earnest in the study of the Irish language and you will find those children most proficient in other subjects.  The study of the language broadens the minds of the children and raises the general standard of their education. I think it was Deputy Professor Thrift who said that the results in recent examinations were not up to the standard of other years.  I do not think that is altogether correct.  The fact is that the standard set for the Intermediate and Matriculation examinations is too high in every subject, and that may be a reason why the children did not come up to the standard the Deputy expected.  I do not believe in Deputies stating here that the majority of the people in the country are dead against the Irish language.  When I was going forward in the last elections I said in the Midlands that I would support the Irish language to the best of my ability on every occasion, and it is my intention to do that.  The people <Col N="1646" /> knew that I meant what I said, and I am doing it.</P>
    <P>What I object to is a Deputy making the statement that he is in favour of the Irish language but that he does not like compulsion.  Such a person, in my opinion, is really more deadly opposed to the language than the man who opposes it outright.  I regard all Deputies in this House as good Irishmen, but they should certainly give the language the help to which it is entitled. I do not think that before he introduced the Bill there was any necessity for Deputy Conlon to have consulted the legal profession.  It is the duty of this House to introduce Bills for what it thinks is right and proper and good for the country.  It would be a strange thing if we established that principle of consultation.  At some future date it would be asked:&ldquo;Why did not the Minister for Justice go out and consult the licensed trade as to what should be the hours of business in licensed premises,&rdquo; and so on.  You can apply the same thing to every Minister and tell him that if he wants to introduce a measure he must first consult the particular class concerned.</P>
    <P>If we were to say for a moment, for the sake of argument, that the Minister for Finance was to go and consult his friends in the country as to how they would like their income tax collected, I think he would find himself in a very difficult position.  Therefore I hope this Bill will receive the full measure of support that it is entitled to receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. HASLETT Mr. HASLETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to speak on this Bill, I must in the first place admit that it is far easier to speak in support of it, because there are a great many platitudes and other things that could be said.  I must say that I am very interested in this debate.  I confess that it is the first real Irish debate I have listened to.  I have followed with as much interest as I am capable the different views put forward, first those of Deputy Conlon and Deputy McFadden, and then the views of the different Parties.  I suppose at this stage one should try to point out that one ought to feel squashed by the storm of eloquence brought forth in support of the Bill.  Very lurid pictures have been painted of some people standing <Col N="1647" /> like inquisitors with flaming swords ready to slay those who speak against Irish.  I cannot see that view-point.  On looking over the speeches I noticed the remarkable thing that no speaker up to the present has stated that Irish should not be taught in the country.  Therefor I hold that the whole thing ranges round the means by which Irish may be introduced as the national language.  It may be necessary to state one's position. We are in a free State, and thought is free, and if one honestly believes that no material benefit can come out of a particular Bill surely one has the right, as the representative of the people, to say so.</P>
      <P>Coming to the Bill itself, I have the greatest regard for its sponsors, Deputy McFadden especially.  I consider him to be a very good friend of mine, and we have had a good many interests in common.  But considering the Bill, I think Deputy Redmond was the first to analyse the speeches that Deputies made in support of it.  To my mind he analysed them very well when he said that there were just two points made in support of the Bill, the first being that it was part of the national policy to introduce the language, and the second that necessity existed in some parts of the Free State for the conduct of legal business in Irish. Strange to say, from all the speeches we have heard in support of the Bill these arguments have neither been supported nor supplemented.  To my mind, the statement that it is part of the national policy is no argument at all. Why should it be part of the national policy suddenly to make it obligatory for entrance to the study of the law to have a competent knowledge of the Irish language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should such precipitate action be taken?  No single argument on its own merits has been put forward as to why this particular Bill should be passed.  I do not want to confuse the issue&mdash;that the Irish language should form part of the national policy.  If I may use an illustration: in the great war when Germany invaded the neutral country of Belgium it was not thought a very convincing argument, when asked why they swept such constitutional <Col N="1648" /> obligations aside and treated them as scraps of paper, when they said it was part of the national policy that they were to make for Paris. Surely a Bill that cuts so precipitately across the national order of a respected institution should have some material reason to support it.  I have listened to the speeches and read the reports in vain to find a reason.  As to the second point, that there is a general demand for the Bill, will any Deputy get up and say truthfully that his constituents are clamouring for it, and that they are impeded and cannot get law enough in the other tongue?  Are they clamouring as they are for drainage, housing, sanitation, employment, and old age pensions, I am told.  I move about the country a good deal and I have never heard this complaint.  Has the legal profession demanded this Bill?  We were told quite frankly that they were not consulted, and that they will not be consulted.  What would we say if the Minister for Agriculture came into this House and introduced a measure, and when he was asked about it, if he said that he had neither consulted the farming community nor anyone else.  I am afraid that from all the benches in this House there would be strong words used.  What our people are asking for to-day is the means and the opportunity to improve themselves socially and economically, and they are quite content to leave the artistic and ornamental until times have improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>Too late, my friend says.  What is five or ten years in the life of a nation?  This Bill prescribes for all who were sixteen years of age on the 1st of January last entering for the study of law, and for the practice of law, that they must possess a competent knowledge of Irish.  I take that to mean to be able to read, write, think and speak it, and not merely an elementary knowledge.  Is not that premature at least by from five to ten years?  It is only four years ago or so since the serious study of it began.  A boy who was then twelve years old may likely enough have been taught by a teacher who was only a learner himself. Can he, in addition to learning the <Col N="1649" /> other essential subjects, be possessed of a competent knowledge of Irish?  I think it is perfectly impossible that he could speak with the eloquence of Deputy Fahy, Deputy Derrig, or Deputy Mongan.  Up to this point I know that I will be described, as some of the rest of my friends have been described, as a West Briton for speaking in this manner.  I think too much has been made of that side of the question in support of the Bill.  Why should we not deal with the Bill itself?  As a great many people have put it to me, why should we not face our own questions in the light of our own experience? It will not help us if we put forward as a reason that another country has a certain sentiment and that we want to oppose that sentiment.  I think that we should address ourselves more particularly in a commonsense way to questions that come before us and leave outside matters to one side.  I flatter myself that I try to see the other person's viewpoint when it is sincere, and I respect it.</P>
      <P>For instance, I can see the viewpoint of the Minister for Education when in the propagation of the language he begins with the child.  I can see his viewpoint there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the Minister for Education and his policy. I am illustrating my remarks by saying that I can see his viewpoint in that perfectly well, and I will tell the Deputy in a minute how I oppose it. The Minister begins with the child that starts going to school at four, five or six, when the child will acquire the language more naturally than if he started to learn it later.  But this Bill, as far as I can see, starts with a person who may have only begun to learn Irish when he was twelve or thirteen years of age, and inside three or four years he is asked to have a competent knowledge&mdash;not the sort of knowledge that may do for a great many positions in the State at present, but a really useful knowledge.  I have never made any secret of my opposition to the compulsory side of the Minister's policy, because I believe&mdash;and it is my own experience&mdash;that <Col N="1650" /> children learn best what they like to learn.  The Deputy said that I opposed the policy of the Minister for Education, and I suppose he considers I am hostile to it.  I come from a district where portion of the Minister's policy could have been made ineffective&mdash;the clause in his Education Bill which provided that if the majority of the parents of a particular school wished, they could opt out from the learning of Irish by making application to the Minister.  As some Deputies know quite well, that policy could easily have been carried out, but in my district not a single school exercised that right to opt out.  If I were to deal with my own experience I might point out that, without very much inconvenience, I could have sent my own children to school across the Border where there is no Irish, but I did not do so; they are at a Free State school and are learning Irish, so that I think the Deputy's point does not carry much weight.  I have stated what is a bare fact, and I will leave it there. Perhaps it is going outside the scope of the Bill, but a matter that has been referred to by a good many Deputies in this debate is the place that Irish takes in the ordinary curriculum of the day schools.  We could with advantage do with less, and we would accomplish in the end perhaps the desire of the greatest enthusiasts for the language. But if Deputies would take what we have in our districts&mdash;a number of small farmers and labourers whose children have no other opportunity of gaining an education except what they get at the national schools&mdash;if a census were taken of these.  I venture to say that the last speaker would find that these people would give expression to their views in a surprising way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might be permitted to make a remark or two on some of the points raised by some Deputies.  Deputy Brennan said that the teaching of Irish in the national schools has not proven to be detrimental to the general education of the child.  In support of that he referred to the scholarship examinations in County Roscommon, which showed that those who are proficient in Irish were also proficient in other subjects. I think it was evident to every Deputy when Deputy Brennan was <Col N="1651" /> speaking that that was no comparison at all, because it was a comparison between pupils who were learning the same thing.  It might not be right to draw comparisons with Northern Ireland, but take Scotland.  Will you find that the average child in the Free State has the same standard of education as the average Scottish child?  Deputy Carney said that there was a demand for this, and he drew a very pathetic picture of the old grandfather and grandmother, the father and mother, and then the child.  The old people could speak nothing but Irish, the middle couple could speak both, and the child could speak English.  I fail to see where the point was, because if anybody was to blame it would probably be the father and mother, so that there was no point whatever in that.  Then we had very great eloquence from Deputy Mullins, who dealt very strongly with those who opposed the Bill, but in spite of all his eloquence, which I admired, I felt that his argument was very crude.  He said that one Deputy who had spoken against it had revealed a slave mind, and yet, practically following on that sentence he said&mdash;these may not be the exact words, but they represent the spirit of it&mdash;&ldquo;Let those who are opposed to this Bill take note that if they continue they will be dealt with.&rdquo;  I speak for myself, and I am not one who is afraid to be dealt with by the law of the land.  I have been a law-abiding citizen, and I am quite content to let the law of the land operate.  Surely, the law of the land cannot operate against a person for what he says or thinks about a particular subject.  Deputy O'Hanlon made what I think, though he is a Northern man, was a curious shot at those who had the temerity to speak against the Bill.  He said that those who spoke against it to-day would take very good care that they knew the language before very long in order to qualify for positions.  I would ask Deputy O'Hanlon not to be raising false hopes in our bosoms.</P>

      <P>We are always glad to see enthusiasm in worthy causes.  We <Col N="1652" /> are glad to see Irishmen enthusiastic about Irish questions and about improving the social and economic conditions of the country, but in regard to these matters I feel that we should consider them on their own merits.  There is one point in the Bill which I think should not be lost sight of, and which, if it is to pass, which I am sure it will, will need amending, and that is the provision which puts it into the hands of one man to say who is to be admitted into this profession.  I think we have too much legislation leaving it to one man, or to a body of men, to decide a matter of opinion.  If we are here as representatives of the people we should be able to find such words, either in the English or the Irish language, as would describe what we want, and not leave it as a matter of opinion.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to rise to support this Bill, and the knowledge that this Bill is to become law, or has every prospect of becoming law, is, to me at any rate, a matter of great satisfaction.  We must have a certain amount of admiration for the gallant fight that is being put up by, I suppose, what we must still call the Unionist Party in this country. They certainly are fighting for the last trench with a determination that is at least to be admired, though we cannot agree with it.  It is not to me a bit surprising, knowing the mentality of that particular section fairly well, that they should adopt the attitude towards the national language that they have adopted in this debate.  It is nothing new to find that particular class opposed to anything Irish.  They do not like anything Irish.  They never did. They represent the people who sent them here, because the people who sent them here do not like our language, our customs, our distinctive national culture&mdash;or in fact they do not like anything Irish about us.  That is about the sum and substance of their opposition. We cannot expect them to change, or at least to change suddenly. Deputy Cooper in particular is strongly opposed to this Bill.  In the course of his remarks on the 19th October he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If there had been any discussion with the governing bodies of the legal <Col N="1653" /> profession, at least with the Bar, one fact would have arisen very early in the debate, and that is the fact that there are reciprocal arrangements between the Irish Inns of Court and the Inns of Court in London.  Members of either Bar, by complying with certain formalities laid down by the Benchers of that Bar, can be admitted to the other Bar.  No examination is necessary. This, as I say, is a reciprocal arrangement.  It has been used very much more by members of the Irish Bar, who have taken up a practice in England, than members of the English Bar who have come to this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as my information on that particular aspect of it goes, it has been almost entirely used by members of the Irish Bar who go across to practise in England.  I do not think that Deputy Cooper will ask us to believe that members of the Irish Bar in future, if this Bill becomes law, will not be allowed to practise in England because they know Irish, because that is what it amounts to.  Bad as they are in England, I do not think they will prevent Irish barristers from practising at the English Bar for the reason that, no matter what other qualifications they have, they had the audacity to learn their national language.  Later on Deputy Cooper referred to another aspect of the situation.  He said, as reported in column 715 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Take the position of a solicitor who intends to have his son join him, first as a partner and then as his successor. The son may now be sixteen years of age, but he was not sixteen on the 1st January.  He may be at a school where Irish is not taught.  There is one such school, a school which has sent very many distinguished men to the Bar and to the solicitors' profession.  It is situated, just across the Border, in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Haslett will know it.  They may teach Irish in that school; I do not think they do, and they are certainly not obliged to do so.  It would be a great hardship if such a boy would have to break his school career and have to go to another school where he would be two years older than the other new boys, and where he would have to acquaint himself with a different system of instruction and adjust <Col N="1654" /> himself to an entirely new atmosphere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot see that any real hardship is going to be inflicted on anybody in this particular regard.  If anybody living in this part of Ireland wants to send his son to a school of law in Northern Ireland and if that school wants to cater for the sons of the people who want to be educated there, I think it is their own business; if that school wishes to teach the national language so as to cater for the sons of solicitors who may prefer the atmosphere in such a school to the atmosphere which does exist in the Saorstát, then it is a matter for that school to teach the national language. Deputy Cooper laments that these students must adjust themselves to an entirely new atmosphere.  The poor fellows! We have great sympathy with them on their coming into a Gaelic atmosphere where they would have to associate with Irish Irelanders and Gaelic Leaguers.  They might lose their carefully acquired accents.  That is an aspect of the matter that should not be introduced into this House at all.  If these people wish to live in this country and to enjoy the rights of citizenship, to which they are welcome, the least they should do is to adapt themselves to and fall into line at any rate with our national aspirations, at least in some regard to fall into line in the matter of the national language. Deputy Redmond during the debate wanted to know why Irish is not made compulsory and applied to the other professions; why is it not made essential for membership of this House. There is a certain amount of logic in that argument.  I for one hope that the time will come in the near future when a knowledge of the national language will be an essential test for membership of this House.  I think it would be more in keeping with the spirit of the nation and more in keeping with our national traditions that such a test should be applied than that we should be asked to take an oath of allegiance to a foreign king.  That would be my reading of it, and I do not think it would be so very revolutionary at all if we were obliged to have a competent knowledge of Irish in this House.</P>
    <P>Then the question was asked about <Col N="1655" /> the medical profession, and why this test is not applied to the medical profession. The Deputy seems to forget that a long number of years ago Irish was made an essential subject for admission to the National University.  He seems to forget that any doctor who qualified at the National University in recent years had to have a knowledge of the Irish language.  It is true that in Trinity College and the College of Surgeons the Irish language has not been made compulsory.  Perhaps the authorities of these institutions will now take the hint, and perhaps as a result of this debate Irish will be made an essential subject by Trinity College and the College of Surgeons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cole has a lot to say on this subject.  There is only one aspect of his contribution to the debate that I wish to deal with.  He said it is a matter of placing another brick on the already troublesome Border question, and he asked is it a matter of trying to drive our children to other centres across the Border.  That brings us back to the old question.  If we have to abandon our National language, and if we have to abandon our National customs, traditions and pastimes, if we have to abandon everything Irish in order to get what Deputy Cole aimed at, well then we are not going to have unity at that price, and it is time that that line of discussion were dropped. We had that kind of unity before.  We had an united Ireland before on these conditions; and I presume, judging by the statements made by responsible men in the North of Ireland and in the Six County Assembly, if we conceded that much and became good West British children, the next thing they would ask from us is to adopt as our national anthem &ldquo;Dolly's Brae&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kick the Pope.&rdquo;  We are not going to do it.  The price is too great.  It is just as well that there would be plain speaking on that question.  Deputy Cole also said:&ldquo;I have been told by people who are supposed to be in the know, and to have considerable influence, that it is useless for Deputies on these benches to oppose this move.  We have been told that the two big parties are out to see which can get the most <Col N="1656" /> credit in this political game....&rdquo; This is not in any respect a political game.  If we are vieing with each other in support of this particular Bill, we are not playing any political game; it is because we have found something in common, something on which we can stand together; and if we find anything tending towards our national advancement and upon which we can stand together in this House, we will do it.  It may be very annoying to Deputy Cole and to other people who hold the Deputy's views to see us do that, but to me it is one of the most satisfactory things that has occurred since I came into the House.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about compulsion, but the strange thing is that the people who talk most about compulsion in the matter of Irish, are the people who were most strongly in favour of compulsion in regard to other matters.  Sometime ago a Bill was introduced here for the insertion of a conscience clause in the Vaccination Act.  Compulsory vaccination got tremendous support from the very people who are now against compulsion in the matter of the Irish language.  Those people were very strongly in favour of compulsion in the matter of vaccination. They cannot have it both ways, and we must come to the conclusion that it is not really the compulsion that worries them, but there is something deeper that these people have not given expression to in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haslett wants to know if our constituents are clamouring for this Bill.  Deputy Haslett has not heard them clamour.  I am quite sure he is honest when he says that he did not hear any people in County Monaghan clamouring for the Bill.  But Deputy Haslett does not mix with the people who want this Bill to become law.  The people he mixes with do not want compulsory Irish, but then those people form only a minor section.  The people who sent me here, and very many other people, too, in County Monaghan do want to see the national language taking its proper place in the affairs of the nation.  Judging by the reception that this Bill has got here, I think the views of that section of the people in County Monaghan are going to be satisfied. <Col N="1657" /> Deputy Haslett wants to know why do not schools opt out.  He says that they could opt out in his particular constituency if a majority of the parents wished.  I am quite certain that they will not opt out when they discover that Irish will be a distinct asset, and there will be far less opting out than the Deputy seems to think when they find that there will be no public position open to them unless they have a knowledge of the Irish language.  The economic situation will be the deciding factor, and when they find that without a knowledge of the language they will be debarred in many quarters from obtaining good public positions, there will be very little anxiety to opt out.</P>
    <P>Every week that passes sees people going wholesale out of the Gaeltacht and out of other parts of Ireland as well.  We are told here that if we make Irish compulsory we are going to drive classes of people out of the country. I submit that our most important duty is, first of all, to keep those people in the country who are prepared to accept our language, our games and our traditions.  I maintain that it is much better for us to legislate for Gaels in this Dáil than for West Britons.</P>

      <P>I have been quite satisfied to give other Deputies an opportunity of speaking on the subject of the Irish language.  I have said so much elsewhere on the subject that I have not much reason to complain.  I find from what I listened to here that anything one would say in regard to this Bill could scarcely be irrelevant.  I remember when first I came to this House I was called to order by one of the Farmer Deputies for speaking on a subject not concerned with the hygiene of cows.  The Ceann Comhairle said that Deputy Doctor Hennessy was not out of order but that his remarks were disorderly. I am afraid there are a lot of disorderly remarks in connection with this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Conlon has proposed this Bill, and Deputy MacFadden <Col N="1658" /> has seconded it.  Neither of those Deputies could be charged with discourtesy.  I know the Deputies fairly well, and I do not think there are two more courteous members in this House. I believe they are perfectly honest and they will hesitate before they go in for any mock courtesy.  Let me ask: What would be the meaning or where would the courtesy come in&mdash;where would be the balm for the wounded bodies of, say, the Incorporated Law Society and the Benchers&mdash;if you sent a deputation to them consisting of Deputy Conlon with a blackthorn stick in his hand, on his left flank Deputy Carney also with a blackthorn, and on his right flank Deputy Mullins with two blackthorn sticks?  I do not think it would make things a bit smoother.  I prefer Deputy Conlon's way of dealing with this matter.  I believe it is an honest way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Bill will pass, and I know I will be taunted that I am voting Unionist.  Certain Deputies have been described as Unionists because of their objection to this Bill.  They have maintained that the position Gaelic is occupying is pure camouflage and that it serves no purpose.  We have been told that we who accepted the Constitution should support this Bill.  I would like anybody to search the Constitution and to tell us where there is anything there indicating that for a pack of defenceless men like the lawyers we are to pass a Bill providing that they must learn Gaelic and have a competent knowledge of it.  I would like to be consistent, and I do not see why a law should be brought in making it compulsory for those administering the law to have a knowledge of Gaelic while the law-makers can go scot-free.  We have heard something about the dim and distant future and what is going to happen then.  So far as I can gather, the dim and distant future means that fifty years hence members of this House and the people in the country will have a thorough knowledge of Gaelic.  The main object is that it will-not apply to ourselves.  If I saw members of this House, especially the Gaelic enthusiasts, supporting a Bill providing that within six months no Deputy would be entitled to sit here except he had a competent knowledge of Irish, I could <Col N="1659" /> understand the situation and sympathise with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there is no analogy for anything that hits ourselves.  That is the trouble.  That is a happy way we have for disposing of awkward proposals.  We are told that the professions want special consideration. They do not want special consideration, they only want to be on a level with the trades unions.  Will Deputies support a Bill that apprentices to trades shall not be qualified until they have a competent knowledge of Irish?  Why will they not do that? Because these apprentices have votes and lawyers&mdash;well, they are only comparatively few and they will not turn an election.  We are also told that the State confers a monopoly on lawyers and doctors.  What monopoly is conferred on them?  To become a doctor, a solicitor or a barrister, a person resident in the provinces will have to spend about £1,500 from the time he starts his preparatory course at fourteen or fifteen, goes through a college or university course, until he qualifies at 25 years of age.  My experience of the professions is that it is a bad investment from the point of view of the return to be got out of it.  Why do we get a monopoly?  Is it in our own interest?  It is not.  There is no other body there to do the work, and we get a monopoly in the public interests.  Of course, it will mean more votes to say: &ldquo;Look at what we have done for you; we have allowed no quack doctors or lawyers to interfere with your interests.&rdquo; That is the reason we have a monopoly.  If any other people were fit to do it, I am sure they would share the monopoly with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A competent knowledge of Irish has been spoken of.  I was always a bit of a dullard myself in languages and everything else, but I tell the House that to get a competent knowledge of Irish would take three years' constant study&mdash;that is, if a person is to do justice to his client in the law courts. That is where the camouflage comes in. We have heard that the standard of <Col N="1660" /> Irish for the National University will be about the standard required for lawyers.  I know graduates of the National University who passed their examination in Irish, and when they were up for positions and had to pass an elementary examination in Irish they did not get a mark&mdash;not half a mark&mdash;nor did they complain of the appraisement of the examiner.  That is what we know about the National University standard.  Of course, I cannot say anything about the effect of making Irish compulsory in the National University. If it is not mere camouflage it will be a serious study, and I can quite understand medical and law students, but medical students especially, going to an English University on that account.  I do not know how that is going to benefit this country, as the £1,500 spent on each student will go to another country.  I know some who have gone already.  They say they will never get anything to do in Ireland, and want to go to the country in which they will have to live in order to cultivate its customs and general business habits, and I believe that is a good investment.  If you are going to make the study of Gaelic a real thing it will be a further incentive to them to leave the country.</P>
    <P>We have also heard a lot about the effect which the study of Gaelic has on other subjects.  I have quoted in another place some of the facts in relation to that.  In the Intermediate Certificate Honours and Pass List, I find that one pupil got as many as six honours with no marks in Gaelic, and his total marks were 1,631.  He failed to pass the examination.  Then we come to a pupil who got a pass in Irish, failed in English, had no marks in Greek, Latin and French, failed in history and geography, got a pass in mathematics and honours in science&mdash;the only honours he got&mdash;a pass in drawing, and had a total of 792 marks.  He passed his examination, whereas the boy who failed in Irish, but got a total of 1,631 marks, failed to pass.  I do not think that is right.  However, it shows one thing, that even if he failed in Irish it did not affect his other subjects, because he was able to get honours in six of them without having studied Irish.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that the boy who got a total of 1,631 marks with six honours failed to get a pass, whereas the boy with a knowledge of Irish with only one honour and a total of 792 marks passed.  Taking the other side of it, I find here that four or five boys or girls, as the case may be, got honours in Irish but failed in all the other subjects or got bad marks in them, with the result that notwithstanding their honours in Irish they failed in the examination.  Is the study of Gaelic such a wonderful thing after all when we get these results?  A great deal has been said about compulsion, and a good deal of confusion has arisen as the result of the remarks made about it.  There are some things to which compulsion is legitimate, but there are many things to which it is not legitimate to apply compulsion.</P>

I know there are Gaelic enthusiasts whose one idea is to have the Ireland of the near future a Gaelic-speaking country when not a word of the hated Saxon's language will be heard.  I was told thirty years ago that in ten years, from that date, all this would come to pass, but it did not and I have grown sceptical.  I would not care to see the English language abolished in this country.  I shall be candid with Deputies.  I think we would lose by it.  It was in English that Robert Emmet spoke, that Wolfe Tone spoke and that Philpot Curran spoke.  I say that the most imperishable lessons in Irish patriotism have been spoken in the English language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing I do not like to see here.  There is too much of the jack-boot and mailed fist display.  I do not believe that the whole Opposition share that and I think if they would use their influence with some of their fellow Deputies it might be very advisable.  It is all very well to talk.  There has been something said about partition, but I really believe that they want to have the unity of Ireland.  We are not going about it as we should.  Those people in the North of Ireland look upon compulsory Irish as almost a religious test and they say: &ldquo;If they do that with Irish then what else may they not do when they get us in.&rdquo;  I think it <Col N="1663" /> would be worth while to give this thing further consideration.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that a knowledge of Irish will stop emigration. We hear bald statements made like that.  Deputies who make them do not feel under any necessity to give any facts about them.  Is there not emigration from every other nation in the world?</P>

      <P>Take Germany. How many Germans are there in America?  We were always told that it was Gaelic Irishmen that founded the great Republic of America.  The Orangeman calls himself a Gael and he has established his claim to be a Gael as well as the southerner.  You have plenty of Macs in Northern Ireland, and we are told they played a great part in establishing the great republic. I believe that will not be denied.  Still, they did not establish the language&mdash;their own language.  I have said that there has been emigration from all the first-class nations of the world&mdash;from Germany, from Switzerland, from Sweden.  There are other countries that have solved emigration and the over-population question in another way and in what I consider a very undesirable way. They have settled it, by race suicide or they have adopted the Stopian philosophy.  I hope that will not come to pass here.  I think the mentality of this country has been practically strangled by the bandying round of certain shibboleths.  I know myself I shall be called a West Briton, a man with a slave mind, a shoneen, a traitor.  Then there is the man who talks of the inferiority complex. I often feel like wishing that man eternal torment.  Anyhow, these are the things that prevail in this country for arguments.  These are the things that make us support any catch-cry.  Well, I wish that Heaven, if only for a week-end, could spare St. Patrick to us so that he might do for <Col N="1664" /> the shibboleths what he did for the serpents.  I need not say that I am going to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Perhaps my figures are wrong.  I think one Deputy spoke twice and that might account for it, but fifteen members only spoke against and over thirty spoke in favour of the measure.  I think most of the points raised against the Bill have been met by speakers in favour of it.  I would like to deal with some points, and with one particularly.  It was said by Deputy Cooper, who started the hare, that I and my colleague, Deputy McFadden, were guilty of discourtesy in not approaching both branches of the legal profession before introducing this Bill.  A great many other Deputies spoke in the same strain.  Deputy Jasper Wolfe worked himself up into a state of wrath over that question.  He considered that we were guilty of grave discourtesy in not approaching the profession.  Supposing Deputy McFadden and I had approached the Incorporated Law Society and the Benchers of the King's Inns and said <Col N="1665" /> to them, &ldquo;We want you to make Irish a compulsory subject at your examinations,&rdquo; I am afraid we would be putting ourselves in a position in which we would be likely to meet with a rebuff. As a matter of fact, if they were inclined to use the language which Deputy Jasper Wolfe applied to Deputy Flinn, we might be met with &ldquo;What abominable impertinence!&rdquo; or, in the language of Deputy Wolfe himself, &ldquo;What colossal cheek!&rdquo; But I think we will probably be met with milder language by the societies concerned. They would be likely to tell us to mind our own business, and if we said &ldquo;We propose to introduce a Bill,&rdquo; they would call that a threat.  We did not place ourselves in that position. We introduced a Bill.  If the principle of the Bill is approved by the House we will then be in the position of acting for this House, and certainly, so far as we are concerned, if any hardship is to be inflicted as a result of the measure, we are quite prepared to meet any amendments considered desirable, provided that the principle to be enshrined in the Bill is not to be interfered with, that is, we are going to have Irish a subject in the examinations for both branches of this profession.  I stated originally when introducing the Bill that I understood the Incorporated Law Society had refused to do anything for the Irish language.  Since then I have discovered that they have made it an optional subject, and have been told that it has been an optional subject for at least twenty-five years. If that is so, the fact that it is an optional subject and has not been effective is a good argument in favour of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many matters I would like to deal with, but I think it is better to get through with the Bill this evening and deal only with a few of the points raised.  With regard to what has been referred to here as the unity of Ireland, Deputy Ward has dealt with that subject fairly well, but not altogether as I would deal with it. Some persons have said here that unity is more urgent than the restoration of the Irish language.  I do not agree with that.  One of the reasons we introduced this Bill is because we regard the <Col N="1666" /> restoration of the Irish language as more urgent than the unity of Ireland. If the Irish language is not saved in this or the next generation it will be lost for ever.  If that occurs there is very little use in doing anything for the Irish language.  I am satisfied that the unity of Ireland will come.  It can wait longer than the Irish language.  Unity may not occur in this generation or the next, but it is bound to come.  Deputy Sir James Craig said when the economic conditions are such as to encourage the people of the North to come in, they will come in.  I agree with him. The people in the North will see that business is carried on in a fashion that it is to their advantage to come in, and they will come in.  It is the economic position of the country that will have its effect there.  I am glad that the Minister for Finance intervened with regard to the cost of teaching Irish.</P>
    <P>It was stated by several Deputies that the teaching of Irish was costing about half a million in money, but the Minister for Finance stated that the actual cost was about one-tenth of that.  Even if it were actually costing more, I do not see why Deputies should object to paying whatever would be necessary to preserve the language.  We want to be quite candid about this.  If I consider how it is that I am sitting here, or if other Deputies consider why they are sitting here, and if we look back some years, we will realise the reason that brought all of us here.  The real origin of the reason why we are here was the fight made throughout the country years ago.  We heard a lot about the hardship that would be inflicted on students of the legal profession if this Bill became law, but what is that compared with the hardships which we, rightly or wrongly, inflicted on the people of this country in order to bring about a position in which we could assemble here to discuss the affairs of the country?  I do not desire to hide our object, and I state that the principal object we had in view during that fight was to make this a Gaelic State.  Some people may say that we have not much chance of doing that, but we are prepared to take our chance, and it is our duty to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> The letter which the President wrote to the Gaeltacht Commission contained a paragraph which, if read by Deputies, would make them realise what the whole thing means.  So far as we are concerned, we are carrying out the policy which had been in our minds even before 1916, and when the sacrifices made in this country and for which some of us were responsible are considered, I do not think that it can be wondered that we came forward and introduced this Bill.  I hope that it will not be necessary to bring in further Bills to deal with other professions, and that they will regard this Bill as a finger-post, not perhaps as a warning, but rather as an indication of what is expected by the people of the country.  I am satisfied that the debate will do much good, despite the big headings in the newspapers about &ldquo;Irish Lawyers and Compulsion, Compulsion.&rdquo; As I say, the debate will do <Col N="1668" /> much good, and when the younger people come to our age they will thank this Dáil for having placed them in the position that they, in their day, were obliged to learn the Irish language, and will in later years be in a position to avail of it.  Unlike many Deputies here, they will not have to regret that they were not compelled, or rather obliged, to learn Irish in their younger days, and they will not, like Deputy Cooper and others, have to spend their time with a book of O'Growney in later life, and then be unable to master the language.  These students will have no difficulty in learning it in their youth, because they will have the groundwork and their enthusiasm will carry them forward.  I do not know whether there is to be a Division on the Second Reading of the Bill or not, but I am content to leave the matter in the hands of Deputies.</P>

      <P>The question which I wish to raise for the purpose of a discussion is the unsatisfactory nature of the replies given to-day by the Minister for Justice concerning two cases of assault and intimidation by members of the Civic Guard in the County Leitrim. The replies given by the Minister to the questions concerning these two cases bear on the face of them, I suggest, the evidence of guilt.  They were prepared, as the Minister informed  us, by the actual men who were charged with having committed the assault in one case, and of being guilty of intimidation in the other.  In order to prove that what I say is correct, I would like to remind the House and the Minister of his reply.  In the first case, that of Mr. Thomas Shanley, of Dromod, Co. Leitrim, he alleges that a member of the Civic Guards visited his house on the night of October 15th and threatened him with violence if, at any time in the future, he was seen outside his own house or met on the public road.  The Minister, anxious to find out the truth about this case no doubt after the question had been put down, made inquiries.  He informed us that an inspector of the Civic Guards called at Mr. Shanley's house but was refused admittance.  I do not wonder that he was unable to get any information.</P>

      <P>And that, consequently no doubt, he was compelled to get his information from the only remaining source&mdash;that is the member of the Civic Guards concerned.  The reply given was that Mr. Shanley did receive a visit from a detective officer on the evening of the 15th of October. The detective officer was engaged in making certain inquiries about the peace of the district, and consequently he called upon Mr. Shanley. He was making inquiries concerning the peace of the district.</P>

The truth of the matter, as it can be vouched for not only by Mr. Shanley but by his father who was present as well as by certain other members of his household, is that his house was raided the week prior to October 15th by two members of the Civic Guards, and a member of the detective division.  I do not know if the Minister would like that I should give their names.</P>

      <P>Sergeant FitzGerald was in charge of the party, and the detective was a gentleman named McCarthy, a native of Co. Cork&mdash;they even get as far as County Leitrim. After the raid on Mr. Shanley's house, a report of the proceedings appeared in a certain weekly journal published in Dublin called &ldquo;An Phoblacht.&rdquo; Whatever appeared in that report&mdash;I did not see it&mdash;the very fact of its appearance thoroughly annoyed this detective officer, McCarthy, and that was the real reason for his second visit to Mr. Shanley's house. Mr. McCarthy inquired of Mr. Shanley as to who sent the report to &ldquo;An Phoblacht&rdquo; and threatened him with violence if he gave any more publicity to their action.  Mr. Shanley replied that he would give equal publicity to any similar action which occurred in <Col N="1672" /> the future.  This Detective Officer McCarthy, who we are told called on Mr. Shanley in the course of making inquiries concerning the peace of the district, told Shanley that he would kick him around the street and leave him in a way in which he could do no more writing.  He would break him up, he said, and warned him not to be seen outside his own door in the future, and that he would keep him indoors for the rest of his natural life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to believe it on the word of Mr. Shanley and of his father and other members of his household who were present. Against their word you have only the word of the detective officer concerned in whose obvious interest it is to give a false answer.  I suggest that he did give a false answer.  He would be leaving himself open to the loss of his position and a possible criminal action if he did otherwise.  My belief is that he did give a wrong answer, and that is borne out by all the circumstances. The other case to which I wish to refer occurred on the same night.  Mr. McCarthy's anxiety to preserve the peace of that particular part of the Free State was apparently very strong that night, because he found that something of a very suspicious nature was happening that night in the village of Dromod. There was an Irish class in progress in the village.  Certain gentlemen, including this Mr. Shanley, attended the Irish class that night for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of Irish which, as we have seen from the debate that concluded a short time ago, is likely to be necessary for persons seeking appointments in this State in the future.  The gentlemen, with an eye to their future prospects, were engaged in the work of making themselves conversant with the Irish language.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that on the night of October 15th the movements of Seán O'Farrell, the gentleman <Col N="1673" /> mentioned in the Question, attracted the attention of the detective officer. His movements were suspicious.  The assembly of a number of young people learning the Irish language attracted the attention of the detective officer. Detective-officer McCarthy was doubtless very zealous concerning the peace of that particular part of the Free State, and he proceeded to make investigations. If he wished to interview Mr. O'Farrell, or any member of the Irish class, he could have done so after the class was over.  He did not wait, however, until the class was over.  He entered when the class was in progress. The fact of his entrance and of other circumstances relating to his entrance can be vouched for by every person present.  There are a number of witnesses concerning every portion of this particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, said that the detective officer, a nice, polite man, called on Mr. Shanley in the course of his inquiries and approached Mr. O'Farrell and asked him to accompany him to the local police barracks.  There must be an implication in that that Mr. O'Farrell refused to go, but Mr. O'Farrell himself was not under that impression. He was under the impression that he was under arrest and that he was taken under arrest to the local police barracks, where this particular detective officer asked him to account for his movements during the day.  Mr. O'Farrell refused to do so, and I think was quite within his rights.  McCarthy thought otherwise, because he immediately retaliated by striking Seán O'Farrell in the face with his clenched fist, and followed this up by a severe beating on the face and head.  After he had been assaulted the first time, Mr. O'Farrell called-upon the sergeant of the barracks.  Sergeant FitzGerald entered the room and remained in it for the rest of the occurrence, but he said nothing and did nothing.  Seán O'Farrell was beaten and knocked into a corner.  He was continuously assaulted on the face and head by this detective officer.  Then McCarthy got tired punching his head and produced a revolver, and proceeded to threaten what he would do to him if he would not answer his questions.  Mr. O'Farrell refused to answer his questions After one <Col N="1674" /> and a quarter hours, during which time he was being almost continuously assaulted, Mr. O'Farrell was turned out on the road.  He was turned out with this threat ringing in his ears from McCarthy, that some night or another his bullet-riddled body would be found on the roadside, and with the threat that every time he met him on the road he would kick him home again.  The Minister, in his reply, said he was informed that there was no ground for the allegation that Mr. O'Farrell was assaulted or seriously beaten.  I am not sure what the implication of that remark is, whether he means that he was not assaulted and beaten, or was not assaulted and seriously beaten.  There must be some qualification there in any case.</P>
    <P>The fact that O'Farrell was beaten can be vouched for by every person in the class who saw him assaulted, and who saw him after his release from the barracks.  A number of people saw him.  For days later his face was bruised and cut, and he was practically unable to eat owing to a dislocation of the jaw.  Does the Minister seriously believe that crimes of this kind, which can be vouched for by a number of people in that district, cannot happen just because persons in the Civic Guards say they do not happen?  Ministers boast about their success in restoring law and order, as they call it, in this country?  Does that law they talk of mean the law of the bully in uniform, a man who goes around the town and arrests anybody he fancies to arrest, assaults him in the barracks and turns him out again, and never during the whole course of the proceedings gives him a word of justification for that action.  Was there any charge against Seán O'Farrell, or any reason to believe he was committing a criminal offence when he attended the Irish class?  Were any orders issued by the superior officers of the Guards to arrest and assault this man?  Is it not a fact that the Civic Guards got a sudden burst of zeal on this particular night, and went on a rampage around the district threatening and assaulting?</P>
    <P>We have had many cases of raids by Civic Guards during the past few days, and perhaps the Minister will tell us, what he has not told us, whether these <Col N="1675" /> are to be attributed to similar bursts of zeal on the part of MacCarthy's colleagues in other parts of the country, or are they acting on a concerted plan? Does that plan include Mr. O'Farrell, one time an elected Deputy for Leitrim?  On Monday last a member of this House, Deputy Corkery, was raided in Cork.  Was that part of a plan?  It is all tending to justify the belief which members of this Party hold, and which many people throughout the country hold, that this detective division of the Civic Guards is being kept in existence to ensure that the spirit of the civil war will not die, and that conditions will be maintained which will enable the Free State Government to play its trump card at elections and to secure its return by a majority.</P>

      <P>Getting up and making charges and not giving an opportunity to reply is very often happening, and it is not playing the game.  We have heard a nice lot of pleasant rhetoric from Deputy Lemass in the last few minutes, rhetoric which we heard earlier in the day, and which was possibly more suited to the debate this afternoon.  It seemed to me to be waste of time to-night.  Deputy Lemass started off by saying that the report furnished to me was prepared by the actual man against whom the charge was made. The Deputy, as far as I can gather, says there is only one detective officer and only one charge.  That officer did not prepare the report.  The report I have received, and on which I have acted, is a report prepared by the superior officers who had gone into this matter.  Deputy Lemass talked about the young man Shanley.  He told us that Shanley's house was visited and that Shanley in his own <Col N="1676" /> house in the presence of his father was threatened.  I would like to know, if that is the case, why Shanley's people would not give any information when a visit was paid by an officer to investigate the charges? They will give no information.  If these charges are true, why will they not give them to the officer?</P>
      <P>If these gentlemen go to the trouble of coming here to see Deputy Lemass, or getting an intermediary to interview Deputy Lemass, why are they tongue-tied in the presence of the police officers?  If there is any truth in this charge why do they refuse to give information? Deputy Lemass, an astute debater, slides over that.  Deputy Lemass told us that Shanley was told he was not to leave his house, and that he was to stay the rest of his natural life in his house.  That occurs in the afternoon of the 15th.  Where do we discover Shanley on the night of the 15th?  Not in his own house, not cowering in fear because he is subject to what Deputy Lemass calls the law of the bully in uniform.  Not at all.  We discover this gentleman nicely off attending an Irish class in the town of Dromod.  That is the story we are asked to believe.  It is absolutely watertight, absolutely to be believed.  And here is Shanley, as Deputy Lemass very candidly remarked, attending an Irish class, not out of love for Irish evidently, but for what seems to be the reason given by Deputy Lemass, that this young man and the other persons attending the Irish class thought they could turn a knowledge of Irish into £ s.d.  If these are the sort of gentlemen who take up Irish because they can cash it, then that is a very poor type of procedure.  I come on to the second case, the charge which was brought against this same officer with reference to an alleged assault upon Mr. O'Farrell. The Deputy says he was brought to the barracks and that he was hammered there for an hour and a quarter and that he came out with a dislocated jaw.</P>

      <P>What did the Deputy say?  That he could not <Col N="1677" /> eat for several days as his jaw was dislocated. I suppose little details do not matter.  The Deputy has been loosely briefed, or he has not gone to the trouble of carefully reading his brief. The Deputy probably does not believe very much in the case or he would read it more carefully.  This gentleman, Mr. O'Farrell, who is supposed to have been hammered for an hour and a quarter, comes out in a terrible condition.  This happened in the barracks.  He was undoubtedly in the barracks and this attack was supposed to have been made in the barracks.  There was not simply one particular officer in the barracks but there were others, and according to the report which I have received, and which I accept, that man was not assaulted in the barracks.  He made no complaint on leaving the barracks of having been assaulted.  If this man has been assaulted, or has been in any way molested, if a criminal offence has been committed by these Guards by assaulting him, then the courts of the country are open for this man to go into.  The proper course for him is to take proceedings and to go into these courts.</P>

He tells us the man will not go into the courts, but we are to hold a police inquiry in which everything is to turn on his evidence. <Col N="1678" /> Then Deputy Boland and Deputy Lemass will say this gentleman is of the mentality that he will attend a police inquiry into the conduct of the Civic Guards, and be examined on oath, but that he will not bring a civil or criminal action against them.</P>

      <P>An appeal was received on the 14th April last arising out of a question by the pensioner for an increase of his existing rate of old age pension (4/- a week).  It was reported that he lived with his wife, two sons and a daughter on a farm of land (Poor Law valuation, £1 15s. 0d.) carrying some stock and with some tillage. <Col N="1533" /> There is also a shop, the profits from which, including proceeds from egg dealing, were estimated at £40.  It was not clear, therefore, on the evidence, that the pensioner's means, as calculated for pension purposes, were less than £31 7s. 6d. a year, and by a decision dated 11th May, 1928, it was determined that he was not entitled to a pension at a higher rate than 4/- a week.</P>
