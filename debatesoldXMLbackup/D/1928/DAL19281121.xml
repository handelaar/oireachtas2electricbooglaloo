      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state the details of the Agency Agreement under which, as stated by him on the 9th May last, income tax assessments made in 1922-23 were made by the British Board of Inland Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agency Agreement merely provided that as from the 1st April, 1922, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and the Special Commissioners should continue to exercise on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of <Col N="401" /> the Provisional Government the functions hitherto performed by them in the area now comprised within the Saorstát, that they should retain control of the staff, and that they should pay the nett proceeds of income tax, etc., collected by them into the Exchequer Account of the Provisional Government. It provided for the Commissioners being recouped all expenditure incurred by them, subject to the rendering of accounts to the Ministry.  It also provided that new appointments were not to be made without the concurrence of the Ministry, and it reserved to the Minister for Finance the power to make arrangements for the hearing of appeals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will bear in mind that during the transition year 1922-23 a separate Saorstát income tax was not imposed, income tax being assessed and collected as if Great Britain and the Saorstát were still one area for taxation purposes.  The revenue so collected was subsequently attributed to the respective Exchequers, such attribution being determined broadly on the basis of residence.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, our own Board of Revenue Commissioners came into existence on the 1st April, 1923, and, commencing with the year 1923-4, took over all the functions previously performed in our area by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The gross income under each schedule coming under review for income tax purposes for the years 1923-24, 1924-25, and 1925-26 has been published in the Annual Reports of the Revenue Commissioners. Statistics relating to the year 1926-27 will be forthcoming shortly.  It is not possible to state the gross earned and unearned income in each year, but, on the basis of the earned income allowances, it is estimated that the earned actual income under all schedules is in the neighbourhood of £30,000,000.</P>
      <P>As regards the apportionment of earned and unearned income between each schedule of the tax, income assessed under Schedules A and C is practically all unearned, and that assessed under Schedules B and E is mainly earned.  Schedule D assessments cover both earned and unearned income, but it is not practicable to segregate the gross figures.</P>

Mayo, is in a very bad state of repair; that for the past six months the pupils have been temporarily accommodated in the chapel attached to the local Franciscan Monastery; that representations have been repeatedly made by the manager to the Education Department and the Board of Works as to the necessity for executing the necessary repairs to this school, and whether he will state what steps are now being taken to provide the necessary accommodation for the pupils of this district during the coming winter.</P>

      <P>The building hitherto used as a school for the girls is too small for the number in attendance, and is structurally unsuitable.</P>
      <P>The manager made application, towards the close of 1925, for a grant to enlarge the school building.  As the school was non-vested, it was not possible to accede to his application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the vesting of the premises to admit of a grant for additional accommodation was, at the instance of the Department, investigated <Col N="405" /> by the Board of Public Works; and in their report, of February of this year, a recommendation was made that the proper solution of the case was the erection of an entirely new school.</P>
    <P>Forms of application for a grant for the erection of a new building were sent to the manager in the same month. On their return by him, the necessary inquiries preliminary to a decision to sanction the erection of a new school were made, and the manager was advised in July last that provisional sanction had been given for the erection of a new schoolhouse.</P>
    <P>The question of the title to the site and of the estimated cost of the new building has been the subject of correspondence with the manager and Board of Works, and is at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>Terence Connolly, of Drumgoan, Carrickmacross, claimed unemployment benefit on the 2nd July, 1928, and furnished evidence of unemployment up to and including the 27th September, 1928. The claimant had to his credit in the Unemployment Fund one hundred and thirteen unexhausted contributions in respect of which he would have been entitled to so many days of unemployment benefit if he was able to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit, one of which is that he must prove that he is continuously unemployed.  On the facts of this case the Insurance officer found that this statutory condition was not <Col N="408" /> fulfilled, and accordingly he disallowed the claim.</P>
      <P>The claimant, in exercise of his right, appealed to the Court of Referees, which recommended that benefit be allowed.  Further inquiries having been made and the fresh information elicited that the claimant on the former occasion had stated his holding of land to be four acres whereas it is in fact over nine acres, the case was again submitted to the Court of Referees for reconsideration, but the recommendation of the Court on this occasion was the same as on the first.</P>
      <P>As the Insurance Officer was unable to agree with the Court's recommendation, the case was sent to the Umpire, who, in giving his decision that the claim must be disallowed, stated that the claimant's holding is too large not to provide suitable employment for him when he is not working for wages.</P>

A committee was appointed by the Conference to deal with the question of freight charges on fresh pork, and, as a result, a large number of reduced rates to London were arranged to operate from the 1st February, 1928.</P>

It subsequently transpired that the lands were <Col N="420" /> not untenanted, but were tenanted lands subject to judicial rents, the tenancy interests in which had been acquired by the father of the present owner and had not merged in the fee. They were published in a further provisional list of tenanted lands on 8th November, 1927, and notice of intention to retain the holdings was published on 7th February, 1928.  The Land Commission propose to apply for an order authorising them to resume these holdings and fixing the resumption price thereof.</P>

Kerry (Estate&mdash; Trinity College No. T. 183/29); whether he is aware that Mr. Brassill signed the purchase agreement in the year 1912, and whether he will state when it is proposed to take the necessary steps to vest the lands in the purchaser.</P>

      <P>This estate is the subject of proceedings for sale by the vendors direct to the tenants under the Irish Land Acts, 1903-9, and purchase agreements in respect of 84 holdings have been signed by the parties and lodged in the Land Commission in 1912-1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the turbary in the townlands of Aghnagran Middle, Leanamore and Gurteenacloona on this estate is within the ambit of the tenanted holdings, and the Estates Commissioners, after the inspector had visited the lands and furnished his report, required the vendors to prepare a turbary scheme of allotment with maps and schedules showing the turbary allotments for the tenants laid off, accompanied by the tenants' consents to accept such allotments.  The vendors prepared a turbary scheme and the majority of the tenants signed consents accepting the exclusive right of turbary on their allotments in lieu of any claim to turbary under their purchase agreements or otherwise, and agreeing that said right of turbary <Col N="421" /> should be vested in them and be consolidated with their holdings, but certain of the tenants refused to sign such consents.</P>
    <P>In addition to this refusal three tenants on whose holdings the majority of the turbary allotments were situated have refused to sign consents to their holdings being vested in them subject to the right of the other tenants to cut turf on the allotments given them under the scheme prepared by the vendors. As repeated attempts by the Land Commission inspectors to obtain the outstanding consents have proved abortive the Land Commission have under consideration what action they will take as regards the turbary on this estate.</P>
    <P>The vesting of the holdings in the tenants on this estate, including that of Timothy Brassill, is held up pending the settlement of the turbary question.</P>

      <P>It will be noticed that there are certain small increases in this Vote for the Office of the Minister for External Affairs.  I do not intend to delay very long over the details of the Vote.  I regard it in the present circumstances as being in the nature of a token Vote, as a Vote that is going to show considerable expansion. The Department has to be reorganised at headquarters and as far as the foreign offices are concerned. There will be presented to the Dáil, according as this reorganisation takes place, certain Supplementary Votes.  A better definition of the business and a better method of handling the business which will follow that reorganisation, can best be debated as the Supplementary Estimates are brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noticed that the small increase in the Vote is made up mainly of two things.  There has been increased provision made for hospitality on the part of the Government towards distinguished strangers.  Actually that Vote is built up by the process of estimating in the course of the year and on foot of reports received as to the people likely to visit the country.  The other point in which the Vote shows any great increase is accounted for by the fact that extra trade inspectors have been appointed in Great Britain, owing to the fact that we are looking for an extension of markets and an improvement in the standard of Irish produce exported.  This has led to increased work on the part of the trade inspectors in Great Britain and to further expenditure in connection with them.  The general policy of the Department <Col N="432" /> is best looked at under two heads, the policy with regard to the British Commonwealth of Nations and the policy with regard to the rest of the world.  With regard to the relationship to the British Commonwealth of Nations, one has to look year by year for certain advances and in that connection one can glance back at the Imperial Conference Report of 1926 where is definitely stated the attitude of the members of the Commonwealth of Nations towards that particular Association.  There it was laid down that the instrumentality through which that Association was guided was the instrumentality of free co-operation.  It was stated that each of the different nations in that Association was the sole judge as to the extent to which that co-operation would be given.  There was a further statement made that the separate units of the British Commonwealth of Nations were autonomous States, equal in status and free in every aspect in their domestic or external affairs, but while so stating that, there is definite recognition that in certain minor points there were certain points of administration or even of judicial procedure in which recognition of co-equality could not be said to be established.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department has been and will continue to be the consolidation of the co-equality expressed at the last Imperial Conference, and in furtherance of that to seek to eliminate all the forms which in some of the Dominions more than others, and in most Dominions much more than here, are said not to be in accordance with the particular definition that was given &mdash;the intention, in other words, to eliminate any possibility of doubt there might be arising as to the supreme and conclusive authority of the Parliament of this State in all matters external and internal concerning its interests.  Certain matters were segregated in that Report and left for discussion by a committee, which should have been established this year.  There again the internal affairs of each of the Dominions had to be taken into consideration, but owing to the fact that general elections were pending in certain of the Dominions, it is impossible to say at <Col N="433" /> this moment when the committee will meet.  It certainly must meet in the course of next year.  With regard to the actual progress made in the matters that were dealt with at the Imperial Conference as to the elimination of certain points on which doubt might have been raised as to whether the statement of co-equality was a clear and definite statement as to the relationship that existed, three items might be pointed out.</P>
    <P>If I segregate the items, I do it because they are the three that immediately rank as being a definite advance. In regard to one of them in particular, as to the phrase used in the Imperial Conference document it must be remembered that while a certain position with regard to the Governor-General was generally recognised it was admitted there might be doubts arising in reference to the Governor-General by reason of the method of his appointment, or by reason of certain things done by him in certain other Dominions.  Those doubts did not arise to any extent here.  In so far as doubt did arise as to the method of communication as between the two Governments that doubt no longer exists.  Official communication takes place direct.  The second point which was adverted to in the Imperial Conference document was with regard to the issue of exequaturs to foreign consuls.  What was stated in the Imperial Conference document has come to pass in this country, that is to say these documents are sent direct here and are countersigned by the Minister for External Affairs.  The third item to which one might refer is the question of full powers issued to representatives of the different Dominions at any international conference. It can now be said definitely and clearly that plenipotentiaries of the different Dominions go to the Conference armed with full powers from that part of the Association which they represent.  Each Dominion Government has its full powers limited to itself.  There is not given to any one power any higher status over the others. In relation to countries outside the Association of the British Commonwealth of Nations, there is one important point which had its re-action later <Col N="434" /> in the year, and to which reference should be made.</P>
    <P>I refer to the visit paid in January by the President of the Executive Council to the United States of America for the purpose of thanking the American people through their President and Congress for the interest they have always taken in this country, and to the support constantly given to the struggle made here for independence. That particular visit and the reception accorded to the President are too fresh to need any detailed reference here, but it is well worth recalling that the President sent a message to the House of Representatives thanking America through that House for the manner in which America had fulfilled the promise of help made by Benjamin Franklin.  It is worthy of note that this message, contrary to previous precedents, was read out in the House of Representatives during the sitting and so becomes part of the official record of the proceedings of that House.  That had a re-action, the re-action being that later in the year the chance came to this country to be one of the first of the nations to accede to the Kellogg Peace Pact proposal, and immediately after the signature of that Pact we had the honour to receive the Secretary of State for the United States, and to show him by the particular welcome that was given to him here how great a connection there was between this country and the United States and how very definite the feeling was here as to the help that country had given to this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department must be to consolidate internally the position of the Free State, and to maintain and extend the sovereign and exclusive control of the Free State over all its internal affairs.  Here one aspect of the re-organisation of the Department must be looked to.  With a view to the important business that is ahead arising out of the last Imperial Conference Report, one can see in connection with that the Committee that is to be set up to consider certain Constitutional questions.  It has been decided to transfer from the post at Washington to the vacant post of High Commissioner in London the present representative <Col N="435" /> at Washington to whose tact, general ability and efficiency is due a great deal of the success in establishing our position in the United States. Further from that, and apart from the Washington post vacancy which occurred by reason of the transfer of Professor Smiddy to London, it is the intention of the Department to come before the House with a proposal to establish two legations in Europe, not to appoint two trade representatives, but to open an Embassy in Berlin and another in Paris.  This is part of the general re-organisation I spoke of and proposals in that connection with regard to supplying money for these offices will have to be made to the Dáil later on by way of Supplementary Estimates.  It is proposed that these Embassies should be opened as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, and again rendering the position of this Vote rather that of a token Vote, there is to be carried out a certain re-organisation of staff, a re-organisation which has been badly needed for some years but which could not be taken up previously because nobody could have a clear idea of the amount of work that was to fall on this particular Ministry.  It is recognised that in the absence of that re-organisation the Dáil and the public generally have had to suffer through the absence of the fullest and most complete information that could be given regarding the activities of that Department both at home and abroad.  It is hoped that when the re-organisation takes place and the staff is put on a different basis, it will be possible to supply members of the House and, through the House, the public generally, with reports as to what is happening.  There ought to be the fullest possible exchange of information as to what is going on in the foreign offices, including what is supplied to the headquarters staff here and what filters through them to the other offices abroad.  How much of this information it will be possible to give to the members of the House and the public will depend upon the degree of organisation that is achieved and the time in which it is achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> When that is being done it is proposed to clear up certain anomalies with regard to the nomenclature adopted with reference to representatives abroad.  If Deputies will look at the Estimate they will see that there is one Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at the office in Washington and a trade representative in the office in New York.  Then there is a representative in Brussels, a trade representative in Paris and so on.  It is proposed that these names and positions should be regularised and the new proposal will include the putting of all of the officials of the Department on a definite basis with regard to salary, adding on to that salary certain allowances equivalent to the cost of living bonus and certain extra allowances which it is thought ought to be given to them in accordance with the positions they are expected to keep up in the different places where they are appointed.  These proposals will come up later.  I mention them now because, in so far as any Deputy wishes to debate any of these foreign offices, it would be much better that that debate would come at a later stage when these proposals are before the House.</P>
    <P>One cannot enter upon an extension or re-organisation of a Department like this without having clearly before one's mind the use to which the Department will be put and the work it will have to handle.  It is quite clear from what now faces the Department that extra staff will be required and better channels of communication as between the different offices and the Department will need to be established.  How far some of the offices at present existing will require to be kept on in the present state, or may have to suffer certain changes, will have to await decision until we are in a better position to judge the changes ahead.  The immediate changes, apart from the transfer of Professor Smiddy from Washington to London, are the opening of the two legations, one in Berlin and the other at Paris.  Appointments will be made to these offices in due course.  Previous to any appointment being made the Dáil must be consulted with regard to the supply of funds for the offices.</P>

      <P>Inasmuch as the Minister for External Affairs has said this is little more than a token Vote, and that we are going to have shortly an opportunity of discussing more fully the various activities of the Department, no good purpose would be served by discussing the matter now at very great length.  All of us have been very interested in the statement with respect to the relations of the Executive Council with the British Government and the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We are glad to see, as regards the position of equality which has been spoken of so much, that an effort is being made by the Executive Council to maintain that position.  We are only sorry that it can be little more than a surface equality, because the fundamental document on which this whole thing is based is one which, in fact, denies Ireland anything like that equality.  Our principal objection to the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs abroad is that instead of making clear to the countries where our representatives are what are the real wishes of the Irish people, on every occasion on which representatives of the Executive Council speak they make it appear that the Irish people are in this position of their own free will; that the Irish people have voluntarily entered into this partnership and have become a part of the British Commonwealth.  We all know that that is not true, and no attempt has been made by our representatives abroad to make it clear to those who supported us in our struggle from 1919 to 1921 that the partitioning of this country did not come about with the consent of the majority of the people of this island, and that in fact the British Government, by maintaining this position, very effectively deprived this country of any advantages which it could have and would have by being independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of our people in respect to Imperial policy in general is not made clear abroad.  It is not made clear to the people, for instance, that if there were to be another Imperial war that it is the wish of the Irish people to be neutral in that war; that it is not and will not be with the consent of the Irish people that the British will claim to have in the neighbourhood of some <Col N="438" /> of our principal ports all the facilities for their navy and their air force that they may desire.  Consequently, whilst we are glad to see that the Executive Council are at least stating that they mean to hold this position of co-equality, we believe that it is in fact not representative of the true position at all.  As I said at the start, the fact that we are going to have an opportunity later of discussing this matter more fully makes it hardly necessary for me to inquire from the Minister for Finance or the Minister for External Affairs what are the routine activities of this Department.  A sum of £34,000 is being spent upon them.  We all know that you can spend practically any sum of money you like on this Department, and we ought to be satisfied in passing these various sums for these offices that we are getting some good return for the money spent upon them.  I noticed that the total sum spent upon the office in London amounts to close on £14,000, and that on the office in the United States an amount slightly over that sum is spent&mdash;£14,700.  I would like to know more in detail what is the routine work that is being done by these Departments, and any exceptional work they have done during the past year and that they propose to do in the rest of this financial year.  We would also like to know why a representative is being maintained, for example, at Brussels and that Paris is only being put on the same level; and that Berlin is not represented at all.  We see that those omissions are about to be made good, and we are glad.  We would like to know what are the trade activities of these representatives of ours abroad. How far have they been able to increase the direct trade between Ireland and the countries where these representatives are?  Looking through the trade reports we find very little advance. There is some advance, but it is very little, and we wonder whether the Department of External Affairs is really active.  It is a confession that it has not been properly organised that it is now about to be re-organised.  To a large extent criticism is more or less prevented by the confession on the part of the Minister that things have not been what they should be.  But we are interested, in any case, in knowing what <Col N="439" /> has been done and what it is proposed to do now.</P>
    <P>Authoritative statements were made recently that 78 per cent. of our total exports are agricultural produce, and of these, I think, 97 per cent. goes to a single market.  If that be so, we would like to know what efforts are being made by the trade representatives of the Department of External Affairs to secure alternative markets, to secure the thing that is so necessary if we are really to be in a strong position at all. If you look at some of the other countries, some of our competitors in the British market, Denmark, for instance, a considerable proportion of its butter exports, one-third, I think, of as much as goes to England, is sent to Germany. Is there any possibility of our getting alternative markets on the Continent which will put us in a better bargaining position than we are in at the present moment with respect to Great Britain?  These are questions we would like to get an answer to.  But the fact that we are told the whole thing is going to be reorganised will deprive some of these answers of very great value.  Still, if the Minister is prepared to give them to us, they may prepare us for a proper understanding of what is intended when the proposition of establishing a legation in Paris and another legation in Berlin is brought forward.</P>
    <P>As I indicated already, the objection of the Deputies on this side is mainly to the representations that are made by the representatives abroad, that the true situation here as it existed from 1921 is not made known; that the position is constantly misrepresented, and that when the time comes that the Irish people will stand by the ideals that they really have, and when they are prepared to see that these ideals are made good, the whole national position will not be misunderstood.  Before the struggle went on from 1916 to 1921 Irish aspirations were very definitely hidden away from the world.  It should be the purpose of any representatives of a Government that claims to represent the Irish people to see that every advantage was taken of the position to make clear what the desires of the Irish <Col N="440" /> people really were.  It is on that account that we think that whilst this money could be well expended it is not being well expended at present, and we are compelled to vote against this particular Estimate mainly on that account&mdash;not that we do not think that the Department, if properly organised, and if the trade representatives really make known to the world what the Irish people mainly desire, and what was the cause of the present position, that it would not be money well spent. We believe the money would be well spent, but we do not believe that a case has been made for the money that is being spent at the present time.  I think that is all I have to say on it at the present moment.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is replying I would like if he would tell us something more about this Committee that is to be set up as a result of the decision of the last Imperial Conference.  I am glad he mentioned the matter, because it is one of the things I was to inquire about.  I had intended asking what has become of it.  I believe that the Committee promised to be a very important one. I do not think the explanation he gave for the two years' delay in setting up that Committee is anything like satisfactory. I would like to know what the Executive Council has done towards urging the setting up of that Committee.  I would like if the Minister would explain that.  We have arrived at a certain admitted position of equality and the position is that, with regard to the various Acts of Parliament, if they were to be interpreted literally, they do not coincide with that position, for as a matter of fact the present position is quite contrary to that set out in the Acts of Parliament. I take it that refers to the British <Col N="441" /> North America Act and the Colonial Laws Validity Act and Acts of that kind.  I am specially anxious to know if the Act under which this State has been set up would be equally open to reconsideration.  There are, I take it, certain things in these two Acts that must be reconsidered in view of the new position of Canada.  We have the same position as Canada in the Commonwealth. If that is so, I should like to know from the Minister whether he is in a position to give expression to any view as to whether the Act under which this State has been set up is equally open to revision in those portions which do not coincide with our present status as defined by the Executive Council and the Imperial Conference.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy de Valera speak of our trade facilities.  I, too, would be anxious to know what is being done in that direction, whether the Minister is satisfied, say, that one trade representative at New York is sufficient to advance the interests of the Free State not only in the United States, but in Canada.  I happened to attend&mdash;some of my colleagues can bear me out in this&mdash;a great fair or exhibition in Toronto which is held every year, and which is, I think, one of the largest exhibitions held on the other side of the Atlantic&mdash;one of them, in any case.  Over two million people visit that exhibition in the course of the summer, many of them from Canada and many from the United States.  I was rather sorry to see that the Free State was only represented by one small stall there&mdash;an exhibition of woollen goods, and not a particularly good one.  Messrs. Jacobs had a small display there too.  It struck me, especially when I saw what was done by other countries, that very much more advantage could be taken of an exhibition of that kind to bring to the notice of these two million people goods produced in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, as a result of inquiries which we made, we found that in Canada and in the United States, too, but especially in Canada there appears, so far as one can judge, to be a great opening for Irish woollen goods, Irish tweeds especially.  The best quality of suitings there are all imported <Col N="442" /> from Scotland or England, as the good quality is not made in Canada. There is no reason why, if the material produced here were pushed there by trade representatives, a very good market could not be obtained for it.  The Minister may have more information on that matter than we have, but as a result of any inquiries we made we were led to the conclusion that there would be an excellent market in many of the provinces of Canada for Irish woollens&mdash;Irish tweeds, serges and worsteds especially.</P>
    <P>In that connection I may also say that in one large wholesale dry goods store which we visited we inquired, amongst other things, whether they had any Balbriggan hosiery.  We were told they had.  They produced stuff which, even to uninitiated people like ourselves, was not Balbriggan.  It was a very poor quality of cotton.  On making further inquiry we discovered that &ldquo;Balbriggan&rdquo; was a trade name for a rather poor quality of cotton goods.  I do not know whether the Minister or his trade representative would have any control over a thing like that.  Undoubtedly we found that to be the fact, that they were displaying or selling cheap cotton hosiery which was sold under the trade name of &ldquo;Balbriggan,&rdquo; and which, of course, had no reference to our Balbriggan or the hosiery produced there.  These are all the comments which I wish to make now, in view of the statement made by the Minister that we shall have a further opportunity of discussing these things.  I should like him to say, however, if any progress has been made with regard to putting into operation the optional clause of the Treaty with regard to the setting up of an International Court of Justice.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister misunderstands me.  I said they have relation to one of the nations in the Commonwealth&mdash;that the British North America Act has relation to Canada.  It was under that Act that Canada was set up.  It has developed very much from the position as set out in that Act.  Therefore, it is necessary to bring that Act into conformity with its present status.  Assuming that we have developed from the position as set up under the Treaty, is the position of the Treaty to be brought into conformity with our present position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand. What I was coming to was this: The British North America Act and the Colonial Laws Validity Act are law, and they state certain things quite definitely, so that in Canada and other places there was a divergence and conflict between law and practice.  By the Treaty it is stated that what is the practice in the Dominions is law here, and, therefore, without a revision of the Treaty and without a revision of any Act, automatically, as we move on, the practice here is law.  For instance, in 1921, when we took over, the appointment of the Governor-General was governed by practice.  The practice up to that time was that the Governor-General was appointed by the British Government, or at least on the advice of the British Government, if you like. Immediately after the Treaty we proceeded to depart from that to this extent, that at the time of the signing of the Treaty every precedent beforehand indicated quite clearly the practice of the appointment of the Governor-General on the advice of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Governor-General of the Irish Free State was appointed on agreed advice between the Government of Great Britain and the Government of the Free State.  We moved on again between that time and the time of the next Governor-General, because the next Governor-General was appointed solely and exclusively on the advice of the Free State Government.  So that, if you like, the law has been changed, <Col N="444" /> but actually as the law is what is the practice, it is the practice changes, and the law changes automatically.</P>
    <P>There have been other changes also. For instance, prior to the signing of the Treaty the most advanced precedent was that any international document, any multi-lateral Treaty the Dominion representatives signed, but the plenipotentiary appointed on the advice of the Government of Great Britain had full powers, unqualified geographically.  That is to say, it could have been argued juridically that he represented all the King's Dominions, that he represented the whole British Commonwealth of Nations, because he was appointed representing the King without any limit to his geographical power of representation.  Now we have moved quite away from that.  No representative can be appointed now with any plenipotentiary power without its being clearly stated, if he is appointed on the advice of the British Government that his power only extends to commit that area which is controlled or governed by the Government in London.  On the other hand, if he is appointed to represent the Irish Free State, his powers indicate quite clearly that he represents the Irish Free State. There also has been a departure in practice, and, consequently, if you like, a change in the law.  But that departure does not need any new legislation here. One could go through many advances. Prior to the setting up of the Free State, no Dominion had a fully empowered representative with a Foreign State.  I remember during the Treaty debate itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was even suggested that it could not be allowed to them.  The Irish Free State was the <Col N="445" /> first Dominion, I think, in 1923 and 1924 to send abroad a Minister Plenipotentiary fully empowered to represent a Dominion in a foreign capital. If you like, that was a departure from practice.  There have been constant advances in departure from practice and always in the one direction.  What are our functions in regard to other countries?  Perhaps I had better not go into that.  A Minister Plenipotentiary sent to a foreign capital represents the Government of the State.  He does not go there to tell everybody that the State ought to be any different from what it is.  It must be presumed that when a people vote for a certain Government and when that Government is returned, it represents them.  I do not see how anybody can suggest that after there had been a general election and the votes of the people had returned, say if you like, a Labour Party, that that Labour Party or Government should immediately communicate with all their foreign representatives, and say to them, &ldquo;We wish you to assure the people of the country in which you are that although the Labour policy was endorsed by the electorate, the electorate is far from wishing to endorse a Labour policy, that nobody can be considered as less the representatives of the electorate than the present Labour Government, and that it must be understood that the people who voted for the Labour Party and for a Labour Government, did so to express how clearly they disapproved of the whole Labour Party and its programme.  You will have complete guidance when you understand that every time a Labour Minister gets up and makes the statement &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; the people there must understand that the reply should be &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo; That does not happen.  When the Irish people accepted the Treaty, we must assume that they accepted the Treaty, and when they elected a government on a certain policy, we must assume they more or less accepted that policy.  When we send representatives abroad to tell the people that this State is a co-equal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, that it is a sovereign state, and that every act that is done here is done by the will of the State and that they are there to represent that Government and <Col N="446" /> that what that Government does must be accepted as roughly representative of the will of the Irish people, or otherwise that Government will be changed, at the next election&mdash;that that is ordinary common sense and truthfulness.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that our representatives abroad consistently misrepresent the position in this country is just absurd to my mind, if I may say so, without being unparliamentary.  This State is a sovereign State.  We can go abroad and tell everybody we very much regret that the people of the Six Counties decided they did not want to be in with us.  But I do not see that it would be any very useful national propaganda.  The people in the Six Counties have only to vote and say, any time, they want to be with us and they can be with us.  I do not think that it would be good propaganda for a country that struggled so long, as we have done, for self-determination, to say that while we approve of self-determination for the whole country we do not approve of it for the Six Counties.  I do not understand what is meant by saying that partition effectively deprived this country of the advantage of independence.  Then as to our representatives going abroad and telling everybody that if there is to be war we want to be neutral, what I presume our representatives will tell everybody is that we do not want war at all.  There is no use assuring everybody that we want to be neutral. When it comes to that point it is the people here that have to decide.</P>
      <P>By Article 49 of the Constitution, except in the case of actual invasion, we cannot actively participate in any war without the consent of the Dáil, and it is presumable that the Dáil will not vote for war, if it does not want to.  If the Dáil, representing the people, does not want to participate in war, then they will not.  There is no need to go shouting a thing which is perfectly obvious.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Deputy.  Deputy de Valera <Col N="447" /> seemed to think that because there is a proposed reorganisation of the office that what has been done hitherto amounted to nothing.  There, I personally consider, he is quite wrong. We took over a situation very indefinitely and an office naturally varying in experience, and within the very minimum of time the State became one of the foremost of the Dominions in the understanding of its position, and in the bettering of that position.  Every movement forward made since 1922 in the Dominions' position has been due, pre-eminently in nine cases out of ten, to the activities of this Government. I have seen it stated in newspapers that things would not be at all bad if we were as advanced as the Governments of South Africa or Canada.  I assert that in the whole advancement in the Dominions' position, the Irish Free State has been in the very forefront, and so far as one can humanly judge, such advances as have been made have been primarily due to the activities of the Irish Free State Government.  These advances have been very considerable.  I have referred to what I consider the one most important, juridically and internationally, and that is the abolition of what is called the Central Panel; that is to say, no one can now act as plenipotentiary committing a Dominion State to anything whatsoever, except he has actual plenipotentiary powers issued to him solely on the advice of the Government of that State.  That, I think, was a clearer advance to sovereignty of the Dominions than had been achieved any time previous to the setting up of the Irish Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been asked what is the utility of the Department of External Affairs. That is one of those questions which undoubtedly it is very difficult to answer.  One can say that inasmuch as every country in the world has found it necessary to be represented, and to have communication with other countries, one might assume that this country would feel the same need. There is no such thing as complete isolation.  It is necessary for us to be in close communication with the Governments of other countries&mdash;with <Col N="448" /> certain Governments, pre-eminently the British Government, and also the American Government, and to a greater or lesser extent with other Governments.</P>
    <P>That is not merely a courtesy arrangement.  In the same way as human beings are made to live in community so it is necessary, and has been for any periods back in history that I can trace, that inter-communication and relationship should exist between countries.  It is more so now than at any time in history.  There are certain courtesies existing between countries. For instance, if the American Government has a commission of inquiry into certain matters, and we think it would be useful to us to have the documents, we ask them.  There is that courtesy arrangement between countries whereby one country does the best it can, during peace times, at any rate, to put every facility at its command at the service of other countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to the office in Great Britain, which Deputy de Valera seemed to complain cost about £14,000 a year, that includes, of course, the trade representative there.  We are doing an enormous trade with Great Britain, and the activities of our trade office there have been effective in putting money into the pockets of Irish farmers, practically every one of whom has benefited by that.  There is another thing to which I would like to call attention.  The cost of this Estimate to the State must be divided, roughly, by half.  Deputy de Valera complained that our office in America cost about £14,700, but we estimate that during the current year we will draw £13,000 from America in visa fees.  That will reduce the cost of American representation, on the figure that Deputy de Valera gave, to about £1,700.  I have not got the exact figure of the cost of the home office, but from it has to be deducted more than half the cost, I should say&mdash;certainly a sum of more than £10,000&mdash;which is revenue derived from issue of passports, so that it is not an unremunerative office.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Department which has made clearer to all the countries in the world the independence of Dominion status than was ever done <Col N="449" /> before by the combined Dominions, that has put money into the pocket of every farmer, that has more than repaid whatever it cost to the Exchequer&mdash;that has repaid that to the people of this country manifold.  And even if it had done no such thing, this State, an internationally recognised sovereign independent State, has its international position to keep up.  It belongs to the respectable family of nations the members of which communicate with each other, and, if you have, if you like, certain unnecessary forms, it is just the same as the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who wear collars and ties.  It would be very hard for anyone to justify on any particular grounds the wearing of collars and ties, but there are in life certain courtesies, certain good manners, certain arrangements, which are based, possibly on Christian charity, but certainly on the grounds of £ s. d., which, on strictly utilitarian grounds, would be hard to justify.  But on the grounds of extending the status of this country, keeping up this country's position amongst all the countries in the world, improving our trade, and, incidentally, getting rid of all these things that I have called anomalies, getting rid of all these things which may be considered slurs on our equality with other States in the world, this Department has done more than ample justice to the people of this State for the money it cost them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement the Minister for External Affairs said something which I find it very hard to understand, and that is that information concerning the work done by this Department cannot be given until a certain reorganisation has taken place within it.  It seems to me an extraordinary thing that Deputies should be asked to vote a sum of £46,400 to maintain a Department in respect of which they can receive no information as to what it is doing, or no information as to the benefit which the people derived from the expenditure of the £44,700 which was voted last year.  Surely the various representatives abroad who are being paid out of this Vote have been doing something during the year, and if so, it was, I think, the duty of the Minister, in proposing the adoption of this estimate, to indicate exactly what they have done, and to give a rough estimate in general terms of the benefit which they have brought to the people by their activities.  A mere statement that a reorganisation is taking place, and a reorganisation, apparently, for no definite purpose, is not sufficient, because not merely does the Minister tell us there were difficulties in the way of getting information concerning the work done, but he also conveyed, if he did not definitely state it, the idea that no decision had yet been arrived at as to the exact purpose and the exact duties of the existing officers, and of the new ones whom it is now proposed to appoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duties of the representatives of this State in foreign countries, I am sure, can be divided into two main categories, those that relate to trade, and those that relate to our national status. In respect of the duties that relate to our national status, there is, I think, rather an important point which I would like to have cleared up.  The Minister for Defence, an ex-Minister for External Affairs, has just been speaking on this matter, and he seemed to think that it was the main purpose of a representative in Paris, in Berlin or in Brussels to go around assuring the people of those countries that the people of the Free State did not want a war.  I suggest that it would be the <Col N="451" /> duty of these representatives to endeavour to ensure the sympathetic cooperation of the Governments of the States to which they are accredited in providing for the preservation of the neutrality of this State in the event of a war.</P>
    <P>Representatives of this State signed a Covenant of the League of Nations, and by their signatures to that Covenant committed this State not to give facilities in time of war to any aggressive belligerent.  Now, it is quite possible, in fact quite probable, that in any war likely to develop within our lifetime England will be an aggressive belligerent, and yet we are bound by a treaty with England to provide England with certain facilities in this country in the event of a war.  I want the Minister to tell us whether the bond which this State has made with the League of Nations is superior to the bond of the Treaty, and which of them is going to hold good in the event of England engaging in an aggressive war. I want him to tell us whether, in the event of such a war developing, we will refuse to give harbour facilities and facilities for aerodromes in this country, or whether we will break our word to the nations subscribing to the League Covenant and maintain the Treaty which we have made with England.</P>
    <P>That, of course, brings up the question of our famous co-equality.  In so far as the Ministry are attempting to give some element of reality to this co-equality, we are glad.  How far they have progressed we do not know, but they have in this debate to-day given public evidence that the mentality which is behind their activities in that direction is right, that they are moving in the right direction, no matter how slowly.  But I would suggest very strongly to the Minister that no case was ever brought to triumph when the advocates of that case had not merely to fight its battles but were also engaged in maintaining the pretence that they had already won.  It is not going to help the Minister or the Government towards the realisation of that co-equality of which they talk when they are constantly asserting that co-equality has already been attained.  If <Col N="452" /> we are a co-equal State, in what the Minister for Defence calls the King's Dominions, or, alternatively, the Commonwealth of Nations, then surely we are free to come out of that partnership any time we desire.  If we are not free to do so, why not?  If the British Commonwealth of Nations is a free and voluntary grouping of certain nations into one political unit, then the members of the group are free to come out. There is the right of self-determination, in connection with which we have heard rather a new theory advanced by the Minister for Defence a few minutes ago, because not merely is the right of self-determination to be conferred upon nations, but it is also going to be conferred upon counties, and he talked about the right of the Six Counties to self-determination.  What about the right of the County Kerry to self-determination? Give the people of Kerry the opportunity to-morrow and they will determine to get out of your Free State as fast as they can do so.  And surely if the people of Antrim have a right to self-determination the people of Kerry have an equal right.  What about the people in Usher's Quay Ward, in my constituency?  They voted ten to one against the establishment of the Free State.  Will you let the people of Usher's Quay Ward establish a little republic of their own, just because they are determined to do so?  The right of self-determination must end somewhere, and it ends, I suggest, with national borders.  That is the right that the people of this country have fought for, have fought for continuously, have fought for in respect of the whole country, and not for a particular portion of it.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister particularly to tell us whether any instructions have been given to the representatives abroad as to the attitude which this country is likely to adopt in the event of a war developing in Europe, or in any part of the world, in which we are likely to be directly or indirectly involved. If no instructions have been given, will he tell us if any instructions are contemplated, or if the Government has any policy in the matter whatsoever?  As regards the question of trade, it is the one matter in which, <Col N="453" /> I think, at least some information could be given us.  I notice that the Minister for Agriculture, as the result of repeated reiteration on our part, both inside and outside this House, has at last got it into his head that there is considerable danger to the nation in the fact that we are depending on a single customer for the sale of by far the greater part of our exports.  Can we rely on the Minister for Agriculture to put the skids on the Department of External Affairs, with a view to ensuring a remedy, or that some alternative outlet will be provided? The Minister nods his head.  Apparently we can rely on him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, although I think the Minister is particularly fond of dialogue.  I want the Minister for External Affairs, who is responsible, to tell us if the Minister for Agriculture represented, when speaking in that manner, the views of the Executive Council, and if the Executive Council has at long last made up its mind in so far as opening up trade relations with other countries outside Great Britain are concerned, and if so, how far they expect to progress during the course of the year.  We had a question raised in the Dáil some time ago respecting the opening up of relations with Soviet Russia, and we had the Minister to-day quibbling in respect to the question as to whether the Government regarded Soviet Russia as a friendly State.  The Deputy who asked that question comes&mdash;and also another Deputy who raised the matter&mdash;from counties considerably interested in the export of Irish herrings.  Considerable quantities of herrings are imported into Soviet Russia, and possibly the Minister for External Affairs could get the permission of his Imperial masters and endeavour to open up some sort of relations with Russia by which it would be possible to do for Irish fishermen what the Department of Fisheries has hitherto failed to do&mdash; that is, to provide them with some profitable market for their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister, I think, was endeavouring to cloud and partly <Col N="454" /> succeeded in clouding, many points of importance with respect to this Department. He spoke about the doubts which existed about the status of the Governor-General, while, at the same time, emphasising the absolute right which this Parliament has to control all the forces of this State, both internally and externally.  I want him to tell us if the people of this State have the absolute right to terminate the position of Governor-General and to refuse to send him, for signature, the laws which are enacted by the Oireachtas, and if they have not that right, why not?  If we have that right and attempt to exercise it, can he assure us, from anything which happened at the Imperial Conference or elsewhere, that any other co-equal member of the Commonwealth of Nations will not threaten us with immediate and terrible was as a consequence?  These are of more importance than the mere administrative details of which he was speaking, and I would like him to deal with them in his reply.</P>
    <P>The same question arises, of course, in connection with the other subject to which he has referred, particularly with regard to the powers of the representatives of this State appointed to attend international conferences.  If these representatives at international conferences were to take a line of action diametrically opposed to the interests of Great Britain, and consequently involve this State in strained relations with Great Britain, how would the Government act in respect of that situation, or is it that our representatives at international conferences are free to act only when they act in agreement with Great Britain's representatives or in matters of very minor importance?  I, for one, am very anxious to see the Government going forward in pursuit of the policy which they advocated when the institutions of this State were first established, when they said that the powers which the Treaty of 1921 conferred were accepted by them because they gave us freedom to achieve freedom.  I want them to tell us whether they have been attempting to use these powers to achieve freedom and, if so, how far they have progressed in that direction. <Col N="455" /> I want to see them progress in that direction, and every step they take in that direction will receive all the assistance which I and those associated with me can possibly give them.  I think it is up to the Minister and to Deputies sitting on the benches behind him who used the argument in favour of acceptance of the Treaty, that it gave us freedom to achieve freedom, to examine the position now and say whether they were justified in using that argument or justified in getting the people of the country to accept the Treaty on the strength of it.</P>
    <P>If we have freedom to achieve freedom, and if the Treaty was accepted for that purpose, then there was obviously an intention to use the power conferred by the Treaty to increase the measure of freedom which we now possess.  That has not been done except in some very minor matters of detail, and we had the declaration from the Minister for Finance only a few months ago that any idea of advancing beyond the present position has been abandoned by the Executive Council; that it is now their intention to work for the establishment of a Republican government in this country.  We would like to be clear about this.  We want to see the Government placed in a definite position, with a declared policy that any man can understand.  Either they stand for the present position unaltered and, as they maintain unalterable, or else they are going to pursue a policy which they occasionally have declared is their policy, and which certainly was their policy five or six years ago: to use whatever powers this House possesses to prize the gate of freedom wider, so that the people of this country can advance unimpeded on the road to the goal to which they have been travelling for generations past.  I hope the Minister will deal with these matters when concluding the debate.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with one point, the only important point, which Deputy de Valera made in his speech. He complains that our representatives abroad are not telling what he calls the real truth to the other nations.  That <Col N="456" /> adjective is indicative of the Deputy's point of view.  There is no such thing as the &ldquo;real truth.&rdquo;  There is the truth, that is all, and the word &ldquo;real&rdquo; is redundant, but I accept it for the purposes of argument.  It may be that our representatives have not been telling the real truth to other people, but the Deputy will admit that they have very efficient and capable substitutes.  Deputy de Valera and his Party, when they were once Republicans, and all along during their chequered career for the last five years, had representatives abroad, particularly in America and on the Continent, telling the people the real truth.  We have had lately, in the American papers, an example of the real truth, as told by Deputy Aiken, who is now in America, and who is described as General Aiken.  I will read it.  It was published in two or three American papers.</P>

Now, this is the right type of propaganda to give the countries of the world, and this is being done by a prominent member of Fianna Fáil, who complained about our ambassadors; that is being done for the last five or six years.

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture made a remark one time that he never reads his own speeches.  The thing that puzzles me is why he makes them.  What our object is and what we would hope at some stage is that the present Government would adopt a point of view which would really dignify the nation.  If the foreign policy of the present Government were based frankly and openly upon the complete freedom and separation of Ireland from England then we would know where we stood, but their present position is one which does not make that clear.  If they are going to appoint representatives and legations in Berlin and Paris we should know what is the fundamental object of such appointments. If they are appointed <Col N="459" /> merely to confuse the issue as between British Imperialism and complete Irish independence, I for one can hardly welcome such an advance or such a project&mdash; because advance it is not.  I hope against hope, in spite of evidence to the contrary, that they will take up a proper line on the question of international independence for Ireland.  They have completely neglected the whole aspect of that question, which they could, even as they are, deal with.  They could frankly go out upon the propaganda that the best thing, not merely for Ireland, but for England and for the relations between England and America, would be to have Ireland completely separate and independent, and a State whose freedom would be neutrally guaranteed.  It would mean an area excluded from war, which would have the effect of preventing wars in future.</P>
      <P>We cannot blink our eyes to facts as they are from day to day.  It is true that an effort was made by the Kellogg Pact and, in so far as it is in any sense a remedy against war, we welcome it: but only the other day we heard that, as likely as not, the American Senate will not ratify that Pact, that there is very little belief in it as a real method towards the assertion of world peace. Again, we find statements made by responsible Ministers in Germany which indicate that feelings are moving in a hostile direction between Germany and England.  If the tendencies are such, surely that is an opportunity where we would in no way make any blunder, even within the framework of the Free State, in stating our case, stating it upon the traditional claim of Ireland for independence and separation from England, and stating it from the point of view that it would be of benefit to England and to the general world peace if Ireland were established as a neutral and independent State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the Six Counties has now, unfortunately, to be regarded rather as an international question, or as a question for foreign affairs because it comes under no domestic department. If this policy were adopted, of going for a completely free and neutral <Col N="460" /> Ireland guaranteed, it would mean that the Six Counties would perforce be brought inside such a scheme because neither America nor any other country could contemplate Six Counties of Ireland being used as a jumping-off ground in a future war.  It has been laid down by military authorities, such as General Mahon, that as long as Britain holds Lough Swilly she can hold the Atlantic.  The Americans know that and they know that, so long as that jumping-off ground is held by England, a guaranteed Free State of Twenty-Six Counties would mean nothing.  This is a policy which could be backed by every Party in this House. It means a peaceful solution of the only fundamental question which gives trouble in this country.  It would take the cloud of suspicion away from that element in this country which at present is so sympathetic with British culture and British outlook, for in a free Ireland such people would no longer be under a cloud of suspicion. It is a policy which any pacifist could support and it depends largely for being made effective upon the manner in which the propaganda is being carried out.</P>
    <P>The general spirit of Europe to-day amongst the people is a craving and hunger for peace.  We could take advantage of that in order to carry out such propaganda.  On the other hand, you have the prospect of people working silently, like the architects of the Great War ten or fifteen years before that war came off, planning the next great war.  People in Ireland sometimes are inclined to smile at the possibility of such a policy.  They say that Ireland is too small.  Look, however, at all the small nations of Europe which are free and look at the contributions they are making to the civilisation of Europe, beginning at the North and going down the coast of Europe.  You will find that those small countries are producing the best in civilisation to-day and in their own way are making the greatest efforts to establish peace in Europe. Ireland may be a small nation, but it is a nation with a tremendous tradition of civilisation behind it and it has contributed largely in the past to European civilisation.  It is also a <Col N="461" /> country which has enormous power in America and for that reason, it holds a position of importance out of proportion to its actual population.</P>
    <P>There is one argument against this and that is that if Ireland were free and peaceful such an alliance might be made between England and America as to be a menace to the rest of the world. I know that there is an extreme element in America so hostile to England that they would prefer to see Ireland unfree so as to be a cause of quarrel at some moment when they could destroy England, rather than to see Ireland free to-morrow.  I do not hold with that view.  A great act of justice will always do more in the long run for civilisation than constructing a policy to destroy even one's worst enemy.  A great act of justice between England and America, brought about by any Government in this country, would set an example to Europe and the whole world.  There have been periods in history when the ideals of freedom were effective and, I suggest that no matter what Government is in power, it is its duty to pursue those ideals of freedom because, even if to-morrow, next week or the week after, such a policy cannot be enforced by the gradual education of the people, when the next crisis comes, it is what is in the people's mind to do that will assert itself.  At present the best one can say about our advances inside the Imperial Conference is that they are very like a skilful fisherman catching a salmon. He knows when to let out the reel, when to give plenty of line, but the fish is on the hook.  We are opposed to this Vote because, so far, there has been absolutely no indication that the Government stand for the policy I mention. As I say, I hope that, some time or other, the mass of the people will insist, or that the Government, or those who are not in the Government but who belong to Cumann na nGaedheal, will insist that we all return to the ideals which inspired this country between 1916 and 1921.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to see that even to-day the Opposition Party in this House have not yet got the right end of the stick.  Even after a year in the Dáil they have not realised <Col N="462" /> that the status of this country is a contradiction in terms.  It is not a static but a dynamic status and it develops or contracts according to its internal dynamism.</P>
      <P>They have not yet realised that fact. I had hoped, when they were coming into this Dáil, that they would take an interest in the status of the country, that they would have been anxious about and jealous of the status of the country&mdash;that they would have been anxious to improve it.  During the past twelve months, they have not taken the slightest interest in that status.  I doubt if they have put a single question to the Minister on that matter.  They have not bothered to study the question constructively.  They have not offered constructive advice or constructive opposition to the Government in power.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister's statement, that there is going to be a re-organisation of his Department and that this country is going to be represented in Paris and Berlin.  I presume that Germany and France will be officially represented in this capital. I have a personal criticism of the Minister to offer.  In the first place, I think he works too much and, in the second place, he has not developed that majestic pompousness which is generally associated with foreign Ministers and which made the late Lord Curzon such a formidable personality in world affairs.  That may develop later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that the last twelve months have been very remarkable in the history of this country.  During the past twelve months, we have been brought more prominently before the eyes of the world than any other small country and, in fact, than many large countries.  The Minister mentioned the President's tour in America and the historic visit of the American Secretary of State here.  There were many other matters which brought us into prominence here&mdash;the invitation to the Chief Justice, the conquest of the Atlantic by the German-Irish aviators and, even in America itself, the Irish race, if not the Irish State, was brought very prominently before the eyes of the world by two great sporting events which ended in the defeat of Mr. Smith <Col N="463" /> and the victory of Mr. Tunney.  Those were purely sporting events to us.  We have no interest in American politics and we would be very great fools if we had, seeing that we have staunch friends in every party in America. These two events were looked upon by the people of this country largely as sporting events and the competitors of Irish descent, whether they won or lost, did so in a very honourable and creditable manner.</P>
    <P>More important than even our relations with America are our relations with the English.  During recent years, there has been a steady improvement in our relations with the English.  The policy which has been stated by the Minister of gradually eliminating antiquated forms and colonial survivals and asserting the absolute, formal co-equality of this country with Great Britain has been carried on with great rapidity.  There remain a few small points of comparative unimportance which can be disposed of during the next few years.  There is one point which, I think, the Minister mentioned and which has now become somewhat acute.  That is a point in which there is a little interference in the affairs of this country.  Although the Opposition may deny it, although many members of the Opposition may not believe it, the fact remains that in this State the Executive is absolutely free, the legislature is absolutely free; there is no interference with either.  But there is what would seem to be a slight interference with the third branch of the State&mdash;the judiciary.  There are certain venerable persons on the opposite side of certain opinions, but I may mention that there is nothing alarming in the situation so far as the Privy Council is concerned.  I saw in the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; a few days ago a terrifying letter from Sir John Marriott, who seemed to think that the world was coming to an end and who was urging frantically everybody to remain calm in this terrible situation. As a matter of fact, there is no tragical situation so far as I know, and the matter will.  I am sure, be resolved in the most friendly manner.  The process which the Minister has pointed out <Col N="464" /> of gradually and scientifically removing the causes of irritation between this country and England will go on in spite of the occasional activities of a few hot-headed young gentlemen in this country and a few hot-headed old gentlemen in the neighbourhood of Westminster.  I fear that in the next few days there may be a slight explosion in the House of Lords from some of our old friends there on the question of this State, but I think it will be as unsuccessful as the explosion that failed to blow off the hind leg of King Billy's horse.  Certain venerable persons in England occasionally meddle and interfere with a few of the decisions of our judiciary and they tie themselves in the most extraordinary legal knots.  Occasionally, they try to tie us in these knots.  We can, of course, always cut these knots with the bright sword of the Oireachtas, but it is a cumbersome process.  It gives us a considerable amount of bother, and it also gives those venerable persons considerable pain and mental anguish.  In view of the unkind remarks made about them by the late Minister for Justice and in order to remove the causes of the slight bother to us and the suffering caused these venerable persons themselves, they might be well advised to leave us in peace for the future.  There are several constitutional methods of doing so, but as to which one is best and which would be most satisfactory to the two Governments I do not know.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is becoming ripe for discussion with the British Government.  That is the last matter mentioned in the annexe to the Treaty&mdash;the necessity of arriving at an agreement with regard to civil aviation and aerial communications.  It is of the utmost importance that that agreement should be arrived at, not only because without it there cannot be any regularly established line of aerial communication between this country and England, but because of the fact that all suitable lines between this country and the Continent will pass over, at any rate, some small portion of British territory. Consequently, I think the time is approaching when persons of good-will <Col N="465" /> could arrive at agreement in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general conduct of external affairs, it has been occasionally suggested that we in this country should take an active part in interfering in the policies of the British Foreign Office.  That is a policy which I think is sometimes favoured by Australian Governments.  They are interested naturally in the affairs of the Middle East and the Near East.  I think the Government is wise and the Minister is wise in adopting the policy adopted by Canada and keeping as far away from the Middle East and the Near East as it is possible to do.  I have doubts whether we will be able to keep away from the Balkans, because we have such considerable Balkan elements in this House and in this country. The only alternative external policy to that which has been outlined by the Minister is a policy which might have been produced completely and fabricated entirely in some such city as Philippopolis.  It is founded on Balkan principles, permanent hostility to your neighbours and permanent irritation of your neighbours, coupled with the typically Balkan defence policy of &ldquo;Back to the bogs with the army.&rdquo; Likewise, the manner in which they propose to exalt the reputation of the country is by burglary, and embezzlement of international obligations.  That policy, I say, which is the only alternative to that of the present Government, is one which cannot be carried out, and, therefore, will not be carried out, because the Balkan period in Irish history has come to an end.  If the gentlemen on the opposite benches had realised that fact a year ago they would be in a far happier position than they are in to-day&mdash;floundering about in an ocean of contradictions.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly entitled to discuss the alternative external policy to that of the present Executive, which has been publicly stated, both in this House and outside, and is well known to the country.  I think I am perfectly entitled to mention it.  The other question of whether there is any support for that policy in this House is a matter which I think we are also entitled to discuss, and whether those silent appeals, like the appeal which came to Paul the Apostle, when he slept at Tarsus, &ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us,&rdquo; are likely or not, I think the back benchers on this side of the House may go to many places where the world is going forward, not backwards; they may go to Copenhagen, Berlin. or Detroit, but to Macedonia, never again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter that I would like the Minister to consider&mdash;that is, the question of our relations with Australia, a place which is very far away, but still, after the United States, a place where the largest proportion of the Irish race is settled, outside of Ireland.  The relations between this country and Australia during recent years have been about as bad as they could be.  The mass of the Australian people are very cheerful and friendly, but the Australian Government occasionally sends to international conferences and to the Imperial conference certain elderly gentlemen who have not the faintest idea of what this State is driving at, but are convinced that it must be something very bad, with the result that there never has been a real friendly feeling between the Irish Free State and Australia.  Likewise, I would ask the Minister if anything could be done with the Press.  The Australian Press Association in London does not give this country a fair show.  It continually sends out to Australia any unfavourable news it can find about this country and fails to report matters <Col N="467" /> which redound to our credit.  Why these gentlemen do this I do not know. If they could be got to give us a better show I believe that the relations between this country and Australia would improve.  That is a matter, perhaps, which the Minister could consider.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down defined particular qualities which a Minister for External Affairs should possess, that he should be self-sufficient, ponderous, like the late Lord Curzon, &ldquo;a very superior person.&rdquo;  If those are the only qualifications which are necessary, when it comes to a question of a change, I think the House would find no difficulty in finding in Deputy Esmonde a perfectly satisfactory occupant.  This debate has taken place upon a high level, with the exception, perhaps, of the incursion of that uncontrollable schoolboy, the Minister for Agriculture, whose speech most certainly was not worthy of him.  I say that with regret, because he is an effective debater in this House.  Certainly his mis-use of his material to-night was not creditable to the position which he occupies.  Some of us do, in quoting members of this House, as far as possible in relation to significant declarations, try to get from those members confirmation of the accuracy of the quotations.  The Minister for Agriculture quoted a member of this House from a paper whose name he does not know, and whose date he does not give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>He gave us the date on which the occurrence was supposed to have taken place.  I am not stressing that, but I think it was unworthy of the Minister and unworthy of the debate. The only other portion which I think could be taken exception to, and I am doing this without blaming the party opposite for it, was the latter portion of the speech of the Minister for Defence.  We have had, unfortunately, in this House, occasions when Ministers have repudiated the policy of their colleagues in definite and set terms.  We have had occasions afterwards where the Ministers who were repudiated got <Col N="468" /> up and said they were merely joking. Unless the Ministry opposite do take responsibility for the statement made by the Minister for Defence in relation to the right of one-quarter of this people to cut off from this land as a separate portion capable of being built up under their own terms into a separate sovereign state&mdash;unless the Ministers opposite are prepared to take the responsibility for that statement&mdash; I, for one, will not father it upon them.</P>
      <P>It is said that this is a sovereign State, and my own attitude of mind towards it is neither to exaggerate nor to derogate from it.  It is to face the truth in relation to the position, whatever it may be, but taking the statement which has been made from the opposite benches to-night, if it is possible under the authority and under the machinery which has been used to set up the Free State as a sovereign independent State, then it is possible under precisely the same machinery to set up another sovereign and independent State in this country.  We have to accept, if that is so, the possibility that there can be two separate and irreconcilable sovereignties in this country accepted and justified by the people of this country.  That is the proposition which, unfortunately I think, the Minister for Defence in his official position has allowed to go out from this House. It is the most serious and the most retrograde statement that has ever been made in the history of Irish constitutional development.  It is a statement which, I say again, I will not father upon any man in this House who does not himself of his own volition make and maintain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is largely complicated by a misunderstanding of the use of terms and by possibly a difference of definition in terms which are used commonly.  We leave out for the moment words such as &ldquo;sovereign State,&rdquo; and all the rest of it, and we come to the words &ldquo;co-equality&rdquo;&mdash;to implement a co-equality of free nationhood in the Commonwealth of Nations. Now, I do not think that I misrepresent the Minister for Industry and Commerce when I say that he means by that co-equality within the terms of the document originating the State.  It is perfectly obvious&mdash;I am trying now <Col N="469" /> to speak in no controversial sense&mdash;but I think it must be entirely obvious to this House that so long as Lough Swilly, Berehaven and Cobh are contracted to be in the possession of somebody else in certain eventualities, which eventualities might involve the life and death of every single member of this State, &ldquo;sovereign State&rdquo; in the ordinary interpretation of the words &ldquo;sovereign State&rdquo; is a term which cannot be used; and co-equality, as compared with another country in the same Commonwealth, which does not allow to any power outside itself the right to control those essential outlets and bastions of its national life, cannot possibly be used.</P>
    <P>I face the actual existing state of affairs, and I want to know how that existing state of affairs can be altered by the action and policy of the Ministry of External Affairs so as to bring about the greater purpose which I think is common to every member of this House.  The Ministry has stated that they have attempted, and do now intend to attempt further, to develop within that commonalty of nations.  I have used the phrase intensive evolution within the Commonwealth&mdash;intensive evolution within the Commonwealth in which the Free State will seize upon every opportunity to develop its own liberty, in which it will seize upon every development of the liberty of all those who are in the Commonwealth and to build upon that.  Intensive evolution of that kind may, as the work nearest to one's hand until one is in the position to use other methods, be a very effective means of preparing for the bigger opportunity which is not ours to-day, and to the extent to which the Ministry of External Affairs will seek that intensive evolution and will seek to gather up those scattered straws of liberty and bind them together, we will help them in every way that we can. Even if they do not accept that, and if they are not prepared to do the other thing, their business is to use what they have got up to the limit, and to the extent that what has been said to-day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicates that they do intend to do it, it will have, I think, the <Col N="470" /> support not merely of their own Party, but of everybody else.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a little and a small people, placed as we are, can use for its liberty other than the methods and the weapons of the weak.  I believe that over a period of time those weapons will be effective, and the greatest of all is sacrifice.  The greatest soldier that ever fought for Ireland was Terence McSwiney, dying slowly day by day in Brixton Prison.  It was that capacity to sacrifice which will do it, and the time may come when all that sacrifice will reap its great reward, the great reward of teaching the people the lesson which he died to teach: that it is in personal faithfulness and in personal sacrifice and in the capacity to suffer that weak people may win out by the strength of their spirit against the wealth and the might of the strong.</P>

He dealt very fully with the activities of our representatives abroad.  He showed this House that those activities were directed mainly to the maintenance of the status of this nation.  If there is one thing that we on these benches have been reproached with from time to time it is the status which this nation enjoys.</P>

      <P>Nation or State.  I will not quarrel with Deputy O'Kelly as to which expression he chooses to use.  We are concerned with the powers we actually possess.  The Minister pointed out that this little country of ours was a co-equal partner in every way with the great dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and a co-equal partner with England herself.  He pointed out it was the policy of our representatives abroad not alone to maintain, but if possible, to develop that status.  The Minister for Defence elaborated the policy with regard to foreign affairs.  In the short time we are in existence we had availed ourselves <Col N="471" /> in turning into actual law in this country things in the great dominions that are only the actual practice.  The consolidation of the status of the Free State abroad is, in my opinion, the main duty of any foreign representative. We have been reproached by the other side of the House because our representatives have not taken up a certain standpoint, and because, as they said, we have not endeavoured to show to other countries that the status we now enjoy was due more or less to duress.  It has been pointed out here by the Minister for Defence that we had general elections in this country to determine those things.  I venture to point out that it is not the duty of any foreign representative, the duty of any embassy which represents this nation abroad, to embark on any propaganda of the kind suggested, and that Deputy Lemass advocated our representatives should be engaged upon.  When a representative of this State goes abroad he has to stand strictly on the letter with which he is accredited and upon which his representation depends.  Because of that he enjoys when he goes to a foreign country a certain status which he cannot depart from or exceed.  We have had an illustration of what I mean when the great Arcos firm was driven out of London because that firm was endeavouring to act as a centre for the propagation of Communistic ideas.  A suggestion has been made that our representatives abroad should engage on a similar undertaking.  I am sure that no reasonable Deputy who considers the position of a representative of this nation in a foreign country would contradict that that would be contrary to the powers he possesses as a representative of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hugo Flinn said that the tone of this debate was on a very high level.  I regret I cannot agree with that statement.  I think that when Deputy Lemass came to deal with the self-determination of the Usher's Quay people he reduced the discussion from anything like a high level and brought it to the level of a farce.  What he said would, in my opinion, be more suitable for comic opera.  I suggest, with all respect, that the sooner the official <Col N="472" /> Opposition recognise that they are discussing a serious matter the better for themselves and the country.  If we are to be compared with great countries like France, Germany and Italy, and then talk about self-determination and the Usher's Quay Ward there is neither logic nor common sense in that.  We were told what the duties of our representatives abroad should be.  If this Government goes out of office and those opposite will be acting in the capacity of foreign Ministers and representatives, and take up the affairs of State, I fear there will be a great deal of international entanglement and a great deal of trouble.  I fear there will be a mess before they will be long in office. We have been endeavouring from this side of the House to put before the other side a fair and reasonable account of what has been done for the status of this State abroad.  We have been talking about the status of this nation and the development of that status.  I think that no Deputy in this House, and no Government who may control this nation, could say that at no future date can the status of this State be changed or improved.  I believe in the words of that great statesman, &ldquo;No man can set a limit to the onward march of a nation.&rdquo;  That is the view that should be taken, in my opinion, by the Deputies, not alone on these benches, but on the official Opposition benches, but that is a view that should not be transmitted to our representatives abroad.</P>
    <P>I was glad of the full and clear explanation given of this Vote, and that for many reasons.  I am often asked the question, being in close contact with the ordinary every-day people who send Deputies to this House, what are we doing with the money we spend abroad?  I am sure Deputies who have heard the Minister's explanation will not deny that the money has been wellspent. Deputy de Valera objected to the spending of £14,700 on our Embassy in the United States, and the reply given to that objection was that we were receiving in exchange a sum of £13,000 odd; so, in fact, the American Embassy was costing the nation only £1,000 odd.  If some of these facts were promulgated and spread among the people, if the Press which comes <Col N="473" /> here would report facts instead of silly nonsense that I see reported in it from time to time, it would do greater and more useful service in this State.</P>

      <P>I am one of the Deputies who listened to the Minister's statement, and I am not satisfied with the manner in which the money voted for the Department of External Affairs is spent either at home or abroad, and particularly abroad.  The Minister for Agriculture spoke a few moments ago about the real truth.  In all of the speeches that have been made from the official side of this House I have not heard much that is informative.  It is the same old attempt at bluff and camouflage as has been made in other respects and in other directions in this State during the past five years.  All that sort of dope has been used here to-night in connection with this debate on external affairs.  We have heard &ldquo;the nation&rdquo; mentioned, &ldquo;sovereign State,&rdquo;&ldquo;co-equality,&rdquo; and all that sort of dope, as the Minister aptly described something a few seconds ago. With regard to the statement that was made here by the Minister for Finance some nine months ago when speaking officially on behalf of the Government, he told us that the Government did not aim at the establishment of a Republic in this country, I contrast that statement with the statement made by the Minister for Defence to-night, who said it was the duty of the Department for External Affairs to insist on the implementation of co-equality and to solidify or consolidate the position of the Irish Free State in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I for one would not vote for any foreign representatives accredited to any Government by this <Col N="474" /> State in a diplomatic position whilst those two contradictory statements are let go unchallenged in this House.  So far as I would be able I would not stand for sending diplomatic representatives particularly to any foreign State and giving them instructions or letting it be understood in their credentials that they represent a State which the Ministers know is not sovereign and has never been sovereign since 1921.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech on this Vote, stated that he proposed to establish two legations, one in Berlin and the other at Paris. I presume that the legations in Berlin and Paris will be established on somewhat similar lines to the legation that we have at Washington in the U.S.A., and that the same bluff will be continued in Berlin and Paris as is being continued by our representative in Washington, U.S.A., since he was appointed there.  When the Minister used the words &ldquo;not trade representatives,&rdquo; mind you, I hoped that he had considered the thing very well before he said it.  I believe that to end the sham and hypocrisy and the waste of money which the Irish taxpayer has to pay for this extraordinary Department of External Affairs, if we have foreign representatives it would be far better if the Minister came honestly before the House and asked for a Vote for trade representatives only, because, after all, we would get something out of that if those representatives worked and were energetic.  But I cannot see what we can get out of this unless trying to lead the people of the world to believe that we have a status that we have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Analysing the Estimate of the Department of External Affairs we find that our representatives abroad, taking them in the order given in the Estimate, cost:&mdash;in Washington, U.S.A. £14,772; London, £12,356, and a bonus of £1,485; Geneva, with a staff of three, costs £1,506; Brussels, with a staff of five, £1,953, and Paris, with a staff of four, £1,752.  We are not informed by the Minister in his statement what duties exactly pertain to these offices in Brussels, Paris and Geneva.  We have got a hazy idea of <Col N="475" /> what the duty of the London section of the Department and of the New York section are.  But so far as Geneva, Brussels and Paris are concerned no information has been given to us.  We are not told whether they are merely trade representatives or whether their duties go beyond the duties of trade representatives.  I presume they are trade representatives.  I do not see that the Department has received very much value through the appointment of trade representatives to Belgium and France anyhow.  As far as one place is concerned where there really is a market waiting for us nothing has been done.  I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture has now got interested in alternative markets. One place where there is a market that can be captured is the Union of the Soviet Republics.  His reply to the question put to-day by me touching the real attitude of the Saorstát in respect to that was not encouraging as showing his intentions in that connection.  I did not put down that question last week or to-day with regard to our attitude towards the Union of the Soviet Republics in any spirit of a desire to find out purely for the sake of curiosity.  I put down the question because in the Estimate I found no provision for a trade representative, or even an observer, in that State where there is certainly a valuable market going to waste and wallop.  I put it down because looking at the imports of that country for the last financial year for which figures are available, I believe that we could with profit send a trade representative there to open up relations with them, and that would be very much better than sending trade representatives to Paris, Brussels and Geneva combined.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the Minister's re-organisation scheme he will see that this question of the trade relations with the Soviet Government is not a question that should be put aside without due and mature consideration. Probably in this country there may be the usual storm of lying propaganda about recognising the Bolshevik Government and all that sort of thing that has been shoved down the throats of the <Col N="476" /> people by the Press that we have here. The fact is that the Union of the Soviet Republics want to buy these goods, that they have the money to purchase them, that they are willing to pay for these goods, and that we are neglecting an opportunity of opening up relations with such a customer, a customer that has got the money, and, as I said, willing to pay for the goods.  I say that the Department of External Affairs, if they neglect the opportunity, deserves to be severely censured in this matter.  They should not allow a smoke-screen of this kind to be used against the establishment of trade representatives in the Soviet Republics of Russia in view of the fact that in the last financial year twelve and three-quarter millions of roubles worth of agricultural machinery was imported there through the European frontiers along with eight million roubles worth of tractors.  In Cork there is at present a factory being set up which will have a monopoly of the European market in the way of tractors.  The Union of the Soviet Republics bought recently eight million roubles worth of tractors.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why, with proper push and advertisement, and proper development on the part of our Department of External Affairs, we could not capture some of that trade.  In that country last year they bought three and a quarter million roubles worth of fish, herrings particularly.  When Deputy Lemass referred to the possibilities of the herring export trade in Ireland.  I am certain he meant the possibilities that do really exist of a market for Irish-cured herrings and Irish-cured mackerel in Russia.  The people in Russia have the money, and they are prepared to pay for any goods they get. When great countries like the United States and France cannot afford to ignore the existence of the Union of Soviet Republics, the great Eastern democracy, if one may so describe it, certainly a little country like this, trying to get into a definite position after centuries of slavery, cannot afford either to ignore the existence of those Republics, and I think our Department of External Affairs would be doing a very good day's work if, instead of <Col N="477" /> opening legations, whatever functions they may possess, in places where they probably will not have such good results, they were to appoint, and appoint quickly a trade representative in Russia.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that instead of appointing a Minister Plenipotentiary or Envoy Extraordinary, or whatever he may describe him as, in Berlin he should appoint a trade representative there.  Last year the people in Germany bought £423,847 worth of stuff from Ireland and we had no trade representative there.  There is a possibility of great trade development between Germany and Ireland.  There are carrying facilities in existence between these countries which do not exist between Ireland and other Continental countries.  With proper encouragement on the part of our Government there is no reason why trade could not be developed and an alternative market found for much of the stuff for which we cannot find a market at the present moment.  I ask the Minister to take these things into consideration.</P>
    <P>The criticisms we have to offer in connection with the Minister's Department are offered because we believe that until the national policy of one Ireland independent and free is accepted by the Government of the Free State, and until that is the driving force behind our foreign representation, it means only so much smoke-screen, camouflage and hypocrisy to appoint representatives or plenipotentiaries in any foreign capital.  The appointment of trade representatives is the proper function of that Department until the present Government qualify their national position and accept a sane national outlook.  I have no other comment to make upon the Vote except to hope that the Minister will let us know whether the point I have made with regard to a trade representative in Russia will receive any attention from him.</P>

      <P>I must confess that it was with some surprise I learned that the Opposition had selected this particular Vote as the one subject which they specially wished to discuss.  Nothing that I have heard so far in this debate <Col N="478" /> has caused that surprise to diminish. It is true I had not the advantage of hearing Deputy de Valera.  It was not possible for me to be in attendance at the time the Deputy was speaking.  I had, however, the advantage of hearing a number of speeches by Deputies sitting on the Opposition Benches.  I say I was surprised because I should have thought that of all possible Departments of State the Department of External Affairs was the least favourable ground for the Opposition.  Suppose the attack had been upon the Department of Industry and Commerce instead of upon the Minister's very near relation, the Minister for External Affairs, I can imagine there would be a much more favourable ground.  There was in relation to all our domestic matters an old tradition, an old legend, which many people in this country believed.  It referred to the enormous, the incalculable wealth that existed in our great mineral resources, and I know not what else, and all this was prevented from being developed by the dead hand of England. Then there was the historical justification that our industries in the past had been artificially crushed.  Naturally it had been in the minds of our people that these industries could equally be artificially revived, though that expectation was grounded rather more on instinct than on any concrete reason; but yet it afforded much ground for discussion.  The coming of self-government in this country must, in that relation, have necessarily been somewhat of a disappointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak now as one of the older generation, and, when you come to the Department of External Affairs, I say that so far from there being any disappointment at the liberty achieved in regard to external affairs under the Treaty, and the additional liberty which has been achieved since by the development of the Treaty, it has far exceeded anything we ever believed to be possible.  Prophets and saints have desired to see the things we have seen and have not seen them.  If an angel could have told Henry Grattan, Flood, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, John Mitchel or Charles Stewart Parnell that in this year of grace, 1928, we should have <Col N="479" /> here in Ireland not only a Parliament able to legislate for this State, free from all interference as Grattan's Parliament never was, but also a Government that in its relation with Great Britain and with the rest of the world could enjoy powers of treaty-making, powers of saying whether or not it would be bound by any but its own plenipotentiaries, powers to say that it would or it would not consent to be involved in a war; if that angel had also told them that in this year the representatives of Ireland would be received on terms of equality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;among all the nations of the world in a great international assembly, my belief is that those men of whom I speak would have thought that it was too great and too wonderful a thing to happen.  But we have seen it happen.  I do not know why it is that Deputy Lemass and Deputy Flinn continually used the future tense.  They said: &ldquo;If the Government and if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do so and so.&rdquo;  I think the words of Deputy Lemass were: &ldquo;If they will promise us that they will use this freedom to achieve freedom,&rdquo; and Deputy Flinn said: &ldquo;If they will seek co-equality.&rdquo;  If all this happened, then both Deputies said they would support the Government.  What else has the Government of the State been doing ever since it was set up but pursuing those very ends?  Are there not on record the proceedings of the Imperial Conference of 1923, and the Imperial Conference of 1926?  Is it not known to everybody that the dominant personality in those conferences was the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins?  Is it not as plain as daylight, on the face of the reports, that the freedom which was achieved in 1921 has already been enlarged, and nobly enlarged?  I will give one example.  Writing as late as 1924, Professor Borriedale Keith, in the last edition of his book, spoke of the over-riding power of the British Legislature over the dominions as being an unquestioned fact.  He asserts it there as a thing in being. But let us, two years later, read the <Col N="480" /> report of the Imperial Conference of 1926 and see how that has gone, together with all other machinery whatsoever by which any will except the will of the people here in the Free State can be made effective over the Free State.</P>
      <P>The real quarrel that the Opposition have is not with the Minister for External Affairs, is not with the Government of the Free State, and is not even with Great Britain; the quarrel the Opposition have is with the order of things and the nature of the world we live in.  I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy de Valera.  I think he is a great patriot.  I think he has in his heart somewhere the image of a perfect Republic, the ideal Republic which, it may be, exists in Heaven, but most certainly does not, and never can, exist upon earth.  In so far as the reality of the Free State falls short of that ideal, Deputy de Valera quite sincerely and by his nature and temperament is bound to quarrel with it.  If it should ever happen that he achieves his idea, his political purpose, he will be as far as ever from his ideal, because no Republic that can be set up, no monarchy in this world, can have that absolute independence which haunts his dreams.  It does not exist in this world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My memory goes back to some years ago when, before the war, I used sometimes to visit the Balkans.  I was rather closely in touch with a great many people specially interested, and I paid some visits there myself.  I remember before the war the independent Kingdom of Serbia&mdash;an independent State, not tied by any conventions, and not part of any Commonwealth.  What used to happen?  That country was dependent, as we are dependent, upon the export of its agricultural produce. Every now and then Vienna used to discover that there was foot-and-mouth disease or something corresponding to it in Serbia, and thereupon the frontier was closed.  Then the Serbian peasants, unable to sell their pork and their swine, began to starve, and there was further accommodation between Belgrade and Vienna.  Serbia, at the enormous cost of a great part of her male population, the cost of that terrible retreat in the depth of winter when she <Col N="481" /> just managed to save the remnants of her army during the Great War, through the break-up of the Austrian Empire has no doubt rid herself of that.  It still remains true that neither she nor Greece nor any of the smaller States of Europe, nor any great State, for that matter, has that independence in the sense in which I believe Deputy de Valera understands it.  The United States of America perhaps have it because of their enormous population and boundless wealth, and because they are separated by all the oceans from their neighbours.  There is no European country&mdash;England, France or Italy&mdash;and still less any one of the smaller States, which has independence in the sense that it can afford to disregard altogether the wishes, desires, or even the selfish interests of its neighbours.  The whole quarrel, as I say, of the Opposition is not with the Constitution of the Free State, with the Government, with the Executive Council, or with Great Britain&mdash;their quarrel is with facts and realities.</P>
    <P>So long as the world endures and men are what they are now, there will be for national security but two possible safeguards.  The first is to be so strong, so wealthy, so powerful that no one will dare to attack you.  That, so far as we are concerned, we may put aside.  It does not apply to any country in the world, with the exception of the United States.  There is one other security, and it is this: that if you are not so strong yourself, you shall be at least part of a great confederation or commonwealth.</P>

      <P>Switzerland was preserved, and its independence was preserved during the war, not by the fact that it was a separate State, but by geographical conditions which do not apply to us.  If the Deputy wants proof of that, it is plain.  Luxembourg and Belgium were equally sovereign States. The sovereignty of these States did not prevent their being overrun by the Germans, any more than the sovereignty of Greece prevented it from being overrun.  You must be either strong in yourself or you must have the strength of a great confederation behind you.  It is the extraordinary <Col N="482" /> position of the Free State in relation to external affairs that it is impossible to infringe her liberties without infringing the liberty of every member of the commonwealth.  It is for that reason I remain impenitently a believer that merely to advance from what we are to an independent republic, to so-called independence&mdash;I think there is no such thing in that absolute sense&mdash;is not to go forward, but to go back; is not to go from insecurity to security; it is, for the sake of nothing at all, to incur the greatest of perils.</P>

      <P>I only intervene in this debate to ask the Minister a question.

We maintain we have not that kind of freedom.  We would take our chance of being overrun, and we think that it would be much less than under this commonwealth of free nations.  What I wanted to ask the Minister is, whether in the case of a citizen of this State going to Australia and being killed at work, and the ordinary legal processes with a view to getting compensation for his dependents having failed would his Department take up the case if it supplied the particulars.</P>

      <P>I would not intervene in this debate but for all the balderdash we have heard spoken to-night as regards co-equality and all the rest of it on the part of a miserable piece of an island which has equality, with an Ulster bridge-head, equality, with every strategic point of our coast occupied by British troops; equality, with a quarter of a million tribute being paid every year.  When I look down this list of High Commissioners and Ministers Extraordinary I cannot but remember that these salaries of £1,500 are paid for by unfortunate individuals like the one mentioned here to-day who has to pay for unemployment insurance, but because he has nine acres of bog gets no benefit.  These salaries of £1,500 have to be paid so that they might squat like the nigger when he put on the black silk hat and the swallow-tail coat and went out and <Col N="483" /> said he was an English gentleman. Our Ministers Extraordinary, with their £1,500 per year, are something like that.  When I see an item for the expenses of an official entertainment by Ministers in London&mdash;a new charge brought on to the list&mdash;I wonder what kind of a dinner that will be or who will be the guests.  We have heard a lot of talk about some of these dinners formerly which the country is paying for through the nose now.  I suppose when Ministers go to London and meet other Ministers there to whom we are paying tribute to the tune of five and a quarter million pounds out of this little piece of an island every year, they chat over how easily they are fooling the poor idiots here who have to pay out to the bailiffs and the sheriffs for all these entertainments abroad.  We had a statement made the other night by the Minister for Finance about borrowing. Although he borrowed £10,000,000 last year in order to raise funds to carry on he wants to borrow further money next year.  We wonder where it is all going to leave us.  I agree with Deputy Mullins that we should call these gentlemen that we send out by the plain name of trade representatives instead of calling them Ministers Extraordinary and sending them out with £1,500 in their pockets to do nothing. We see here a charge for our High Commissioner's office, London, rent, fuel and lighting costing £4,000. All these things and these big salaries are paid in order to keep up the appearance that this piece of an island is, moryah, a sovereign State.  Deputy Law tells us that our freedom has greatly enlarged.  I ask him to read again the Ultimate Financial Settlement and the Boundary Agreement and a few other little things and then see if he will talk about the enlargement of the freedom that we have got. We know the freedom that Deputies like Deputy Law are aiming for and the freedom they are anxious to obtain.</P>

      <P>It is the result of the policy we heard expounded this evening that sandwich-men are on the streets of Dublin, and in the villages <Col N="485" /> and in the towns.  The Minister sneers at the sandwich-men, but it is his policy that is responsible for such a state of affairs.  That the very best people in the country have nothing but sandwich-boards as a means of obtaining a living is the result of the Free State policy. Deputy Law, in naming a litany of our national leaders, has asked us to recognise that if they could have dreamt in their days that the time would come that they would occupy the position that we now occupy they would have considered themselves great optimists indeed.  The sum of £40,000 is being devoted to a Department of External Affairs.  Window-dressing, and nothing else.  This Department has devoted its activities abroad to lowering the very name of this nation.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, the money which is devoted to this Department should be devoted, in so far as our representatives abroad are concerned, to endeavouring to raise the status of this country and to make it quite clear what the ultimate aim of the people is.  This money has been devoted to the very opposite purpose, to a persistent endeavour to impress upon the people of the world that we are satisfied with our slave status.  The shame and the mockery of it is that we have here, in this House from the moment the Minister introduced his statement, an atmosphere of dope, and Deputy Law rings down the curtain with what I think is nothing short of national blasphemy by saying that our quarrel is with facts and that we do not recognise the extent of the freedom we have gained. What a hollow mockery it is to think that five or six years ago the instrument upon which this House and Constitution rest was put through on the plea that it was either accepted or else immediate and terrible war.</P>

There is no difficulty whatever in voting £40,000 to this external window dressing, but when the money is asked for these poor people, we are told that there is no money available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has wandered over a great many points. Deputy de Valera announced that his Party were going to vote against the Estimate for reasons which I could not actually gather.  I know that one of the objections to the representatives abroad is that, instead of making clear the wishes of the Irish people, they apparently allow themselves to be utilised in the pursuit of political party propaganda.  He went on to indicate what he thought should be the attitude of the representatives abroad, and he had a further proviso as to what was going to be the attitude of the Irish people with regard to a war hereafter. He asked if our representatives abroad made it quite clear to the Governments to which they were accredited, and used their influence throughout the countries to which they were accredited, to see that the sympathetic consideration of those people should be given to the Irish people's wish that in any war hereafter they should be neutral.  I would not like to determine at this moment what will be the Irish people's attitude in connection with any war hereafter, or to say that our representatives abroad should be given officially as part of their instructions a direction that they should embark upon an amount of propaganda for getting other nations sympathetic to Irish claims, so that in any war which occurs this country should be allowed to remain neutral.  I do not know where this proviso as to what the Irish people will do afterwards comes in.  I do not know if the Deputy is again searching his heart to find out what the people wish.  I do not know that we, as an Executive Council, holding office for a number of years, should set out on a course of conduct which would be nothing more or less than broadcasting to outside nations, say, to the <Col N="488" /> United States of America, all the propaganda which the Deputy tries to put out through his own partisans when they are sent there.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture referred to one statement that has been made.  Are we to have it broadcast by representatives of ours that it was a statement made in this country in the past that if certain votes were not cast in a certain way war was going to be carried on by coloured troops in this country?  That is not the purpose for which any Government I know uses its foreign representatives.  It seems to be a peculiar situation that the representatives abroad should be criticised for trying to picture to the people in the countries where they live what the conditions are that operate here.  That can be very simply expressed.  They state that the Treaty was signed.  They state that there were Articles of Agreement for the Treaty, and that these Articles were passed in a particular way.  They state that under that elections were held and that certain results were achieved in those elections. They state what seems to them to be the position of the Free State, say, in America, and that is open to criticism by anybody who believes that the statement is wrong; it is open to criticism amongst a well-informed section of the American populace that might be listening to them.  But that these people should go out of their way simply to say that we have only surface co-equality, that we did not sign or accept the Treaty voluntarily, would be a strange thing for people to do who held back to any tradition that the Dáil had accepted the Treaty and that the Treaty position was secured, not as Deputy O'Connell, by an incidental remark, seemed to insinuate, by any British Act, but by an Act of a previous Dáil, an Act of the people voting in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked by Deputy Lemass&mdash;I am not sure if I am asked by Deputy de Valera&mdash;that I should go into a discussion as to the routine activities of the Department, or the trade activities of the Departmental official abroad.  Deputy Lemass certainly did ask me; in fact, Deputy Lemass put it in this way, that I had stated that information <Col N="489" /> could not be given, and he said that surely as these representatives, who are paid out of this Vote, had been doing something the House should be able to have details given to it.  I have avoided giving details in this case, and I think Deputy de Valera understood the reasons perfectly well, because I said that there was a certain reorganisation on foot, that hereafter the details of that reorganisation would come before the House, and that that would be the time to go into the routine activities of the Department as to the general line upon which representatives abroad work.  I do not think that information could be given until the reorganisation is carried through.</P>
    <P>Information in the form of reports is circulated to Deputies as to the activities of foreign representatives, mainly in trade, but sometimes in other matters.  I do not think that there would be any good in having two debates. What is the good of taking up the Geneva office, the Brussels office or the Paris office, if, as has been outlined, the Paris office, which now consists merely of a trade representative, is going to be extended into something else?  The time, surely, for a discussion of that will come when a definite proposal for the extension of that office is before the House, and similarly with Brussels.  It might be asked if there was to be no other Vote asked for in this matter.  Why go through figures which are really before the House in the published returns that are issued to Deputies?  If I went into these figures with regard to, say, the Brussels office, if the Brussels office is going to be substantially changed, if it is to be put under new direction, if there is going to be any change, either in the status or the method of control, the time to discuss that would come later, when a Supplementary Estimate comes up.  But even then I view with horror a situation in which I would be asked to state the routine activities of the Departmental officials abroad.  I rather hope that what are described as routine activities will be put before the House in reports, circulated either yearly or at other periods, according to whatever material can be handled.</P>
    <P>I am making no promise with regard to the future, until I see what staffs <Col N="490" /> will handle the information and how it can be best presented to the House.  If anyone wanted to see what the routine activities of the Department are it would merely be a matter of visiting the headquarters office, or some of the offices abroad.  Nobody could pretend to cover in a speech all the petty details of the ordinary office, either for trade representatives or diplomatic representatives abroad, and I hope that reports will not be clogged up with statements as to more definitely routine things.  In addition to that there have been statements made in various discussions as to what are the general lines on which the office works.  I had taken for granted that these would have been adverted to previously and that all that the Minister would be expected to state in succeeding years would be important changes or new directions in the line of procedure.  I do not at all agree that there is any evasion in the statement that reorganisation is on foot.  Progress brings about reorganisation.  The old organisation of the Department was as it was when it was first taken in hands, and unless people were to advert immediately to gathering together a staff and the setting up of an organisation outside any activities that were previously foreshadowed, I do not see how any other circumstance could arise than that before us now, namely, that the consideration of matters now to be handled by the Department necessitates the employment of more staff, the placing of people in more definite positions, the change in the status of certain office representatives, and the fiting of the whole situation, office, office equipment and staff, to the new duties, or the duties we now seem to have accumulated and which require attention.</P>
    <P>Similarly several people have asked, with regard to trade representatives, if an effort has been made to obtain alternative markets.  There seems to be a peculiar confusion of thought with regard to this question of alternative markets.  I do not know that anybody is going to demand that people should be sent abroad having as their instructions that at the moment the certain flow of our exports is towards a certain market, and that that must be changed whether alternative markets offer better possibilities or worse.  It is a <Col N="491" /> question of a relation and comparison, and it is amazing the enthusiasm there is for alternative markets, whether or not the new countries that apparently are going to be opened up for our produce are going to offer equally good conditions, or worse conditions.  It seems to me to be absurd.  There has been an attempt made in a small way to secure other markets.  All the results achieved can be seen year by year, or month by month, in the Trade Reports which are issued.  These are things which should be looked to.  I hope no one is foolish enough to rely on trade returns of imports and exports as the only evidence that can be given of the actions of our representatives abroad. There is a great deal more to be done abroad even than trade.  There is a great deal more than trade or than what is called diplomatic relations to be looked after abroad.  There is the collection of information for the Department, social legislation, methods of finance, methods of taxation, and status in various ways.  It would be quite absurd and unfair to those who are abroad to take as some of their activities, or as evidence of their activities, the trade returns published from time to time, or even to take as evidence the activities of the trade representatives themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell has asked about the Constitutional Committee.  I am sure the Deputy realises the extreme importance of the matters set out under the three sub-heads in the Imperial Conference Report, and the points to be dealt with by the Committee, and realises the importance of having everything very definitely and clearly considered and all the material gathered together before a delegation from this country would go into such a Committee.  It has taken a considerable amount of time to prepare.  I might stress again what was stressed by the Minister for Defence, that, in so far as the third heading is concerned, we have a very definite position that the Colonial Laws Validity Acts have no relation to this country.  I am having all the materials prepared to justify the position we have taken up.  Obviously we did not take up that position without previous consideration, and <Col N="492" /> arguments come up from time to time and have to be met.  All the other Governments have exactly the same problem before them.  The Deputy will admit that these are very grave constitutional points that have to be inquired into.  The Deputy will know hereafter what is the attitude of the Free State representatives on such a Committee. In addition to the time required for preparation, there have been difficulties of a temporary nature with regard to this Constitutional Conference.  I refer to the elections in other countries.  We had our own election last year.  That Committee is to meet next year, and the material with regard to it will probably be circulated to the Governments to be represented quite soon.  We are certainly going to lose no time in getting that Committee together consistent with our own preparations and readiness to enter into its deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to his experience at Toronto at an exhibition there, and to the fact that the Free State exhibit was a small one.  In another Vote, already passed by this House, there is a certain sum given me for international exhibitions and fairs. It is a small sum of money, and was definitely made small for this reason: Up to date, when invitations have been issued with regard to participation in international exhibitions and fairs, the first thing to do is to find out how far industrialists and commercial firms here will support such an exhibition. Mainly the response has been very little; very, very disappointing.  It is almost impossible to get industrialists and commercial people in this country to recognise the value of such exhibitions, and the small Vote asked for in the Department of Industry and Commerce is indicative of the success we have had in getting these people to agree to participate in exhibitions of the sort.  In the matter of Balbriggan wear, to which reference was made, that is rather a technical thing.  There have been decisions on some of these place-names under the Trade Marks Copyright and other Industrial Property Acts, which refer now not so much to the country of origin as to specific types of articles and types of fabrics.  Whether this is a case in point I cannot say.  I would have to <Col N="493" /> have details of what the Deputy speaks of before me, and have them examined departmentally.  The Deputy asks about the optional clause, and in connection with that I cannot do better than read what the Vice-President stated at Geneva on 10th September:</P>
    <P>The delegate of Canada, Mr. MacKenzie King, on Friday last recalled to us that his country had, many years ago, agreed with the United States that any disputes that might arise between them should be settled by arbitration, and that, in fact, many disputes have been so settled. He added, to the gratification of the Assembly, that experience led the people of Canada to favour, in so far as Canadian questions were concerned, the reference to arbitration of all international disputes of a judicial or legal nature, and the settlement by methods of conciliation or arbitration of all other differences which might arise between Canada and any other nation.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I do not hesitate to say that the Irish Free State is no less strongly in favour of arbitration than Canada.</P>
    <P>That represents the general viewpoint of the Government with regard to the Permanent Court and the optional clause.  That matter is being definitely considered and that marks the point reached in September.  We hope to progress further in that respect later.  Deputy O'Connell asked whether it was not expected that the trade representative in New York might be sufficient for Canada also.  In so far as there has been consideration given to the question of Canada&mdash;and it has been definitely considered&mdash;the indication is not that we would be satisfied with a trade representative in New York for Canada also, or even that we should have merely in Canada a trade representative.  I can go no further than that at the moment. Deputy Lemass wondered what was going to happen if our representatives at international conferences by their vote or by deliberations, or by what they said, brought about strained relations with Great Britain, and I think he asked&mdash;he certainly implied it if he <Col N="494" /> did not put it explicitly&mdash;if the Free State Government would support them. I cannot understand the circumstances in which representatives of this Government would bring about strained relations with British representatives at an international conference, and that the Free State Government which appointed these representatives would not support them. I may not have taken down the Deputy's question correctly, but the context in which the phrase occurs implied that the Free State representatives who went to international conferences were always bound to agree with the British representatives.  Again, that is a matter that can only be answered by pointing to the various discussions and conferences when there have been occasions on which there was a most definite disagreement, a disagreement which was maintained to the end, while still friendly relations were preserved.  It is not improbable these things will happen again, when the Free State point of view at an international conference will be diametrically opposed to the attitude of the English representatives.  But there is no reason why there should be strained relations simply because there is disagreement at international conferences. The Deputy asked a question, to which I have referred already: are we endeavouring to get sympathetic consideration for this State's neutrality?  He spoke about neutrality in a future war, and about the attitude of the citizens in this country in a future war.  I wonder would any man be brave enough to stand up and say what was the attitude of this State in the last big war?</P>
    <P>What was the point of view which was expressed by the President on Deputy Carney, Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Flinn in a compulsory capacity in uniform?  What was the attitude of Deputy MacEntee, who wanted to get into uniform and missed his train? What was the attitude of a great many other people in this House who took up arms against the particular people who were fighting?  Surely the situation changed.  The situation in 1914, at the outbreak of the world war, was entirely different from the situation here in 1916, and from that on until the war <Col N="495" /> ceased.  Who is going to say what is going to be the attitude of this State towards a future war, and, again, who is going, with any assurance, to claim that only this country is to be guaranteed, alone of all other countries in the world, against participation in a future war?  Who is going to say why we should be singled out?  Deputy Kennedy, in reply to Deputy Law, said that our position under a Republic would leave us in a much stronger position than we are in at the moment.  Deputy Law at any rate put up an argument&mdash;it may not be acceptable to Deputy Kennedy&mdash;that being associated in a certain capacity with certain nations we are strong in the matter of armies and navies, and that there was less chance of invasion than if this country had to rely on itself, as it would in the end, because treaties of neutrality and guarantees of neutrality do not count for much when war circumstances intervene.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the alternative markets, a point to which I referred, and went on to refer to the importance of Soviet Russia and the sale of herrings to that country, about which Deputy Mullins afterwards got so lyrical.  I am not at all sure that this country cannot sell all the herrings it has to Russia.  If it is found that the absence of some diplomatic relations prevents herrings being sold to the Russian population who are ready to pay for them, I would like to have that made clear to me.  On the only occasion on which a business proposition came up to me from people interested in Russia, it was framed in such a way that it could not be classed as a business one at all, and it failed on that ground.  Even on that occasion there was never any question about the absence of a trade representative or a diplomatic representative, or of the absence of any treaty with Russia or of any part of it.  Deputy Lemass made the insinuation that if we could get the permission of our Imperial masters we could have a resumption of trade with Russia.  There is no permission necessary for anything we have to sell to Russia if she wishes to purchase and pay for it.  The best way to test that is, let us get a decent, sound, economic <Col N="496" /> proposition and see if it is going to be prevented by any outside agency or absence of trade relations, and let us see if in those circumstances we cannot proceed to link up with Russia in a definite way.</P>
    <P>Someone afterwards said&mdash;I think it was Deputy Mullins&mdash;that a Cork factory was to have the monopoly of the supply of tractors.  I do not know where the monopoly is to be secured to the Cork factory with regard to the supplying of tractors anywhere.  There is one firm reckoned to be the main firm for manufacturing tractors here, but that it has the sole right of sale to any country outside I have yet to learn.  Deputy Esmonde was disappointed that I had only referred to one or two items with regard to what I call the advance made internationally this year.  I could not refer to the Bremen or to the visit of the Chief Justice to the States, although these were two events of great importance, because I was only dealing with things which have some connection with the State as a State.  Although it is true that we were connected with the flight across the Atlantic, and that it was an important thing that the Chief Justice should be invited to America by the Bar Association of America, those are not matters which appertain to the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>On the matter of civil aviation, Deputy Esmonde was anxious that the convention referred to in the last portion of the Annexe to the Treaty should be concluded at once.  The convention does not hold up the development of civil aviation.  What holds it up is the want of money, and it is impossible in the present condition of things, I think, to look for any new money for civil aviation development. It may be possible to get money for civil aviation by way of subvention by subtracting it from other Votes, and I am attempting to have that done, but if there is money for civil aviation the question of this convention does not arise.  It only arises in certain circumstances, and these circumstances have nothing to do with civil aviation and its development.</P>
    <P>Our relation with Australia is a matter which may have to be contio <Col N="497" /> sidered hereafter, but these relations have to be taken in the order of their importance gauged on the facts before us, and although it is quite true that Australia holds a considerable number of our people we have interests of more immediate importance in countries other than Australia.  The Deputy may rest assured that the question of Australia as a member of the Commonwealth of Nations will not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>The Privy Council was referred to by Deputy Esmonde and some other Deputies.  There has been a change in the situation with regard to the Privy Council.  That particular situation. which was not very clear early, was very much clarified at the 1926 Imperial Conference.  There is a very definite statement made in that which Deputy Esmonde quoted in a question which he put to me some days ago:&mdash;&ldquo;That it was no part of the policy of his Majesty's Government in Great Britain that questions regarding appeals should be determined otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of the portion of the Empire primarily affected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there are changes to be considered, and we reserve our right to bring up the question again, but meanwhile and all the time that declaration I read stands, and that is the declaration upon which we found any course of conduct we may take with regard to appeals generally and the right of specific appeal.  Deputy Hogan raised a point, I think, as to whether we were represented on one appeal which was taken before the Privy Council.  We may have different views on different cases.  The Deputy says we do not recognise the court.  It is not right to say that we have held that attitude always.  There was a definite statement made here certainly when the Lynham and Butler case was being considered. There was a definite type of case in which it might be considered for years to come, while certain implications to the Treaty were being considered, that it was right to allow certain appeals to go before the Privy Council.  That situation has changed definitely by the attitude of the people who granted the right of appeal where it did not seem right to us it should be granted. <Col N="498" /> There is a changing situation which has to be met in different ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullins thinks that Ambassadors sent from this State are only shams and hypocrites.  That opinion may carry weight with some people who may regard the Deputy as an authority on ambassadors, on shams and hypocrites, but it will not hold against facts.  The facts are that representation abroad has been found to be very useful and to have beneficial results for this State, both from a status and a trade point of view.  The only suggestion which, I think, Deputy Mullins made was that we should appoint trade representatives to Russia.  His whole speech seemed to proceed on the basis that if we had a trade representative there it would be his business to sell fish to the Russians.  That is not the business of a trade representative, who generally has to tackle trade questions, to clear up difficulties, and to make it easier for traders to trade with particular countries, but not to become recipients of cargoes of certain goods and to proceed to unload them on the Russian or any other market.  The Deputy, having the view that ambassadors are no good, and that a trade representative in Russia might be good, is completely out of touch with modern thought on these matters, because most nations have come to the conclusion that diplomatic representation, including, as it does, trade and commercial representation, is a much better type of representation than merely trade representation.  The diplomatic agent, who is in direct touch with the Government of a country, must be of greater value to his country than a particular type of representative who cannot get into direct touch with such Government.</P>
    <P>The situation will change according to the relative importance of a country and its trade, or according to the diplomatic matters that have to be dealt with.  Deputy Kennedy asked a question as to foreign litigants.  That is not any part of the Department's business.  I thought he was referring to people here having some right of action against people abroad.  The Department does not act as a legal adviser to people in this country who <Col N="499" /> think they have a right of action or a claim on property abroad.  There might be questions arising out of a particular case which it would be the duty of the Department to clear up.  If an individual case does arise it is the duty of the people concerned to have legal representatives who will probably have legal agents abroad who could be briefed on the matter, and they could get the situation cleared up in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney was very angry with my reference to sandwich-men.  I have no attitude, either of disdain or contempt, with regard to them.  The Deputy asked a foolish question.  He apparently thought that he discovered a mare's nest and that people were being forbidden for political purposes to carry sandwich-boards.  I found out that the reason they were prohibited was because they did not obey the police regulations in regard to them, and I told the Deputy that that type of subject was more in his line than diplomatic representation.  I might say the same to Deputy Corry, who gave us an example of the motley and whose remarks, though they may have amused himself, lowered the tone of the whole debate and the dignity of the House.  He said that the Minister for Finance had to borrow money to provide funds for these expenses.  If he has to borrow, it is not to meet these expenses.  They are ordinary expenses which have to be met out of taxation, and if there is borrowing it will be for another purpose.</P>
    <P>In reply to the observations of Deputy Lemass in regard to visas, I may mention that the total expenditure of the Department was £48,000.  Receipts from passports were £11,000, and there is a sum of £850 for rents receivable for the letting of part of the High Commissioner's offices.  There is, in addition, a sum of £13,000 from visas collected by means of revenue stamps, and that amount appears in the accounts of the Revenue Commissioners. Last year the amount received was about £11,000.  As I say, the estimated receipts from that source will reach <Col N="500" /> £13,000.  That is not shown here, because it is credited in some way to the accounts of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>So far back as three years ago this question of legislation in regard to the acquisition of rights of citizenship had been considered, but it was crushed out by other matters which were considered to be of more importance.  The Department of Justice is preparing legislation, but I cannot say if they are working on the old heads of legislation which existed in a vague form in regard to the matter.  There is, however, consideration being given to the question of future acquisition of the right of citizenship.</P>

We note that the sum to be provided includes £600,000, which is an <Col N="504" /> annuity payable to the British Local Loans Fund under Article 5 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement of the 19th March, 1926, in respect of the agreed amount of advances therefrom outstanding on 1st April, 1926.  As our Party are opposed in toto to the Ultimate Financial Settlement, it is quite obvious that we could not allow this Vote to go without a challenge.  Therefore, in view of the agreement that has been arrived at, that the other Votes should be taken more or less without discussion, I am simply going to be content with explaining our attitude on the matter and saying that we must ask for a division in regard to it.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to say in respect of this Vote that has not been already said.  The arrangement to repay in a twenty year period a fixed annuity of £600,000, instead of collecting the repayments and interest and remitting the proceeds, was an advantageous arrangement to this country and will ultimately bring a sum running well into seven figures into the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankKerlin" hpid="Mr. KERLIN Mr. KERLIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Vote I would like to draw the <Col N="507" /> Minister's attention to what I consider the totally inadequate rates of pay for chemists employed by the Government in the State Laboratory.  I wish to refer particularly to the position of those described in the Estimate as junior chemists, both established and temporary.  I understand that the qualifications for each of these posts is that of an honours B.Sc. degree with a couple of years' practical experience. I know that in actual fact the majority of these junior chemists have secured an M.Sc. degree, and that in addition they have carried out certain post-graduate research work.  On referring to the Estimate we see that the salaries of junior unestablished chemists range from £180 to £220. These are exclusive salaries and carry no bonus.  These, to my mind, are very inadequate salaries for men with an M.Sc. degree or an honours B.Sc. degree, for men who have spent three or four years in a university and whose education and training have entailed considerable expense.  I consider this state of affairs most inequitable.  There are hundreds of tradesmen and men in clerical positions in the City of Dublin who have far higher salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of those unestablished men, it appears from information that I have obtained that there is no possibility of their being established, and that they must be content to remain as temporary officials with no prospect of promotion in the service, no prospect of security of tenure, and no prospect of obtaining any pension rights.  When we come to the position of established chemists, we find that it is not very much better.  From information obtained, I understand that three junior chemists were recently established after four and a half years' service in that Department, and that they are now in receipt of a salary of £130, together with bonus amounting in all to a total salary of £207 per annum.  For the first couple of years after being established they will actually be receiving less than they were receiving as temporary officers.  The position is that they must go back to the beginning of the scale.  Taking the case of an unmarried man, the annual increment <Col N="508" /> is £7 10s., rising to a maximum of £250, plus bonus after 16 years' service.  To refer to individual cases, the chemist who deals with all toxicological cases, the man who deals with poison cases, such, for instance, as the Malahide case, who is responsible for important work such as that, only gets a salary of £195 per annum with bonus, amounting in all to about £290 per year.  I understand that the man who looks after this work in England is in receipt of a salary of £4,000 per annum.  I am not going to suggest that our man who looks after this work should get a salary anything like that, but I do think that the salary he is in receipt of is not at all in accordance with the importance and responsibility of the work that he is doing.  Again, the man who acts as referee chemist and deals with all disputed cases of analysis which come in from local bodies and who would naturally be looked upon as being particularly exact and careful in his work, is in receipt of a salary amounting to only a little more than £5 per week.</P>
    <P>If we compare the rates of pay in this Department with the rates of pay in other Departments, which from the point of view of size and the nature of the work carried out would be looked upon as being similar, the big difference which exists is very apparent. For instance, take the Estate Duty Office.  We have there three assistant principal clerks with salaries ranging from £550 to £700, together with bonus.  We have ten examiners with salaries ranging from £250 to £500, plus bonus.  We have three assistant examiners with salaries ranging from £90 to £350, plus bonus, and there are three clerical officers with salaries averaging about £200 each, plus bonus. In the Office of Public Works, we find that there are four architects with salaries ranging from £500 to £650, with bonus; nineteen assistant architects with salaries ranging from £150 to £450, with bonus.  There are eight assistant architects (temporary) with an inclusive salary of from £7 to £8 per week.  There are twelve temporary clerks of works with a salary of from £6 to £6 13s. a week, inclusive.  If we refer to these two particular Departments, <Col N="509" /> and to many other Departments throughout the Civil Service, such, say, as the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the Department of Finance, we can easily see the big difference that exists in the payment of those officers.</P>
    <P>In general, I do not think the Minister or any Deputy will deny that the salaries paid to the chemists in this State laboratory are inadequate.  As I pointed out in my opening remarks, the standard in this case is an honours degree standard, and accordingly those men should rank as junior administrative officers in the Civil Service, but they are only paid on a scale which, I think, is inferior to that of junior executive officers, and in their case I think the educational standard is much lower.  I think it only approximates to the leaving certificate of secondary schools, or at least to a pass degree standard.  There was an agitation last year, and in earlier years, in the Press and elsewhere, for increased salaries for trained engineers, and I understand as a result of that agitation the position of engineers has been, to a certain extent at least, improved.  I am not quite sure, but as far as I can recollect, the salaries of engineers in certain of the Government and public services have been increased as a result of that agitation. The position of chemist in this Department is similar to that of engineers. These men had to spend three or four years in a university, and their training cost in round figures something like £1,000.  After that training and expenditure the Government employ these men at what are definitely inadequate salaries.  That is certainly not giving much encouragement to young men to enter the universities, and to take up professions such as chemical science and engineering.</P>
    <P>The point that struck me was that if these young men had not gone on for these professions if they had entered the Civil Service and became junior executive officers at the age of seventeen or eighteen they would now be in a far better position.  For instance, we have the case of a junior chemist who has been established, after four and a half years' service and is now in receipt of the princely salary of £207 per annum, inclusive. <Col N="510" /> He had to spend four years in a university and had to have two years' practical training before he got that post.  After roughly ten years' training and service he has reached the salary of £207 per annum, inclusive. If he had entered the service ten years ago as a junior executive officer, unmarried, he would have received £90 as an initial salary, and with ten years' increment he would now have £165 plus bonus, amounting to £270 per annum.  I think it is not fair that a man who has spent so many years in his profession, and on whose education his people spent so much money, should not be admitted to the Civil Service on terms equal at least to those of men who entered at eighteen. I suggest these chemists should rank as junior administrative officers, and receive corresponding salaries, and further, that men who are established after a certain number of years in the service should not have to go back to the bottom of the scale, but should receive increments in respect of each year of service.  Finally, I think the Minister should be able to fix on an establishment for this Department after several years' experience of the nature and extent of the work.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying to these points that I have raised he will probably be sarcastic about appeals for increased salaries coming from this side of the House, but I suggest the increased cost necessitated by giving these officials a salary commensurate with their qualifications and service could easily be met by cutting down the salaries of a few of the excessively-salaried officials who can be found in dozens throughout the Civil Service. I think a sum of between £1,000 and £2,000 would be sufficient, in the beginning at any rate, to give these men something in the nature of adequate salaries, and that could easily be saved by cutting down the salaries of even ten of the excessively-salaried officials to whom I have referred. There is room for considerable reduction in those salaries, but at the same time I think there are other officials in the service, such as those junior chemists who are badly paid and who are deserving of special consideration. <Col N="511" /> There is another point that possibly arises in connection with this Vote, and that is the question of what might be described as national research work.  I would like to ask the Minister has he considered the advisability of putting chemists on research work, such as the utilisation of peat resources, the development of our mineral deposits, and in general the study of chemical manufacturing processes which could be economically developed in this country when the Shannon scheme has matured.  In connection with the salaries of the junior chemists I ask the Minister to give this matter earnest consideration.  It is no frivolous case I am raising.  There is really a genuine hardship in this case. I am sure the Minister if he considers the facts would be one of the first to admit that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that there is nothing anomalous in Fianna Fáil Deputies asking for an increased salary for scientists.  It is because of the country's poverty&mdash;a strong reason at least for making such a demand is simply because of the country's poverty.  The country is so poor that her scientists are more important to her than would be the case in a rich country.  Even if there were not the anomalies that exist in comparing the salaries of that Department with the salaries of an ordinary Service Department, there would still be a strong case for asking for special consideration for those employed in the State Laboratory. I know that there is a desire to get through this Vote as quickly as possible; nevertheless I would ask the Minister to say what work is the Laboratory principally engaged in at the moment.  We would like to know whether it is a branch of the Customs or Excise, or whether an effort is being made to make it a Department of Scientific Research.  In that connection I would like to know whether the Minister has considered the amalgamation of the State Laboratory and the Geological Survey.  It seems a bit unnatural that these two Departments- should be separate if the purpose of the State Laboratory is to do research work.  We all know that the chief of <Col N="512" /> the State Laboratory is a great authority on peat; that he is one of our greatest assets, and I would like to know whether that great knowledge of his and his enthusiasm with regard to peat is being availed of to any extent. It is his belief&mdash;I know it was his belief a few years ago, at all events&mdash; that the peat deposits would yet turn out to be a great source of wealth to us.  It would be a sorry thing if, in the present condition of the country, when Ministers practically admit that they can see no chance for industry in the country, when they are, at least judging by the recent speeches of the Minister for Finance, simply in despair for something of a big industrial kind to turn up&mdash;it would be a very unfortunate thing if there were not some effort made to utilise the peat resources of the country.  We would like to have a statement from the Minister on this, as to the real purpose of the Laboratory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As the time is short, I would not undertake to start replying at length to all the points raised.  I will deal first with Deputy Moore's question.  The State Laboratory is nothing in the way of a Department of Scientific Research.  As a matter of fact, I do not think that research could very well be done in connection with the State Laboratory.  I think research such as the Deputy has in mind should be done either in the University or in some way under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce. Though it has had other work, and will always have other work, the particular work of the State Laboratory is to make the tests that are necessary for Revenue purposes or for purposes in connection with Government contracts, and for the volume of work being done there, being very largely routine, I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to try to make it a Department of Research.  I think research ought to be done separately. There is a certain amount of money voted each year for research scholarships. I think it is £720.  Perhaps that money could be used differently.  Perhaps more money could be used if a <Col N="513" /> scheme were thought of along these lines.  I do not think it should be done by the State Laboratory.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Kerlin's argument, I do not think we have anything to do with what it costs to qualify a man for one of these positions. There is no reason why we should pay more than the commercial rates for a post like this.  We pay what from the human point of view is a living wage.  There is no reason why we should pay more than they could get for doing similar work outside. There is only a comparatively small proportion of what one would call high-class work done in the State Laboratory.  A great proportion of the work is rather of a routine character. The only thing which we have to do, the only lines on which we can go in connection with this is simply to pay the sort of wages that are being paid outside and the sort of wages that will get us qualified individuals.  I believe that the State is not justified in all circumstances in paying the lowest rate at which they can get people.  I say that because there is the human element and there are certain rates below which you should not go, rates that the most unskilled get.  But when we leave unskilled people out of account, then naturally the proper line to take is to pay the rates that will get us people who are able to do the work.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of the Deputies on this side of the House to oppose this Vote and to oppose it very strongly.  We think it a very bad principle that public moneys should be put into the hands of any group of individuals for expenditure in a secret manner, and on activities which are not revealed or as to which no indication is given to this House.  We are here presented with the bare statement that £10,000 is required for Secret Service. We have not in the Estimates, nor have we had from the Minister, any statement as to what this money is to be expended on.  Is it too much to ask that the Minister should give some indication of what has been done and is being done with this money?  Is the Secret Service a political Secret Service? Is the money being used to ascertain information concerning the activities of the Minister's political <Col N="516" /> opponents?  I would prefer if the Minister would give us in the Estimates or some other way an indication that it is impossible for the money to be used in that way.  As far as we are concerned, we know that it is quite possible to use the money in that way.  We know that an individual named Harling, who recently became notorious and is now admittedly a member of the C.I.D., came into the Fianna Fáil offices and applied for a position as messenger at 15/- a week.  He is a married man, and it is not unfair to assume that he did not want that appointment unless he had an additional source of income which possibly came out of this Vote. I wonder would the Minister tell us why a married man came to apply for a post as boy messenger, worth 15/- a week?</P>
      <P>I do not know whether there are any of the present employees at the head office of Fianna Fáil in receipt of any money out of this Vote.  It is possible there are, but I agree it is likely there are not, because we have had several cases raised here recently of members of the Civic Guard raiding the houses of officers of the Fianna Fáil organisation and arresting delegates to Fianna Fáil Conventions off trains for the purpose of seizing documents, reading them, and supplying the Government with evidence of the activities of the organisation.  If the Government had secret sources for supplying them with the same information they would not care to take the onus of carrying out these raids in public as they are carried out.  We, therefore, must assume that this money is being expended for international secret service purposes, if it is not being spent on political secret service work.  Perhaps we can guess that there are persons in the employment of the State in the United States of America counting the battleships, or in France counting the submarines.  Will the Minister assure us that that is not the case or will he assure us, in view of the attitude which his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, took on a certain Vote to-day, that they are not in Russia organising a white revolution?</P>

      <P>Any sort of revolution. The fact remains that we have received no information from the Minister as to what purpose this money is being devoted, and yet the Dáil is asked to vote it blindly.  It is a rotten principle, a principle which should be abolished.  It is a survival of mediaevalism, and in an ordinary, modern, democratic State it is not right that a blank cheque should be given to any body of men to use in any way they like and for purposes avowedly secret.  Certain facts have been brought to our notice which would indicate that there is a body of men in this country associated in some way with the police forces, whose main function appears to be the organisation of crime.  We have had cases of men induced to attempt the rescue of a prisoner in Mountjoy and supplied with guns for that purpose by a person who afterwards, it appeared, was in the employment of the Government.  He have had the case of Harling, who admitted that he attempted to organise a Republican organisation in addition to those that exist.  I know there were some organisations that existed in this country recently, organisations with which our Party were not identified, but which were, I think, somewhat in opposition to the Government.  There were organisations such as that which called itself the I.R.A.O.&mdash;the Irish Republican Army Organisation&mdash;and which, in my firm conviction, contained more secret service spies of the Government than it did members who honestly subscribed to the principles for which it was avowedly established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system is wrong, and, it being a wrong system, it must inevitably produce evil results.  I wonder if the Minister will tell us whether there are any Appropriations-in-Aid in connection with this Vote?  Does the secret service agent who organises a bank robbery stick to the spoils or hand it to the Ministry to be put against the cost of <Col N="518" /> the organisation of that raid?  When a post office is raided, as did happen recently, by a gentleman who, I think it has since been admitted, was in the employment of the Government, do the proceeds go into that man's pocket or go against the expenses of the organisation of the raid?  I believe while you have an avenue provided by which money can be expended secretly for purposes which are not merely secret but are of such a nature that they cannot be disclosed, evil is bound to result.  It would be much better for the Government to put on the Civic Guard and the forces associated with them all responsibility for the suppression of crime in this country.  You have 700 detectives, plain clothes policeman, and if they are not able to get all the information required to enable the Civic Guard to maintain order, then no information will be secured as a result of the expenditure of this money.  It is a waste of money.  This Vote is possibly used by the Government in a manner which they know to be wasteful, but which they believe to be necessary in order to buy the acquiescence of some people who might otherwise be troublesome. I hope the Dáil will reject it.  It is not likely they will, in view of some of the Votes they have passed.  We, however, will vote against it, because we believe that in principle it is wrong.</P>

      <P>&mdash;likely to organise crimes of violence or attempt, by <Col N="519" /> means of armed force, to overturn the authority of a Government elected by the people.  No money out of this Vote is spent for the purpose of finding out anything about Deputy Lemass now.  Perhaps two or three years ago the money was spent in obtaining information about his activities. The Deputy says that it is a rotten principle, and that it should be unnecessary in an ordinary, democratic State.  If there were no remains of the organisations that were so very active two or three years ago, and no offsprings from them in existence it might be unnecessary to have any expenditure under that head.  Certainly very little would be necessary.  But occasionally, even for dealing with ordinary crime, the authorities must have a little money at their disposal that will not have to be accounted for in detail and supported by vouchers for the Comptroller and Auditor-General. If we had none of these pretended military <Col N="520" /> organisations which can do nothing except die or become murder organisations&mdash;if we had none of the remains of these, it would be unnecessary to spend very much money.  As I stated, for years the expenditure from this source went down very rapidly up to last year.  There was some increase then, but what I think happened up to July twelve months was that we decreased the expenditure too rapidly.  As long as you have people talking about renewing war and giving utterances to the sentiments that one occasionally hears, though less frequently as time goes on, it is necessary to have money and to use it to discover so far as possible any plans that they may be making to resort to armed crime, or for the encouragement of crime, and, if necessary, to pay for the information that any of their members are prepared to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this Vote.  In the British days, I understood this department was practically a department of the British Army, and from what I can gather it is practically the same now.  I have a letter here from one of the dismissed civil assistants&mdash;one of the men dismissed in 1916.  I should like to read first his notice of dismissal:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When I was discharged in 1916 I had twelve years' service as a temporary civil assistant, and if I had been retained I would, in the ordinary course of events, be put on the pension list in September, 1918.  During the Truce period the discharged men from all branches formed an association, called the &lsquo;Victimised Civil Servants' Association,&rsquo; and made representations to the late Mr. Michael Collins, who promised to look into their claim, with the result <Col N="524" /> that some men were reinstated immediately, and the Ordnance Survey, with one exception, were reinstated in February, 1924.  The terms were that for civil assistant, pensions service would count from the date of their discharge by the British Government, and the temporary civil assistants would have to do a qualifying period of 15 years from the date that they were discharged before they should be put on the pension list.  A good number of us were obliged to accept these terms through force of circumstances.  Needless to say, we feel that having to do another qualifying period is a great hardship, and, further, that, according to present Civil Service Regulations, we would not, even at the end of 15 years, be then eligible for pensions, as there is a regulation to the effect that the Civil Service Commissioners will not put any person on the pension list who is over 50 years old.  Also the probability is that we would not be able to pass the standard of physical fitness which is also essential at such an advanced age.  I am one of the youngest of the men concerned, and at the end of the qualifying period I would be 53 years old.  I would be forced to retire at the age of 60, assuming I was put on the pension list at the age of 53.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House, but I want to contrast that with the treatment meted out to people already drawing disability pensions from the British Army, and while I think these men may be all right, I think the others should get fair play.  This man says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That would be a very poor recompense for my 41 years spent in one of the most useful and most intricate of the public services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And under these circumstances he asks me to bring the matter before the Dáil and he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In asking for this concession, we are only asking to be put on equality with our colleagues, who joined the British Army during the Great War.  These men were never taken off the Ordnance Survey pay list, and received increases of pay, and were put on the pension list <Col N="525" /> while serving in the Army.  They were also excluded from all examinations required, and are now, I am glad to say, working side by side with us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He is not a very bitter man apparently.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;as there were only two killed and nine or ten wounded.  The remainder did not get a scratch, but are all drawing disability pensions, with few exceptions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We got this question raised with the Minister for Finance about two years ago, but he was (we believe) prompted by the Ordnance officials at Phoenix Park (the Acting Director and the Chief Clerk, who belonged to the old gang) with the result that he denied that we were entitled to pension rights, and the fact that we got compensation did not entitle us to any further consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, he got miserable compensation. I think there is a case for this man's position to be reviewed.  I believe that this was part of the British Army establishment when the British Army was here, and if the present Army were taking it over I could quite understand their not wanting to have these civilian officials in their way, and to have it under the Army might be the proper thing to do.  But I understand that is not the position, and that it will not be the position, and in that case I certainly say that these civilians should get at least the same treatment as the British military got.  Some time ago I brought up the case of a Mr. Rowland, and the Minister had some correspondence with him after I raised the matter in the Dáil.  The Minister said that this man had got a very fair trial.  He was one of the civilians who was dismissed for not joining the Army, and he got reinstated along with the rest when the late Mr. Collins had them reinstated. He fell foul of some of these discharged British soldiers, and I mentioned in the House before the case of one man he had trouble with.  Since then I was down in Roscommon, where I met people who can vouch as to the truth of the statement made by Rowland with regard to the conduct of this man, who was superintendent of one of these sections. He behaved in a disgraceful manner.  I actually met people who <Col N="526" /> were prepared to give evidence if necessary. Mr. Rowland alleges that his case was not properly heard, that he simply got the usual drumhead courtmartial, which could be expected from a Department which is run at present by people who served the British Army faithfully and who at present, I believe, are doing the same.</P>
    <P>That is about the staff.  I would like to know what we are spending £46,270 on at present.  I understand that only a few areas&mdash;part of Roscommon and Mayo&mdash;have been revised.  I speak subject to correction, but I think it took three years to produce the revised sheets for these areas.  I know that there were several applications for them, and it took about three years&mdash;I may be a little out in that&mdash;to get these sheets available for the public.  I also raised the case of bad work on a certain bog, and I got the usual answer. I do not blame the Minister, because he has to rely on his officials, but I do suggest that these people are part and parcel of one institution, that is, the British Army, that an independent investigation into the work of the whole Department would certainly do no harm.  I would also like to know what proportion the indoor staff bear to the outdoor staff, because it is the outdoor staff that has to supply all the material for the work of this Department, the people who go into the fields, revise and survey&mdash;I think it is only revision work that is being carried out now&mdash;but I would like to know what proportion these staffs bear to one another.  I may not be able to get an answer now, but I might get it some other time.  I would also like to know what is the proportion of the indoor staff to the staff that was in the office at the time that the British handed over the service.  It is common knowledge that a number of valuable plates that were there at the time were either taken away or destroyed by the British, and it is also said&mdash;I cannot prove it, of course&mdash; that when the service was about to be handed over a number of these Royal Engineers who were ranked as soldiers were put on the permanent Civil Service list, so as to be eligible under Article 10 of the Treaty.  If that is not so, I would like to have it contradicted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> In recruiting for the service in the British days boys who went into the office had to give an undertaking that they would join the Army on reaching a certain age.  It was really a branch of the Royal Engineers, and that is why the pay was so miserably small. This gentleman who gave me his case is engaged at present as a surveyor working side by side with Land Commission officials, and I understand that there are others in the same position. He says he is a competent surveyor, and I am sure if he was not he would not be employed.  There is a very great discrepancy in the salaries paid to people like him, who have to go through this hard field of work of the Survey, and the salaries paid to Land Commission surveyors.  The maximum he can reach is £150 per annum, and I think the lowest class of surveyor in the Land Commission has from £200 to £275 per annum, plus bonus.  I do not think that that is fair.  If a man is able to do his work&mdash;and I am sure he is&mdash;it is not fair to ask him to work side by side with people of the same profession at a lower salary than they have.  These men got their training through practical experience in the field; the others were university men, I suppose, men better situated in life and able to get a university degree. But the actual surveying of land that they are doing is done as well, if not better, by these other people, and I think that there is a good case for a re-examination of this whole position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the treatment of the civilian officials, and in fact of the whole institution, I think it would need to be overhauled.  We cannot prove all we hear, and we do not want to believe it either until we are certain, but we would like to have a complete investigation of the position there so that we would know if it is a fact that this institution is still working in conjunction with the British Army.  I believe it is, but if that is not so I would like to hear it. I have a list of positions held by the Royal Engineers, and it shows that the whole staff is simply a Royal Engineers' staff.  I am sure that some of the civilians are just as good. Royal Engineers are in the Drawing <Col N="528" /> Department, the Printing Department, the Computing Department, the Publications Department, the Vandyke Department, whatever that may be, and it appears to me that there are practically no civilians at all.  If this is going to be a branch of the Army I suggest that it should be a branch of your own Army.  Whatever I have to say against that Army as such&mdash;and I am glad to see the Minister for Defence is taking notes&mdash;you should make this a branch of your own Army and not have people whose loyalty to Ireland can certainly be questioned, but whose loyalty to the British Empire cannot.</P>

      <P>It is always refreshing to hear a Deputy speak his mind, regardless of the consequences to his Party, and it is doubly refreshing when it comes from that side of the House, because I am afraid that Deputy Boland's reference to the British Army and to the Royal Engineers will lose him some true and tried supporters.  I remember during the last elections a meeting at Castleknock in Co.

      <P>That is only a small point.  I would not intervene only for the fact that Deputy Boland, I think unjustly, because he is a kind-hearted man, enunciated a doctrine that would be very dangerous and harmful to a large number of men.  He suggested&mdash; at least it might be so read&mdash;that the fact that a man was in receipt of a disability pension from the British Government meant that he ought not to be employed.  I do not know if Deputy Boland knows that there are degrees of disability pensions.  A man with 100 per cent. disability pension would not be fit for employment, while a man with twenty per cent. disability might be fit for almost any kind of employment except severe manual labour.  I should be sorry if it went out without contradiction from me that the fact that a man is in receipt of a disability pension, even a small one like 12/6 a week, would indicate to anyone that that man is unfit for any form of employment. As a matter of fact I have no doubt whatever that in the Ordnance Survey there is a fair amount of sedentary work, planning and apploting maps, corrections and so on, that a man with even fifty per cent. disability pension&mdash;a man who has possibly lost one foot or one leg&mdash;could do perfectly efficiently.  I do not know the <Col N="530" /> details of the case that Deputy Boland has quoted.  I do not want to lay down the law on that, but I want to appeal to Deputies in all parties, including the Labour Party, not to let the doctrine go out that any man who is getting a disability pension should not be employed, because disability pensions in a great many cases are so small that that would condemn a man and his wife to starvation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I meant to convey, that a man who gets a disability pension should have no other employment, but I say that the civilian employees who were dismissed in 1916 should be put on the same footing as those serving in the British Army.  I am not saying that they were not doing that according to their lights, but, as I am told, they were put on the pension list while serving with the British Army.  I wonder does Deputy Cooper stand for putting them on?  He probably did at the time.  I do not know if he does now or not.</P>

      <P>I have had a good deal of correspondence with people in the Ordnance Survey who are not satisfied. I do not know the details and could not pronounce an opinion in this case, but I am glad that Deputy Boland gave me an opportunity of saying that this is a special case, with regard to the Ordnance Survey, and that he does not mean it to be conveyed that every man with a disability pension is unfit for employment.</P>

      <P>I would like to repeat Deputy Boland's question and to ask how many of these individuals are on field duty as distinct from office work. I would also like to know if it is a fact that men who refused to serve with the British Army have been victimised. I want a definite reply from the Minister.  Were more favourable conditions given those who went out and served with the British Army than to those whose national principles would not allow them to do so?  Are the civilian clerks victimised at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some questions which I would answer better if I had notice of them.  For instance, the details of the main point that Deputy Boland raised with reference to the civil assistants&mdash;although I did deal with that two or three years ago&mdash;I have forgotten.  I remember distinctly that the case was put up to me and that I went into it.  I do not now remember the details clearly.  The position about this office is that these men were handed over to us with the exception of thirty or so who were reinstated by the Provisional Government. They have Treaty rights and are entitled to special pensions if dispensed with.  It means that we cannot alter the organisation of the office without incurring a substantial pensions liability.  I could not say at the moment how many men are outside and how many men are inside.  I know that there is a surplus staff of over thirty, most of whom, if not all, are actually working for the Land Commission, because no work could be provided for them in connection with the Ordnance Survey.  That surplus arises because of the reinstatements made by the Provisional Government. In one sense, if we gave those men as being outside people it would not exactly show the proportion outdoor or indoor in connection with the Ordnance Survey.  However, if the Deputy will put down a question he can have full information.  The Ordnance Survey was a military office under military control before the change of Government.  It is now a civil office, though it is intended to have a certain liaison between it and the Army in future.  It is now actually a civil office and the head of the office is now the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know nothing about the individual cases that Deputy Boland mentioned.  I could either take him as asking a question now and write to him about it or he could put down a question and I will give him any information available. But I am satisfied that there are no people in the office being paid who are not fit to do the work.  They may have disability pensions but they certainly are fit to do the work or they <Col N="532" /> would not be retained.  We cannot take notice of all the other sources of income they may have or what their pensions cost.  If they retired on pension and did not work the cost of their pensions would be inflated because of their rights under the Treaty.  The office is of a peculiar character as compared with others.  There has been a great deal of trouble with the staff, a great deal of friction between the civil employees who were discharged and afterwards reinstated and the other employees in the office.  I am satisfied that the faults were not altogether on the side of the men who went out to the war.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that there was a certain amount of discussion in this House because handbills which appealed for votes for General Hickey during the last Seanad election were supposed to be printed on the Ordnance Survey machines and with paper belonging to the Ordnance Survey. Such bills were printed, but the investigation convinced me that they were printed by the reinstated men for the purpose of making trouble for the others.  We were not able to convict anybody, but I was convinced that was the purpose.  While I cannot say that those men who were in the Army are innocent of a certain amount of blame the reinstated men are not persecuted saints altogether.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland mentioned a rumour that a good deal of stuff was taken away by the British and destroyed when the taking over took place.  I think that is entirely groundless.  The Deputy also suggests that there should be an independent scrutiny of the condition of the office.  We set up a Committee which inquired into certain matters.  I am not sure if I remember all the people who were on the Committee, but it was set up because of certain allegations made in this House.  I think the chairman of the Committee was Mr. Sears. Mr. Seán McGarry was the person who raised the matter in this House, but he afterwards refused to act on the Committee set up. There were also on the Committee the Secretary of the Executive Council, Mr. Diarmuid O'Hegarty, Professor Purcell of the National University, and I think Mr. Quane of the Department of <Col N="533" /> Education.  There was some other Engineering man, perhaps Mr. Nicholas O'Dwyer of the Department of Local Government, but I am not sure of that. They went into the matter at great length and found a great many of the allegations&mdash;in fact, all of them&mdash;to be unfounded.</P>
    <P>There was one matter that had to do with the scientific basis of the Survey, which they did not think it worth their while to go into, but so far as the general working of the office was concerned, they were satisfied, and we are satisfied that the whole series of allegations made by an officer of that Department, who had gone into the National Army, against the head of the office were untrue.  The report was somewhat lengthy.  As far as I remember it was not printed, but a copy of it was placed in the Library, and I am sure it is still there.  In any case I suggest to Deputy Boland that he should read that report because it deals with a great many matters which are the subject of rumour outside.  I think he will find some doubts he may have cleared up in regard to them.</P>
    <P>I only remember I looked into the question of the civil assistants at the time, and I was satisfied that in reinstating them in all the circumstances the State was acting reasonably well by them.  Not having notice of the question, and it being three years old, I am sorry I am not able to reply more fully to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister go into this matter again, because no one can deny that the people who worked in a civil capacity up to the time of the Great War should have as good terms as those who joined the British Army.  I am not blaming those who joined the British Army, but I do not think it is fair to treat those people who, for national reasons, took a different view of the war badly.  I have made a statement which the Minister can investigate on the authority of that letter.  Some of them were put on the pension list, while actually in the Army, and were also rushed into this office when the British were handing over, and made eligible for pensions under Article 10.</P>

      <P>A question arose a few days ago which ought to have been raised on this Vote by Deputy Clery in connection with a prosecution of a Mr. Hanley of Ballina.  I made inquiries and found that the State counsel was satisfied that there was not sufficient evidence to go on with that case.  He consulted the Attorney-General, and they were satisfied that there was not sufficient evidence to go on with it.  No influence of any sort was used either with them or with any one else in connection with the case.</P>

      <P>This is only typical of a number of cases throughout the country.  It is easy for the President to say that no influence was used in that case with people of that kind.  I think the Attorney-General was wise not to let that case go on.  The President is aware that there have been many people who hold views similar to those held by Deputies on these Benches and who were brought before juries and the juries disagreed, but then these people were kept in prison and harassed in every way, and were then afterwards found not to be guilty.  It is a wonder that the State could not consider these cases beforehand as they did with the District Justice in the case I refer to.  He was quite satisfied that there was not a prima facie case to go before a jury.  The President knows that these cases are taken before a District <Col N="536" /> Justice, and in that particular case to which he refers there were witnesses from the Finance Department. If their evidence is correct, and if the Attorney-General was right in advising a nolle prosequi to be entered, perhaps we would be entitled to know what action the President has taken in regard to these officials.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Vote it seems that an increase of £2,000 upon last year's amount is unreasonable. There is a sum of £12,000 set aside for prosecutions.  That seems to be made up of payments of expenses for prosecutions in the country. It seems to be an unreasonable amount especially when there is another item after that of £10,000 for fees paid to counsel.  I take it that a big portion of that money goes to the two Prosecutors who are practically continuously in the Central Criminal Courts.  Then there is an independent salary paid to the Attorney-General and the practice does not seem to be followed here which is adopted in other places by which the Attorney-General goes into court and conducts important prosecutions.  Perhaps the Minister when replying would give some indication as to the work of the Attorney-General's Department and tell us why the Attorney-General himself does not conduct some of the cases in court and thus save money spent on prosecutions.  There is a sum of £30,928 for State Solicitors.  That would mean about an average of £600 to each State Solicitor.  These solicitors are only part-time officers.  They are in somewhat the same position as a sheriff who is appointed at a lower salary.  I understand that these State Solicitors in Land Commission cases, when they are successful, receive their costs from the litigants and make no return to the Department.  If that is so, anyone who stays an hour or so in a Circuit or District Court in the country and listens to the undefended Civil Bills at the suit of the Land Commission will realise the enormous amount of fees which go into the hands of the State Solicitors.  In 99 per cent. of the cases the Land Commission are successful, and I would like to know if the fees recovered in such cases go into the hands of the Land Commission or into those of the local State Solicitor.  If they go to the solicitor it means that in many cases he draws an abnormal salary, a salary much larger than most senior counsel in the courts can hope to draw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an item set apart for the defence of public officials in actions <Col N="538" /> taken against District Justices, members of the Gárda Síochána, and other public officials for acts done by them in consequence of their duty.  Perhaps the Minister would give some details as to how that is made up.  If the District Justice gives a decision which is wrong, I understand that when there is a case stated or when there are certiorari proceedings, if the Supreme Court hold against him on the points submitted he is liable for the costs.  I do not know if that is one of the matters provided in this sum of £400.  I also want to know if, in cases where the Gárda Síochána are mentioned, the costs of defending proceedings such as those in the Waterford cases are borne by the State.  In the Waterford cases, as the House will remember, acts of blackguardism were committed by the Civic Guards which you could not expect the State to stand over.  I want to know whether in the case of Civic Guards found guilty of such acts of blackguardism the State steps in and pays the expenses in such proceedings. Perhaps the Minister would also explain the reason for the increase under this head and whether he contemplates any alteration in regard to the present system.</P>

      <P>The President said that I charged him with interfering in the case.  I did not say that, and I think if the President was wise he would have remained silent.  I am, however, convinced now, from what the President said, that interference has taken place, and when he did not make inquiries as to whether this man's claim was paid I think the thing becomes much more fishy.  Did he inquire what the evidence was?  If he did not inquire whether Mr. Hanley had not been paid his claim I wonder how he would try to prove to us that there was not sufficient evidence to prove the charge.</P>

After the statement he made here the last day, the people of Ballina were inclined to believe his version, but when they see this statement to-day they will be inclined to change their view.  If he is anxious to show that he is not interfering he will go about it in a different <Col N="540" /> way altogether.  That is, if he wants to convince the people of North Mayo and Ballina.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask, before the Minister concludes, whether or not the Attorney-General is bound to prosecute in the case of a Minister as in the case of an ordinary civilian for, say, contempt of court. We had a case where one of our Deputies was prosecuted.  There was also the question of the Minister for Agriculture, who was guilty of gross contempt of court during the elections, and the Attorney-General did not move at all in the matter.  I should like to know does his jurisdiction include members of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General could prosecute a Minister, but I think it would not be good form for him to do so.  Deputy Ruttledge asked why the Attorney-General did not plead in court, and said that the Attorneys-General who were here before the change of Government did.  Of course, the Attorney-General, before the change of Government, had not anything like the volume of work to attend to that the present Attorney-General has, because the Attorney-General gives general advice to the Government in connection with the preparation of legislation.  That, in itself, has been a very heavy task.  In connection with the constitutional position, and external relations especially, because our External Affairs Department has been very small and has only been learning its work, an enormous amount of labour has fallen on the Attorney-General. Of course, there was formerly a Solicitor-General as well as an Attorney-General and there was a division of labour, such as is not possible under a system by which we have really only one law officer.  The result is that while the present Attorney-General and other Attorneys-General have themselves been anxious to plead in court, they have not found it practicable.</P>
      <P>A Deputy asked the President a question with regard to Mr. Hanley. I looked that matter up since, and Mr. Hanley has not been paid.  My Department were not satisfied that the money was owing.  They conducted certain inquiries which led to a prosecution being instituted.  I also made inquiries generally on the matter since the whole question was raised.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to proceed?  I had an interview with the counsel who prosecuted for the State.  I asked him about it.  He said, without being spoken to by any person whatsoever, he had come to the conclusion, on examining the evidence, that there was no chance of a conviction and that, accordingly, he had represented to the Attorney-General that it was a proper case for entering a nolle prosequi.  It is not customary and it is not right for the Attorney-General to proceed with a case unless he believes that there is a prospect of a conviction being obtained. In certain cases he has been mistaken, naturally, but in no case is the mere satisfaction in his own mind that there was guilt sufficient to justify him in proceeding with the case.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ruttledge asked whether it included paying costs of District Justices in case of applications for certiorari.  I am not sure of that, but I would say in certain cases it might.</P>
      <P>With regard to the police, the bulk of the sum is expended in defence of Civic Guards.  The expenses of defence are only paid out of State funds when there is an acquittal, and when, in addition, the case seems to be one that merits State assistance, but in no case where a Civic Guard is convicted is money paid out of State funds.</P>

      <P>I note that the total expenditure for this office on Vote 13 on the other Votes amounts to something like £5,000, and I would suggest to the Minister that he should give to the House some information as to the work discharged by this Department for that expenditure.  I remember writing some time ago to the Superintendent of the Quit Rent Office to get certain information which I thought he might have furnished me with by way of letter.  I regret to say that my inquiry did not meet with any adequate response.  In view of the fact that I cannot get the information from the office, I, and those associated with me <Col N="547" /> on these benches, would like to get in the House some information from the Minister as to the work which is done by this Department.  I understand that it originally existed to administer certain rents derived from properties and paid to what was called the Crown in Ireland.  I would like to know whether these rents still continue to be paid to the Crown, or whether they come into the Exchequer of the Irish Free State Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Quit Rent Office collects quit rents which do come into the Exchequer of the Saorstát. There was a considerable period of discussion, I think, up to last year or the year before, with the British Government as to whether quit rents were due to them or due to us.  Finally, it was decided that they were due to the Saorstát and they come into the Saorstát Exchequer.  The Quit Rent Office discharges certain other duties in connection with the management of foreshore, the Curragh at Kildare, and a few other items of State property.  It is practically a dying service because, of course, quit rents are being gradually extinguished with the progress of land purchase.</P>

I understood the Minister to say that the British Government had contended that these quit rents were properly payable to them and that, on the other hand, his Department had been successful in their contention that the quit rents should be reserved to the Free State Government. I think it would be very interesting, and would be the means of giving the House a certain amount of useful information, if the Minister would state the respective grounds for this contention: upon what grounds the British Government claimed to possess themselves of these quit rents, and on what grounds his Department claimed to retain them.  Would the Minister state the reasons why his claim was conceded, as this is a very important question?</P>

      <P>A few days ago I was told that I could bring forward under this Vote some definite cases to which I then referred, the cases of the families of volunteers in the national service. There are thirteen such families in portion of my constituency.  The treatment that has been meted out to the families of these volunteers is not in keeping with what one would expect from even the present Government.  These are the families of men who lost their lives on active service for the country.  In many cases the position is that a father or a mother was totally dependent on their boy who was killed.  The amount of <Col N="551" /> compensation paid was £100 and £150. When discussing some of these cases the other day the Minister stated that he did not want to give anything for what he called emotional loss.  We are not asking for emotional loss, but I consider that while the families of spies in the district are getting compensation to the extent of £1,200 and £1,500, and while on the other hand the families of Republican soldiers who lost their lives on active service are now in a state of penury and starvation, and are dependent on home assistance, such a position as that is a disgrace to any Government. I think it is very unfair and very unjust the way in which these families have been treated.  I want to know definitely from the Minister if he is prepared to re-open those cases.  I am in a position to put definite cases to the Minister where the families of volunteers who lost their lives in fighting in the cause of the Republic are now drawing home assistance, and I want to know from him if he considers that that is just or right?  I consider that it is a blot, a dishonour, and a disgrace to the Executive Council and the Government that such a thing should exist, and I ask the Minister definitely to re-open these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister will say, when I have concluded, that he has no knowledge of the definite cases that I am going to raise.  I want to assure him that I am not raising these cases on this Vote without having previously interrogated the Department concerned, both by interview and letter, endeavouring to get some redress for the grievances which I am now going to enumerate.  In one case a soldier, while actually on the parade ground, was struck by the muzzle of a rifle on the eye and rendered unconscious for some time.  He got sleepy sickness and was discharged. But we are told by the Ministry concerned that that ex-soldier is not entitled to any pension.  The man has almost lost his reason, and he is incapable of presenting a case for himself. I have gone to considerable trouble to get a case stated for him.  I have tried to get one soldier who is prepared to make a statement, but the <Col N="552" /> other soldier concerned is not prepared to make a statement because it was he who struck the ex-soldier and is afraid of military discipline.  The order was given to shoulder arms, a rather awkward movement, and it was while doing it the soldier inflicted the injury in the case I have mentioned.  This man is afraid to make a statement for fear he would be subject to disciplinary action.  I have no opportunity of focussing attention on this case except by bringing it before the Minister.  I have repeatedly tried to bring it to the notice of the Department concerned, but have failed.</P>
      <P>There is another case where two men were discharged as insane.  One has been a few years in a mental hospital and is in a pitiable position.  I saw him in the hospital.  He is now ready to be discharged, but can get nothing in the shape of gratuity or pension to put him on his feet again in the civil world.  He was sent home with an escort of a corporal and two soldiers. We are now told that this man was not insane in the Army.  If not, why was he sent home in this manner?  There is another case of a soldier who, after an ambush, suffered from the delusion that he was being pursued, and he went insane.  In this case we are again told the same story, that he did not go insane while in the Army.  He was handed over to the mental hospital. These are three of the most glaring cases that have come under my notice, and I think it is not fair that they should not get more consideration than the Department of Defence has given them.  I want to assure the Minister that I did not take advantage of this opportunity to bring these cases without having tried on several occasions to get some redress for these men, but I have failed miserably.</P>

      <P>There are two pre-Truce cases I brought before the notice of the Department of Defence.  One was that of Stephen MacDermott, killed at Lough Lynn, in County Roscommon. No gratuity or grant was given to his parents because it was said they were not dependent on him.  They were dependent on him at that time, and if he was alive they would be still more dependent on him now.  There <Col N="553" /> is the case of Peter Coyne, who was on active service during the Black and Tan time. It can be proved he lost his health on active service.  The difficulty in his case, according to the reply of the Department, was that he had not made application in time.  This man was not in touch with people who could post him as to what he ought to do, and I think the objection made in his case should not rule him out.  He is a physical wreck now, but simply because he did not know how to go about it he received no compensation.  These two cases should be reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Corry's cases, I think that if he took one or two sample cases and would write explaining them we could examine them more closely.  The principle at that time was really to pay for money losses and not for any other losses.  Of course, mistakes may have taken place.  With regard to the British supporters, it may be that ridiculously large sums were paid to them, but these were sums paid by the British Government, and we have nothing to do with them.  They did not come out of our fund.  With regard to some of Deputy Hogan's cases, up to the 1927 Act, where people were discharged insane, nothing could be done for them, but they come within the scope of the 1927 Act. Provided the Medical Board or the Pensions Board would certify that the illness or incapacity was due to military service they would get compensation.  I do not know whether application has been made and the cases have actually been before the Board under the 1927 Act.</P>

      <P>Before Mr. Murphy concludes, there is a point of personal explanation that I want to make.  It was suggested here by more than one Deputy, in the course of the previous discussion on this motion, that I had put down my amendment on the paper at the instance of the Government.  I think it is only fair, both to the Government and to myself, to say that that is not so.  I put it down on my own initiative entirely, and simply for the purpose of getting something that I thought the House would agree on, and something that would give a larger basis for the inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. TADHG MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy O'Hanlon who said, in his practical and sympathetic statement, that the merits of this debate were entirely in favour of this motion.  That being so&mdash;and I agree with that statement&mdash;it will lighten the task that falls to me in closing this debate.  If there is one fact that emerges from the whole debate that was regrettable and surprising it was the fact that in the speeches against this motion by the members of the Executive Council there was no indication whatever of what their policy was or is on this important question.  As a matter of fact, the three Ministers who contributed to this debate spoke with different voices on the whole question, and nowhere could we see any indication of a considered policy, or even agreement, on this question. The speech of the Minister for Finance was one of neutrality, benevolent neutrality one might call it.  He was in favour of this question being examined, but he was reluctant to commit the House to the principle of the motion.  I am at one with the Minister for Finance in urging that this question should be examined.  And, as has been pointed out here during the course of the debate, any subsequent action in connection with this whole question will to a great extent depend on the examination that the question gets and that this motion asks for.  The Minister for Agriculture, in a very unworthy speech, asked us to come down from the clouds and to consider practical things. This motion deals with a very practical issue.  It deals with a very material and important issue, and has all the <Col N="567" /> fundamentals of a question that is both practical and urgent for a large section of the people of this country to-day. He devoted a great portion of his speech to the question of the burden that a scheme of this kind would impose on the small farmers of the country. The aim of the motion, or at least one of the results of the adoption of a scheme of this kind, would be to lighten considerably the burden imposed on the small farmers of the country in the matter of local taxation, and to spread the burdens evenly over the country as a whole.  It will be some comfort for him to know that at the present moment a scheme of this kind is being put through in Switzerland, that it is made obligatory on the people to participate in the scheme, and that it is being framed with the view of benefiting the small holders there as well as other sections of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was about as deplorable a speech as one could expect to read or as one could expect to hear on a question of this kind.  If there was one member of the Executive Council, by reason of his office, and by reason of the duties pertaining to this office, who ought to have gone into this matter sympathetically and with a great deal more knowledge than the speech he delivered on this debate shows, it was the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. I propose to go back later on in the course of my reply and to deal with the many points made by him in the course of his speech.  The Minister for Finance, in dealing with this motion, mentioned a sum of £750,000 as approximating to the cost of the scheme.  We have given some examination to this question, and it has been pointed out, I think, by Deputy Hogan (Clare), and it is our opinion that a scheme of this kind based on an insurance system would not cost anything like that figure.  We have some evidence to support us in that contention, and we got that from another portion of the country, where a scheme of that kind is in force at the present time.  The cost of a scheme of this kind in the Six Counties is estimated at £145,000.  The population of Northern Ireland is <Col N="568" /> round about 1,250,000.  The population of the Saorstát is about 3,000,000. If the widows and orphans in the Saorstát are in the same proportion as persons in a similar class in Northern Ireland, the cost of a scheme of pensions for widows and orphans, and including old age pensions at 65 years of age, would be something like £348,000, a figure very much less than the figure indicated by the Minister, to say nothing at all of the very alarming figures given us by the Minister for Local Government in his speech on this question.  To return for a moment to the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, I want to say that one can get helpful information from what happened in the North of Ireland in that connection, when the Minister speaks of the burden that a scheme of this kind would place on the backs of the people.  The Minister for Labour in Northern Ireland, who is himself associated with big industrial concerns there, said during the course of the debate on the Bill to provide pensions for widows and orphans in Northern Ireland:&mdash;&ldquo;If it did anything of this kind,&rdquo; that is, did anything to impose unbearable burdens on industry, &ldquo;if it did anything of the kind it would be a matter which would require very serious attention, but I think I can show, and show quite clearly, that it will not place upon industry an unbearable burden.&rdquo; We have some figures in that connection. A firm in the linen industry in Northern Ireland employing 600 persons have had a sum of £145 per annum as a result of a scheme of this kind added to a wages bill of between £50,000 and £60,000.  A firm employing 10,000 men would have an additional charge of £4,000 per annum on a wages bill of £1,500,000.  As to the small-holders that the Minister for Agriculture spoke about, the additional charge on farmers employing three men would amount to one shilling per week.</P>
    <P>It would be well, if it were possible, to have this matter considered altogether apart from the question of home assistance&mdash;to have it considered on its merits and from the point of view of what the duty of the State is to the people referred to in this motion.  In our opinion the duty of <Col N="569" /> the State ought to be as clear on this question as it is in connection with any of the principal services in the country.  Our view is that, as the resources of the State are devoted to maintaining an Army, a police force and other necessary services, such as must be maintained in any civilised country, the women and children referred to in this motion should be treated as a first charge on the resources of the State.  I agree that it is difficult to consider the matter apart from the reactions of the present poor law system.  I listened with very much regret to the statement of the Minister for Local Government that he could see nothing degrading in the system of home assistance.  Fortunately for himself he has very little experience of it.  Those of us who have had experience of it have had the humiliation of the whole position brought home to us very forcibly and clearly, and we have no doubt about the absolute and utter degradation that the system imposes on the people who are unfortunate enough to become victims of it.</P>
    <P>Apart from people of that kind, there are a large number of people who have sufficient pride to avoid the home assistance system.  We have people who have been able to struggle along and to keep up appearances under very difficult circumstances. It is for people of that kind, as well as others, that the passage of this motion would make a great change.  We have women who have lost their breadwinners, and who have refused to look for charity, going out day after day to work in their endeavour to keep their homes together and to feed and clothe their families.  We have a Compulsory School Attendance Act in force, and although it is desirable that children should be sent to school, if the mother is not able to look after the children at home and give them the attention and care, and exercise the control over them that is necessary, then Compulsory School Attendance Acts and other Acts of a similar kind will fall very far short of what could be achieved by them.</P>
    <P>It is because we are absolutely convinced that the duty of the State in <Col N="570" /> this matter is quite clear, that we have put down this motion, and it is because we are perfectly certain that such a scheme is going to make a tremendous change in the conditions of a very large number of people, who deserve well of the State, that we ask the House to pass this motion.  It is clear that we are not at present discharging our duty to people of this kind.  The Poor Law Commission afforded absolute corroboration of that.  In their report there is general agreement with the view that home assistance, as at present administered, is entirely inadequate.  Even since we discussed this question last we have had very striking corroboration of that fact in the County Kerry. I have here a statement made by the Superintendent Home Assistance Officer in Co. Kerry to the Board of Health recently, which makes very sorry reading.  He refers, in the most striking portion of his statement, to the conditions under which a large number of people in receipt of home assistance in Kerry are living at present. Their existence, he says, is nothing more practically than starvation. The children are denied necessary nourishment; consequently in almost every family there are either imbeciles, cripples or consumptives, certainly caused in most cases by malnutrition. In a large number of houses there are no beds.  He goes on to advocate that, whatever economies should be effected by the Kerry Board of Health, there should be no economies in the matter of home assistance.  He considers that the allowances that have been given to people of this kind are entirely inadequate and, to some extent, responsible for conditions such as he describes in very striking language. The Minister for Local Government tells us that we have nothing to hope for except the continuation of such a state of affairs as this until 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>He has no other alternative but to suggest the addition of 8d. or 9d. in the pound to the local rates until 1931, and urges us to fight our <Col N="571" /> corner better on public boards.  He suggests that some local representatives in control of public boards are not generous enough in the matter of home assistance, and are not sympathetic enough to the poor.  Yesterday I read a report of a Local Government auditor to the West Cork Board of Assistance pointing out that in at least one district in West Cork the scale of home assistance was far too liberal.  It is very hard to reconcile a statement of that kind with the statement made by the Minister, that he is in favour of more generous administration of home assistance.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that local representatives are not entirely at fault in this matter.  I have had occasion before in this House to refer to a notorious statement made by a Commissioner of the Local Government Department in connection with the poor made at a sitting of the Poor Law Commission held in Cork City.  I do not want to go into that again, but if that represents the official view, it gives very little hope for the more generous administration of home assistance that the Minister is advocating.  Home assistance is given to a great extent with a view to supplementing some income that the people who receive it are alleged to have, but the fact is that in a great many cases no such income exists, and, to all intents and purposes the few shillings given by the home assistance officer must provide all they can provide for the home until the next payment is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister ever hear the suggestion made by boards of health in the country that the names of people in receipt of home assistance should be hung up on the dead walls of the towns and villages.  I wonder did he ever hear that home assistance is often paid out in the middle of the street?  People are asked to give away whatever little pride or dignity they might have when they are called up to receive the three or four shillings that they get in home assistance.  The Minister may not have heard of it, but it is a fact, and it is further proof of the degradation of the home assistance system.  We are not asking that the home assistance system should be <Col N="572" /> scrapped, but we are asking that the humiliation it imposes on people should be minimised by taking as many people as can be taken off, and by giving them, at the expense of the State, treatment which, in our opinion, they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Minister disagreed with the way in which Deputy Corish interpreted the article of the Dáil democratic programme that would have a practical bearing upon this question.  I find that the next article of that programme, which by the way I understand the Minister himself moved at a meeting of the Dáil on that occasion, is one that will have some bearing on this question also.  It says: &ldquo;That the Irish Republic fully realises the necessity for abolishing the present odious and degrading foreign poor law system and substituting therefor a sympathetic native scheme.&rdquo;  Now what have we done in that respect.  We have abolished the old workhouses and called them county homes.  We have abolished the relieving officers and called them home assistance officers, and we have changed the expression outdoor relief to that of home assistance.  But the same odious system remains more or less in many portions of the country, and has been worsened considerably by the changes brought about.  We can do something towards giving effect to that article by the adoption of this motion, and I can see no reason in the world why even the Minister for Finance in his caution should be slow to have the principle of this motion accepted by the House.  The principle of this motion was accepted by forty-five candidates for Parliamentary honours in 1919.  In 1919, I understand, the present Minister for Local Government promised to support a scheme of this kind.  It is yet time enough for him to repent of the speech he made in the course of this debate, and I trust that other members of this House, who associated themselves for some years with the idea underlying this motion, will also assist in getting recognition for the principle of the motion in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Alfred Byrne has been for some years an active member of the Mothers' Pension Society in Dublin, and, I understand, support for the <Col N="573" /> principle of this motion of pensions for widows and orphans has been promised by Deputy Thrift also.  I have no doubt whatever that members of this House who were signatories to the report of the Poor Law Commission will give effect to the recommendations made in that report by their votes upon this motion.</P>
    <P>I come now to another portion of the speech of the Minister for Local Government. He gave us the figures affecting cases of this kind in West Cork. He told us that at the present time, in West Cork, the people who would be considered under a scheme of this kind were in receipt of 47 per cent. of what they would get under a pension scheme. I have here figures supplied in connection with the matter that do not at all tally with the statement of the Minister for Local Government.  I find that in West Cork, at the present time, we have 69 cases to which a scheme of this kind would apply.  The number of persons involved was 276; the amount per week distributed is £31 11s.; the amount per case per week, 9s. 2d.; the amount per head per week, 2s. 3½d.; the amount per case per day, 1s. 3¾d., I think this is the most significant porof the return&mdash;the amount per head per day is 4d.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to work it out in accordance with the Minister's figures, but I gave it up because they did not seem to tally.  In any case I shall leave it to the Minister and the House to consider what measure of treatment the figures I have given afford in cases of this kind.  The average family that would benefit by a scheme of this kind in West Cork at the moment enjoy fourpence per head per day, and we can easily understand the luxury in which they revel at the present time on that sum of fourpence.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. MURPHY Mr. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go back to the question that I raised in introducing this motion as to the set-off that could be obtained if we were able to reduce the amount spent on home assistance and other charges of that kind in aid of a scheme of pensions. The figure up to March, 1926, for a year for home assistance under the Boards of Health was £295,259.  The children at nurse and boarded out cost £24,139; maintenance in county homes cost £173,112.  Under the few remaining boards of guardians, children at nurse cost £6,903, outdoor relief £92,599 and maintenance £68,938, the total being £660,950.  It is very easy, after a little consideration, to see how this relates to a scheme of this kind, and one can see that practically 50 per cent. of that amount could be saved by the adoption of a scheme of this nature.  There you have to some extent a set-off against the scheme which I propose.  I am quite satisfied that, with comparatively little trouble, we can evolve a sound scheme of pensions for widows and orphans.  I am perfectly satisfied that we ought to tackle that job immediately.  We have the opportunity and we ought to avail of that opportunity to go into all the branches of our national housekeeping account in order to find how that money can be obtained.  In this country at present we have £2,200,000 spent in betting on race courses, and that is by far the smallest portion of the money spent on betting.  We have money spent lavishly in many other directions, and it ought not to be outside the capacity of the Government to see how the resources of the State can be examined and utilised for a scheme of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> I feel that whatever the fate of this motion to-night, a scheme of this kind is coming very shortly.  We cannot afford, as the Minister for Finance said very properly, to lag behind other countries in the matter of social work and social services.  I feel that as the Minister indicated a desire to have this question examined, the result of that examination will show that this task is not as appalling as the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, would have us believe.  I am perfectly sure that the case for this motion has not been answered and has not been upset in any way and that it stands as the only constructive effort in this debate.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept Deputy Law's amendment.  Deputy Law's amendment reads very well, but means very little.  It asks for an examination of the question by any other means that may be necessary.  It may mean, for instance, some slight extension of home assistance, as the Minister indicated, but that is not going to meet the problem or provide a solution.  Therefore I ask the House to accept this motion and to reject the amendment.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I would like to refer before I finish&mdash;that is, the statement made by Deputy Brady in the course of this debate.  Deputy Brady, apparently, had fears that certain remarks of mine in connection with the number of failures arising out of maintenance in industrial schools cast a reflection on certain schools. Nothing could be further from my mind than to make a reflection on any school catering for children of this kind.  I condemned the system, and I condemn it still, without making any reflection on the manner in which schools of this kind are conducted.  I ask the House to say that the State is bound to accept the principle of this motion, and, being bound to accept the principle of this motion, that the preliminary step should be taken of examining it in all its bearings.</P>

      <P>Mrs. Ruddy is not eligible for an award in respect of <Col N="426" /> her son's death, as the terms of the Act of 1927 require that before an award can be made in such cases death must have taken place within four years from the date of discharge from the National Army.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether an application for an old age pension from Mrs. Mary Egerton (formerly Hollingsworth), who was born at Poulaphouca, Co. Wicklow, on April 6th, 1858, has been received by the Pensions Officer in Sligo, and whether, in view of the fact that Mrs. Egerton has a certificate showing that she was baptised at Aughrim, Co. Wicklow, on April 18th, 1858, he will investigate the cause of delay and take steps to expedite the granting of this pension.</P>

      <P>An appeal was received on the 5th July, 1928, in this case against the decision of the Collooney Pension Sub-Committee, who proposed to allow a pension of 6/- a week.  The claimant's age was not in doubt, as it was proved that she was born on 6th April, 1858.  It was, however, admitted by her husband that he received 32/- a week wages and a free house as a gardener.  The claimant's means (a moiety of the means of the couple as calculated under the Old Age Pensions Acts) were, therefore, in excess of the statutory limit(£39 5s. 0d. a year), and it was determined on 30th August, 1928, that she was not entitled to any pension.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Land Commission authorities intend to offer for sale to the Department for forestry purposes an area of approximately 1,700 acres of land on the estate in question, but no formal offer has yet been received.  No inspection of the lands is therefore being arranged for, nor can anything be said on the question of the employment of labour unless and until the land has been actually acquired.</P>
