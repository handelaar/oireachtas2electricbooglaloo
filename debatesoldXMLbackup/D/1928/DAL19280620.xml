      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether a decision was promulgated in May, 1926, debarring clerical officers from promotion to the Executive Grade in the Civil Service, and writing assistants and shorthand typists from promotion to the Clerical Grade for a period of two years; and, if so, whether the decision has now become inoperative.</P>

      <P>In 1926 promotions to the Clerical and Junior Executive Grades were suspended.  It was the intention to reconsider the matter at the end of two years.  It is now due for reconsideration, but in this connection I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave to him on this subject on the 25th April last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN (for Mr. Clery)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he can state why subscribers to Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1920, have repeatedly applied for repayment, giving their registered numbers and other particulars, with no result, except acknowledgment of their application; that lists of subscribers whose names have not heretofore been registered have been compiled in the following places:&mdash; Charlestown, Kilmovee, Kilbride, Killasser, <Col N="767" /> Midfield, Cloongullane, Swinford, and other areas throughout East Mayo, with certified statements from the original collectors and other authorised persons attached; and whether the Minister will now state what action he proposes to take in connection with those lists, and with the collection and registration of other subscribers, of whose names there is no mention in the records of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications for repayment in respect of subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible, but in view of the fact that a very large number of subscribers failed to apply for repayment until a comparatively recent date a certain amount of delay in dealing with individual cases is inevitable. I am satisfied, however, that there is no undue delay in dealing with cases in which the applicant furnishes particulars corresponding with the particulars recorded in my Department.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, all lists purporting to contain authentic particulars of subscriptions which were not already recorded in the Department of Finance are being carefully examined in conjunction with the corresponding individual applications for repayment.  If there are no discrepancies to be reconciled the names of the subscribers are entered in the authentic Register and repayment is duly authorised.  I may say, however, that difficulties frequently arise by reason of conflicting particulars being furnished in different lists for the same locality or by reason of the impossibility of reconciling the lists with the individual applications received.</P>
      <P>As regards the final part of the question, if a subscriber of whose subscription there is no record in my Department furnishes the name and address of the collector to whom his subscription was paid, application for information is made to that collector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would heartily welcome on the part of industrialists in the Saorstát a practical desire to study at close quarters the industrial organisation and manufacturing methods of other countries, and would lend all the assistance I can towards arranging a series of foreign visits for this purpose.  Having regard to the direct benefit individual manufacturers must expect to derive, and as a sign of their genuine interest, I would expect the expenses to be borne by those participating in a tour.  But I could give substantial assistance by having the preliminary arrangements undertaken by my Department, by obtaining facilities for whatever inspections it was desired to make abroad, by enlisting the co-operation of railway, shipping and hotel interests with the object of keeping the expenses within reasonable limits, and in other ways.</P>
      <P>Unless the Deputy has some other suggestion to make, I would propose to bring this matter at once before each of the Advisory Committees attached to my Department, and ask them to notify me which of the industries would be prepared to avail of organised visits abroad and the country or countries to which they consider such visits would most advantageously be paid.</P>

I do not agree that the statement was made that the Ceann Comhairle was guided by reason and not by the Standing Orders.  The Ceann Comhairle is guided by reason and the Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the President before putting the motion to sit late to the House he should at least have stated the reasons which compel him to ask the House to sit late.  I do not think, so far as the particular Bill <Col N="787" /> which is to be taken to-day is concerned, that there is any particular urgency.  If one was to take the statement of the President at its face value the measure which the Government is now introducing was determined upon so far back as June or September, 1927, but if they had any clearly-formulated or definite intention in their mind in September, 1927, that intention lay dormant until almost 100,000 electors of this State presented a petition to the House demanding that the rights conceded to them by Article 48 of the Constitution should be made operative. For practically nine months we heard not one single word from the Government as to their intentions in regard to this particular Article of the Constitution. I do not believe that we even heard of it nine months ago.  Certainly the general election of September, 1927, was not fought upon the issue that Articles 47 and 48 should be deleted from the Constitution.  It is quite an easy matter to throw our minds back and recollect what were the issues that President Cosgrave put before the people at that time.  I think there was some question of perjury, some question of business incapacity, some question of the pending insolvency of the State if a certain party was returned to power, but certainly in the prime issue put before the people this question of deleting Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution did not arise.</P>
      <P>Now what has made this issue so pressing and urgent a matter that the President comes to this House, already overloaded with proposals for legislation, already over-taxed beyond its powers to consider and deliberate upon legislation which is flung at the House as if it were a factory organised upon mass production lines, as if it were a factory for the ready production of legislative tin lizzies without a single word of explanation or justification for any one of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the proposals put before us were considered by a Joint Committee of the Seanad and the Dáil which was set up to consider amendments to the Constitution.  How many hours' debate was given by the Committee to the discussion of any single <Col N="788" /> one of these amendments which the President now proposes to make?  How many people participated in these discussions? By what majority was any single one of the amendments carried?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I presume the President will explain.  At any rate, I am anxious to know what is the extreme urgency which is going to compel this House, at the behest of the President, to take to-day, and to bolt, as it were, without any consideration whatever or without any due consideration, a Bill which proposes to deprive the citizens of this country of two rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution which was put before them in 1923, and which has been before them in all the general elections since? What is the urgency which compels the President to ask this House to sit late and to sit incessantly without that adjournment which the ordinary physical demands of human nature call for?  Public representatives considering matters of this character and of this nature ought to be afforded every opportunity of discussing them properly, and if possible at leisure, so that their minds may come to the consideration of these problems every day refreshed by proper rest and the necessary cessation which the ordinary demands of physical nature calls for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President proposes to coerce this House by wearing it down and wearing it out, by depriving, if you like, the Opposition, or those who, by virtue of their position as public representatives, have to discuss both sides of this question, of the ordinary rest which is necessary in order to enable them to work efficiently.  The President proposes <Col N="789" /> to deprive us of that, and that is a form of coercion.  I ask: what is the particular urgency which compels him to coerce this House in regard to Constitution Amendment Bill No. 10? As I have said, for nine months the intention of the Government, if they ever had any, in regard to this matter lay dormant.  They had forgotten about it; they put it in cold storage, and it might have remained there for the next four years but for the fact that almost 100,000 people, by virtue of the rights conferred upon them by the Constitution which was established at so much cost to the people, so much cost, if you like, to the national honour of the people, and so much cost to the people of the State in blood and treasure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I drew the Deputy's attention to the fact that he is discussing the Constitution Bill. He must keep to the motion to sit late; we cannot have a debate on the Constitution now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the President to state the reasons for extreme urgency.  For there must be some reasons of extreme urgency apparently that compel him to ask the House to sit late to consider Constitution Amendment Bills 10 and 14 and the motion for the Closure which the Minister for Finance proposes to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am entitled, in asking the President to state those reasons of urgency, to point to the fact that the matter is not urgent and that the matter is not important.  Naturally, as I have said already, certain citizens propose to exercise the right conferred upon them by the Constitution.  It will be very difficult for the President to justify urgency in this matter.  There is no urgency in the matter.  Before a single citizen is deprived of his rights under this Constitution or by this House there <Col N="790" /> should be given to this House and to every Deputy in it the fullest opportunity of discussing and debating any such proposal.  The Constitution is a fundamental contract between the citizens on the one hand and the Executive power on the other hand.  We here, as representing the people, are entitled in the people's interest to discuss that question or any proposal of the sort contained in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill No. 10 without restriction and without coercion of any sort.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, is the motion made by the President in order?  I notice that the Standing Order states that a motion that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays may be made without notice.  There is at present in operation an Amendment by which the Dáil may sit on Wednesdays and Thursdays to 11 p.m.  That motion was passed in this House some time ago. The Standing Order certainly does not provide for the motion that the Dáil shall sit later than 11 p.m.  It provides that a motion that the Dáil sit later than 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday may be moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order provides that the ordinary sitting shall be from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.  The Standing Order further provides that a motion may be made without notice that the Dáil sit later than 9 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and 4 p.m. on Fridays.  An order has been made by the House extending the hours of sitting on Wednesday and Thursday to 11 o'clock.  That must also be taken to affect the Standing Orders.  A motion to sit later than the normal hours of sitting&mdash;11 o'clock &mdash;is in order under the Standing Orders.</P>

It seems to me, at any rate, and to many other persons in the <Col N="791" /> country, that both the big parties here are more anxious to score points off each other than to do the work for which they were sent here by the people in the country.  They are more concerned in expending their ingenuity in framing amendments to score off each other and to put each other in difficult positions, they are more concerned to manoeuvre against each other than to do the work that has to be done in the interests of the nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to refrain from saying things because they are unpleasant to one side or the other.  I am going to express my convictions, and those are my convictions as well as the convictions of a great many other people.  If the Deputy does not believe them he is free to disbelieve them.  I have no doubt that the main responsibility for creating this position rests with the Government Party.  I cannot see what necessity there is, I cannot see what urgency there is at this stage in the session to introduce a whole series of Bills, a whole sheaf of Bills to amend the Constitution. There was no urgency about that.  We have worked under the Constitution for the past five years. Considerable progress has been made in developing the resources of the country.  I have not seen at any stage how or where these things that are sought to be removed from the Constitution have hampered the economic progress of the country in any way. <Col N="792" /> And it is in the economic progress of the country that people are interested and not in forms or formulas of Government or Constitutions.  I should say that I see nothing in any of these Bills which we have before us here, which should call for even one night's late sitting&mdash;nothing in the way of urgency whatever.  We have many matters here before us.  We have practically all the Estimates to dispose of yet.  We have the whole administrative machinery to be disposed of, such questions as education, agriculture, the whole administration of justice&mdash;all these are before us to be discussed.  We have motions on the Paper in the names of private Deputies, motions that have been on the Paper for the last three months.  We have such motions as that of Deputy Murphy calling attention to the necessity for the establishment of widows' and orphans' pensions in the country, and such motions as that in the name of Deputy Davin.  In my opinion it is much more important that we should be discussing these than discussing changes in the Constitution which are neither urgent, nor, in the opinion of a great many people, necessary.  It is because I feel there is no necessity for calling the Dáil together to sit late to pass these Amendment Bills that I will vote against this motion and protest against it in any way I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the President did not think that the ordinary dictates of courtesy would necessitate that he should give the Dáil some reason as to why he is moving this particular motion to-day. It is quite obvious that it is not merely the desire to get the matters on the Order Paper disposed of that is actuating him.  If it were necessary in his opinion that this Dáil should have more time to do its work than it has at present by meeting three days in the week, there is nothing whatever to prevent the Dáil from meeting on Tuesdays and so making up by meeting on Tuesday the time that would be required.  But I think it is not extra time that is required.  It is not to give the Dáil an opportunity to consider these Bills that the President has introduced this motion&mdash;it is not in order <Col N="793" /> that these Bills should be considered in calmness and in a proper manner that this motion is brought in.  He has produced out of his attache case or out of his pocket a shoal of Bills, amendments to the Constitution in a variety of ways, and he has flung them contemptuously at the Dáil.  He just tells the Dáil that they must pass them in a manner under which they could not get the consideration they require. That is his purpose in moving to sit late, not because there is no time without these late sittings, but that these Bills should be considered after the Dáil has been seventeen hours in session and when it will be impossible for any man unless he is a superman to give these Bills the consideration which they require.  I will admit that a number of these Bills are not important. A number of them are unnecessary, a few of them are frivolous and the balance are ridiculous; but at the same time they seek to do something which this Dáil should be slow to do.  They seek to remove from the Constitution the few democratic provisions that the Constitution retains. If the Dáil is going to tear up the Constitution in that manner they should do so in a proper atmosphere. They should come fresh to their work in the consideration of each Bill, and they should have an ample opportunity to think out and consider the different implications of each Bill.  They should have an opportunity of proposing amendments and alterations in the Bill. But this has not been done.  They are to be shoved one after another, relying upon the tame majority the President has behind him here.  By that majority he hopes to steam-roll them through the Dáil and to show his contempt for the Dáil and the Constitution.  We have been glad in the last few days to be able to show that the Constitution is a matter of no importance.  We have been glad to be able to show that the Standing Orders also can be ignored when necessary.  It is perhaps a good thing, from the point of view that I have, that these symbols should be stripped of their gilt and shown to be what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I think there are some Deputies in this House who, if they support this motion, and by doing <Col N="794" /> so give their consent to the consideration of these Bills in a light-hearted manner, will be belying every political principle that a few months ago they were avowing they stood for.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, too much to hope that these Deputies will ignore the Government Whips on this occasion.  It is, perhaps, too much to hope that they will show even a fraction of the independence they pride themselves on.  If they did, and if they were honest in avowing the principles for which they were elected, they would say to the President that these Bills to amend the Constitution, to effect considerable alteration in the structure of the State, should not be considered at four o'clock in the morning, or at five or six o'clock, by a House, one half of whom would be sleeping and the other half of whom would be rolling in from the bar to cast their votes when the division bell would ring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle thinks that the statement should not be made, I am prepared to withdraw it.  I am prepared to admit that the temptation I would have to remain in the bar would be great, and I presume that the temptation would be equally great for other members of the House.  Deputy O'Connell referred to what has been going on in this House for the last few days.  He was right, I think, perfectly right, in placing the responsibility for what has happened on the shoulders of the Government. We are adopting the methods that are open to us by the Standing Orders to prevent something happening which we believe would be detrimental to the best interests of the people.  We are perfectly within our rights in doing <Col N="795" /> that.  We are perfectly within our rights in devising every means we possibly can to delay, to postpone, or to prevent Bills being passed which are taking from the people one of the rights which are guaranteed to them by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Ministers opposite&mdash;some of them&mdash;will remember when they and their agents of the I.R.B. were going around the country telling the people to support the Treaty because the Treaty did not matter; it was the Republican Constitution they were going to get that would matter.  I wonder do those people look back on those days and do they examine the position in which they now find themselves. They are sitting here under this Constitution proposing these Bills and arranging that they be considered in a manner which will prevent their implications from being properly realised. It may be possible to confuse the people about these things for a time, but not for always.  Sooner or later the people will begin to realise what exactly the game is that the Government is up to.  Only one-third of the people have realised that already.  In a very short time the majority of the people will realise it, and on that day this Government will go out, and will stay out once it gets out.  Certainly, they have done more by their own actions than anything we have thought of doing to indicate the falsity of their position and the doctrines to which they profess adherence.  I hope the Dáil will reject this motion, not merely because it imposes an undue strain on the members, but because it is a device to get Bills passed in a manner which will prevent them being properly considered, and in a manner which will prevent an opportunity being given to the people to realise in full what their implications are.</P>

Deputy Lemass himself said&mdash;and he was entitled to make the statement&mdash;that he was going to use the Standing Orders to the utmost possible extent for a particular purpose. I am not supposed to decide whether all these purposes are or are not correct.</P>

      <P>The will of the people is amply implemented by the General Election.  I suggest there is no need for any protracted discussion on the matter that we have before us.  It is a clear and simple matter.  We have a long programme, and we know it has become the habit of Deputies to make very long and, shall I say, very tedious speeches about whatever matter is before us.  When we have sixteen items on the agenda it gives a multiple of sixteen members every opportunity to make speeches.</P>
      <P>But there are only a certain number of days in the week and a certain number of weeks in the year, and as time does not stand still, even for the Fianna Fáil Party, I think the Government is doing what is its absolute minimum duty in proposing that we sit for some time later than 11 o'clock this day, beginning at 3 o'clock, and that all possible means be taken to overcome any attempt in this House, or outside of it, on the part of a minority, to over-ride the wishes of the majority.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that, according to Standing Orders, the Dáil is empowered to sit on four days a week, namely, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  For some considerable time past, on the instructions of the Government, we have only been <Col N="799" /> asked to sit on three days a week.  If the Government desired it, they could have got the House to sit on Tuesdays as well.  The Minister for Defence pointed to the fact that there are some important items on the Order Paper. I agree with him, to a certain extent. I might say that we in the Labour Party would not mind sitting on two or three nights if these sittings were for the purpose of discussing legislation that was going to benefit the common people of the country.  As far as these Constitutional amendments are concerned, I believe there is no necessity for the undue haste manifested by the Government in asking the House to sit all night.  The Minister for Defence referred to the fact that some of these items have been on the Order Paper for a considerable time.  I agree with him, and I instance in support of that the motion calling on the Government to introduce legislation to provide widows' and orphans' pensions.  I consider that it would be much better for the people of this country if the Government would agree to have an all-night sitting for the discussion of such a motion than to have all-night sittings for the discussion of Constitutional amendments.  If the motion before the House for an all-night sitting is carried, might I ask the President if he is prepared to give another all-night sitting for a discussion of the motion which proposes to provide by legislation pensions for widows and orphans?  The passing of such a motion would be of some real benefit to the people of the country.</P>

If the President thinks that it is necessary for the House to sit all night to discuss them, might I point <Col N="800" /> out to him that we in the Labour Party believe that there are many other matters calculated to be of far more benefit to the common people of the country requiring discussion by the House, and by all-night sittings if you like.  One of these matters is the motion dealing with the question of pensions for widows and orphans.  I repeat the question which I have already addressed to the President: If the motion before the House for an all-night sitting is carried, is he prepared to move, later on, that an all-night sitting will be held to discuss the question of providing pensions for widows and orphans?</P>

Apparently the President's attitude in this, as in most other matters in the past, is to shoot first and give his reasons afterwards.  He brings his proposition before the House but gives no reasons.  He puts it to the House in just that kind of manner which has so exasperated the general public outside.  A great many people, who are not supporters of the Fianna <Col N="801" /> Fáil Party, were very glad to see the Fianna Fáil Party come into this House if it was only to stop the over-riding arrogance of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to stop that attempt on their part, their over-riding arrogance supported by the British force and power behind them.</P>

      <P>I think, as Deputy O'Connell has made a statement which is an attack upon the Fianna Fáil Party, that we are entitled to give our reasons for the faith that is in us.  The reasons for the opposition that we are giving to these measures brought in at the present time into the House is because we feel there is a big principle involved.  The principles of nationality and of democracy are both involved, and I do not think that, on reconsideration, Deputy O'Connell would pass such principles as these lightly over as mere matters of formula.  For myself, I do not think there is any chance of this country recovering the kind of prosperity that both Deputy O'Connell and his Party and our Party desire if we do not safeguard the principles upon which the State is built. The former leader of the Labour Party adopted the very same methods when dealing with other attacks upon the liberties of the people in this House. He also adopted a method of Parliamentary opposition to such an extent that all-night sittings became necessary, and for that reason I do not think that Deputy O'Connell should object to another Party adopting the same methods for similar reasons.</P>

      <P>I must point out to the Minister for Defence that there is a very great difference between idle obstruction and a thorough-going opposition.  The attitude of our Party was stated by our leader when he said that he was going to oppose these measures on account of the aggressive attitude taken up by the Government and expressed especially in Amendment No. 10 Bill to the Constitution.  We might examine very closely whether, when Ministers speak of having a majority in this House and a majority in the country, they are speaking the truth.  I do not believe that they have to-day even as large support in the country as they had six months or a year ago.  I think that the attitude of the people to-day is very different from what Deputy O'Connell thinks it is towards us.</P>

      <P>There are a great many people who realise that we have proved to be of value in this House, that we are in a position now to win their confidence sufficiently to be able to carry on the Government of this country.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party came into this House with a strength of only 61 out of a total of 153. By various means they have managed to accumulate a following from certain individual members of the House who came in partly on the support of Republican second preference votes.  These Independents do not represent their mandate when they support a minority Government in this House.  I believe the country is opening its eye.  If President Cosgrave wants to-morrow to see what view the majority of the people hold upon whether the will of the people should prevail in regard to Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution he will get an answer which will put him out of office for ever.</P>

      <P>As an Independent Deputy who has no Party affiliations whatever, and who has not to thank Fianna Fáil for any second preference vote, I have to say it is exceedingly tiresome for one to have to sit here and <Col N="803" /> listen to controversy going on between the two big parties so as to make up his mind whether the Fianna Fáil Party are going to tire him out and put him out of the House so that there would be one less in support of the Government on certain occasions, or to say whether one will stick the thing out and see it through.  I have decided that I will stick it out.  That does not mean that I will vote with the Government all the time.  With Deputy O'Connell, I disapprove not only of the general manner in which the Government brought up these Bills, but also the manner in which the time of the House was wasted by those who deliberately wasted it.  Obstruction may be a good policy to adopt.  There is nothing new in it.  It was not the idea of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was practised when we were obstructing English business for Irish purposes, but now we are obstructing Irish business for no purpose whatever.</P>

      <P>My opinion is the obstruction has been carried too far.  A Deputy gets up and discuss a Bill introduced by his own Party, and occupies one hour and forty minutes in a speech which, when it was delivered, had nothing in it.  That is not only a waste of the time of the Government, but of the Private Members' time.  I suppose that is part of the policy adopted to try and tire out those who have no Party affiliations.  I think this House should transact business for the good of the country.  It may be good Party tactics to obstruct, but it is not bringing the country nearer to prosperity to obstruct Government or Private Members' business.  I wish the President would find some method of dealing with the present situation in countering the obstructionist tactics of the Opposition which would not oblige members to come here early in the morning to attend public business and find they will not get a night's rest to-night or maybe to-morrow night.  I think other methods may be found. Speaking on my own behalf, I think an all-night sitting is not fair to members who have to sit here and listen to a lot of rameis spoken by one side to the <Col N="804" /> other, and who at the same time have a duty to their constituents to remain in the House until the time has arrived when business may be done for the good of the country.</P>

      <P>I protest against the suggestion that this Party has ever tried to hold up any Irish public business but the business on foot now, which is dictated by the British enemy.  That is our view.  It is an attempt to take away from the Irish people whatever right they had under the Constitution. It is British work, and we object to it. I am astonished that Deputy O'Connell blamed us for the opposition. Surely he and his Party do not want to let the abolition of the Referendum slip through without debate?  I think he will find that the people of the country place good value on that part of the Constitution.  I would like to remind the House that whatever arrangements were entered into at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges by all Parties to facilitate public business were carried out on our side. Every member of every Party on the Committee knows we did that.  If we failed to keep the time-table arranged, it was admitted by the representatives of every Party that as there were new members of all Parties in the House it was likely that the time-table could not be carried out for that reason.  I maintain we are not to blame in this matter. I believe the Government has brought in these measures which were shown not to be urgent.  Urgency only arose when the people took or tried to take advantage of the Initiative, and then the Government got spurred into activity.  We know from our experience on that Committee that the Government Party was most anxious to get through with its work, and yet it had no hesitation in throwing seven or eight Bills at the House, and we are expected by the Labour Party to facilitate the Government.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Connell or some other Deputy will explain the position of the Labour Party.  It is not right to put the blame on us in this matter.  It is due to the people opposite.  If we could get behind the scene the hidden hand would be revealed, but it is not so hidden as it used to be.  It has come into the open recently.  We were, and are, willing to facilitate any legislation for the benefit of the Irish people.  As the Leader of this Party said the other day in answer to the charge that he was holding up legislation for dealing with evil literature: Let the Bill be introduced and it will get a speedy passage through the House if it is a good Bill.  There was the Mutual Assurance Act, for which the Minister for Local Government was responsible, and it was given a quick passage.  We did not delay it very long, and any other legislation which will do good work for the Irish people will not be held up by this Party.  But the work of the British Government, through its agents opposite, will be held up as long as we can.  In opposing the legislation to which we object we are only using our rights.  There was a refusal on the part of the Government to defend these Bills.  It was only to be expected that some answer should be made to our speeches by the Government or from some other part of the House.  We were charged with obstruction, whereas we were fighting for the best things in the Constitution.  It is significant that the best things must be wiped out. These things cannot be touched.  There is only one answer to it, and that is, that the minority in this country holds the reins still, and when they crack the whip the Government does what it tells them.  I protest against that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a late sitting is not an ideal solution of the trouble we have got to meet at the moment.  Neither is a speech of one hour and forty minutes on a Bill, which there is entire agreement in the House, is not going to pass, such as we had here on Friday last, and which delayed to some extent consideration of the motion mentioned by Deputy Cassidy.  I put it in all earnestness that if we are going to have a full and frank discussion in respect of any and every one of those measures, we are not going to get it by repeating what has gone on for the past couple of weeks.  I am perfectly satisfied that a late sitting will only give us an opportunity of spending more time on this matter than we would otherwise get. Deputies say we should meet on Tuesdays. I agree, but I cannot bring Deputies here.  Deputies have expressed to me their unwillingness to come here on Tuesdays.  They have said that they have attended regularly for the last six or nine months, and some of them have more business to attend to elsewhere than other Deputies who have, perhaps, more time to devote to public matters.</P>

      <P>It may be their misfortune to have these large businesses to attend to but at least some consideration must be given to them, in the conduct of their business.  I agree with Deputy O'Hanlon that late <Col N="809" /> sittings do not conduce to the best consideration of these matters, but I do put it in all sincerity and earnestness to Deputies: does such a matter as the age at which a person will be eligible for election to the Seanad justify three or four amendments?  Let us be frank with one another on those matters.  We will not get a better discussion of them by going on the lines we have gone on for the last two or three weeks.  We are not likely to get accommodation, and I am not going to ask for what we are not going to get.  I know of no other method of getting through the business in time than by having an all-night sitting.  I am also going to endeavour to persuade Deputies to meet on Tuesday and early on Wednesday morning, so as to give an opportunity to the House to adjourn about the second week in July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>We do think you have introduced some unnecessary heat into this matter.  I certainly did not.  The Minister for Defence, who has vanished, told us that there was here a policy of deliberate obstruction.  He told us that there was not even a pretence that there was not.  Now listen to this: &ldquo;I do not want to take up the time of the House.  I am really very tired, and nothing but a keen sense of duty has caused me to keep addressing the House.&rdquo;  Those are the words I used. Either I was saying that I was not obstructing or I was pretending I was not obstructing.  So whichever statement the Minister for Defence wants to stand over it is wrong.  The status quo at any time has a right to exist unless it is reasonably challenged, and the status quo in this House from the point of view of debate is that we meet at a certain hour, that we keep on for a <Col N="812" /> certain time, that we work under reasonable conditions.  The suggestion is that without any reason whatever stated that that should be reversed, that the status quo has no right to exist, that it disappears automatically, that some other condition is normally to be expected and may be taken without any justification or reason whatsoever. The fact that we as a House are asked to do something which is abnormal, without any reason given, is a perfectly sound reason for refusing to do that which is abnormal.</P>
      <P>No work to do! We were brought up here from the country and kept in a session which cost £100 an hour for the sitting of the House, for the salaries and travelling expenses of members. Members of the Seanad and Dáil were brought here and sat for one day at a cost of between £200 and £300 an hour for mere travelling expenses and salaries of members, and then we were sent home because the Ministry had been too lazy, too inefficient, too utterly incapable of carrying on the ordinary business of the House to provide work for men to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of this Dáil that we did protest, that we did say that it was a scandal that that thing should be done, but now we must work four days a week and all night to make up, not for our idleness, not for our inefficiency, not for our incapacity to carry on parliamentary affairs, but for the fact that we have a Government which is utterly incapable of even making a programme of work for this House.  Some time you shall starve and some time you shall be over-fed with work.  The suggestion is, apparently, that we are to come here and work all night.  If it is suggested that this House is to be made up of people who are here for their living and to make a living, there is some sense in that.  We are told that we are only working six or seven hours a day.  Is it suggested that the ordinary membership of this House is, and should be, composed of men who have no other work and no other interests, nothing else to concern their minds with but the six or seven hours during which they sit in this House?  If that is the suggestion then by all means let these lazy people work <Col N="813" /> all night.  If a House is so constituted and is designed to be made up of men of that particular calibre, and no other, then by all means let them work all night.  What does it matter how and when they work? With men of that kind it does not matter. Their work is no good anyway.</P>
    <P>I suggest deliberately, however, that, if this House is to be of any value and is to do work of any value, it must be made up of men with other affairs and other interests to look after, men who bring to this House the experience they gain in carrying on that work.  They should have consideration, in dealing with the affairs of this House, for men who come in here, after doing their day's work in the ordinary productive affairs of life, merely to discuss amendments. It is impossible to discuss this question entirely in vacuo, merely to say, as the President said, without any justification, without any excuse, &ldquo;Let us sit until eight o'clock in the morning.&rdquo;  How then are we to consider the most important matters that could possibly be offered to the consideration of this House, things fundamental, things which, when they are lazily, idly, foolishly and half-sleepily done cannot be changed without the invocation of machinery infinitely stronger, infinitely more complex, and infinitely more costly and difficult to put into operation than a vote in this House?  What is going to happen to the idle amendments you pass at four o'clock in the morning?  If they are bad, what does it mean to change them?</P>
    <P>If you put the whole Fianna Fáil vote together in the country, add to it the whole Sinn Fein vote, and add to that the whole Cumann na nGeadheal vote and get them all voting on one side, it will not be sufficient to remedy one idle vote at three o'clock in the morning.  And they know that. Deputy de Valera said the other day that the idea was to create a sort of non-return vote which will filter in one direction, which will filter out that which is good for Ireland and leave in all the rest.  That filter is being made and the valve will then be screwed down because, under the Constitution, there evaporates after eight years the power of this House to alter <Col N="814" /> the Constitution.  They know it.  They are working for that.  They want to get the thing through while they have the chance.  They want to destroy the machinery by which an attempt of that kind can be prevented from being accomplished.  As Deputy Lemass said, some of these amendments are, of course, idle, some of them silly, and some of them ridiculous if you take them one by one, but if you take the whole ten together you fit them into the system of seeing that there shall not be control by the people, even by a majority of the people, over the thing that a minority of the people could effect by coalition here in the Dáil.  That is what they want to do and it is our business to see that they do not do it; that it is held up by the legitimate use of the machinery of Standing Orders and the Constitution; that it is held up so long that the knowledge of the folly and criminality that are being attempted here will filter to the people through the barbed-wire fence of a prejudiced and syndicated Press.  We must have time to get out among the people.  We have to go to Galway, Roscommon, Sligo, Cork and other sections of the country and we have to have time to get over and through that barbed-wire fence and we are going to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney, who, I see, has also vanished, said that we do not want another change in the Constitution for a generation.  He does not want any improvement in liberty in this country for another generation.  It would be unwise to do it, but we have to do it before eight o'clock in the morning. I am very sorry that Deputy O'Connell and his comrades should always be snapping at our heels, trying to pick little points of vantage, trying to blame all the time while they reap the advantage of the thing which they blame. Is Deputy O'Connell in favour of fighting this thing right through to the end or is he not.  Is he in favour of saying that every piece of machinery which is in the power of the Dáil and members of the Dáil shall be used to hold this thing up until we have time to get to the people and make them understand this issue?  If he is, what is the use of that carping, silly criticism? Either he means to fight with us or <Col N="815" /> he means to fight against us.  I do not care which but I want to know and the people will know by the time this debate is over.  The Labour Party before fought a very fine rearguard action against a bad Bill with a small number of men and that is a great credit to their endurance and debating strength.  This is the time for them to throw in their forces frankly and not in a spirit of carping criticism or else to get out of the way and leave it to those who are prepared to carry the battle through.</P>

      <P>The issue here is not time, but pressure.  They want to get the House into such a condition that they will pass anything to get home to bed.  That is the game.  An amendment will come up at 4.30 a.m., 5.30 a.m., 6.30 a.m., 7.45 a.m., but, after sitting all night, is any man going to suggest that it is going to receive that consideration which is due to fundamental amendments of the Constitution which you cannot alter except in the manner I told you?  It is going to get the amount of consideration that Bills thrown at this House with contempt deserve to get.  It is going to get the amount of consideration which anything that emanates from a Government, which is capable of throwing Constitutional Bills at the House with contumely and contempt, as these have been, will get.  It is because, whatever I may think of a particular Constitution, whether I like it or dislike it, I do regard a Constitution as a big instrument that I ask this House to say that they will not discuss these matters except under such conditions as those under which men should discuss matters of dignity and importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are to have a series of midnight amendments to the Constitution.  We will be able to mark them off.  You will have a Minister of Fisheries who is King of England.  We will be able to <Col N="816" /> say that that went through at a quarter to two in the morning.  That is the only explanation of why it would go through.  We are going to have Senators who never saw Ireland.  That will go through at three o'clock.  You will have men who are not liable to income tax in this country, because they are not generally resident here, as Senators, members of the Executive Council&mdash;four o'clock in the morning. You are going to have constitutional amendments which say that the King is not portion of the Oireachtas.  That will come in with the milk.  What they are backing is their constitutions against my constitution.  Will I stand it?  How many nights are we going to be able to keep it going?  That is what they are going on.  How much misrepresentation through their organised Press, how much damage can they do by cynical, silly, flapdoodle articles in the Press, how much misrepresentation can they get for their money?  Will it be effective?  That is the question.  Of course there are difficulties with the Independents.  They want to go home to bed.  Some of them have a certain respect for the Constitution. Some of them merely trick with the respect they pretend to have.  Eight o'clock in the morning, to-morrow morning, the next morning and the morning after, and out of tired brains and weary heads and, above all, weary feet, they are going to evoke the new Constitution.  What is the primal purpose of this game?</P>
    <P>The President said that he had introduced ten Bills, of which three, as a matter of fact, do not matter much. Somewhere about autumn or the Greek Kalends will do for them, but three of them are wanted now, and he said that we would not have opposed or interfered with the passage of the ten Bills if it was not for one of them.  Now, this is perfectly true, that we would consider the Bills in relation to the Seanad in an entirely different spirit if they were not part of the conspiracy against the operative power of the will of the people of this country as expressed in the abolition of Article 47 and Article 48.  If the President wants accommodation he can have it.  Get rid of the Articles 47 and 48 Amendment <Col N="817" /> Bill; throw that out.  Let the Constitution operate, leave the people in control and we will discuss in a very different spirit a new Seanad which is not fitted into a system in which control of the people has been abolished.  You have technically&mdash;I do not want to go into it at any length&mdash; in the nominal Constitution and it is a written word at the present moment, a condition of affairs in which this House is elected once in five years, and throughout the whole period of its existence it is under the control of the electorate if they choose to use the powers of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The alternative is that you shall elect a Dáil for five years, and that once elected it can do what it likes and that no power lies in the electorate either to compel it to do that which is right or to prevent it doing that which is wrong.  That is an entirely different question to considering the Constitution and methods of election and powers of the Seanad, that the whole control is actively, continuously and operatively present in the power of the electorate, and when that is withdrawn, if the President wants accommodation, if he wants to get back to an attitude and an atmosphere in which we will consider other Bills, one by one, to see whether we can fit them in, and see whether we can amend them or improve them, we can do it by taking out the criminal purpose, criminal as against this country, criminal as against the right and the power of this people to deal with the matters of this country &mdash;if he will take that snag out then he will be dealing with a very different people.  But as long as it is part of the conspiracy to see that the common, plain people of the country shall, not even by a majority, have control over the legislation of this country, then he must look for stern, rigid and unrelenting opposition from those who founded their belief in the future of the country on the ground that the will of the majority of the people will be right.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the House realises the seriousness of the constitutional issue for which we are asked to provide these abnormal facilities without any reason given?  We have got to guess all that I am telling you.  Except for the fortunate little irruption of the Minister <Col N="818" /> for Defence and the further irruption from the President we would have no indication whatever as to what the purpose was.  I want the House to realise that once you have taken away Articles 47 and 48, which is the purpose of this abnormal procedure, everything else can happen.  The Dáil can decide that it is perpetually in Session.  Once you have taken away the power of the people under the Referendum and the Initiative to control you, you can make judges subject to this House; you can say that there shall not be proportional representation.</P>

Deputy O'Connell said that progress had been made under the Constitution for the last five years.  Progress is not uni-directional.  He said that none of the changes had hampered economic development.  I think that Deputy O'Connell had not really adverted to the meaning of what he said when he said that.  I am being deliberately fair to him&mdash;I do not think that he had in his mind the fact that among these Constitution Bills was a change of Article 5 and Article 12.  No man in his senses could suggest that that change could be otherwise than hampering in the economic, spiritual and other development of this country.  I take it, therefore, that Deputy O'Connell, when he was speaking of the changes was speaking of minor matters, which I <Col N="819" /> know did arise and were allowed to pass.</P>

      <P>If I have misunderstood the Deputy I am very glad.  The President said there was no money for widows.  There will be a lot of money for widows and there may be widows if the Government deliberately, as they are doing in this matter, turn their backs upon that atmosphere of conciliation and accord and of willingness to use in a reasonable, constitutional way the Constitution which is represented by a full Dáil at present.  If I know the rules of the game I can please myself whether I go into it or not.  I read the rules and I know what would happen.  But, if in the process of playing the game somebody, because they are the stronger side, are capable of altering the rules of the game, what sort of a claim can a peacefully-minded man like myself make to people to come and take the risks of coming into that game?  Here you are deliberately asking the House to provide the abnormal machinery for the purpose of doing something which should not even be done normally.  The President said that it was not an ideal solution&mdash; euphemistic to the verge of untruth.  If I characterised this solution in the language which it deserves, I should bring upon myself one of those rebukes I regret so much to get from the Chair.  He said that we must not repeat the conduct of last week.  Whose conduct&mdash;his, or ours?  The conduct of throwing ten constitutional amendments in three days, unexplained, at the head of the Dáil! No, you must not repeat that kind of conduct.  If you do, you are taking a great risk to safety, to public order, to the public peace, to economic development, to the unity and friendship, to the good accord of the people, within the State.  No; the conduct of last week would be disgraceful in some small novelist's republic&mdash;something that was intended for the purpose of being ridiculous would not attempt to alter its constitution in this way.  It <Col N="820" /> certainly would not have attempted, under the pretence of constitutionalism, to do the very thing that was going to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to everyone of us who has been trying to induce people to use the Constitution.</P>

The President does not want us to repeat the conduct of last week&mdash;he does not want what he calls &ldquo;obstruction.&rdquo;  I think the obstruction has come from the other side.  I am told that I spoke the other night nineteen columns.  I spoke eight and a half columns of it and the House spoke the rest.

I have a copy of the proceedings, with a copy of my speech, and any Deputy <Col N="821" /> can find out the time I spent upon it. There are 197 separate contributions to the debate during my speech.  I was obstructed.  No, we do not want what went on last week.  What we want from the President is this: First, that he shall take a reasonable and responsible view of the Constitution; second, that he shall take a reasonable and responsible view of amendments to the Constitution; third, that he shall lay them before this House in a reasonable and responsible manner; that he will justify the particular amendments which he introduced; that he will attempt to coordinate them with the other half dozen or dozen amendments which he has thrown down to the House&mdash;which, I am perfectly sure, there are not a half dozen members of the House can do at the present moment&mdash;in relation to what I call the trivial amendments.

Then we are going to oppose everything of a like character, and within the functions of the House we are going to do everything that is humanly possible, and that is reasonable, to see that every single one of these amendments of the Constitution, in the fullest and most complete and intimate detail, is fully discussed.

      <P>I formally and most solemnly object to a motion which is intended to create a situation in which amendments of fundamental importance to the Constitution will be discussed under conditions under which they ought not to be discussed.  That is my objection.  That is the reason why I ask every member of this House, including every Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy who will have to go back to his constituents, to say that these fundamental and important amendments to the Constitution shall not be discussed in any condition except the condition which will allow them to be discussed in a manner convenable to their dignity and their import.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I very much regret the necessity that seems to have arisen in the mind of the Government for proposing this motion.  I have an inherent dislike to the suspension of the Standing Orders. There should be some grave necessity, to my mind, to justify it.  Now they are putting before us a whole sheaf of Constitution Amendment Bills.  I think that the position in which the Dáil finds itself to-day could largely have been avoided had the Government paid some little attention to this question during the last ten months.  On the occasion of the Second Reading of Constitution Amendment No. 6 Bill&mdash;I think it was called&mdash;on the 27th July last year, I opposed the Second Reading, but not on the ground of opposition to the principle of the Bill, but rather on the ground of the time and the mode of its introduction.  On that occasion I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As to the method of dealing with the Constitution, I think that if, instead of the House dealing piecemeal with portions of the Constitution, it would be far wiser, now that the time is drawing rapidly to a close during which it will be possible to amend the Constitution directly through this House, to have a Select Committee of the House appointed to go into the whole Constitution and consider whether in the light of the experience we have had of the working of that Constitution it would not be well that in many respects it should be amended.&rdquo;&mdash;(Official Report, column 993, 27th July, 1927.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> Now I submit that if the Government had listened to the suggestion I made on that occasion and again during the course of my speech, and had set up a committee composed, as it might have been, of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the Constitution and the working of the Constitution as a whole, by this time, that is after the lapse of ten months, they would have been in the position to have introduced a comprehensive, omnibus, single measure dealing with what were considered to be necessary amendments of the Constitution.  They did no such thing.  They allowed all this time to elapse until they were confronted by a situation created by the introduction of a petition which purported to be under Article 48 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am not going into a discussion of that Article or of that petition, now, but what I do desire to impress upon the House is that when the Government find themselves in the position that they are in to-day they have themselves, and, almost, only themselves to thank. for it.  They could have adopted the course that I suggested and they might have been in a very different position. But that is not dealing with the present situation.  The Government have thought fit to introduce no fewer, I think, than ten separate Constitution Amendment Bills.  Along with other Deputies I cannot see why these measures could not have been combined in one.  As for the Canadian precedent having anything to do with our internal procedure I fail to see how that in any way meets the case.</P>
    <P>But undoubtedly we in the Dáil now are presented with the problem of the passage or rejection of these measures. Special exception has been taken by the Fianna Fáil Party to one of the measures, namely, that dealing with Article 48.  I may say, in passing, that as far as I am concerned that is one of the measures that I am most in favour of.  I fail to see how the loss of the Initiative or even portion of the Referendum will in any way, endanger or diminish the liberties of the people in this country.  I have had experience elsewhere, and I am convinced that there are no freer people in the world from the point of view of Parliamentary <Col N="824" /> rights and institutions than the people who live across the water in Great Britain.  They have no Initiative and no Referendum there, and personally, if I had anything to do with the shaping and passing of this Constitution, I would have opposed both proposals.</P>
    <P>But the opposition is not to be confined to this one measure.  It appears that because of the serious opposition to Amendment Bill No. 10 the others are to be opposed in almost like manner. Now, as far as the other measures are concerned, while not in agreement with the exact terms of them as proposing an ideal solution for the future Constitution of the Seanad, at the same time I candidly admit that the present system of election to the Seanad is one which must be altered and amended, and that amendment must take place before the next election to the Seanad The next election to the Seanad is to be within the space of the next two months.  That being so, I say that some Constitution Amendment Bill with regard to the future method of composing the Seanad is essential, but at the same time I do not see for a moment why my original suggestion should not be carried out.  Would it not be possible for the Government to introduce and have passed a short Amending Bill extending the life of the Senators in the present Seanad who would retire at the end of this year by, say, one year?  During that period of one year there would be an opportunity given for a meeting of a committee such as I have proposed to consider the Constitution as a whole, and during that period also to have proposed here and discussed a Bill dealing with the future composition of the Seanad. Therefore, I think it is a pity that it should have been thought necessary to table a motion like this. While objecting to the procedure adopted.  I must confess that I do not follow the argument that because these Bills are to be considered at a certain time of the night, therefore it will be to the disadvantage of other measures that may come before the Dáil. On the contrary, I should say that if these Bills were to be disposed of, as suggested by the Government, that would give all the more time for the <Col N="825" /> discussion of questions such as widows' and orphans' pensions.  But I must confess that the procedure adopted seems to me to offend the sense of the House.  There was no necessity for the introduction of all these measures almost simultaneously as they have been introduced.  Would it not be possible even yet to postpone the consideration of the Bill dealing with Article 10 until the autumn.  If that were so, there might be no necessity for the introduction of this motion to-day. If that Bill were postponed I should say that there might be some possibility of arriving at something in the nature of an accommodation between the two chief Parties in this House.</P>
    <P>I put that forward to the Government in all seriousness and sincerity. If they say, as they may, that there is an immediate necessity for the passing of this Bill dealing with Article 48, I confess that I fail to see it.  They have allowed ten months to go during which they did nothing to amend or alter the Constitution in this respect.  They got a Second reading of a Bill during the last Dáil.  Why did they not reintroduce it if it were necessary, or continue the process of passing that original Bill through the Dáil?  If it is such a necessity now, surely it was also a necessity then.  I therefore think that the wisest and soundest course for them to adopt now would be to postpone the taking of the Constitution Amendment Bill 10, which deals with Article 48, until we resume either in the autumn or at the commencement of next year, and to carry on with the other Constitution <Col N="826" /> Amendment Bills which deal with a matter that has already been the subject of discussion by a Committee composed of Deputies and Senators from both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think that the necessity for bringing in a motion such as this would then be obviated, and I do suggest most sincerely to the Government that that would be the proper course for them to adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to say, in reply to what Deputy Redmond suggested, that whatever might happen in the case of the other Bills it would not be possible to postpone Constitution Amendment Bill No. 10.  It seems to me that the proposal of Deputy de Valera to present a petition here, whether that petition was in order or was not in order, makes it essential that action should be taken.  Action must either be in the form of setting certain machinery in motion or in the form of removing that particular Article from the Constitution.  I think that in that matter no delay can take place.  If the House will not assent to one line of action, I think it is the duty of the House to adopt either one line of action or the other, and it certainly is the duty of the Government to press the House to adopt one line or the other.  I move, sir, that the question be now put.</P>

      <P>When the debate was about to be adjourned on the last day, Deputy Thrift contradicted a statement which I made.  I replied that we would go back to the point to-day.  The statement I made was in reference to the fact that it was ultra vires for the Executive Council to bring in this Constitution Amendment Bill, seeing that a petition had been signed by more than 75,000 voters on the register asking the Oireachtas to set up machinery whereby the people could initiate legislation. The statement I made was this: &ldquo;There is at present on the minutes of the Dáil a resolution passed by this House to the effect that that petition <Col N="831" /> should not be considered until a Select Committee considers the whole question of the machinery whereby the petition could be accepted by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 23rd May last we discussed a motion which was in the name of Deputy Thrift.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the question of granting leave for the presentation of a petition, purporting to be prepared in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution, be not further considered until the Oireachtas has prescribed the procedure to be adopted for the presentation of the petitions contemplated in Article 48 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the same day's Order Paper there was another motion in the name of Deputy Thrift which was not reached. This other motion reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee consisting of six members of the Dáil and six members of the Seanad be set up to consider and report as to the procedure to be adopted in the presentation of petitions purporting to have been prepared in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know why on earth Deputy Thrift is running away from these two motions.  Surely he is not ashamed that these motions were down in his name, and that one of them was discussed and passed, and that the other is still on the Order Paper in his name to be discussed and, I suppose we may take it, passed at some future date?  If it is not going to be passed at some future date, why was it put on the Order Paper?  If Deputy Thrift did not intend it to be discussed and passed at some future date, why did he put the motion on the Order Paper?  Perhaps the quotation which I am about to read may throw some light on the subject. The quotation reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was caught napping President Cosgrave simply refused to accept Mr. de Valera's petition&mdash;refused, in other words, to be bound by an existing Article of the Free State Constitution.  If the Dáil had ratified the refusal, it would have created a most dangerous precedent; but the <Col N="832" /> alternative seemed to be its connivance at an attack on a fundamental provision of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. From this apparent dilemma the Government was rescued by Professor Thrift's proposal, that the course of Mr. de Valera's petition should be stayed until Parliament should have prescribed a procedure for petitions under Article 48.  The Dáil adopted Mr. Thrift's amendment yesterday by a substantial majority.  We may suppose that the Government will not be caught napping twice, and that, before the procedure for petitions under Article 48 can be formulated, the Article itself will have been consigned to unhonoured oblivion.</P>
    <P>That quotation is taken from a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; on the 2nd June last.  That was the day that Deputy Thrift's motion was passed in the Dáil.  When Deputy Thrift was proposing his motion, that the question of granting leave for the presentation of a petition purporting to be prepared in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution be not further considered until the Oireachtas had prescribed the procedure to be adopted for the presentation of the petitions contemplated in Article 48 of the Constitution, it appeared, I think, to the majority of members that Deputy Thrift was appealing to us not to consider Deputy de Valera's motion further until the Dáil would go into the question of the procedure to accept such petitions.  He did not say to the Fianna Fáil Party here: &ldquo;You caught the President napping once; I do not want you to catch him napping again, so I am introducing this motion.&rdquo;   He did not say: &ldquo;I want you to turn down Deputy de Valera's motion now, so as to give the Government an opportunity of getting rid of Article 48 of the Constitution and consigning it to unhonoured oblivion before any further steps can be taken in the matter.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>What he did say was this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The first thing to do is for the Oireachtas to determine how that petition is to be presented, to lay <Col N="833" /> down what is the constitutional and proper way to do it, and, accordingly, I have put down as a substantive motion that the House should proceed to get advice from a Joint Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad as to what that Committee thinks is the right method to adopt for the proper presentation of such a petition.  That is my case for the amendment.&rdquo;&mdash;(Parliamentary Debates, May 23rd, column 1907).</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift also made this appeal on the same basis (column 1905):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are there not enough things calling for us all to join together?  Are there not hundreds of problems waiting for us to attack and work at? Are there not unemployed calling for us to do something to give them employment? Are there not thousands living in dwellings who appeal to us to put our brains to work to see how we can make things better for them instead of wasting time?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I heard that I pictured Deputy Thrift going off to build houses and tackle all the other problems that confront the nation.  I thought that was what he had in mind, but the next day it would appear from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; that what he had in mind was to get the Dáil to pass his particular motion so that the President might not be caught napping, not that houses might be built or that the other problems confronting the Irish people might be faced, but that the President might not be caught napping twice, that &ldquo;Before the procedure for petitions under Article 48 can be formulated the Article itself will have been consigned to unhonoured oblivion.&rdquo;  That is the real purpose of Deputy Thrift's amendment to Deputy de Valera's motion. That was, I suppose, the real purpose of all the flapdoodle and the appeal he made here in this House.  If it is not, I would like him to tell the House what his purpose really was.  We maintain that it is absolutely ultra vires for the Government to introduce the Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill at the present time, because there is in existence a petition signed according to the conditions laid down in Article 48 of the Constitution requesting the Oireachtas to put Article 48 into effective operation.  The Article calls for <Col N="834" /> 75,000 people to sign the petition. Actually 96,000 have signed it, and not more than 15,000 reside in any one constituency. When Article 48 was being passed through this Dáil five or six years ago, we were told in regard to that Article and in regard to Article 47, which is the Referendum:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, we consider, particularly suited to this country in the circumstances of the time.  It will impress on the people more forcibly perhaps than would otherwise be the case that henceforth the law of this country is their law, is the creature of their will and is something which they can make, alter or repeal as it seems best to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, who was the Government's sponsor for this particular Article in the Dáil.  Then they told the people that this particular Article was brought in for the purpose of making the law of this country the creature of the people's will, of making it something which they can make, alter or repeal as it seems best to them.  If that is the purpose of the Article why is it being now abolished?  Is it being now abolished in order to secure that the law of this country will not be the creature of the people's will, that the law of this country is something which the people cannot make, alter or repeal as it seems best to them?  We would like the Government to answer that.  If the purpose of abolishing this Article now is to secure that the law of the country is not to be the creature of the will of the people of this country, is not to be something which they can make, alter or repeal as it seems best to them we want to know why is it that Article 48 was ever put into the Constitution. Now the date on which Articles 47 and 48 were introduced and passed here in this Dáil is significant. It was the 5th October, 1922.  That was the date on which the people were told that henceforth the law of this country is to be their law; is to be the creature of their will; is to be something which they can make, alter or repeal as it seems best to them.  And because the law was to be the people's law many things were done in this country.  The people were asked to support the Government <Col N="835" /> in carrying out certain deeds here because the law was to be their law and because matters were to be so arranged that the people could make, alter or repeal the laws as they thought fit.  The 5th October, 1922, is a date previous to any official executions that took place here.  The executions were carried out on this plea &mdash; this is another quotation &mdash;&ldquo;We are going to see that the rule of democracy will be maintained, no matter what the cost and no matter who is the intellectual that may fall by reason of the assertion of that right.&rdquo; That is another quotation from President Cosgrave.  The date on which he used those words was the 28th November, 1922, in the debate on the execution of the late Mr. Erskine Childers. This is another quotation from the same debate: &ldquo;They (the people) have the right to decide their own affairs.  They have the right to have their majority will decide their own affairs, and no man, Irish or English, has the right to say them nay.&rdquo;  This is another quotation from the debate on the executions of the 8th December, 1922.  It is from Mr. Kevin O'Higgins: &ldquo;We want to place the power of Government in this country in the hands of the Irish people so that they may rule according to their will.&rdquo;  In another portion of the same debate he said: &ldquo;We have no higher aim than to place the people of Ireland in the saddle in Ireland and let them do their will, but we will not acquiesce in gun-bullying, and we will take very drastic measures to stop it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, all the executions that took place here in this country were justi&mdash; fied by the existence in the Constitution of the democratic Articles of the Constitution.  Two of these were Articles 46 and 47; they are now called Articles 47 and 48.  We mean to do all in our power to block the erasion from the Constitution of the democratic Articles of the Constitution, the articles which were quoted in justification of the executions of Erskine Childers and Liam Mellowes.  In the debate on Article 48, which makes provision for the Initiative, it was said by one of the Free State Cabinet: &ldquo;It (the Initiative) keeps contact between the people and their laws and keeps responsibility and consciousness in the <Col N="836" /> minds of the people that they are the real and ultimate rulers of the country.&rdquo;  That was all very good then. If the Initiative keeps contact between the people and their laws, and keeps responsibility and consciousness in the minds of the people that they are the real and ultimate rulers in this country, why is that Article now being erased from the Constitution.  This is another quotation: &ldquo;The text of the Article, as it stands, is permissive, it is not mandatory. It is permissive of Parliament to institute the Initiative, but it is mandatory if Parliament having failed to introduce it is requested by petition within two years.&rdquo;  That is a quotation from the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins when he was introducing the Initiative. The people were told then what Article 48 meant.  These are the words of Mr. Blythe: &ldquo;It (the Article of Initiative) is mandatory as it stands, whenever a petition shall be presented signed by 100,000 voters on the register.&rdquo;  That is what Mr. Blythe said then.  In other words, he said that whenever 100,000 voters on the register want to set up machinery for the Initiative, this Article makes it mandatory.  Why did the Minister for Finance tell the people then that whenever 100,000 people on the register &mdash; it was amended in Committee afterwards to 75,000 &mdash; asked for the machinery of the Initiative to be set up it would be set up.  Why did he do that?  Did he really mean it, or was he simply seeking to secure the support of the people for his war measures?  Was he simply asking the people to agree to the war measures that he afterwards took to get rid of Erskine Childers and Liam Mellowes?</P>
    <P>It is not a bit of wonder that the Ministers want this to be discussed in the early hours of the morning, when the lowest possible number of people will hear the truth about the thing.  We know that only the slightest possible amount of what we say here will get through to the people of the country as a whole, and when it does get through we can hardly recognise what we said. They want to hold these meetings of the Dáil to discuss these diabolical amendments when there will be nobody even on the Gallery.  Deputy de Valera definitely charged the Government that the reason they have introduced these <Col N="837" /> Constitution amendments is because they are fearful lest the people should throw them out of office.  He also charged them that these Bills clearly show that they got into office under false pretences.  What have the Ministers to say to those charges?  I have read the extracts from their own speeches on Articles 47 and 48 which they now propose to abolish.  If they were really in earnest then in asking the support of the people for this Constitution which contained Articles 47 and 48 why are they getting rid of them now?  Why are they getting rid of these Articles of the Constitution by which they justified the execution of the Republican prisoners?  That is what we want some Minister here to answer.  We want them to give us the reasons here, and not to be putting on the closure.  When we were speaking about this Constitution some of the Ministers sneered at us because we knew something about the Constitution, because we knew that the Constitution Act is outside and apart altogether from the Constitution. But the Constitution Act was not published and made known to the people when the people were asked to support the Cumann na nGaedheal Party during the first three quarters of 1922.  It was only when they had the people in their grip, when they assumed dictatorial powers, that they put through the Constitution Amendment Act.  They had then the ball at their own feet; they could then say that they had effectively closured the Republicans in this country.  They had them either in jail or on the run, and they had some of them under the sod.</P>

They said: &ldquo;Why are these people fighting?  Why are they in arms against us?  Here we have a Constitution which is the most democratic Constitution of any country in the world and it will enable them to do anything they want for the people of Ireland. If they do not work that Constitution we must take whatever steps are necessary to render their opposition ineffective.&rdquo; President Cosgrave said that they spent £35,000,000 of money, but since we came in here he said that he never said it.  He said that they spent £35,000,000 of public money, and they shot many people opposed to them, and they got many of their own soldiers killed.</P>

They were delivered for purely obstructive reasons, and the most effective answer which we gave was the silence we maintained for the past week.

      <P>To get down to the bare facts before us and to analyse what little shred of argument has been given to us, I will endeavour to consider the only reasonable contribution made to this debate and that is the speech delivered by Deputy de Valera.  Deputy Aiken referred to it a moment ago when he said that the action we were taking was ultra vires.  Let us examine the points of view put before the House in an orderly common-sense way and see which of the contentions are right. Deputy de Valera said: &ldquo;But the moment any effort is made towards freedom by any section of the people, even <Col N="844" /> if that section hope to get a majority behind it, then that section and that majority is to be deprived of constitutional action.  It is to be blocked by this Constitution and these people will be told `If you want it you must not hope to get it from this Constitution, whatever way you may get it.  You may get it by force but we have securely locked the door and have taken very good care that there will be no means through this Constitution by which a majority can hope to assert their freedom if they want it.' &rdquo; That crystallises the whole case and the whole sum of the argument that has been presented to this House by the Opposition.  Deputy de Valera went on to say that the action the Government have now taken in introducing the amendment Bills now before the House was ultra vires and it was not within our power to carry it.  I would like to quote the view that is held on these benches so that the two views might be placed side by side.  President Cosgrave speaking on the Constitution No. 6 Bill (Volume 20, page 986) said: &ldquo;While the value of the Initiation machinery, foreshadowed in Article 48 is in any circumstances very doubtful, it is clearly wrong to allow a position of affairs to remain where the presence of an Article is being used to fool the populace, to delude them with the belief that it can be used for a purpose for which it cannot be used.&rdquo;  I might add a further quotation in the same debate from a speech by Deputy Hogan, page 998.  Deputy Hogan said: &ldquo;The State is being attacked.  It was attacked in the person of the Minister for Justice by certain weapons.  Is it not being attacked by the Fianna Fáil Party? Which is the more dangerous, the more insidious form of attack?  What is the object of that party?  Is it not the overthrow of the State?&rdquo; We have now the issues clearly placed before us &mdash; the Fianna Fáil point of view and the point of view of the Government and the question should be asked, which of these points of view is correct?  A short time ago this House was presented with a petition and in that petition certain demands were made to this House.  It was sought by means of Article 48, which the Bill before the House is intended to amend, entirely to remove <Col N="845" /> from the Constitution Article 17.  In reading Article 48 I would draw the attention of this House to a very important phrase that occurs therein: &ldquo;The Oireachtas may provide for the initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments.&rdquo;  The question I want to ask this House is, is the amendment proposed by means of a petition by the Fianna Fáil Party, a constitutional amendment.  We on these benches hold that the amendment proposed by Fianna Fáil is grossly unconstitutional and was an amendment that could not be carried by the means they suggest.</P>

I wonder did Deputy de Valera ever ascertain what are the real historical facts so far as that particular contribution to the debate is concerned. If one looks around the various countries of Europe what does one find?  In France they have a Senate which numbers 300 and lasts for a period of nine years.  In Italy the Senate is nominated for life by the King through his Ministers.  In Canada, New South Wales and Queensland it is nominated for life.</P>

We have been asked in this House to maintain and keep within the hands of the people the powers which they possess.  Although we have been told by Deputy de Valera that we must not pay any great attention to the example of other countries so far as the creation and composition of our Seanad is concerned, we must retain in the Constitution this method of the Initiative, because <Col N="849" /> should we remove this method of the Initiative from the hands of the people, all popular liberty, all popular rights are gone.

I would point out that in Switzerland, where the Initiative is in use, there is no such thing as woman suffrage; no such thing as proportional representation; the liberty of the Press is practically only of very recent growth; the liberty of the individual is by no means guaranteed; and <Col N="850" /> trial by jury in many of the Swiss Cantons is unknown.  Deputy de Valera, with the wonderful argument of a logician, suggests that we are not to mind the example of the other great countries which furnish real practical experience for the guidance of a young State such as ours, which is now setting out to rule itself, after being misruled for 700 years.  We are to follow the guidance of what may be really termed a political back-number.  What we are doing in amending this Article is in the interests of the country, in the interests of popular liberty, in the interests of the subject, and in the interests of the State, and we are determined to do our duty.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to find in the few brief remarks which the President thought fit to deliver to the House when introducing this Bill some justification for it.  I have found his justification for the Bill could be very briefly stated.  He started with the platitude.  He said &ldquo;majorities have rights and these rights must be secured to them&rdquo; and then he said as an argument in justification for this Bill that there is adequate provision in the constitution for the expression of political opinions and that the Initiative and the Referendum did not recommend themselves to the Executive Council, for that reason we presume.  In connection with the Initiative alone he said &ldquo;it served no useful purpose.&rdquo;  In that statement of the President we must take it we will find the motives that influenced the Government in bringing this Bill in this manner before the House.  I do not think I could find any additional information in the oration to which we have just listened from Deputy Byrne.  He will be occupied no doubt for the rest of the night in endeavouring to sit idly and to stand supinely.  He will have a difficult job. He succeeds in doing it but so long as he does not try it in the House it will be all right.</P>
      <P>I hope in the discussion of this Bill we will not have the same guilty silence from the front bench opposite that we had in connection with the Constitution Amendment Bill that passed second reading.  I trust some little light will be let in upon the discussion that took place in the Executive Council or the Committee Rooms of Cumann na nGaedheal when the decision was adopted for the abolition of Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution.  It is not sufficient for the President to give as justification for this Bill that majorities have their rights and that those rights must be secured to them, because this is a Bill which takes from a majority of the Irish people the rights given to them by the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Article 47 of the Constitution, one of the Articles which must be abolished, is to secure to the majority the rights they possess, and is an Article that provides that any Bill passed by this House can be referred by a Referendum to the people on a demand to that effect being signed by two-fifths of the Deputies here or one half of the members of the Seanad. It does not become law unless the majority of the people approve of it by their votes.  This Bill, we are told, is to secure to the majority the rights they have.  It is the very reverse of what the President described it.  It is a Bill to take away from the majority of the people rights given to them five years ago, when this Constitution was enacted.  Article 48 is the Article that provides that the people can take steps to set up machinery for the initiation of laws by this House &mdash; laws which could not become operative unless the majority of the people, by Referendum, voted for them.  When President Cosgrave introduced the Bill and stuck his hand in his breast, like Napoleon, and said &ldquo;the majority have rights and these rights must be secured them,&rdquo; he was just trying to hoodwink the Dáil and the Irish people.  This is a Bill to take from the majority the rights they possess, to prevent the majority exercising those rights, and it is because I assert the Government are afraid to face the majority on particular issues that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is adequate provision in the Constitution for the expression of political opinions.  There is, of course, provision in the Constitution for the democratic election of members of the Dáil. But is it seriously maintained that these provisions are adequate for the purpose of getting a clear expression of the people's opinion upon particular <Col N="853" /> issues?  Deputies opposite just as Deputies on this side of the House have all gone through the general election. They have all been elected by the votes of the people, and they know quite clearly that a general election is not a suitable opportunity for getting the expression of people's opinions on particular issues.  The issues that come before the people at a general election are confused by the personality of the candidate, by the records of the Party to which the candidate belongs, by the policy of that Party, and by a variety of matters such as personal friendships, likes and dislikes.  The result of a general election is a general indication of people's opinion as to which Party should constitute the Government.  But as an indication of people's opinion on a particular issue, as, say, the retention of Article 17 of the Constitution, it is not an instrument for getting that opinion at all.  If it is desired to get a clear expression of the people's opinion upon matters of that kind or on matters of the important nature which have been mentioned here, it is by the machinery of the Initiative or the Referendum that that opinion can best be secured, because by that machinery the people will be asked to give their opinion on one item only, unconfused by question of personalities.  The Initiative and the Referendum do not recommend themselves to the Executive Council.  Of course not.  The majority have their rights, and these rights must be taken from them while there is time.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Constitution which provides it can only be amended by law within eight years and, therefore, we have all this indecent haste before the eight year period has expired to filch from the people the democratic rights they were given in 1922 and on the strength of which a civil war was fought.  No wonder the Initiative and the Referendum do not recommend themselves to the Executive Council.  It is extraordinary that the sections of the Constitution which provide for the democratic election of members to this House, recommend themselves to the Executive Council.  Perhaps this is only the beginning.  Perhaps the next step that will be taken in the middle of an all-night sitting will be to abolish the <Col N="854" /> system of democratic election altogether. We could advance strong arguments in favour of an intellectual aristocracy and a benevolent dictatorship.  It is coming.  This is the first step in that direction to prevent the people having any means by which they check the doings of this House, and take out of their hands any means by which they could initiate and pass legislation irrespective of the opinion of the majority in this House.  No wonder that the Initiative and the Referendum do not recommend themselves to the Executive. No wonder we are to sit until eight on to-morrow morning to discuss this Bill. Of course the possibility is that the closure may be moved before that.  In order that Deputies may fully appreciate the significance of the introduction of this Bill in this manner at this time it may be necessary to review briefly the history of the Bill.  As Deputy Aiken pointed out, Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution were inserted therein in 1922 with a great blare of trumpets, with a great proclamation of the desire of the Government to ensure that the will of the people would prevail and would always prevail in this State.</P>
    <P>In order that the people might be made familiar and kept familiar with the doings of their legislators, in order that they might keep a check on and be able to revise the action of their legislators, these Articles were provided in the Constitution.  As Deputy Aiken has pointed out, these Articles and similar Articles were taken and proclaimed in justification of all that happened after that Constitution passed through the Dáil &mdash; to make Ireland safe for democracy.  To make Ireland safe for democracy a civil war was fought, and on that plea £20,000,000, £35,000,000 or £50,000,000 were sent up in smoke. That was to make Ireland safe for democracy and to ensure the retention of the democratic rights of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is this, that if there were any Articles of the Constitution which the Government in common decency could not touch they were these Articles which they pleaded in justification for all the action they took after that Constitution became law.  They did not hesitate to justify the deed, which could not be justified in any other manner, by saying that they were necessary to insure that these Articles should be the fundamental law of this State.  They became the law.  They succeeded in smashing down opposition to their policy.  They forced that Constitution on the Irish people, and then fought an election upon the grounds that they were going to take equally drastic steps to retain the Constitution.  As I said before, they made magnificent speeches about their attitude.  They struck heroic attitudes; at every cross-roads in the country they proclaimed themselves to be super-men, men of iron, men who would never flinch, men who were going to preserve the Constitution no matter what the so-and-so irregulars would do to circumvent it.</P>

      <P>A faint, far-away &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo;  The Constitution became law.  The Constitution was looked upon as something which should not be altered except where the alteration was obviously needed in the interests of the people.  Articles 47 and 48 were the gilt on the ginger-bread.  They represented part of the covering of democracy which hid the less democratic and much more significant Articles which provided for the authority of the British Monarch in this country.  That is the preliminary of the history of the Bill.  When we consider this Bill we must keep that civil war and all it meant to this country in the back of our minds.  A certain number of individuals who thought that this Constitution had some significance, who thought that Article 48 was meant seriously, proceeded to take advantage of it.  The Article provides that if the Oireachtas has not made provision for the initiation of laws and constitutional amendments by the people within <Col N="856" /> two years, it must do so upon a petition of 75,000 voters being presented to them to that effect.</P>
      <P>As I said, a certain number of people who thought that the Government, in common decency, could not run away from this Constitution, proceeded to take advantage of that Article in order to abolish a much more objectionable Article in the Constitution.  In order to effect other constitutional changes and other legislative steps which are necessary a petition was signed.  By the efforts of voluntary workers throughout the country that petition was signed.</P>

I am not dealing with these Articles in order to repeat or to go over something else that has already been decided.  I am showing the steps leading up to the introduction of the Bill by the Government.  Following upon the refusal of the Government to accept the petition a motion was tabled by Deputy de Valera: &ldquo;That the petition be received,&rdquo; and then President Cosgrave announced that the Government would oppose the motion.  It was then that events began to move.  It was upon the announcement by President Cosgrave that that motion would be opposed by the Government that matters began to happen which resulted in this Bill.  The first indication that something was happening was a leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; said that the Government is unconstitutional. It is proposing to ignore the Constitution, and by doing so it is opening up an amazing vista of lawlessness and irregularity; and what is more important, that they are giving Mr. de Valera an amazingly bad precedent.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been introduced because of a certain amendment to Deputy de Valera's motion which was carried in the Dáil.  It was introduced at the suggestion of the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Irish Times&rdquo; suggested step by step everything that has actually happened.  They suggested that President Cosgrave's attitude was wrong and unwise.  They suggested that a motion should be moved to postpone discussion upon Deputy de Valera's motion, that the excuse could be offered that no machinery was in existence for the examination of such a petition, and as Deputy Aiken read out, they then said:&mdash;&ldquo;But take very good care that the Government is not caught napping twice,&rdquo; and before such machinery could be set up, before such a Committee could be formed, a Bill to abolish the Article in the Constitution should be introduced, and that is what happened.  I do not know whether the writer of this leading article in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; is a prophet &mdash; I do not think so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Bill is now before us &mdash; the Bill to abolish Articles in the Constitution which were used to justify everything that did happen, and of which I hope some of the Deputies opposite are ashamed, in 1922 and 1923. These are Articles to provide that the majority will of the Irish people can be made effective in this State.  It is proposed to abolish that.  These Articles do not recommend themselves to the Executive Council.  The Executive Council have other ideas in mind.  I propose to postpone the consideration of this Bill for twelve months.  I do so because I think it is not possible for any Deputy in this House to be associated in any way with the game the Government is playing without coming out of that game bearing some marks of the mud.</P>
      <P>I think that the Government in their own interests and to preserve the last shred of decency that is left them should agree to accept my amendment. It is going to go down on record that this game was played.  It is going to appear on the records of this House that this thing was done, and the historian of the future will read the article in the <i>Irish Times</i> and the events in this House, and he will see that the Irish people during this period had a Government so backboneless, so invertebrate, that a leading article writer in the <i>Irish Times</i> could dictate its policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has moved that this Bill be not further considered as it is the opinion of the Dáil that Articles 47 and 48 should be retained until the people by direct vote have expressed their will on the question of deletion. The majority have rights and these rights must be secured to them, and surely the Irish people have the right to say whether or not these articles should be deleted.  Remember at the end of another year or so it will not be possible to delete these Articles at all by law.  Before any other amendment in the Constitution can be made and before any of the steps which we are going to take between this and 8 o'clock in the <Col N="860" /> morning can be rectified, it will be necessary, as Deputy Flinn said, to get all the people who voted for Fianna Fáil, for Cumann na nGaedheal and Labour put together &mdash; two-thirds of the voters on the register &mdash; to effect the change.  After this Bill becomes law a majority will be powerless to alter the Constitution by a single comma.  Not even two-thirds of those who vote on a Referendum, but actually two-thirds on the register, would be needed.  We could not get them to vote in the last election; we had only 60 per cent of a poll.  If every person who voted in the last general election voted for a single Constitutional amendment they would not be able to secure their aim under the terms of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>We should be very careful before we take the steps we are going to take now, before we take away from the people the right the Constitution gives them to check the work of the Dáil.  We should get their opinion about it first. We should use the machinery of the Referendum and ask the opinion of the people about this matter.  If the majority of the people want to delete those Articles we will not oppose their will.  It is because the Government know right well that the majority of the people, sooner than delete the Articles, would vote them out of office, that they are proposing their amendments now and are pressing these matters to a division.  I challenge them to take any steps whatever to get an indication of the people's will on this Bill. They are afraid to face the people on it. They are even afraid to defend it in the Dáil.  They sit there mute of malice. They are relying on their tame majority to put the Bill through irrespective of what arguments can be advanced against it.  They put up Deputy Byrne to make the case, adding insult to injury.</P>

I hope they will not attempt to prevent any Deputy in this Dáil saying what he <Col N="861" /> thinks.  If it is not proposed to take the views of the people on the matter, at any rate take the views of the people's representatives and let us have none of this jumping up and moving of the closure.  Are we to take it that the Government is not merely afraid to face the people, but is afraid to face the Dáil in fair discussion upon this measure?  Personally, I feel strongly upon this.  I know exactly the arguments that were used by the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Fisheries and several of their colleagues to ensure that an opportunity would be given them to set up this Dáil and to provide for the passing of this Constitution.  It was not this Constitution that they were talking about then.  It was the Republican Constitution that was going to make all the difference in the Treaty.</P>

      <P>But this is the Constitution that came, and these are two of the Articles which they produced and now, in the year 1928, having secured themselves in office, having built up their reserves of power, having organised, trained and disciplined an army to defend them, and having no need for the services of the fools they relied on in 1922, they proceed to tear up this Constitution, to strip it of every democratic provision, and leave it a document which would proclaim nothing else except that His Majesty King George V. is to be the final authority in this island.  Is it too much to hope that there are members of Cumann na nGaedheal who are not so entirely lost to shame that even at this stage they will begin to see where they are going and they will help us to stop the rout, help us to provide, not that our policy will become the dominant policy of this country and not that the Government's policy on major national matters will be reversed, but that some provision will be made by which the people will be able to express their will on these matters as single issues?  That is not asking for much.  It is not asking for much from men who once were <Col N="862" /> proud to belong to the Sinn Fein movement. It is not asking much from men who once boasted they were Irish Republicans&mdash;to ask them merely to keep in this Constitution provisions by which the majority of the people can occasionally and at considerable difficulty make their will effective; effective on matters concerning the national status as well as on matters concerning their social welfare.  There is, perhaps, some prospect of securing amongst the ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal that support which I am asking for, but it is very slight, I am afraid.  The Party Whips are there to see that the prospect does not become a probability. Many arguments could be used to keep men on the easy road when it is a difficult thing to take the right road.  I know what it is.  But I hope that sufficient will be found even in the ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal to resent the  dishonesty of this Bill and to reject it, and by rejecting it to reject the Government that introduced it.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been appeals made, rather pathetically at the end, by Deputy Lemass that somebody from the Front Government Bench should deal with the arguments which have been put forward by his Party against the measure now before the House.  I am afraid that my main difficulty is to find arguments in the three speeches which have been addressed to us, and not the difficulty of answering what I can at best describe as the semblance of arguments which have been put up.  I certainly thought that there would be some speaker from the Fianna Fáil Party who would take this question up as a serious one, and argue it as a serious question and on the merits. Not one of the three speakers from the Fianna Fáil Party has attempted to do anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take firstly Deputy de Valera's speech.  I heard most of it delivered by him the other evening, and I have read through the whole of it.  Argument I cannot find in it, unless, indeed, you think that vituperation is argument, and that by mere unbounded invective you can carry your point always.  I consider the speech which <Col N="863" /> Deputy Aiken delivered more extreme in vituperation and more wanting even in the semblance of argument than Deputy de Valera's first speech.  I come now to the more temperate speech which Deputy Lemass delivered, but none the less on the same ground: invective, invective, and nothing but invective, no attempt by any single one of the speakers to get down to the real point at issue.</P>
    <P>We have been charged again and again with want of good faith and want of honesty.  We are told that this is an entirely dishonest measure on our part.  I repudiate that.  It is not.  This is a Bill brought in by us for one purpose, and one purpose only, and that is to improve the Constitution. We considered that that Constitution had defects.  Every Constitution will have defects.  Nothing that has ever come from the brains of man, I might say, but has shown by experience its defects, and because we believe that this Initiative is a bad thing, is a defect in the Constitution, we wish to eradicate it from the Constitution.  As the President said the other day, we expressed our arguments against this Initiative as far back as last July.  I have endeavoured to analyse Deputy de Valera's speech, but when I tear away the rhetoric and the invective from it, I find very little behind it.  The only thing that I can see in it, in the nature of argument, is where he says &mdash; and this does not go to the merits of the Initiative at all &mdash;&ldquo;I said before if these powers which are given in the Constitution are to be taken away from the people, the people should be consulted.&rdquo; The people have been consulted and the people have spoken.  The Bill that was introduced last July was before the people at the General Election in September, and upon that Bill and on the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party the people voted at the last general election and returned us to power.  I think if you look at it fairly and honestly you will admit that the Government, having introduced the Bill, having expressed their intention to do a thing and having gone to the country with that Bill as one of the planks in their platform, not to do that <Col N="864" /> thing would be to betray the trust reposed in them by the people who elected them to this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera went on to say, though possibly he did not completely mean it, but it has been rubbed in all through the speech of Deputy Lemass, that it is a fundamental right of the people to have this policy of initiation. That means, I suppose, that you can have no democratic Constitution unless you have the Initiative in it.  The argument seems to be that it is inherent in the people to have the power to initiate legislation.  Are there any free peoples in the world at all, or how many peoples in the world are free if that be a fundamental right?  How many peoples in the world have given up or have never enjoyed that fundamental right and are ignorant of its very existence?  Are the peoples in the States of New York or in California not free because they have no powers of initiation?  Are all the great Republics of South America, or is France, another Republican country&mdash;are the citizens of those States not free, and are they deprived of their fundamental rights because they have no right of initiation in their Constitutions?  Deputy Aiken declared that this Bill would be <i>ultra vires</i> if it became law.  That is an argument which I cannot follow.  I do not precisely know what Deputy Aiken meant by it, though he repeated the phrase again and again, but I can tell Deputy Aiken that this Oireachtas is sovereign in this State, that every law it passes is binding upon the people of this State, and that, as far as the Oireachtas is concerned there can be nothing <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken quoted various phrases.  One, which I took down, was that the people were in the saddle, and that there was to be no gun pulling. That is an absolutely clear statement of our policy: that the people are in the saddle; that the people elect their representatives to this Dáil, and that this is the chamber which ultimately and finally wields power in this State.</P>
    <P>The people are in power; the people are in the saddle, and they are free to put whom they like into power.  They do it through the ordinary medium of a general election.  As far as the <Col N="865" /> Deputy's arguments go they seem to be this: That representative government is worn out; that representative government is undemocratic; that representative government is not sufficient unless it has been supplemented by some of these, what I would describe as fancy things, like the power of initiation. That is not my view.  I believe in representative government, and I believe that representative government, pure and simple, is the best form of government for this country, and in my humble judgment these added things, like Referendum or Initiative, are clogs and difficulties and defects in respect of the system of representative government.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera in a speech which he made on this question some time ago brought forward as an argument that Initiation has been a success in Switzerland. It may be.  I will admit that it is, but anything more unlike the situation in Switzerland and the situation in the Irish Free State I certainly cannot imagine.  To begin with, Switzerland is a federal union.  Switzerland consists of 24 independent States that have come together as one federal state. Switzerland had one of the most difficult problems that could be dealt with, and it was dealt with in a way that suited the Swiss people.  The Swiss Constitution was brought in after Switzerland had been racked by civil war.  The Forest Cantons had been beaten and the other Cantons had come in at the end of that civil war, and a bitter civil war because it was fought on religious grounds. Then this Swiss Constitution for the first time was established, and the Swiss Constitution was dealing with a very strange problem, because the Swiss people as well as their Cantons have Communes&mdash;I am not sure of the number, but I think there are something over 2,000 Communes.  In several of these Communes there is no representative government.  The people meet together, and they do their business, not through delegates and not through representatives, but they do it in person. That was the history behind Switzerland and that was the training the Swiss people had.</P>
    <P>The Swiss people found, no doubt, that this Referendum, the power of Initiation, suited them, but where else <Col N="866" /> has it been tried?  In a Constitution which was established in Germany very much about the same time as the Irish Constitution, Initiation was also introduced. Has Initiation been a success or a failure in Germany?  It has been tried twice in Germany, and on both occasions it has shown itself an absolute farce.  The first attempt by the German people to exercise their power of initiation was when they initiated a Bill for the confiscation of the properties of those who had been the ruling Princes in Germany prior to the Revolution. That was opposed by the Government of the day.  There was a Referendum.  The German Referendum requires 50 per cent. of voters, but less than 50 per cent. went to the poll. The thing was lost after great expense and great discomfort to the German people, and the whole thing at the end proved a complete failure.  The second attempt at Initiation in Germany was during the time when the currency question was largely debated, and after the German Government had brought in certain proposals for regulating the currency an attempt was made to initiate legislation by certain persons who held large sums of paper money.  They presented a petition to the German Government which would, in the opinion of the German Government at any rate, have brought a considerable amount of trouble and turmoil to the country, with the result that the Government passed legislation to the effect that any petition of this nature would have to be treated as a Referendum on a Money Bill, which meant it could only be granted by the President, and the President, General Von Hindenburg, refused any such Referendum.  There you had only two cases in Germany where this power of Initiation was attempted to be used, and in both cases it has ended up in complete fiasco.  If I may, I will quote, not as an authority, but a mere statement of fact, from an admirable monograph recently published on the new democratic constitutions in Europe.  It was to this effect:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is significant that the really big issues, such as the acceptance of the Dawes Report, or the entrance of Germany to the League of Nations, were considered to be too critical and <Col N="867" /> too important to be submitted to the people, and the people showed sufficient discernment and sufficient confidence in their rulers not to interfere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, argument from analogy is always, to a certain extent, a defective argument, but as far as you can argue from analogy, it is one of the best arguments, if not the best argument which we can have.  At the present moment we find that in other countries which have started like us this Initiation has been used, not for the advantage of the people, but for the disadvantage of the people.  There has been a tremendous amount of <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> here, a very poor class of argument indeed, but our position is clear, that having given the matter full weight and full consideration we are of the opinion that the retention of this power in the Constitution would not be for the benefit of the people of this country, and would not make for future peace or security in this country, and we are further strengthened in this belief by the history of what has taken place.</P>
    <P>I am not going back upon previous debates but we do know that the only occasion upon which any effort was made to utilise the power of initiation in this country was a deliberate attempt to wreck our Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has challenged an argument on this subject, and, before entering into it, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the Bill which is actually before it.  It is to delete Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution. I submit that you cannot consider that proposal in any adequate or thoughtful way unless you take into consideration the conditions and the circumstances under which the Constitution itself was framed, and the purpose for which those Articles were included in it.  In considering such a proposal, I would like to emphasise to the House, to ask them to consider that this is no mere commonplace, ordinary legislative measure that is now before it.  We have often been taunted with obstructing and holding up the business.  I want to leave that phase of the matter altogether on one side, and to those <Col N="868" /> who would try to restrict or limit debate upon this matter, I would quote the dictum of a great parliamentarian, Charles James Fox, who said that deliberation, and not despatch, was the duty of legislative assemblies.  We are considering a fundamental law of this State.  We are proposing to alter and to change that law, whether for the better or for the worse is the point which we have to argue.  At any rate it is always a delicate and a dangerous thing to tamper with the fundamentals of anything, whether it be a creed or a building or a constitution.  I would like that we should leave behind us, if we can, the atmosphere that has been engendered here during the past few days, and consider this matter in a calmer but not less earnest spirit, to consider it not as partisans fighting to retain or to obtain some temporary political advantage, but as men charged with a great public duty who will be judged by the people upon the results of their efforts to-day.  We, on this side of the House, admittedly, and it may be a weakness in our position, necessarily approach this problem from two aspects and in two frames of mind. Primarily we view the Constitution which we are now discussing as an instrument which, if not actually imposed <i>in toto</i> from without, at least, in certain essential forms was determined by an exterior power.  We feel that the provisions of this enactment which have been so determined are unfortunately considered by the majority of this House to be the essential provisions, and, therefore, we feel that any change which we must make in that Constitution must be a revolutionary change, that we must change it not in its accidentals, but in its essence.  On the other hand, by force of circumstances, we have come here.  We have been compelled to accept in the letter, if not in the spirit, the forms that have been imposed upon us, and we can look upon other provisions in this Constitution in the light of a contract regulating the relations between the effective Executive power in this State and the people whom we represent.  In respect of those particular provisions and in respect of them only, we can place ourselves in the position of representatives of the people who believe in and wish <Col N="869" /> to preserve and to secure not only the national, but the popular liberties.  I would like if we could make that a common ground between ourselves upon these benches and the Deputies in every other section of the House.  I would wish that that principle could be accepted, and that we could, without reservation of any sort, take it that every single Deputy here, even if he does not believe in the wider, the fuller, the wholly unqualified national freedom which we seek, at least believes that every single citizen in this State should be secured in his rights as a man.</P>
      <P>In answer to an interruption the other day, the Ceann Comhairle emphatically declared that this House derives its authority from the people and from no other source whatever. We welcome that pronouncement from the head of this Assembly.  We endorse it, and we will uphold it to the fullest extent of our power.  It is because we believe that all authority is derived from the people that the exercise of authority by this House or by any component of this House, or by any organ in this State, should be always controlled, checked and guided by the effective power of the people, by the will of the people, expressed through the organ of the Constitution, that we are opposing the deletion of Articles 47 and 48 from this Bill.  This House, in the words of the Ceann Comhairle, and I think that we ought to remember them always when we are discussing these fundamental Statutes, derives its authority from the people. The acknowledgment of that principle took a long time to secure, longer here in Ireland, possibly, than in any other land on the globe.  It was secured as a result of suffering through centuries, suffering by generations of the common people, and when the common people secured the almost universal acceptance of that principle, I would ask you to remember how jealous they were of it, how metaculously they set themselves to devise safeguards for it, and how jealous they were, when the need arose, always to assert it.  Many constitutional forms were devised to this end. The operative and essential principle of every one of them was found in the division of authority among the organs of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> The Minister for Justice said that he was a believer in representative government. He asked us did we, on these benches, declare that representative government had broken down.  Let the Minister for Justice read any single modern analysis of modern constitutions, particularly the constitution from which the Constitution of this State derives, the Constitution of Great Britain, and let him answer himself whether or not representative government has broken down.  Every impartial observer who has examined the British Constitution from which, as I said before, this Constitution derives, and which in many respects it resembles, is certain, at any rate, that if representative government has not broken down it is, so far as Great Britain is concerned, in the last stage of degeneration.  When the people secured the acknowledgment of that principle to which I have referred they devised certain machinery whereby it would be made effective, and, as I have said before, they realised, with Hobbes, that freedom is political power divided into small fragments.  Therefore they made certain that no power and no authority should be concentrated in any one organ in the State. In some cases they allotted to the head of the State certain functions; to other sections and classes within the State they allotted certain other functions.</P>
    <P>In some cases these functions were divided between two, three and four assemblies.  In the case of our State, in the case of Great Britain and in the case of the United States the power was divided between the head of the State, an Upper Chamber if you like to call it so, and a Lower Chamber. For years that division of authority was effective, but by the passage of time it has been nullified and the safeguards which were based upon it have, for the most part, disappeared to-day. For years it was effective in Great Britain, and for a long time men looked upon the Government of that country as a model to be imitated and as the finest expression of the principle in practice, but in no other country in the world has the decay of that principle been more rapid and more complete.  Gradually the three separate functions of the head of the State, <Col N="871" /> of the upper or revisory Chamber and of the Parliament, have been usurped by one component.  One hundred years ago England enjoyed what was known as representative or Parliamentary government&mdash;government by a monarch and two Houses of Parliament. Forty or fifty years later that Parliamentary Government had become Cabinet Government, with the Cabinet and the Parliament alternately the important and determining factor in it. The Throne in itself was important, but in relation to the other two factors was comparatively insignificant and ineffective.  To-day the process of evolution or degeneration has gone a step further, and all power and all authority is centred ostensibly in the Cabinet or, more accurately speaking, in a cabal within the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I remarked that our Constitution, deriving as it did from the British Constitution, had certain resemblances to it, and I am emphasising the degeneration and decay which befell the British Constitution, because the fact that our Constitution had to a certain extent to be modelled upon the British Constitution furnished the central problem which the Committee which drafted and considered this Constitution of ours had to solve.  Our Constitution resembles the British Constitution, but there are very striking, very essential and very important differences.  The most important of them are Articles 47 and 48.  Why were those Articles inserted?  The President has stated that they were introduced because they happened at the time to be fashionable Constitutional devices meant to impose upon the people, but never meant to be effective&mdash;meant to attract popular support, but never meant to be effectively used.  Surely the President, when he makes that statement, is not just to two great men who are gone and who cannot rise in this House to vindicate their memory.  The President knew Arthur Griffith longer than I did, possibly longer than most of us in this House, and he knew him better than I did, I daresay, because I only knew him from 1916 until his death.  Can anyone who ever knew that man and who can look back on the years that are gone and feel the prouder for having <Col N="872" /> been associated, however distantly and humbly, with the great work which he did for this people&mdash;can anyone stand up here in this House and sincerely and truthfully declare that he did anything for show, solely with intention to deceive, and that, above all things, in the moulding of this Constitution that he did what he himself, on the very last day on which he recommended the Treaty to the Dáil, declared he never did, whatever else he may have done&mdash;deceive this people? Can anyone say that Arthur Griffith, whom we all knew and whom we all&mdash; no matter how we may have differed from him years ago&mdash;revere and cherish in our hearts, inserted in that Constitution one single provision which he did not feel to be essential, necessary and vital, giving to the people some power which he did not think was in their interest and to their continual welfare to use?  What I have said of Griffith I will say of Michael Collins.  His ways were not mine, but I do believe that, deriving from the people, believing in the people and sincerely desirous of emancipating the people, he, so far as he could within the four corners of the Treaty, forged for the people an instrument which, as he said himself, though it was not freedom, at least gave them the means to achieve freedom.  And these two men, to whose memory so much lip-service has been paid within the last four years, had associated with them in the drafting of this Constitution the keenest intellects in Ireland which they could command.</P>
    <P>If we examine the position in which Collins and Griffith and the members of the Constitution Committee found themselves in the year 1922, we will understand why Articles 47 and 48 were inserted in the Constitution and why, no matter who else may do it in this House, the President and those associated with him who pretend to stand here as the inheritors of the things that Griffith and Collins gave&mdash; at least they, whoever else may do it, should not delete Articles 47 and 48 from the Constitution If they do, they take the very key-stone from that Constitution and assuredly this State which was meant to be a democracy will become an autocracy and the <Col N="873" /> Constitution itself will tumble down in ruin.</P>
    <P>When the Constitution Committee came to examine the position in which they were under the Treaty, they found that, by the Treaty, they were compelled to draft a Constitution modelled more or less upon the British model, a Constitution in which the representative of the King of Great Britain should form at least one component part.  They found that so far as Great Britain is concerned, as I have emphasised, the system of Constitutional checks and balances, which had grown up through the centuries, had broken down completely within the last hundred years and that, so far from that Constitution fulfilling the essential requisite for freedom which Hobbes who examined the position minutely laid down&mdash;that freedom was political power divided into small fragments&mdash; now all political power in Great Britain had become centred in one organ in the State.  It might have been possible to remedy that position if we could take and make again as an actual functioning component in the Government a head of the State who would enjoy the affection and the loyalty of the subjects.  The old system might have been made effective here in Ireland if we could have had, as head of the State, the descendant of a royal line stretching back through the centuries, whose power and importance had waxed with the prosperity and progress of the people.  It might indeed have been possible to remedy that position if we had been able to choose, by public election, as head of the State that citizen whose private merit and public character had secured for him the trust and confidence of the people.  But these essential things were denied to the men who had to draft this Constitution.  Our native thrones were overthrown; our princes were banished, and, as the key-stone of the whole Constitution and the whole Government, we were compelled to instal the representative of a foreign throne who, so far from commanding the respect and affection of the mass of this people, had, at the very best, only secured their passive hatred.</P>
    <P>That was one of the great fundamental <Col N="874" /> difficulties which Griffith, Collins and the Constitution-makers had to overcome.  Sharing that feeling to the fullest, those who made that Constitution determined that the representative of the Crown in Ireland should only be a symbol.  They did not believe, and they did not indeed seek to secure, that such a power as was represented by that symbol would ever be effective in securing the liberty of the people. At the same time they saw the danger of a non-controlled Executive.  They were familiar with, and they feared, the methods which had overcome Parliamentary Government elsewhere, and they wished, therefore, to place in the hands of the people some weapon which would make the Executive at once the instrument of the people's will, and at the same time protect and secure the rights of minorities in this State.  Only that State is free and only that State is democratic, in the true sense of the word, in which the rights, even of the weakest member of the community, are secured against unlawful aggression. Remove Article 47 from the Constitution, and what protection is there for any minority, or any individual, in the country who dares to oppose the power of the Executive?</P>
    <P>That is the argument; that is the reason&mdash;to protect minorities and to secure the rights of the weakest among us&mdash;why Griffith and Collins inserted Article 47 in the Constitution.  I submit that it was a nobler and loftier reason and one more in accord with the true character of these men than the one which President Cosgrave, to his shame, adduced here in this House. I hope that those who are here as Independent representatives, who proclaim that they do not belong to any Party, who stand within the polity of this State as single individuals and alone, will listen to what I am going to say and will ask themselves with me what protection is there, if Article 47 is removed, for any minority, whether cultural, religious, social or industrial, in this State?  Formerly, as I have said, there was a certain protection for every individual in this State, because the Executive power was divided among a number of organs or instruments who had to co-operate in order that the <Col N="875" /> executive power could fully function. To-day all that has disappeared.  All authority is concentrated in the Executive, and, as we here have witnessed from time to time, the Executive is no longer controlled by Parliament.  The Executive is controlled elsewhere.  I do not believe that it is even controlled by the Party.</P>
    <P>The Executive of the present day&mdash;I speak without any particular or special reference to the Executive of this House&mdash;the Executives of most Party machines are controlled by big businesses, by proprietors of one or two companies, by newspapers, the syndicated Press, as Deputy Flinn called it, by Deputies who are not members of the Party proper, but whose votes are essential in order to give the Party a majority which keeps the Executive in office.  We have had instances of the power of that majority in this House.  We have seen a leading article, dictating a certain policy, appearing in the newspapers, and we have seen the Executive Council, pretending to speak in the name of the people and to act in the name of the people, meticulously follow the programme laid down in that newspaper, which, whatever else it was, never was a friend of the Irish people.  The Executive, as we see it to-day, reminds me of one of these automatons, a mechanical chess-player which used to amuse the crowd, a doll which used to take little pieces and move them from square to square, appearing as if of its own initiative to pursue a well-defined plan, while all the time, concealed in the bowels of that effigy, was a hidden hand which moved the pieces and made the effigy posture to its will.</P>
    <P>The parallel I have drawn is not complete, because the effigy only moved to amuse, and therefore, to that extent, possibly, was of benefit to the people, but the automaton Government, controlled by an interested section within the nation, may often operate, not to the amusement, but to the grave detriment and disadvantage of the people as a whole.  Under the present system of degenerate Parliamentary Government there is, I repeat, no security for <Col N="876" /> any individual who dares to oppose the interests, often the selfish and mercenary interests, of the section which, in reality, controls the Government of the day.  At present, so far as we in this State are concerned, so far has Parliamentary Government degenerated that there is no single right of a citizen, whether of liberty honour, property or civic right, secured from the aggression of the Executive, if he dares to oppose it.  I repeat, and I would ask Deputies to dwell upon it, that there is no single right of citizens, whether of liberty, property, or honour, that is secure against infringement or violation on the part of the Executive in pursuance of its personal or even mercenary advantage.  That is a truth which I wish to urge on you.</P>
    <P>That is an argument which I wish to adduce, in answer to the Minister for Justice, for the rejection of this Bill and for the retention of Article 47. That is the reason why Arthur Griffith placed it there, in order that a position which has come about in this State to-day by the failure to recognise the encroachment by the Executive Council on the liberty of the people, might not remain for ever unremedied&mdash;that the people, having awakened to their danger, might have at hand an instrument by which they could secure and work their salvation.  I would like to try and put before you the consideration which I am about to capitulate in order to show you how difficult it often is for minorities to secure their rights, even with a majority thinking that they are acting fairly and not tyrannically.  We, as a minority, operating in this House, when our forces are joined with the Labour Party, present a combination which is possibly the strongest which any Government could face and survive. Two or three votes more or less on some divisions which have taken place in this House, and the effect would be such that the Executive Council could hardly function.  As I said before, we, the coalition of Fianna Fáil and Labour, present.  I believe, the strongest effective minority that could be contemplated, but, as the experience of the last nine months has shown, not even a minority so strong and so constituted as that minority has been, has <Col N="877" /> been able under the present Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was saying, A Chinn Comhairle, that even with the independent co-operation of the Labour Party&mdash;I must be very careful, I must have regard for the susceptibilities of Deputy Anthony even if that regard carries me so far as to make use of such an uncouth expression as independent co-operation&mdash;I hope the Dáil will realise that if the votes of the Deputies who sometimes follow Deputy O'Connell into one lobby are added to the votes of those who always follow Deputy de Valera into the same lobby, that we have the strongest combination of a Parliamentary minority that could be presented.  Yet if such a combination as that, as the history of this session, the records and the experience of this session, have already shown, is powerless against the will of the Executive and that Executive is supported by the unreasoning votes of the majority in this House&mdash;if our position is so powerless, if our rights as a minority are so insecure, that after four hours' discussion in this House a Bill to amend the Constitution in a vital particular can be passed without any further debate under closure, that in order that physical fatigue may coerce us to yield the rights of the people when we can no longer resist the proposition to sit and discuss constitutional amendments from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 8 o'clock the following morning, then I repeat, what hope is there?  What hope is there in this country, under such an Executive, for any other minority, whether it represents wealth, religion, culture or social status, which dares to withstand the power of that Executive Council? What rights, under the present Constitution, have minorities at the present moment?  They have no redress in the Seanad, because the Seanad is powerless against the will of the Executive, and ultimately powerless against the will of this House.  Their only safeguard is a temporary one, that certain Bills, if they are not declared by both Houses to be necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, can be suspended for <Col N="879" /> a period of ninety days, but if those minorities can get the signatures of 75,000 voters in this State under Article 48 to assist them in maintaining their rights they can initiate legislation to repeal the statutes which infringed upon their rights or which treated them unjustly.  Under the operation of Article 48, that legislation is immediately referred to the people as a whole.  In short, by the co-operation or by the co-ordinate operation, if you like, of Articles 47 and 48, there is given to any minority in this State or to any minority in this House&mdash; although the protection may not be the fullest, nevertheless it is within limits a reasonable protection and a reasonable safeguard&mdash;the power at least to refer the legislation in question to the whole people and to give the people&mdash;who, I think, are often moved when they are moved in the mass by a deeper sense of justice and of equity than the Executive of political parties, who are inclined to be guided by considerations of temporary party advantage&mdash;the liberty of exercising their veto, if they so desire, upon legislation which has been held to be unjust or oppressive upon any section of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice cited one or two instances of that.  I do not know, possibly, one which would substantiate my case more fully than that which he referred to as one of the German experiments. As we are aware, two years ago, or possibly less, a proposal that the estates of certain ruling princes in Germany should be confiscated was initiated by a certain section of the people.  One would think that that was a case where mass interest would overcome that sense of justice and right which I believe to be dominant in the majority of any right-thinking people.  Possibly the estates in question had originally belonged to the people.  Possibly some of them may have been confiscated in war. At any rate, one would say that the princes having been dethroned, and since they had been divested of all their executive functions within the State, the means which were given them formerly to maintain their position as heads of the State should now be surrendered to the people.  A very strong case could have been made, and no doubt a very <Col N="880" /> strong case was made, for confiscating the estates of these German princes.  The matter was carried to the people and the great majority of the people took up the position that they did not feel competent to determine this matter in strict accordance with the law or with the fundamental justice of it.  Therefore, they took up the position, which was taken up in this House on a previous occasion by the Ceann Comhairle, that they refused to disturb the status quo.  I submit that the very fact that the great majority of the German people did that, in a matter where it might be held that their own selfish interests dictated that they should vote for the confiscation of these estates, is an instance which justifies the retention of Articles 47 and 48 in this Constitution.</P>

      <P>We are speaking now as a minority in this House.  We are speaking as a minority on behalf of a minority.  I ask all those minority Parties, which now constitute the majority in this House&mdash;those minority Parties, whether they are independent or whether they are allied, whether they are independent or banded together&mdash; not to forget that they too are minorities, even though they be essential for the moment to President Cosgrave's majority, and that what we are demanding for ourselves we are demanding for them also.  Further we ask them to remember that the Party upon whom it is now proposed to impose disabilities and whom it is now desired to deprive of their rights, will not always be the minority in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These precedents which are now being set up are very valuable from another point of view.  When I began I emphasised that throughout these debates we approach this question from two positions and in two minds.  We approach it primarily as a Party which feels that the Constitution must be changed, as I said, not in its accidence, but in its essence.  To maintain the rights of the people to determine their own destiny without let, hindrance or interference by any power, or any throne, or any monarch, except the <Col N="881" /> power of the Irish people, expressed through their duly-elected representatives, and through the head of the State whom they choose for themselves, we who have accepted the constitutional way will be prepared, in order to assert that traditional principle of Irish nationality, if necessary, to take another course.  We approach the question also from another point of view.  We can take the materials which are to our hands in this Constitution.  We might desire to amend it in another way within the Constitution by removing certain Articles from it.  But I ask the people who are now going, by the removal of Articles 47 and 48 from this Constitution, to place the Executive in untrammeled and uncontrolled power within this State, to think of what the position will be if there should come into office, not as the result of the present situation, but as the result of the another election which may be precipiated, other people who, taking hold of and exercising that power which the House now proposes to concentrate, without question or without any possibility of revision or recall, in the hands of the Executive Council, may say: &ldquo;Away with your Constitution; away with the rights of any citizen who dares to withstand the majority in this House; away with the rights of property; away with the rights of religion; away with the ordinary common rights of freemen.</P>

We do not propose to cause him a single uneasy hour after 10.30 if he will enforce upon the President the reasonableness of the argument that men who want sleep cannot possibly discuss the Constitution of the State. I do not want to put anybody's hair on end.  I want you to remember&mdash;I want particularly the Independents in this House to remember the old saw, and it is a good one: &ldquo;What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.&rdquo; The principles for which President Cosgrave and his allies stand will not always be dominant in this House.  The one thing for which our history has been noted has been the resurgence of the national idea, and of the separatist idea, in Irish politics.  Six years ago the Party led by Deputy de Valera, in elections within the Twenty-six Counties, only polled a little over 200,000 votes.  In September last they polled 400,000, almost as many as President Cosgrave's Party.  Inevitably and assuredly another power will come into this House, will sit on President Cosgrave's benches, and will avail themselves, I hope, to the fullest of the precedents which have now been created, so far as certain Articles of this particular Constitution are concerned.  I hope, however, that when they do come, when things which are repugnant to Irish manhood, and are in contravention of the traditional principles of Irish nationality, have been removed from that Constitution, they will set themselves to reinsert within it the provisions and the Articles which Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, I repeat again, and those who drafted this Constitution for them, inserted in it in order to protect the rights of minorities against the wrongful usurpation of power and authority by the Executive Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>An altogether fantastic importance has been ascribed to Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution. They are Articles which were very little discussed before the Constitution was first published.  I have no recollection who was in favour of them.  I do <Col N="883" /> not know how the proposal for the Initiative and the Referendum originated. I do not know who suggested them.  I know that not much importance, at any time, was attached to them.  Attention was concentrated upon quite other Articles, and difficulties in connection with other Articles. When the Constitution was going through the Dáil the discussion that took place upon those two provisions was very little.</P>
      <P>Various speakers have quoted remarks that the late Minister for Justice made in connection with these particular provisions.  I know that the late Minister for Justice, a couple of years before there was any suggestion that the Fianna Fáil Party would come into this House, before there was any suggestion that a petition would be prepared by Fianna Fáil under Article 47, had come to the conclusion that these particular Articles and the powers contained in them should be removed from the Constitution.  These Articles were introduced when we who stood for them&mdash;and that is saying a great deal&mdash; had even less experience and had given even less thought to the problems of government than the Deputies on the opposite Benches now have.  We introduced these particular provisions without any great consideration, without having had experience which might show us what was necessary and what was workable in a constitution.  After a certain amount of experience, we came to the conclusion that these Articles and other Articles were faddist schemes and the Constitution would be better without them.</P>
      <P>We do not believe that these Articles give any security to the people, that they secure the people's rights, or that they are of any importance, as the Minister for Justice said, in a Constitution the principle of which is representative government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Referendum may be all very well for some small communities.  A Referendum might be a very good means of deciding in a country town where and in what position the town pump should be placed, or on what day a market or a fair should be held, but it is certainly not suitable in a community of any size for deciding on any ordinary law.  There <Col N="884" /> might come an occasion when the Legislature would be specially desirous, on something of paramount importance, to consult the people, and the thing might be such that every citizen would have thought about it and become informed upon it, and it might be possible therefore for the people to decide.  But ordinarily, people could not be informed of the merits of laws or the effect of laws, and the submission of matters to the people for decision by a Referendum in a community as numerous as the Irish Free State would be simply like bringing a proposal here to the Dáil and, without any discussion whatever, and without any attempt whatever to make Deputies familiar with its effects and provisions, to take a vote upon it and have it passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The people were not deceived.  We made it quite clear that we regarded the Constitution as imperfect and as likely to require amendment by putting in a provision that for a stated period it might be amended by ordinary legislation.  We were quite aware that we were tyros in this matter, that we had not thought about it sufficiently, and that on the whole the matter of constitutional requirements had not been sufficiently examined and that amendment was likely to be necessary. While on that particular point I might reply to what I think myself was the gist of the argument of Deputy de Valera that changes were now being made and that in a year or in a couple of years the provision enabling the Constitution to be amended by ordinary legislation would lapse and that the main procedure laid down in Article 50 would become operative, and that because of the rigidness of that procedure it would be impossible for a party which had a definite majority support in the country to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not believe that the procedure for amending the Constitution should be so rigid as that.  We believe that the period during which the Constitution can be amended by ordinary legislation ought to be extended, and that, per- <Col N="885" /> haps, even after whatever extended period might be fixed, some new procedure other than that laid down in the Constitution should be devised, some procedure that would make it easier to amend the Constitution than it would be if the main provision of Article 50 came into operation.  We believe that if there is a majority, for instance, in this House desirous of amending the Constitution in a particular way, and if after a general election that same party came in with a majority, then there ought not to be obstacles in the way of that party effecting an amendment of the Constitution.  We do not want a rigid Constitution which cannot be amended, though we think there are arguments in favour of having a procedure for amending the Constitution which makes it somewhat more difficult or at any rate requires greater space of time to elapse than the enactment of ordinary legislation.  I have already dealt with the point of urgency.  The action of Deputy de Valera in attempting to present a petition under Article 48 to this House makes it necessary to do something about it.  I certainly hold it would be quite wrong, and quite unconstitutional in spirit, for us to refuse to receive a petition for whatever reason and let the matter rest.</P>

I accept that entirely and I have no reason to depart from what I said at that particular time.</P>
      <P>The Initiative really gives no powers to the people that they have not where you have a democratic system of election and a wide suffrage.  If there is a democratic system of election, a proper arrangement of constituencies and a wide suffrage, then the people have all the powers that they would have under the Initiative.  There is no use in suggesting that the Initiative or any of these schemes gives more protection to minorities.  There is no protection for minorities, no ultimate protection, except the sense of fair play of the majority.  If you have a majority which wants to persecute, then there will be persecution, unless there is a question of armed resistance, of course, and I am ruling that out for the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>People with a democratic system of election have all the powers that they can have under the Initiative.  Anything that can be done by the Initiative can be done through the election of representatives, and there are things which it would be against the public interest to do over the heads of elected representatives, supposing that the majority of the people could be got to do it.  I take the particular thing that Deputy de Valera had in mind when he raised the question of the Initiative.  I believe that if the people wanted to join issue on the question that is involved in the deletion of Article 17, it would be dangerous to put them in a position of joining issue while there was a majority in Parliament and an Executive <Col N="887" /> supported by that majority which did not wish to join issue.  If issue is to be joined on a thing like that, then the safety and the interests of the country demand that it shall be done when there is an Executive in power and when there is a majority in Parliament that wishes to join issue and to take every step that may be necessary to meet the situation that arises, with the full conviction that they are taking the right course.</P>
      <P>It seems to me there is nothing to be said for the Initiative.  It is not protection for minorities.  It does nothing for the people that cannot be done in another way.  In certain circumstances it might be dangerous.  It is liable to be expensive and to disgust the people with elections.  We know that very few Referenda would make the whole thing farcical.  There would be a very small minority verdict.  We might have things decided by what would be something like one-eight&mdash;a majority which would represent only one-eighth of the electors.  People were influenced by talk about Switzerland, but that country, as the Minister for Justice has pointed out, has a different history, and its circumstances are entirely different, and power is distributed in a different way.  We threw things into our Constitution which were unworkable and unsuitable to our conditions and which are really blemishes in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>I would like to reply to one other point made by Deputy Aiken.  We did not justify the steps that were taken in the Civil War by references to these particular Articles at all.  They were done with reference to the whole principle of majority rule and the democratic system of which it has been pointed out this is no essential part.</P>

      <P>I remember hearing President Cosgrave making the statement that this was a sovereign assembly.  I also remember that he told us that the Constitution was not imposed by force.  Then again I have taken down the exact words of the Minister for Finance.  He said: &ldquo;It is open to us to delete any Article.&rdquo;  Then, on the other hand, the President and, if I recollect rightly the Minister for Lands and Agriculture made the statement that we could change no Article of the Constitution the alteration of which was repugnant to the scheduled Treaty; that anything that could be construed as being opposed to the Treaty could not be permitted. I wonder how the President could make those statements coincide. On the one hand, we are told that we are a sovereign assembly, and, since the Constitution was not imposed by force, but was actually constructed as an instrument with our free will and of malice aforethought, that we can amend or delete any Article of that Constitution.</P>

I want to submit to the President that we have no power to delete Article 48 of the Constitution.  The President mentioned that if there are certain things which would be repugnant to <Col N="889" /> the scheduled Treaty, that those things cannot be done.  That means to say&mdash; we will take it logically&mdash;that the Constitution in whole or in part was based on the Treaty, and, because it was based on the Treaty, there are certain provisions laid down by England whereby we cannot change a certain specified Article of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>No: Article 17; but I am naming two more, Articles 47 and 48, that cannot be changed ordinarily, and I think I have as much right to <Col N="890" /> point out to the House what Articles should, or should not, be changed as the President has.</P>

      <P>We are told that within the ambit of this Constitution we can proceed to our complete independence. We are told, again, that there are certain provisions laid down which cannot be changed, because of the dictation from England.  But I say to the President that there comes dictation from Ireland not to change or delete Articles 47 or 48.  The President talks of the sanctity of honouring our bond.  Now where is the honour or sanctity in deleting the only Articles of the Constitution, probably, which give any power to the people?  Why keep faith with people across the Channel who say, &ldquo;There are certain Articles which cannot be deleted&rdquo;? Why not keep faith with the Irish people and preserve the only Articles in the Constitution which give the minorities a certain amount of power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the President talks of the sanctity of honouring our bond in respect of the Treaty and in regard to our agreement with England, why not keep the agreement with the Irish people?  It is very peculiar that anything that cannot be changed cannot be changed at the dictation of England, but there is no talk of honouring our bond to the Irish people.  I am not going to be out of order in this.  I merely mention this, that there are two Articles of the Treaty which were not honoured and the President is not honouring his bond when he comes in with ten constitutional amendments and in his ten minutes' speech hurls them at our heads here.  I suggest to the President that his political honour in the words of Falstaff is a mere escutcheon&mdash;something to be brought out and paraded when there is any talk about honouring our bond with England.  But the mere escutcheon is quietly pocketed when there is any talk of honouring our bond with the Irish people.  This Article of the Constitution, namely Article 48, was inserted there with a certain purpose in view, after, I presume, calm, cool, deliberate thought, although the Minister for Finance tells us now that it was not <Col N="891" /> considered at all, or that at least it was not considered very much.  He says now that &ldquo;we consider them faddist schemes.&rdquo;  It is wonderful how they included these faddist schemes in this Constitution that we were told for the last two or three years could not be changed by one iota.  Now it can be changed in ten minutes if the President had his way.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this subject the President adopted an attitude that he adopted when he was speaking on the Initiative, at least on the petition, that time he donned the cap and bells and gave us a flippant speech, a speech that was very hard to understand until one came to know the gist of it, and until one could regard it with a certain sense of humour because his attitude on this matter of amending or deleting Articles of the Constitution is worthy of the best efforts of Gilbert and Sullivan.  In order to keep a certain Article of the Constitution there at the dictation of another country the President is going to wipe out at least two Articles and amend several others.  He comes along and breaks a lance on the Constitution and incidentally he breaks the Constitution in ten different pieces; and then, of course, the Minister for Finance or some other Minister will come along like the faithful Sancho Panza and try to patch it up again, sticking the pieces together.  If another country can dictate to us what Articles should or should not be deleted or amended, then there is no justification whatsoever for the President to call this a Sovereign Assembly, although, mind you, it is the best description of this Assembly I have yet heard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will want to beware.  I think the Deputy is completely out of order; on this general question he has made a few remarks, not very many on Articles 47 and 48, but his principal remarks deal with other Articles, not Article 47 or Article 48 at all, and I want to call his attention and the attention of the House to that.</P>

      <P>I was just going to point out that it was a good description, because the Sovereign Assembly has the harp on one side and the King's <Col N="892" /> head on the other side.  The President may at least consider for a moment the fact that when we acted in accordance with that Article 48 we went to a lot of trouble, and got almost 100,000 voters from the highways and byeways to sign a certain petition, and now after all that the President comes along with his ten commandments, one of which is to abolish Article 48 altogether. The President might have considered all the trouble that was gone to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He might have considered all the expense that was gone to in order to try and to act in conformity with that Article of the Constitution which he now proposes to delete.  He might also think of honouring his bond to the Irish people, and that in this Article, which gives the minority power to do certain things in regard to the Constitution, he might consider those people, and their rights as well as he considers the rights of England when they imposed certain restrictions on us in our actions towards the amendment of the Constitution.  He should think of all these things, and when he has thought them out if he can say further that we can change or amend any Article of the Constitution, and if he can also say in the same breath that we cannot amend certain Articles in the Constitution, because the changing of them would be repugnant to the Scheduled Treaty, then the President will have done something that I consider it impossible to expect of the President, that is, to reconcile two totally different and opposite statements and make them coincide.</P>

      <P>I want Deputies to be clear about this.  The Chair is given certain duties under Standing Order 52.  On an amendment, when a motion for the closure is moved on the Second Reading of a Bill and the debate has proceeded in this particular fashion, if the Ceann Comhairle makes up his mind to accept the motion of the closure, and if that motion is put and carried the amendment is then put.  If the claim is made that the main question should then be put, that normally would be accepted.  I am not talking now of this particular Bill.  But as a general rule that would have the effect of preventing, for example, a Deputy whom his own Party might be very anxious to have speak on the main question from speaking on it if he had already spoken on the amendment.  I am suggesting now to put the amendment and to leave the main question open.  On the main question the Opposition Party will be able to choose any member they like to speak even though he has spoken on the amendment.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might make a suggestion to the President that would save a good deal of the time of the House.  I listened rather carefully to a remark made by the Minister for Finance with respect to Article 50.  I would suggest that if there is anything behind that except window-dressing, and if it was seriously intended, and if the President puts on to this set of Bills a Bill indicating what their attitude is in respect to Article 50, and put what the Minister for Finance said in black and white so that we may see it in the form of a Bill, and feel that we are not throwing out certain safeguards without any corresponding thing coming back, then our attitude might be very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it necessary? After all, the reputation of governments the world over depends on the undertakings they give being carried out.  In the first place, I can tell the House that it is now two years since a Committee of the Cabinet considered the Constitution. Their recommendations consisted of quite a number of variations of the Constitution, amongst them Articles 47, 48 and 50.  The difficulty with regard to Article 50 is what was mentioned by the Minister for Finance, that is the question of the best machinery to adopt in lieu of the arrangement which is in <Col N="896" /> the Article, that is whether it should stand for five years or for eight years. There were two proposals under consideration. One was to give an extension of say three or four years, and the other was what the Minister said, which in effect meant that in the event of an amendment of the Constitution being passed in one Parliament and a general election taking place that if the next. Parliament passed the same amendment that would be an amendment of the Constitution.  We quite realise the difficulties of getting a majority of the electorate, which is the form in the Constitution at the moment, for getting an alteration of the Constitution in the period of eight years.  That is one of those matters which so far as putting it down in black and white is concerned does not lend itself so easily to being done at the tail-end of the session. As to the guarantee I unquestionably give the guarantee that it is our intention within a two-year period to extend or amend at any rate that Article of the Constitution, which will not make it necessary for a majority Referendum to take place in order to effect an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>You may amend it for the better or the worse.  We are particularly anxious to see in black and white what the proposed amendment would be.  At this stage we cannot diminish our opposition to any of these Bills on a guarantee of that kind when we do not know the exact terms.  You can very easily replace the Referendum by something which, from our point of view, would be very much worse, and from the point of view of giving the people sovereign rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that it would be our intention to amend Article 50 of the Constitution in a not less favourable aspect than one of these two, that is, we would extend the period for amendment of the Constitution by five years, or, alternatively to that, amend it in the sense I have indicated, that is, an amendment of the Constitution passed in one Parliament would stand over for passage by the next Parliament.</P>

      <P>Who is to judge? Your idea of what is democratic is <Col N="897" /> apparently very different from ours. We have heard people just now contending that we should not leave people to decide major issues.  Apart from other matters it would not be in the interests of the people.  We hold that it would and, therefore, there would be no judge ultimately of what is more or what is less favourable.  We want to judge that matter for ourselves.  The only way in which we can really judge in this case is to have a Bill, and according to the President's own admission the Cabinet Committee considered this matter two years ago, and from the statement which he has made, that they have their minds well clarified in the matter, surely it should be within their power, even in the time that would be occupied here talking overnight, to prepare a Bill embodying what the President has outlined?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to give any guarantee as regards the question of closure.  The question of what is a reasonable time depends upon what individuals think.  All the Chair is asked to do on a particular occasion is to say that the debate has so far progressed that the time has arrived when the House itself might be asked to decide whether the debate should conclude on the particular matter before it.  The decision is taken by the Chair under the provisions of the Standing Orders and the Chair, of course, has not power to prevent anyone asking for the closure.  The Chair need not put the closure question unless it is satisfied that in view of the Standing Order it is proper to allow the House to come to a decision.  As to what Deputy de Valera says about a reasonable time, I do not know what time he means. It would be impossible for the Chair to say that the closure would not be accepted at a particular moment, but if the amendment were now put and the public business resumed the Ceann Comhairle would not accept a motion at once for the closure on the main question.  The Chair might perhaps do that after two or three speeches had been made.  The particular tone here this evening is such that I would prefer if the matter could be decided without that provision.</P>

      <P>Before addressing myself to this Bill, let me say it was refreshing to have the few exchanges of courtesies that took place between the President and the leader of the Opposition. I hope that such nice exchanges will characterise our debates in the next few weeks.  Having said so much, I was rather struck by the fact that this particular Bill has been sandwiched in as a kind of comic interlude between the heavy scenes on the question of the powers of the people.  This Bill does not appear to have very much chance of success.  It got rather a bad reception all round, first of all from the manner in which it was drafted and secondly in its contents.  I find that I cannot compliment the draftsman or those who inspired the Bill.  On the question of the drafting of the Bill, my sympathies are entirely with Deputy de Valera and those on his side of the House, because it is extremely hard for a private member not in the Government Party to produce a Bill which, in all respects, will be in keeping with what should be put before the House.  We spent a great many days and weeks discussing the power of the people and are still doing it on these Constitution Amendment Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the worst measures that ever was introduced to take power from the people was the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, 1926. Listening to the debate on this question, it reminded me of something that happened in another House just thirty years ago.  There was a measure being discussed at that time in the British House of Commons which had for its purpose the abolition of one of the most corrupt systems of local government <Col N="900" /> that ever was known in this or any other country.  I refer to the old Grand Jury system which was undemocratic and corrupt from start to finish.  If there was one Act which the British Government gave us that conferred the benefit of democratic control on the people of this country, it was the Local Government Act of 1898.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate on this Bill, if one closed one's eyes, one would think he was back thirty years ago.  It is an extraordinary thing, in an assembly of Irishmen, conducting Irish affairs, to hear the libels on the Irish people that were perpetrated in this House, as to the manner in which they dealt with local government&mdash;that our public bodies are corrupt from start to finish, and unfitted for the duties of appointing a porter, that they are unfitted to deal with a tender for a bar of soap.  That is the condition that we find our country in now after five or six years of self-government.  Nothing as bad as these arguments was used thirty years ago by those who wished to frustrate the efforts of the British Parliament when they were giving Ireland a Local Government Act.  I have heard people dealing with other measures talk about getting freedom to obtain freedom.  The greatest act of freedom to obtain freedom that this country got was the Local Government Act.  Were it not for that Local Government Act we would not be sitting here.  It gave the people freedom to obtain freedom.  But the people in this country to-day are being told that they are unfitted for freedom and unfitted for local administration.  When this Local Government Act was first passed it was passed with a two-edged idea.  Some people thought that with the granting of local government there would be no such thing as a further effort to secure self-government, and others thought, and thought wrongly, that if local government was given to Ireland the Irish people would make a mess of it in a very short time.  What are the facts?  Up to 1918 local government in Ireland was an example to the world of purity in public administration. I defy contradiction of that. The administration of local government was pure.  What corrupted the <Col N="901" /> purity of local administration?  We must face facts, and when anybody brands the people of Ireland as corrupt we must exactly understand what the justification is for such a stigma being put upon them.  I say that the people who corrupted the Irish people are in this House&mdash;the leader of the Opposition and the President of the State.  There have been a few years of local government in this country when corruption did get in.  Why did it get in?  Because men were elected or selected&mdash;they dare not go forward for election.  Men were selected to act on local boards not because of their administrative capacity, but because they had none.  They were deliberately put in to defy authority because they were unfitted for administration, and it was a very excellent weapon.  Let me compliment both the Leader of the Opposition and the President on the manner in which that weapon was used, but I cannot compliment either of them on the aftermath or reaction that was bound to come from using men to defy authority, and on their saying, when they have got into office, that this country is unfitted for local government. It is corrupt because they put in office men who were bound to bring the country to corruption.  They brand every person in the nation as corrupt because of that system they themselves inaugurated.</P>
    <P>We do not want the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill in the Free State, nor do we want an amending Bill.  What we do want is a Bill that will enable us to trust the people, a Bill that will enable those who are good administrators to come forward. At the moment they will not come forward because of the fear of being branded as corrupt.  If Deputy de Valera wished to do justice to the people he would not have brought in an amending Bill.  There is not a provision in the Bill which does not presuppose that this country is corrupt from start to finish.  He agrees with the Commission, and he agrees that the people are not fit to make appointments. Why are they not fit to make appointments?  I heard the most ridiculous arguments in this House as to the corruption of public bodies.  Deputy <Col N="902" /> Dr. Hennessy said that a man is corrupt because he voted for a doctor who was after getting his diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons, the National University or Trinity College. If he voted for a man who had been given a diploma to practise as a doctor he was corrupt.  He went so far as to suggest that no man is fitted for a position as medical officer in this country who has not done a post-graduate course.  In other words, the diplomas which are given by the College of Surgeons, the National University and Trinity College do not fit men for public appointments.  To perpetrate a bull, no man should be allowed to graduate unless he has done a post-graduate course.  That is about the size of it so far as public appointments are concerned. Deputy Wolfe is one of the awful examples that we have in this House of corruption.</P>

When he had exhausted all the resources of bribery and corruption on the public boards he thought it better to take a position under them.  In both capacities he found himself corrupt.</P>

      <P>I am glad you like it.  I do not want to labour this question too much.  I would suggest that local bodies should not be branded as being corrupt because they may have had on occasions voted in a man not because he was not qualified but because he might by some chance have a thirty-first cousin in the neighbourhood.  That is not a corrupt act.  I think if the Government want to deal with this question as it ought to be dealt with, what they should do is to go back to local government as we had it.  I am not saying one word about local government at the moment, but we should have it back as we had it before the amalgamation of unions and before the other things that were done on a half sheet of paper&mdash;amalgamation schemes <Col N="903" /> run through without any consideration, as a result of which local government is in chaos.</P>
      <P>I believe there is safety in numbers and what is really wrong in the change in local government and what gives colour to the suggestion of corruption is that there are too few members on our local boards.  It is an extraordinary fact&mdash;many people do not know it&mdash;that there is only one local board elected by the people&mdash;the county council.  The membership of the county council varies from 28 to 32.  Other important local boards are manned from the county council and are not elected.  The members of the board of health are not elected as members of that board.  They are nominated by the county councils.  In the past, they were nominated, in most cases, on political issues.  Nearly every county council which nominated a board of health divided itself into political sections and nominated certain politicians to act.  So far as local administration is concerned, that is a misnomer, because members of a board of health, ten in number, dealing with a large county, cannot be in touch with the people.  Consequently it is not local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, I do not for a moment imagine that simply because a civil servant is a civil servant he goes around with a halo.  I do not believe that civil servants are all saints.  I do not believe they are different from any of the rest of us.  They are just as human as any of us, and, if that be so, why should a civil servant, or three civil servants, be so pure as to be above corruption?  We have heard that men elected by the people are supposed to be corrupt.  I cannot understand that argument.  If we bring it down to ourselves, we must be a very corrupt body.  We are elected on a manhood franchise&mdash;the broadest franchise in the world.  We are inferior, in point of election, to those who will be elected on the local boards in a week or two.  They will be elected on a much more restricted franchise&mdash;probably only a 60 per cent. franchise.  They will be elected by ratepayers and householders only, <Col N="904" /> and ratepayers and householders are branded by this House as the only people who cannot elect honest representatives. We, ourselves, are elected by people of 21 years of age, and if the local boards are so bad, God help us, because we must be a great deal worse.  I hope that in a short time local government will be recast from top to bottom, so that we shall have local government in fact, and not only in name; that local bodies will get power, and if they get power the local people will see that the right men are elected.  When there is no power, there are no men going to seek office.  If you give the people the power to administer local affairs, if you see their numbers are much greater than they are at present and not so great as they were in the past, you will find there will be no suggestion of corruption and no necessity for a Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill.  You may safely leave local government to the people, being assured that pure administration will follow.</P>

      <P>I must congratulate Deputy O'Hanlon that although he can boast he came into this House without getting any Republican votes, on the question of local government, at least, he is as sound as any Republican.  I cannot say the same about Deputy Wolfe, either in regard to the Republican support he got before he came into the House or what he did after he came in.  But as he holds himself forth as an awful example of corruption, we can leave him there.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health kept constantly asking for cases of corruption. That, I submit, so far as legislation is concerned, is not the most essential thing.</P>

      <P>The most essential thing is to prove that the system is defective and requires amendment.  I am strongly in favour of local government and of throwing responsibility back upon the people, even in spite of their committing certain sins from time <Col N="905" /> to time, and making certain grave errors.  I think the institutions of democracy are such that they must educate people in the long run, and that it is only by having such institutions and by exercising the people's judgment, from time to time, that they are going to perfect their methods and adjust themselves to governing themselves properly.  By the way, one of the advantages of democratic government is that it magnifies the defects.  If there is corruption there is an outcry, and immediately society remedies itself.  It is only the autocrats and people who wish, for the purpose of political power, to rob the people of their power, who desire to magnify those defects. That is what happens under the Local Government measure to which Deputy O'Hanlon referred and which he condemned very properly.</P>
      <P>I was on the Dublin County Council for some time, and I was also a representative of the Council on the Council of University College, Dublin.  The latter body included a number of highly educated men.  I have nothing to say against either body, but I must frankly admit that if I went out of my way I could criticise the conduct of both bodies in the matter of appointments. Yet, in spite of their sins, I have the same regard for those members who were on the County Council with me as for those who were on the governing body of University College with me. And I say that any radical remedy that would be required for one would be equally required for the other.  Once you throw responsibility upon bodies like that, you must simply allow for a certain amount of error in human nature.  It is impossible to reform everything, as Edmund Burke said a long time ago.  And people who go out for stern morality are often to be greatly suspected.  I do not propose to detain the House very long, because the allegation has been made by members of this House that there is an attempt to obstruct in Private Members' time.  When Deputy O'Kelly spoke here the other day he spoke from the fullness of his experience of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think his condemnation of the attitude of the Minister for Local Government <Col N="906" /> in his &ldquo;stern morality,&rdquo; has been simply overwhelming to an impartially-minded person.  There is a particular example I want to take to show the defectiveness of the present system.</P>
    <P>The Appointments Commissioners appointed a certain person as Borough Surveyor in the County Waterford. The Corporation of Waterford objected very strongly, and said very strong things, which were reported in the Press.  Subsequently, a paper in Waterford, called the &ldquo;Waterford Standard,&rdquo; took up the matter and published a letter from one of those who had been competitors for the position. On the strength of that letter, an action for criminal libel was taken by the Commissioners against the Editor of the &ldquo;Waterford Standard.&rdquo;  That action was tried in Dublin, and the result of it was that the case was dismissed with costs.  In other words, what was said was not considered to be a libel in any sense.  Now, an interesting thing occurred in the course of cross-examination. Mr. O'Hegarty, Commissioner, was being examined.  I am not saying a word of criticism of an individual who cannot defend himself; that, I understand, is the rule.  I am merely quoting.  &ldquo;Mr. O'Hegarty produced and handed to the Judge for inspection the report of the examiners giving the recommendation in respect of the various candidates.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But because he happened to be connected by family associations only with a prominent Republican family in the city of Waterford, apparently his name was on the black list.  It is nonsense to contend that it had any reference to civil misdemeanours in the ordinary sense of the word.  It must have been political misdemeanour that was against the other man, and that the name of this man, because of his political associations, was the only name sent down.  It came out in the course of the cross-examination in this case:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In further reply to counsel the defendant said that the Corporation thought that more than one name should be sent down, and that they should have some discretion in making the appointments.  They asked for a list of further names.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is exactly to meet that that this Bill is introduced.  It may be contended after all, that what I have said is a trifle, but it must be admitted by everyone that you are going to remove every element of suspicion&mdash;I will not say we are going to give an instrument which checks political corruption, or the use of political power at headquarters, <Col N="908" /> if you like&mdash;by the sending down of a panel.  If you send down a panel and send down the qualifications you are allowing the Corporation in this case to exercise full discretion within limits, and they have all the information before them as to the qualification of the individuals.  I think that is the strongest case.  My case is this, that first of all there is at least a very strong indication here of political corruption, and even if there is not, there is an element of suspicion introduced to public life which should be eliminated, and which can be eliminated by this particular Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, when supporting the Bill on last Friday afternoon, made certain statements that I think it is my duty to correct.  In the first place he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I read the speeches that were delivered while this Act was under discussion, and I got the impression that there was prevalent in this House on all sides an opinion that the public life of Ireland was full of corruption.  I repudiate that suggestion.  I do not think it should have been suggested by any Party, whatever Parties they might be, that the public men of Ireland are corrupt, dishonest and inefficient.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a suggestion that ought not to go out, and if Deputy O'Kelly had taken the trouble to read again the speeches delivered on the Second Reading debate in connection with the original Bill he would have found out that he had not read the speeches as carefully as he thought he had read them.  If he had looked up the discussion on the Second Reading Stage he would have found that Deputies like Deputy Gorey and Deputies in this Party, who were here at the time, took strong exception to any insinuations of that kind from the Government Benches or from the Minister who was then in charge of the Bill.  The Minister responsible at the time is now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  If Deputy O'Kelly, for instance, read Deputy Gorey's speech he would have found that Deputy <Col N="909" /> Gorey and all the members of his Party at the time&mdash;of course the Party is now gone and is swallowed up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash; made some of the most violent speeches that were made during the debate on the Second Reading of the original Bill against that suggestion.  So much for that portion of Deputy O'Kelly's statement.</P>
    <P>I now come to another part of Deputy O'Kelly's speech.  He stated that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Committee suggested by Deputy O'Connell was agreed to, an arrangement might be made by which it could be secured that all Parties would be represented on the Local Appointments Commission.  If that were so, then, as long as we had our representative there, we would have to be satisfied always.  We have not a representative there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kelly apparently is ignorant of the fact that the Local Appointments Commission consists of three civil servants and does not consist of the representatives of any political party.  Deputy de Valera in his own Bill accepts the principle of the original Act, namely, that the Civil Service Commissioners should be given power to appoint a Selection Board which would make certain appointments in connection with the local authorities. As far as I know Deputy O'Connell's mind he had no idea that any Committee that was set up under the terms of the amendment would mean the removal of the existing commissioners, and would lead to the setting up of a body consisting purely and simply of the representatives of political parties.  I suggest that any suggestion that the Appointments Commissioners should consist of the nominees of political parties would lead to a worse state of affairs than the existing state of affairs.  As far as I am personally concerned I would not in any circumstances vote for the setting up of Appointments Commissioners, consisting of nominees of existing parties, because I do not believe there would be agreement about any appointment, no matter what the nature of the appointment might be.  So far as I am concerned when asked to express my opinion by <Col N="910" /> voting on the original Bill, I made up my mind that if the local authorities required the best people, and particularly if they were anxious to secure the ablest medical, professional or technical men to do the work required to be done by local authorities, the men to select the most efficient men would be the heads of the professional and technical organisations in this country.  For instance, I cannot accept the view, no matter whom it might be put forward by, that an ordinary county councillor in the country, no matter to what party he belonged and no matter how well educated he might be, would be a better judge of the qualifications of a medical man than the heads of the medical profession in this country.  If the members of the medical profession put at the head of the profession, for instance, a man like Deputy Sir James Craig, I would certainly say that the medical profession should be quite satisfied to leave in his hands, or in the hands of any man like him, the decision, as between two or three men, with regard to which of them was best suited for a particular appointment.</P>
    <P>The whole charge that has been made by the people responsible for the introduction of this Bill against the administration of the original Act is that supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party are not getting a fair deal in the appointments that have been made by the Appointments Commissioners. That is the sum and substance of all the speeches which I have listened to from the Fianna Fáil side on this Bill. If that is the position, I suggest to the Fianna Fáil Party, and to the Government Party as well, that the Commission which Deputy O'Connell proposes in his amendment should be set up, so that the Fianna Fáil Party, or those who have made complaint to that Party in regard to the administration of the Act, should get an opportunity before a Select Committee of proving that charge.  I do not think it is right or proper that the House as a whole should be asked to go into these charges.  The Minister for Local Government has been continuously interrupting during this debate by asking that the charge of corruption be justified.  I say that the Select Committee is the place to justify these <Col N="911" /> charges, and that the people who have made the complaints should be allowed to go before that Committee and justify them, if they can do so.</P>
    <P>So far as local authorities are concerned, I see no differences whatsoever between the representatives of Fianna Fáil and of Cumann na nGaedheal in regard to the attitude adopted by them as members of local authorities in the case of appointments that have been made, at least in my area.  I have before me a case I got some time ago, where a minor appointment was being made by the Leix County Council in my constituency.  The County Council asked the Local Government Department to lay down regulations, with regard to subjects and other matters, for an examination.  This examination was held under the supervision of a representative of the Department. Eventually the result was announced, that so-and-so was No. 1, and giving the names of 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.  A young man who passed the matriculation examination was placed first, and rightly so; he took a very high percentage of marks in Irish as well as in other subjects.  What happened?  An individual who was placed fifth on the list was elected by the County Council against this young man who obtained first place, and representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Leix County Council, as well as representatives of Cumann na nGaedheal and other Parties, voted for No. 5 instead of for No. 1.  I mention that to show that if the Fianna Fáil Party was in power tomorrow and if they had a Civil Service Selection Board, probably the same charge would be made by the official Opposition against them as these charges that they are now making against the Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister has power of sanctioning or non-sanctioning, but in the case of a qualifying examination such as that, he has no power to force the local body to appoint a particular person, and in so far as withholding sanction is concerned, where it has been useful in making them appoint the first person in a case like that, sanction has been withheld. But there is a point in connection with appointments made in this particular way beyond which the Minister has no power and has to give in to the local authority.</P>

      <P>In this case one thing happened which the Local Government Department might have put right.  In the usual method of examination the papers are handed out with numbers on them, but strange to say, in this case the names and addresses of the candidates were allowed to appear, so that the examiner, when he got the papers&mdash;and I believe the examiner in this case was teaching the successful candidate Irish&mdash;of course, knew who his friend was.  The Local Government Department might have put things right, as far as that was concerned at any rate.</P>

The experience of the Local Government Department has been such that they completely washed their hands of these examinations.</P>

It was the case <Col N="913" /> of the person with the biggest pull.  I do not make the charge that there was bribery.  Of course, there appears to be a misunderstanding as to what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;corruption!&rdquo; The point I want to make is that the Fianna Fáil representatives were pulled as well as the Cumann na nGaedheal representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly happened, in this case at any rate, and the poor man's son would have very little chance between the two of them.  Deputy de Valera, when I was first speaking, appeared to deny that Deputy O'Kelly and his supporters had made the charge that their political supporters were being prejudiced by reason of the administration of this Act.  Deputy O'Kelly used the words &ldquo;the Republicans have not got a fair do.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; even is not properly understood by me in this matter, so that I do not know exactly on whose behalf he makes that charge.  I took particular note of the words that Deputy O'Kelly used, because I recollect that I heard him delivering that speech, which lasted from twenty minutes past twelve until two o'clock, and that he had not carefully studied all the speeches on the original Act, and he was not even well acquainted with the contents of the Bill which he was himself supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only concerned with one thing in this particular case, and that is this: What is the best way of getting for the local authorities, or the ratepayers, the most efficient officials to administer the affairs of the local authorities?  It all boils down to this, as far as I am concerned: The principal officials of local authorities consist, as far as I know, of men who have, or should have, professional or technical qualifications. Professional and technical men in this country, including the legal side, have very powerful organisations, much more powerful when they act on behalf of their professions than any trade union.  They have officers whom they elect to certain positions from year to year.  I contend, and nobody is going to change my mind on this matter, that <Col N="914" /> the heads of the professional and technical organisations of this country are far better judges of the ability and the qualifications of their own members than any member of a county council that I know of.  For that reason I am not going to vote for or support any amendment to the original Act which would deny these men the right to make these appointments in the interests of the ratepayers.  I think the Appointments Commissioners need certainly not be given the power to make every appointment.  However, I quoted one case that I know of, the case of a minor appointment, where the local pull went against merit and ability, and so far as I am concerned I am not prepared, as I say, to accept the charge, unless and until it is proved, that political prejudice is operating in the administration of the Act.  If it is, and if that charge is being made, there is no better way of dealing with it than by asking the people who are bringing in this amending Bill to support the amendment moved by Deputy O'Connell, to have a Select Committee set up and to bring before it the people who believe these charges and who believe they can justify them, to call for papers, persons and records from the Commissioners there and then, and only by this means justify the charges that have been made, thereby making a case for the amending Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no interest whatever in this Bill. I believe that this is a thoroughly dishonest Bill, and the people responsible for it know it.  But I have a certain interest in the speeches that were made.  I do not agree with Deputy Davin that the Minister for Local Government was not entitled to ask for specific charges of corruption.  I would agree with him but for certain circumstances.  I do think if a committee is set up that that is the place to bring forward charges in regard to corruption.  But what Deputy Davin has forgotten is that Deputy de Valera, in the most specific way, stated that there was corruption and that certain members of his party would give specific examples of it.  In the most specific way he stated that.</P>

      <P>The talk about corruption which formerly was fairly frequent with respect to local bodies is now turned on to the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, of course, does not directly charge the Local Appointments Commissioners with corruption but he says that other people do.  That is a typical statement.  He never makes a direct charge but merely suggests. That has been his technique for the last five years.  Here is a specific example.  It is very useful.  If it is proved, he can father it.  If it is not proved, he can deny it.  The old story. &ldquo;I am not going into details.&rdquo;  In other words, he was not going to justify what other people said.  &ldquo;I am not going into details as to whether there is any justification for that or not.&rdquo;  Of course not.  He leaves other people to do that.  &ldquo;Other Deputies will be speaking and they will probably refer to certain appointments.&rdquo; I am willing to admit to the Dáil for what it is worth that he has covered himself fairly well.  He is a good judge.  This is his technique.  He has left a way out, a back door; but he has left it open and to any one who knows anything about plain English and who is not a pettifogger that is <Col N="916" /> an attempt to suggest that the Appointments Commissioners are corrupt, an attempt to indicate that certain Deputies will give examples of corruption.</P>

      <P>I hope you, sir, will give me as much liberty as you gave to the other side.  I listened to the speech of Deputy Ward, a member of a party that have been talking Republicanism all their lives.  Deputy Little talked about &ldquo;We, Republicans.&rdquo; What was the whole theme of Deputy Ward's speech?  It was that a man should not be appointed because he was not of a certain religion. He did not say it.  He never would.  It was merely a suggestion.  I believe, but I hate to quote it in present company, that somebody said that the word &ldquo;Catholic,&rdquo;&ldquo;Protestant,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Presbyterian&rdquo; should be forgotten in the one word &ldquo;Irishman.&rdquo;  That is a doctrine to which I give allegiance.  We on these benches do give allegiance to it. When it comes to making a temporary point, when there is a temporary advantage to be taken, when it suits the mood of the moment and suits the game which Deputies opposite are playing, it is all forgotten by these Republicans.  We will leave it so.  It was the speech of a fourth-rate dispensary doctor who had to bring in religion and social pull.</P>

I have not said that Deputy Ward is a fourth-rate dispensary doctor, nor do I suggest it, but I say that that is the sort of argument that would be required to justify the appointment of a fourth-rate dispensary doctor.  What is the whole point of this Bill?  It is to get the third best. To rule out the first and the second best.  The principle behind this Bill is the point of view that you would expect from a man who cannot get a job on his merits, and who must push into service in order to get a job as a dispensary doctor or some other position every little influence&mdash;religion, family pull, influence with the local bodies, and so on.  Any way, I hope that I will never again hear a speech from a professional man like that which I heard from Deputy Dr. Ward on this subject. Of course, Deputy Jasper Wolfe stated the position absolutely correctly, as every Deputy who knows anything about the country realises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not get the point. Deputy Wolfe stated the position quite correctly.  Deputy Little said that he was a member of the Dublin County Council, and he never knew of any corruption there.  Of course, Deputy Little is a babe in the wood and nobody should take him seriously.  &ldquo;Corruption&rdquo; is a word with a rather loose meaning. Somebody said that he thought the least objectionable form of corruption was taking money.  I do not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many forms of corruption&mdash;local pull.  It is very hard to resist it.  I would find it very hard to resist it if I were a county councillor and there is no Deputy on the opposite side who would not find it hard to resist <Col N="919" /> it if he were only honest enough to admit it.  If there are three or four persons, all of whom are qualified, it is very hard not to take into account the family history&mdash;the fact that their fathers had given service to the poor of the district, that they are entitled to some consideration, and a hundred and one other circumstances which will suggest themselves to anybody who faces the problem fairly.  I would not call that corruption but if you like call it corruption.  Call it corruption to allow yourselves to be influenced by the family history of a person, by the fact that he is a decent, hard-working man, even though he has not a tremendous amount of brains or even though his qualifications are not high.  Let us call that corruption if you like.  I use the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; because it has been bandied about the Dáil, because it is connoted by the words &ldquo;undue influence.&rdquo; We know we must all of us in the nature of things be influenced by that. You may take it that a very good case, even an honest case, can be put up for that but that case has not been put up. On the one side we have had the simple proposition that the best man regardless of any considerations should get the job. Of course you may say that that is not happening.  You may say that the machinery is not right for doing that but that at any rate is the principle behind our Act&mdash;that the best man should get the job.</P>
    <P>I could understand Deputies who are serious about this matter saying &ldquo;Well no, there are cases where you should not give the best man the position, there should be a preference.&rdquo;  You could even say that there is a good case for a preference.  You could say that you should give a certain preference as against technical qualifications.  You could further say that you are giving a preference to a man who has practised with his father for 20 years and that that should be taken into account.  That could be argued but what are you doing here?  You are simply proposing a Bill which is based on this principle&mdash;that the local bodies should be allowed to appoint the third man rather than the first, if they wish to do so.  There is no principle behind that Bill.  That Bill was introduced with a view to the <Col N="920" /> pending elections.  They thought it would be a good thing for the present elections and it was introduced for no other purpose.  I remember, though I have not the record and I have not a very long memory, that in 1921&mdash;I was actually a T.D. in 1921&mdash;the principle was proposed.  I was not as ingenuous as other Republican Deputies at that time and I remember that one of the things we looked forward to was the day when we could pass an Act like ours to insure that we would get away from local wire-pulling and appoint the best man, and when we could, so to speak, administer a sort of Spartan discipline in all these matters throughout the country.  All that is forgotten in the latter day so-called Republicanism for the sake of getting a temporary advantage.  I said that Deputy Little was a baby in this respect but he is learning.  He is not as ingenuous as he looks.  He started off by telling us that the county councils were honest.  He talked of the seven just men and said that the county council of which he was a member was absolutely the last word in altruism and upright administration. That is what he suggested to me.</P>

      <P>That is what he said, and he does not deny it.  He started off with that.  That is the sort of speech that one would expect from a person who is 15 or 16 years of age and who had been reading &ldquo;Speeches from the Dock&rdquo; for the first time, but you would not expect it from a T.D. like Deputy Little, who ought to have seen a little life.  He went on from that and he quoted from a report of a case tried recently, and he pointed out that the judge had asked what was the meaning of a black list.  He conveniently&mdash;and I was watching him carefully at the time to see the point and I could see him&mdash; ignored an exclamation from Deputy Wolfe by way of an interruption.  Deputy Wolfe said: &ldquo;Tell the whole story.&rdquo;  He did not hear it; he quoted away, and he proceeded to make a point which he knew to be quite wrong. He proceeded to make the point that inquiries were made as to whether this man was on the black list.  &ldquo;We must <Col N="921" /> assume,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the others were.&rdquo;  We must assume because there was no note opposite the names of the others that they all were.  In other words, that they were all Republicans &mdash;new variety, of course.  The Deputy knew perfectly well that that was completely disingenuous, and that was a completely wrong point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You went on to say that with regard to the others: &ldquo;We must assume that as there was no note opposite their names they were on the black list.&rdquo;  You said that distinctly.  Of course he knows it now, because he sees the point.  You know that you said it, and you tried to leave the House under the impression that this black list was some black list of so-called Republicans, and that five or six people had been ruled out because they were Republicans.  The Deputy did not attempt to define the word Republican &mdash;&ldquo;because they were Republicans,&rdquo; whatever that means.  The Deputy knows that the man whose name was sent down was first on the list.  There was no point in making inquiries about persons who were not going to be appointed. He knew that perfectly well. He is not as innocent as he looks.  Of course it was good enough to justify Deputy de Valera's point about corruption, or his own suggestion about corruption.  Deputy Little was put up to suggest that these five persons were found to be Republicans, or something like that, on this black list, and that is the reason that they were not appointed. If there was any doubt&mdash;I was looking at the incident&mdash;Deputy Jasper Wolfe made it clear.  He said: &ldquo;Quote the whole story.  Tell the Dáil that the man opposite whose name the note appears was the man who is getting the position.&rdquo;  No, he would not explain that.  The Deputy knows that there is no point whatever in making <Col N="922" /> inquiries about persons who are not going to be appointed, but equally, Deputies will know that it is perfectly right, in cases like that, to see whether there was anything against a man in the past&mdash;not that he is a Republican&mdash;but in the case of a professional man, he may have been dismissed in the past for incompetence of any sort, for negligence or for any sort of misdemeanour. These things should be inquired into.  A man may pass an examination and get high marks and be the best man for the position, but the Local Appointments Commissioners would be neglecting their duty if they did not inquire into the past of this man and see whether at any time he had been guilty of a misdemeanour or neglect of duty.</P>
      <P>Why did not the Deputy explain that?  Simply because Deputy de Valera suggested at the beginning&mdash;a suggestion which he has been running from ever since&mdash;that there was corruption. That suggestion had to be justified, and that is the sort of justification you have got.  I ask the Dáil to throw out the Bill as quickly as possible and give it the fate it deserves.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture said that this Bill was intended to get third-rate or fourth-rate dispensary doctors appointed.  That was, in effect, the meaning of the Bill, he said.  When a dispensary appointment is vacant there is no shortage of applications.  If thirty or forty qualified doctors apply for a position and three names are sent down, I do not think the Minister can say that a third or fourth-rate doctor can be appointed.  The Selection Boards working under the Appointments Commissioners have never told us what is their standard of marking.  Deputy Sir James Craig said that there should be some definite standard of marking. Take, for instance, the case of medical men qualified, one in the National University, one in Trinity College, and one in the College of Surgeons.  What we want to know is, if the qualifications of the College of Surgeons, the qualifications of the National University, and the qualifications of Trinity College are treated on the same basis by the Selection Boards?  We also want to know what marks are given to the D.P.H., and what marks to other degrees, such as B.A. or B.Sc.  If there are marks for a B.A. degree in philosophy and ethics, what value is such a degree to a man who has to go to the country to a dispensary practice? If marks are given for the B.A., would not, say, the diploma of a College of Irish be equally entitled to be recognised?  It would show educational training in languages equal to that shown by the B.A. in modern languages or ethics or philosophy.   The Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been informed, and I believe it is true, that medical men who have some experience, and who contemplate going forward for local vacancies, have been taking out post-graduate courses and doing everything towards improving their qualifications in the knowledge and belief <Col N="924" /> that that would improve their chances of appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If a post-graduate course for medical men is a sine qua non for appointment to a better position, what about the poor unfortunate medical man in the dispensary service in the country?  His only chance of promotion is within the four corners of his own county under Section 5 of the original Act.  If he seeks to get a better appointment outside his own county, he cannot get it, because he cannot take the post-graduate course.  A dispensary doctor is entitled to four weeks' holiday in the year.  We hear a lot of talk about holidays for the Dáil and for every type of civil servant and everybody else. But the man who is working for forty-eight weeks of the year is supposed, if he wants to get further promotion, to take his post-graduate course during his four weeks' holidays.  If the Minister for Local Government is in earnest about this, he should do what the medical profession have been agitating for for years, and grant men in the dispensary service special holidays to take a post-graduate course, if they so desire. That is a concession which should be granted to them, because, as far as the original Act is concerned, they can never get any further in the service unless they take this post-graduate course.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter entirely.  Assuming that there are facilities for a post-graduate course, and that dispensary doctors can be transferred from one county to another, does the Deputy suggest that the county council or the county board of health, say, in Cork, where an appointment is to be made, is going to judge between the comparative merits of a dispensary doctor from Roscommon, a dispensary doctor from Donegal, and a dispensary doctor from Cavan, who want to be transferred on promotion to Cork?</P>

      <P>There is nothing in the Bill, but under the present system a man in the dispensary service has no chance of getting his name sent to the local authority if he applies to the Local Appointments Commission, because he cannot take out this post-graduate course.  He has been trained in the hard school of experience.  We want to know from the Selection Boards if the hard school of experience gets any credit.  I submit that one or two years in the dispensary service, a training in the school of experience, is as good as all the post-graduate courses that could be taken out within twelve months.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a man can show he has six months' experience in a clinical hospital as a house-surgeon or physician and, in addition, if he took out a post-graduate degree as Master of Surgery, M.D., or one of the fellowships of the Royal Colleges....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A Fellowship of one of the Royal Colleges to go into the dispensary service at a salary of £200!</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To get these things meant a good deal of time and cost to him, but it meant that certainly he was going to be appointed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are told that the poor man's son for the first time gets an equal chance under this Bill.  And yet Deputy Hennessy, who has a wide knowledge of these things, tells us that it meant a good deal of time and cost to him, but that it meant that he certainly was going to be appointed.  I wonder does the House realise what it means to get a degree such as Master of Surgery, M.D., or one of the Fellowships of the Royal Colleges.  A Fellowship of the College of Surgeons, for instance, is the blue ribbon of surgery in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An M.D. of one of the Irish Universities is the blue ribbon of medicine, and Master of Surgery is a degree on the same plane, perhaps, as one of the Fellowships.  Yet, the poor man's son <Col N="926" /> must sit down after he is qualified and study for three or four years more to get one of those Degrees or Fellowships. Then, we are told, he is certain to be appointed.  But I submit he will not be a very poor man's son if he can sit down and do a post-graduate course and study for at least three years after he has been qualified.  The poor man's son, as I know him, would have to work after being qualified, and if he goes down the country the moment he gets the chance he will work, and he is going to get no credit whatever for experience. He has to come up and take a post-graduate course, or take one of these Degrees.  There are hundreds of excellent men in the Dispensary service who are precluded from securing better appointments because they cannot get these Degrees.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health should make arrangements whereby these men would be enabled to take these courses, and secure these Degrees if necessary for appointments.  I submit that the Diploma of Public Health is an excellent Degree in itself, and it has been used as far as I can see as practically a necessary qualification for appointment. At least a good many of the people appointed recently have the D.P.H. degree.  It is an excellent degree for a man who is going to be appointed a County Medical Officer of Health, but as a man practising in the Dispensary Service myself I cannot see how it is absolutely essential for an ordinary man in Dispensary practice to have the D.P.H.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Sir James Craig in what he says that one year as a house surgeon, for instance, is more important. One year's training in the school of experience in the Dispensary Service is more important than a Diploma of Public Health.  A doctor in the ordinary dispensary service under the Public Health has no work that would take a doctor to do.  He has simply to act on a report of a sanitary sub-officer. He has to recommend that a house here and there be whitewashed or that a manure heap should be removed.  He does not need a Diploma in Public Health in a case of that kind.  What he needs is commonsense.</P>
    <P>In answer to the point made by the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="927" /> Public Health, I do not stand, if you like, for the Boards of Health making appointments direct.  We do not ask that in this Bill.  But we ask the Appointments Commission to send three names to the Board of Health.  If the appointment is to be made, for instance, in the premier County of Cork it is not absolutely essential that a Corkman should be appointed.  There might be one hundred and fifty men on the service at present that would take promotion, even to Cork.  What we would like to know is that a man who has five years' service, or a man who has ten years' service or another man fifteen years' service, when he comes before the Selection Board, will get credit for that service.  Personally, I think that if a man with ten or fifteen years' service and experience in the same kind of work is seeking an appointment that experience should count for a lot.</P>

      <P>In order to be clear, I want to submit to the Deputy that he is not dealing with the point of promotion.  The Deputy is apparently dealing with new appointments, because if he considers that he is dealing with the point of promotion I would refer him to section 6 of this Bill which deals with vacancies for professional and technical officers.  The interpretation put upon that is that the local body would select a man for promotion whether in his own county or some other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish just to give a few instances of what I think were rather unfair appointments made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Wexford County Board of Health for some time had a scheme.  They appointed a man to act as ophthalmic surgeon to their <Col N="928" /> county hospital.  For a couple of years he was acting on a temporary basis and the position was this, that his work was giving such satisfaction that they made up their minds to make it a permanent appointment.  When they came to that conclusion they found that the case would have to come before the Local Appointments Commission.  This man was brought before the Local Appointments Commissioners as well as others.  It was suggested here by some speakers, I do not know by whom, that the examining body, the Selection Board, were not acquainted as a rule with the people who came before them.  In this case they were very well acquainted with some of those who came before them, with the result that the man who had been doing the work temporarily for two years was turned down in favour of a man from Dublin.  Now this Wexford doctor was in the habit of attending that hospital every morning.  He had done every operation that a man in his position would be expected to do, such as removing cataract, obstruction of strabismus, enucliation and lid operations. He had of course after operations of that sort to dress the eyes of the people on whom he had operated and he was prepared to go on with that.  He was prepared to call every day at the hospital whereas the man now appointed is only prepared, if he gets the appointment&mdash;that is so far as the Board of Health know&mdash;to come down once a week, on Saturdays.  If a person has anything wrong with his eye he will have to come before this Dublin doctor on a certain Saturday. If an operation is necessary he will have to come back the following Saturday, and if an operation has been performed the patient will, under present arrangements, at any rate, have to remain bandaged as that man leaves him until the following Saturday.  It may be held, perhaps, that the Wexford doctor did not have the proper qualifications. The Wexford doctor was qualified in September, 1924, and attended the post-graduate course at the Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin for three months.  In May, 1925, he attended a further post-graduate course and obtained a certificate there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1927 he attended a full three-months' <Col N="929" /> post-graduate course in Paris. Again this year, 1928, he attended a short post-graduate course in the Royal Eye and Ear Hospital, London.  In addition to that, as I have said, he had been actually doing work in this Hospital for two years, had given every satisfaction, and had performed with success any operation that he might have been called upon to perform in that Hospital.  He was turned down in favour of a man who was well acquainted with the Selection Board&mdash; not the Appointment Board, but the Selection Board.  I do not know who was first on the list, but at any rate this Wexford doctor was turned down.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen to this man? He has not been yet agreed to by the Wexford County Board of Health.  If he were agreed to he would go down every Saturday only, and it would put the people to great inconvenience.  In addition to that, it would cost him somewhere about 36/- to go down and back on the train, and it is to be presumed that he might spend the other 4/- which he would have left on a meal. He would have nothing left, really, and the result would probably be that after six months or so when he had been working in this place, an application would come for an increase, which no decent Board of Public Health could refuse under the circumstances.  This man is in all probability accepting the appointment for £100 a year, knowing well he cannot do it for the money, whereas the Wexford doctor was quite prepared to do it, and give service every day if necessary, and as good service, I believe, as the other could give.</P>
    <P>There is a second case.  There is another man here and it would be no harm here to give his qualifications.  Starting in the Junior Grade he got a prize in mathematics; in the Middle Grade an exhibition in mathematics; Senior Grade, prize in mathematics, Latin, Irish and English; first place in arithmetic; high marks in English, and honours in geometry.  At the University College, Dublin, first place in the County Council Scholarships in the County Limerick, and a University entrance scholarship. In the Faculty of Engineering he had honours in first engineering; honours <Col N="930" /> in final B.E., and exhibition and first place in the final B.E. degree.  In the B.Sc. course, honours in B.Sc. degree, in mathematics, physics and geology. Irish language&mdash;fluent Irish speaker; gave all holidays to Irish one session at Carrigaholt, and four at Ring Irish College, getting the full teaching certificate in Irish language at Ring College. Also, the higher diploma in education in the National University.</P>
    <P>After going through these various courses he spent a year studying for the M.Sc. degree, but interrupted his studies towards the end to take up an appointment in Scotland.  While in Scotland he applied for a certain position under the Limerick County Council, the position of Assistant Surveyor. This was about the time that the Principal Act was coming into force.  The Limerick County Council appointed this man, but by the time his appointment had been made the Act came into force, and all appointments were again advertised.  He was turned down for a man with a pass degree.</P>

      <P>Both sides were going to get closer to defining what their differences were and upon what grounds there might be a basis of agreement.  Frankly, it must be confessed that the average man feels that he has been fooled to such an extent about Articles 47 and 48 that he is not in a mood for accepting mere statements across the House by way of guarantee. It would take a considerable amount of reassuring to make us feel that the offers made by President Cosgrave and the Minister for Finance were not merely an attempt at sending <Col N="931" /> the fool further.  I regret this myself. I think it is one of the most tragic results of what has gone before that there is not some sort of a basic understanding upon real national principles.  I do not believe this country is going to go ahead until it does what every other country does, until it has certain basic agreement upon questions of, for instance, progress towards complete unity and freedom in the country. These, everybody will admit, are the real interests in Irish life, and they cannot be dismissed as mere matters of formula or abstract questions any more than title to property can be dismissed as an abstract question when the people who hold the title to property are inflicting certain injuries upon the tenants who happen to be occupiers of that property.  In national life the question of principles and the question of individual interests are absolutely intertwined, and to such an extent as to lead to the old saying that patriotism is enlightened selfishness.  It is the selfishness of the whole community that realises that by standing together on the big principles of national independence and unity they are really serving their own purpose best as individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which we have been treated reminds one very much of a story which Standish O'Grady wrote at one time.  He said he pictured before him two persons playing a game of chess, playing it earnestly at a table.  One of the players was an Irish leader at any time in Irish history.  He was symbolic.  He played the game with this other man, and as the game went on it became clearer and clearer that the Irish leader was winning, and when the game was very near the end a figure stepped out from behind a curtain and swept away the chess-board.  That old analogy applies very well to the present situation and to the sweeping away of the Articles 47 and 48 immediately they cease to be an adornment and are being put to the use of making a step towards the freedom of this country.  The President admitted as much.  He blamed Deputy de Valera for having obliged his Ministry by presenting the petition&mdash;obliged him to remove these Articles.  So long as <Col N="932" /> these were ornaments and were not put to use they could remain there for ever.  But the minute they became an instrument in making a step further in the direction of the freedom of the country, then the chess-board had to be swept away.  We were winning the game, and the game could not be allowed to continue.  In that atmosphere it is very hard to see how any promise or any pledge can be accepted from the people who had swept away the chess-board.  When Republicans were at war every effort was made by high dignitaries of the Church, by spokesmen of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and others trying to induce Republicans, saying that if they would only lay down their guns and have recourse to the machinery of the Constitution that they would get an opportunity of freeing their country step by step.  The analogy of the valve and the trap has been used.  There is, I believe, a system by which that trap is used in countries where there is big game.  They put a bleating lamb or a goat inside the palisade and they leave the door open until the lion or the tiger comes inside, and then they close the door; they have a convenient trap-door by which they let out the bleating lamb or goat.  Now the trap-door is being opened and the bleating lambs of Article 47 and Article 48 are being let out by the trap-door because they think they have trapped the wild beast of Republicanism in their constitutional trap.  Well, if they think that a Government or a country can be run upon these tricks they are making very grave mistakes.  Even if nothing else happens, a Ministry in this country which thinks it is going to depend upon public opinion after doing that sort of thing is making a great mistake, because the sheer contempt which any Irish public will have for tricks like that will mean the end of that Government in a very short time.  It was put very strongly by the Minister for Justice that the only object of our using Articles 47 and 48 was to wreck the Constitution.  Well, let us look at it from his point of view.  Supposing he does regard the removal of Article 17 of the Constitution as a wrecking of the Constitution&mdash;which, of course, I submit is nonsense&mdash;but suppose he <Col N="933" /> thinks that, is it not time enough to say good-morning to the devil when he meets him?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mark Antony must not expect the same eloquence from me as from himself.  But to say that because one Article of the Constitution may be used for some purpose which a particular party does not like, that therefore that Article is to go, is simply an exercise of tyranny.  To say that because the Minister for Justice does not like the idea of getting rid of Article 17 of the Constitution, that therefore Articles 47 and 48 must go, is simply to say that we are going to stop any exercise of judgment by the Irish people for fear that they may exercise that upon the particular matter which we object to.  The amendment has nothing in it as to the wrecking of the Constitution.  Its terms are:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill should not be further considered, as it is the opinion of the Dáil that Article 47 and 48 should be retained until the people by direct vote have expressed their will on the question of deletion.&rdquo;  That I submit is fundamental to any constitution&mdash;that where a question involving the powers of the people is at stake, that the people should be directly consulted on that particular issue.  As has already been pointed out, the Referendum is not a protection for the minority.  It is a protection for the people.  You could not get a better example of a place where it should be used than here.  When people argue that other countries have not got a Referendum and that in some countries it has not been altogether a success, that has no bearing upon the Irish situation at all.  The fact is that the powers are here.  The rights of the people have been, I would not say established, because the people's rights are always established, but, they are here given an opportunity of expression, and this opportunity of expression is suddenly and very rapidly swept away from them.  The Referendum, as it is here in the Constitution adumbrated, because that is all it is, the full machinery is not there, may be a good thing or may not be a good thing. It is only by trying whether it suits <Col N="934" /> Irish conditions or not that we are going to be fully convinced whether it is good or not, and the argument is put forward that if in large countries it has not been a success, it will not be a success here.  That may be so.  We are not a large country.  We are a very small country, and I think in point of population we are not as large a country as Switzerland.  The argument is put forward that in Switzerland you have direct government by the cantons and in the communes and you have the cantonal system as well.  I for one would welcome a development in the direction of direct government.  I think that whatever may be said for other forms of government, representative government as exemplified in England to-day is a wash-out.  The whole Party system becomes either a corrupted force, as it is in England, of gain between two or three parties, or else supporting all the time a plutocracy against the ordinary people, and that is what it is in England; or else, on the other hand, it becomes something in the nature of a sort of civil war as in Ireland, because there is no fundamental understanding upon big national issues. Therefore the arguments put forward by the Minister for Justice carry, I must say, very little weight with me, because I think the more we get back to the people, the more we educate the people through direct government if necessary on a communal system such as exists in Switzerland, and even with the cantons, the more I would welcome it for one.</P>
      <P>There are two big difficulties raised by this Bill in connection with Article 50 of the Constitution.  That Article states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Amendments of this Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty may be made by the Oireachtas, but no such amendment, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, after the expiration of a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall become law, unless the same shall, after it has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the said two Houses of the Oireachtas, have been submitted to a Referendum of the people,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> Mark those words, &ldquo;submitted to a Referendum of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and unless a majority of the voters on the register shall have recorded their votes on such Referendum, and either the votes of a majority of the voters on the register, or two-thirds of the votes recorded, shall have been cast in favour of such amendment. Any such amendment may be made within the said period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation and as such shall be subject to the provisions of Article 47 hereof.</P>
    <P>Notice that the terms of this Bill merely repeal the last two lines of that Article, namely: &ldquo;and as such shall be subject to the provisions of Article 47 hereof.&rdquo;  It does not eliminate the element of the Referendum higher up in this Article, so that you will be in the extraordinary position if you want to change the Constitution afterwards, of having to create the Referendum for the purpose, or else of saying that it is impossible to change the Constitution because the Referendum has been ruled out.  The effect of that would also be that, if we happened to come into power within the next two years, the minority in this country would not even have the machinery in Article 47 to protect them.</P>

      <P>It is not, I submit, exactly what they intended to do; to leave themselves without protection from the wild beasts that they thought they had trapped in the palisade.  I suppose it would have been a case of falling into the trap themselves, of being in bad company.  I believe that in the minds, not of the Government front bench, but in the minds of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party generally, and in the minds of many of the independent members, there is a lurking fear that perhaps in some way or other, if Article 47 and 48 were put into force, that they would have no reference to Article 17, and that if Article 17 were removed there would be a grave element of danger in dealing with England.  Now it is absolutely necessary to remove that fear.  It is <Col N="936" /> expressed shortly by the words of the Minister for Justice when he said that it was going to lead to the wrecking of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, by the people. From their point of view it is not going to lead to any element of wrecking, even of the Constitution or anything else.  It is a normal and natural change for any Irishman to take into consideration. Of course, I can understand a frank Unionist regarding it as a breach of law and order and of the Constitution in the old-fashioned sense before 1916; but I cannot understand anyone now not assuming it as natural and inevitable that, in the course of time, the Irish people will march towards freedom, and that Articles 47 and 48 supply an easy way for that march.  Suppose, for instance, that Article 17 were abolished by means of the petition, and suppose you had a sensible Ministry in power, even if they were not Republicans, and that they saw the situation was shaping in such a way that they had to bend to the storm, what would their natural attitude be?  They would have a vote of the people to see if they wanted to get rid of Article 17.  They would have a large party in the House pressing for the removal of Article 17, and, on the other hand, they would have the British Government beginning to give out dark hints and trying to bluff this country into disobeying the mandate of the people.</P>

      <P>&mdash;that there is no danger in retaining Articles 47 and 48 by making use of Article 17.  There is no element of danger, and there is a very strong case to be made for a united House achieving what we desire to achieve by means of it.  I do not think that even if this particular Bill becomes an Act that it entirely meets the situation.</P>
      <P>Article 48 of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas may provide for the Initiation by the people of proposals for laws or constitutional amendments. Should the Oireachtas fail to make such provision within two years, it shall on the petition of not less than seventy-five thousand voters on the register, of whom not more than fifteen thousand shall be voters in any one constituency, either make such provisions or submit the question to the people for decision in accordance with the ordinary regulations governing the Referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words used here are &ldquo;it shall on petition.&rdquo;  It does not say that it may. When the petition is presented it says that &ldquo;it shall on the petition.&rdquo;  The petition has been signed and, therefore, as far as Article 48 is concerned, everything which should be done has been done, if the law is to be kept and worked automatically.  The next and only step which can be taken at this stage is to examine the evidence as to the reliability of the petition.  That objection has been safeguarded by the fact that those who took the signatures went before the Peace Commissioners and made a statutory declaration before these officers of State.  You cannot go behind their <i>bona fides.</i>  You must accept them unless you are going to indict them for breaking their oath to carry out their duties.  You cannot go behind these statutory declarations.  All you can do is to examine them and see that they are correct.  We have supplied the necessary machinery for <Col N="938" /> bringing evidence that that petition is a correct petition.  Article 48 does not even say that the petition is to be presented. Further, it does not say that it is to be accepted by the House.  It says &ldquo;on petition.&rdquo;  I submit that 96,000 people have made that petition. The petition is there, and on that petition the House is bound to act.  All the legislation in the world cannot get away from what has happened.  Even Deputy Thrift's motion is a breach of the Constitution, because it delayed what should be the automatic action of this House. So, too, this Bill does not get the Government out of their difficulty.  It is still, so far as that petition is concerned, breaking the law by not putting Article 48 into operation, so that if they pass this law they still continue to be unconstitutional, for on the advice which they have received from the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; they have not succeeded in doing what it suggested they should do, namely, establish a dangerous principle which may be followed by the Republicans afterwards when they come into power. That precedent is there, and has been there since Deputy Thrift's motion was accepted by the House, and it will be further there by neglecting to act on the petition of 96,000 voters of this country. The argument was put forward by the President that we cannot rely on that petition because some of those who signed it are dead.  Does he contend that 20,000 or 25,000 have died?  The number required is only 75,000.  We have 96,000 who signed, and even if they are dead that does not affect the matter.  They signed in good faith.</P>

      <P>It is a wonder how the Minister for Finance woke up like a Rip Van Winkle to find that two Articles of <Col N="939" /> the Constitution were fantastic.  Of course it is the consequence of what might be called the spirit of counterrevolution, which is getting away from the people.  Up to a certain date there was a national fervour in this country out of which we were getting the very best the people could give, and that led to confidence in the people.  After that time, after the passing of the Treaty, apparently confidence in the people was lost, and the last stage was arrived at when it was discovered that to accept the decision of the people on any matter such as the broad issues of a measure of legislation is fantastic, frills, mere ornaments, and that the minute any attempt was made to use them they break down and are found to be impossible. I suggest that we should reverse the engines and that we should go in the direction of trusting the people.  Only by trust and by such institutions as the Referendum will the people be educated to the use of the Referendum, and above all, even if it is thought advisable to get rid of the Referendum, it is essential that the people, having been given that power, should themselves be called upon to relinquish that power, and that any other conduct in connection with the clauses of the Referendum is a tyrannical use of&mdash;I will not say the majority in this House, because it is not a majority party but a minority party which by various means has gathered up a following sufficient to give it a temporary majority on this motion.</P>

      <P>Táim in aghaidh an Bhille seo chun Airtiogal 47 agus 48 do chur ar neamhní.  Ar an gcéad dul síos is contabhartach an rud é.  Do mholas do mhuinntir na Gaillimhe, agus go háirithe do na h-ógánaigh, triall do bhaint go mór mór as Airtiogal 48, chun an méid saoirse atá againn do leathnú agus seans do thabhairt do chúrsaí polaitíochta.  Bhí súil agus dóchas acu&mdash;agus bhí an ceart acu&mdash;go bhféadfaí feidhm a bhaint as an airtiogal san chun an Bunreacht do leasú.  Cad a dearfad leo anois?  Déarfaidh siad nach raibh an ceart agam&mdash; go raibh mé ag iarraidh dalla puicín do chur orra.  Níl fhios agam cén freagra a thabharfaidh mé dóibh nuair a rachaidh mé ar ais go Gaillimh.  Má glactar leis an Bhille seo, má déantar <Col N="940" /> reacht de, an móide an meas a bhéas ag na daoine ar an mBunreacht féin ar no ar chúrsaí polaitíochta.  Nách dócha go mbeidh éadóchas ortha agus ní dhéanfaidh sin aon mhaith don Dáil seo no don chúrsaí polaitíochta.  Táim cinnte nach rachaidh sé chun thairbhe ná chun síochána don tír seo.

Níor thuig aon duine gur ar a shon an ruda so a fuair Cumann na nGaedheal 67 Teachtaí.  Deir an tAire Airgid nach ceist táchtach an rud so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard for anybody on these benches to introduce anything in the way of a Bill that would find favour with the Government, as far as I can see from the attitude adopted throughout the whole discussion.  There are, however, a few points that I would like to refer to.  I should like briefly to refer to the history of this Bill and to mention a <Col N="944" /> few of the ideas and views I have got as a result of the situation.  The Minister for Justice might have left out the statement that the Constitution contained flaws, the flaws being particularly Articles 47 and 48.  If they were flaws, they received no attention for quite a considerable time and it was only on the introduction of the Petition that the flaws were taken note of at all. Some of the Deputies, arguing on the introduction of the Petition, gave the impression clearly that the Petition, joined as it was with the matter relating to Article 17. was such that it could not be accepted on account of its repugnance to the Treaty.  I do not agree with that view, but I am trying to fathom how a Deputy who conscientiously believes that a Petition such as this could not be accepted because of its repugnance to the Treaty is justified in voting for the abolition of Articles 47 and 48.  If he feels he is correct in that attitude, and if the majority of the members of this House agree with him, has he not sufficient assurance that our Petition is not going to do any damage from his point of view.  Evidently that is not the real reason because otherwise he could not conscientiously vote for the deletion of Articles 47 and 48 of this Constitution where this Petition cannot be accepted from his point of view.  The Minister for Justice referred to an attempt on two occasions in Germany to introduce the referendum. He pointed out that on both occasions these attempts failed, but he did not tell us that as a result of their being fiascoes the German Government deleted the referendum clause from their Constitution.  I think if he had pointed out to us an instance of any country that had such a clause in their Constitution, and that, as a result of an effort being made to make use of it, it turned out to be a fiasco, and the country removed the referendum from its Constitution, I might then feel that I could be impressed with that suggestion.  The Minister went on to deal with countries like Switzerland and America, forgetting all the time that these countries have not got the political situation confronting them that we have got here. We are quite frank and open about our attitude as regards the national situa- <Col N="945" /> tion.  Those countries have no such international difficulties or differences at all.  They have no outside power, even indirectly, governing their advancement towards freedom and independence. They have their freedom and their independence.  Any difficulties they might have would be purely domestic, and there would be no interference from an outside source.  I do not know if the Ceann Comhairle would allow the discussion of a new Article of the Constitution, that is Article 83, the very last Article of the Constitution. As far as I can read that Article, and I would like Professor Thrift to read it, we have no power in this Dáil to make any laws whatever which affect the rights of the people as far as their making laws is concerned.  This Dáil is only the custodian of certain powers to work under this Constitution. Article 83 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The passing and adoption of this Constitution by the Constituent Assembly and the British Parliament shall be announced as soon as may be, and not later than the sixth day of December, nineteen hundred and twenty-two by Proclamation of His Majesty, and this Constitution shall come into operation on the issue of such Proclamation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take Article 83 in conjunction with Article 2, I do not see how we can in any way alter the Constitution without submitting whatever alteration we want to make either by way of Referendum or by way of Petition on the part of the people themselves.  Article 50 has been dealt with, to a certain extent, by Deputy Little, and when the Government try to make out that Articles 47, 48, and 50 slipped in by accident, without any thought, slipped in just as a flaw, I imagine that a legal mind at least could judge that these Articles were put in after a great deal of thought.  One has a bearing on the other, and they all go back to Article 2. If you remove these Articles, or alter them in any way, what effect do you give to Article 2 of the Constitution? How could the people be ever classed or recognised as those who make the laws, or from whom the laws of the country are derived?  I contend that <Col N="946" /> while the Government has certain powers of administering laws under this Constitution, and is the custodian of the Nation's march in any direction, they have no right whatever to interfere in any way with the Articles of the Constitution, which are paramount in the interests of the people.  Article 2 will have no power whatever; it might as well be taken out with the others. Article 2 definitely states one thing. The means by which the people can work Article 2 are those very Articles which it is now being thought to delete or alter.  How they can afterwards argue the Constitution as a Constitution, beginning at Article 2 and ending at Article 83, is something that I cannot understand.  I do not intend to make any appeal to the Government in this matter, but I do wish to state that I, in common with the members on these benches, recognise that it is the will of the people that will make or mar the country in any direction.  We have to stand over what the people want. But the attitude taken up now means reversing the situation.  The people will have to take what this Dáil decides and, constitutionally, there will be no way out of it if there is going to be this class of action.  A good deal of talk went on for quite a long time by certain people before Republicans came into the Dáil to work towards the Republican ideal.  It was said to them: &ldquo;Come into the House and you can work towards your ideal constitutionally.&rdquo; Now we are here given abuse for trying to work the Constitution constitutionally.  That is what we meet with.  Afterwards if things happen which are not desirable we certainly cannot be blamed, we certainly cannot be told that we did not make an honest effort to work towards what we frankly came in to say we were going to do.  I ask the Independent Deputies again to try to explain to themselves why they used arguments on the introduction of the Petition stating that it could not be accepted on account of its repugnancy to the Treaty, and why they are now turning around and are going to support the abolition of the Articles under which this Petition, according to themselves, could not be accepted.</P>

      <P>I confess that I find it very difficult to convince myself that President Cosgrave, who has introduced this Constitution Amendment Bill No. 10, is the same President Cosgrave whom we have all heard so much about during the last five years.  Probably my difficulty in that respect is due to the fact that I have not yet reached that high standard of intellectual ability which is the proud boast of the Front Bench, that high standard of intellectual ability which enables Ministers to roll glibly off their tongues such classical terms towards Deputies as &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Put a sock in it!&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Well, at any rate, the Government has used all the resources of the State in an effort, we were told, to establish supreme and unchallenged the will of the people.  In the discussion that took place on the Initiative Ministers assured us that they were determined to see that the people would <Col N="948" /> not be tricked into the removal of the Oath.  The President, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and the Minister for Education told us repeatedly that that petition motion was a trick. No doubt their honest hearts were stirred to indignation at the thought of the poor, simple Irish people being tricked into something they did not desire and something that they did not understand.  In that connection I submit that their fears are absolutely groundless, because so far as this Party is concerned, if I have interpreted their policy correctly, I think I can challenge contradiction of the statement that on every conceivable occasion they made it clear that they were determined, as far as they possibly could, to get rid of Article 17.  Where, then, does the trick come in?  Those who are talking of the people being tricked evidently have very short memories. They are the very same people who tricked the electorate into the acceptance of a Constitution which was only published on the morning of the election of 1923, and, of course, the Constitution in 1923 contained Articles 47 and 48.  It was the whole Constitution then.  The people were told all about this great charter of liberty which was to bring peace and prosperity, and within its clauses there was full and ample opportunity for the people to work towards the national goal.  Of course, there was no trickery on the part of the Executive Council in that connection.  There was no trickery in connection with the manner in which they put through the Boundary Agreement, nor in the manner in which they abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well, then.  I want to know if it would not be more honest on the part of the President to admit that his opposition to the Initiative and his reason for the introduction of this Constitution No. 10 Bill is really that if Articles 47 and 48 were allowed to remain and become operative, his fear is that such action would bring upon him the censure of His Majesty King George?  I can see no other reason for it.  Deputy Boland stated this afternoon that it was because we on these benches felt that the Government is not engaged in Irish business, that this is business purely in the interest of the Empire, that we have taken up our attitude of opposition to these Bills and why we intend to continue our opposition to them.  I think it is a feasible assumption that the President has suddenly come to the conclusion that the giving effect to Article 48, and the power of the Initiative and the Referendum, would place him in a very serious position so far as the British Empire is concerned.  In that connection I would like to ease the President's mind.  I submit that he could go over to London and state to His Majesty King George&mdash;he could even go in full court dress, and he need not send a letter of apology, as he felt constrained to do on a previous occasion&mdash;he could go over and tell His Majesty King George that this Article&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This House is discussing the abolition of Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution. There is no necessity for the President to go anywhere else to get authority for deleting these Articles or for keeping them in.  The Deputy need not proceed on that line of argument at all.  The Deputy is again simply introducing <Col N="950" /> another matter which is not relevant to the Bill.  He is entitled to do that in certain places, but he is not entitled to do it here.</P>

      <P>The point I wish to make is that the reason for getting rid of Articles 47 and 48 is because if they were allowed to remain the power of the Initiative would remain also, and would have to be given effect to.  I was going to point out that the President could challenge the British Cabinet to deny that they were responsible for the inclusion of Articles 47 and 48 in the Constitution.  He could state that the Constitution had been submitted to the British Cabinet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is common knowledge to all of us unfortunately that they were responsible for sending it over here in the form, which amounted to a declaration&mdash;and it is on the official records of this House that there are certain clauses in that Constitution which cannot be altered to the extent of a comma.</P>

Am I not in order then in pointing out how President Cosgrave could defend his actions in another place, and before people who would accuse him of a breach of the Treaty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. COONEY Mr. COONEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point which I want to make.  I want to submit for the consideration of Deputies another fact.  The Minister for Finance said that the will of the people was now more generally accepted, and as a proof of that he pointed to the occupany of these benches by Republican Deputies.  Deputies <Col N="952" /> are going, by defeating this amendment, to indicate clearly to Republican thought in this country that, if and when we attempt to use this Constitution to further the march towards independence, we are to be met on every occasion by the full force of the majority vote in this House, and they are going to close down the safety valve.  We shall then see who are the guardians of peace and order in the country.  We honestly believed that there were certain clauses in this Constitution which by honest effort could be used in the interests of the people, and to my mind the most fundamental clause from the national standpoint was Article 48, in view of the present situation in this country. Take that away and you leave very little hope in the minds of many of us who thought that constitutional action could serve our aim.  As I said before, that aim has never been in any way muddled.  It has been kept clearly before the people of the country, and before Deputies on every occasion.  I think it would be well if the Government would clearly indicate if that is their intention.  Are they really determined to close down the safety valve? If so, I would like them to make a declaration to that effect.  I would like the Minister for Finance to add to the statement which he made some months ago with reference to the attitude of the Government towards the Republican ideal.  I would like to know if the Government are now prepared to announce that they will oppose the use of this Constitution to enable this country to obtain any further reforms, nationally or economically?  I think such a declaration would clear the air very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to submit for the consideration of Deputies the question as to what effect this will have on the country.  Will it not be held as another British victory, and lend further proof to the impression, which is almost becoming a conviction, that behind this Ministry there is operating a powerful secret force.  That secret force may be represented here by a few Deputies, and, I believe, as I said on a previous occasion, there are a few people in this House who hold the Government <Col N="953" /> in the hollow of their hands. At the eleventh&mdash;or perhaps I should say at the twelfth&mdash;hour, I appeal to any member on the Government Benches, to anybody who has the least national instinct left; there is still hope if he is prepared to go out honestly and face the country on an issue of this kind.  We challenge such Deputies here and now, if they are serious in saying that they are doing this in the interest of the people, to prove that.  They can prove it by passing this amendment unanimously, and the passing of this amendment will not lead to the position which the passing of Deputy Thrift's amendment led to. It will not lead anybody into a trap. It will enable all of us to go before that final court of appeal and have their verdict on what I consider to be a real fundamental clause of the Constitution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that one of the principal reasons why Articles 47 and 48 should be retained is that they leave the road open to national unity.  By their abolition, you put the King's <i>imprimatur</i> for all time on the Constitution and the King's seal in this country has always been the fan that fed revolution.  No matter what the President said about threats from this side of the House, he cannot get away from the fundamental fact that as long as this country is unfree there will never be peace.  As the Bishop of Limerick said, &ldquo;While grass grows and water runs there will be men ready to die and dare for this country so long as she is unfree.&rdquo;  If the country were free, from Antrim and Derry to Cork and Kerry, you might, as in Germany, have a reason for the abolition of the Referendum, but we were told, when this Constitution was being set up, that it would be used as a lever to freedom, and none of the original framers of the Constitution ever contended that it was all that was to be desired.  As long as you have the country unfree there can be no economic progress, because there is an inherent belief that there is no stability. <Col N="954" /> The Minister for Agriculture to-night said that there were not two Deputies on these benches who knew what a republic was.  Our definition of a republic is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was going to submit that Articles 47 and 48 could be implemented for getting a republic, and I was going to give him my definition of a republic.  It is this: &ldquo;Ireland her own and all therein from sod to the sky; the soil of Ireland for the people of Ireland, to have and to hold without rent, or render, fee, or service to any power under heaven.&rdquo;  Nobody could contend that a country with a lien on the land of Ireland of three and a half millions tribute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a land is in no sense of the word free, and if we desire these things for the people they can only be obtained by a national effort which, in itself, is obtained by a vigorous national spirit.  That can only come about by the unity of the national elements which are separated at present, and if you close the door by the passing of this Bill you do away for all time with any chance of that unity.  You are trying to stop the volcano of Irish nationality and you will not succeed. The President said on one occasion here that he yields to nobody in things national.  I suppose he spoke for the executive, and, if he yields to nobody in things national, the personal animus that is on the other side should be replaced by a broad national outlook which believes that the national elements will come together in this country and go forward for complete independence. Every avenue and every means of obtaining that complete independence should be left open.  Is it a Micawber hope, a pious belief, that somehow, somewhere, sometime, we will attain independence unless we endeavour to obtain it?  I submit that these Articles which are about to be abolished would tend to unite the whole people.  Consequently <Col N="955" /> the Dáil should hesitate before passing this Bill.  Like Deputy Cooney, I do not appeal to Independent Deputies. &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; is a misnomer. They are like the souls in Limbo, as they never will get out of the position they are in.  The other day we honoured the memory of Wolfe Tone, and it would be well to ask ourselves was that all a hollow mockery, and are these people who talk about Tone actuated by a selfish dog-in-the-manger policy?</P>
      <P>Tone put down as his principal doctrine, his principal plank, to &ldquo;break the connection with England, the never-failing source of all our evils,&rdquo; but it appears that that has been forgotten, that where we are now we are going to stay, and that there is going to be no national advance as far as we can help it in our day.  In pursuing this course, in destroying the Constitution which I believe anyway was intended by the framers to be used as a lever towards national advancement, we are consciously or unconsciously doing the work of the Empire, and we are getting into a quagmire.  When we are done with, as far as they can use us, they will kick us out like old shoes. There is a lot of talk about the will of the people.  You can talk about the will of the people, and play on their temerity.  You can appeal to their baser instincts and their cowardice. but we expect that people pretending to be national leaders ought to show courage and steadfastness for national ideals and lead the people.  If they do that I believe the people will follow them.  A lot of sophistry has come about of late, and we are full of materialistic arguments, but we realise that there can be no economic progress, that things materially will not progress unless you have sound national principles and a nation led by men who are prepared to stand for these national principles.</P>

By retaining Articles 47 and 48, as I said, you make way for national unity.  I know very well that there are elements on the opposite side and elements on this side that will never come together, but I also know that the common people of Ireland will come together, and that when this animus and this spleen are all forgotten, the nation will progress, and that we in our day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to recommendation 7 of the Joint Committee's Report on the Constitution. The provision of the Constitution at the moment is that a Bill having passed Dáil Eireann is considered by the Seanad.  If the Seanad passes it with amendment or amendments which are unacceptable to the Dáil, and if agreement is not reached between the two Houses, it is held up for a period of 270 days.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining when the Deputy informed you that he could not hear me, that if a Bill having passed the Dáil was either passed by the Seanad with amendments or rejected, and if the Dáil disagreed with the amendments made by the Seanad and agreement was not reached between the two Houses, the Bill was held up for 270 days.  After that time, unless three-fifths of the members of the Seanad so requested, it automatically became law.  If, on the other hand, one of two things happened&mdash; after the Bill has passed the Dáil&mdash;if two-fifths of the Deputies of this House present a petition to the President of the Executive Council, or, alternately, if three-fifths of the members of the Seanad present a petition to the President of the Executive Council, in the first place, the petition which comes from two-fifths of the members of the Dáil would require to be accompanied by a petition of 50,000 voters, or in the case of three-fifths of the members of the Seanad so requesting, the Bill could be referred to a Referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for an extended period of the holding up of a measure which has passed the Dáil and obviates two other courses which I have mentioned, or rather precludes them from being put into operation.  The position in this Bill is that a measure having passed the Dáil can be held up by the Seanad.  After a period of eighteen months, the Dáil may pass a resolution again sending up the Bill to the Seanad, and if the Seanad does not pass it, then at the end of sixty days the Dáil again passes a resolution, and the Bill in question is due for signature by the Governor-General and becomes law.  It may so happen that by agreement a Bill can be held up for <Col N="967" /> twelve months after the eighteen months have passed, and at any time during that twelve months the Dáil could by resolution declare that the Bill was deemed to be passed.  It is a rather involved statement, and if Deputies wish, I will repeat it, with a view to making it more clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is not concerned with Articles 47 and 48 at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  I made a mistake about that.  It is Article 38 I should have said.  I need not go over the position at the moment as regards the holding up of a measure.  I simply take up this particular Bill and state what the case is.  Once the Bill has passed the Dáil, it is sent to the Seanad, and the Seanad may amend it.  If the amendments are not accepted by the Dáil, and if there is no agreement reached between the two Houses, there is first of all a period of eighteen months in which the Bill cannot become law, except by agreement, as I have said.  At the end of the period of eighteen months the Dáil will require to pass a resolution, again sending the Bill to the Seanad.  If the Seanad again rejects the Bill, a period of sixty days elapses and the Bill is again due for consideration by the Dáil, and the Dáil may by resolution again send the Bill forward, and whether the Seanad accepts it or not, it automatically becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision for a Dissolution occurring, and in that case, perhaps, to make the matter clearer I will mention dates.  We will suppose that the Bill has passed the Dáil by the 1st May.  Eighteen months in the ordinary way would run from the 1st May, but a Dissolution takes place on the 1st August.  A new Dáil then considers the measure and the eighteen months period is cut down to the first day of the assembly of the new Dáil, if the new Dáil so desires.  A period then of twelve months can run with the wish of the Dáil, but two months from the date of the assembly of the Dáil, the Dáil, by resolution, could pass the Bill and it would be due for signature and would become law.  There is the intermediate <Col N="968" /> period of eighteen months, and that intermediate period having run and no agreement being reached, the Bill might be, by agreement, held over for twelve months.  At the end of that period, it would require a resolution of the Dáil in order to pass the Bill into law.  I formally move the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary way a Bill is held up for 270 days, and it is then subject to either of two courses.  One is a petition from two-fifths of the members of the Dáil, and the other is a request from three-fifths of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which has just passed a Second Reading gave the right of Referendum.  That right will now be taken away from the Seanad if that Bill becomes law.  The compensation which is offered in respect of that particular right which is being delivered up is that they get eighteen months, or at most, twenty months, against nine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has explained the mechanism of the Bill. Can he explain the fundamental principle? What advantage is it to the State to extend the period during which the Seanad can hold up legislation? I think on the Second Reading as it is generally understood, the principle of a measure has to be explained, and the benefits which the State will derive from the operation of that measure ought to be clearly stated by the person who makes himself responsible for it.  I intervene to suggest to the President that, before he concludes his statement, he ought to put before the House the advantages which are to be derived from this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that while nine months is a very long period for mature consideration, twenty months affords a greater opportunity, and gives liberty for more mature consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>You think that, unlike eggs, the legislation will not deteriorate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Very often accommodation is reached in a period of twenty months which is impossible in a period of nine months, and it was considered that by affording the period of twenty months there would be better opportunity for that consideration I have referred to.  Alternatively, let us say, there is a dissolution, and the new House sends forward a Bill with a particular restriction upon the power of the Dáil to have the measure passed more quickly.  That power is restored to the Dáil, but it is a matter for the judgment of the various members of the Dáil as to whether or not this is a better arrangement than the old one. I consider it is.  I consider, in the first place, that while the Seanad might not wish to put the State to the expense of a Referendum, accommodation may be reached, and is possible to be reached, in twenty months which might not be possible in nine.  They are giving up a right bestowed on them five or six years ago when the Constitution was being considered.  They are giving up the right of submitting such legislation as they considered was inadvisable to a Referendum.</P>
      <P>They are giving up a considerable amount, and some consideration must be restored for the consideration which is being surrendered.  In this case the eighteen months is a fair consideration, I might say, in respect to both the Seanad and the Dáil.  In one case only did the Seanad hold up a Bill for nine months.  In one other case the Dáil presented a petition of two-fifths of the members, but that petition was not persisted in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The President said that <Col N="970" /> there was here a principle of compensation. Is this compensation for vested interests in the Seanad that interfere with the will of the people expressed in legislation through the Dáil?  Is that what the compensation means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The compensation is not meant in the sense of pounds, shillings and pence, as apparently the Deputy has interpreted the matter to be.  I will make it more simple for the Deputy if he so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>You used the term, suggesting compensation for something which is being taken away.  What has been taken away?  Their power to interfere with legislation passed by the Dáil being carried into effect?  I suggest the principle behind the Bill is compensation for interference with vested interests in their interference with the will of the people as expressed through the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The second amendment, as has been previously indicated, is not in order.  It raises the question generally.  On this Bill questions are restricted to the provisions of the Bill itself.  Deputy Lemass's amendment is simply a formal amendment which, if moved, would enable the general question to be discussed. The Deputy need not necessarily move it at the first stage.</P>

The remark just made by the President that this is intended to compensate the Seanad for certain powers which it is proposed to take away from the Seanad is rather interesting.  If we look at the Articles which are being taken away just now, we will see that three bodies, as I said before, are struck at.  The people were <Col N="971" /> struck at, because the power of the Initiative was taken away from them. They were struck at because their position had been that of final arbiters of legislation.  That was taken away from them.  The Dáil was struck at inasmuch as the power of a minority in the Dáil to have legislation referred to the people was taken away from them.  We find that the only people who are to be compensated are the Seanad.  The Seanad had the power also of referring certain questions to the people.  There is no question of the people who talk about the will of the people compensating the people for the powers that are taken away from them, and there is no talk of compensating the representatives of the people for the powers taken away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only people whom it is proposed to compensate are those who are strong enough to drive a bargain, those in whose behalf all these Bills are being passed, because with the interests they represent they hold the balance of power which is keeping the Executive in office.  It is there that we are going to find the reason for this urgency compensation.  They are well able to strike a bargain as we can see.  They are not going to take anything on the statement of the President.  He does not think it sufficient, in dealing with them, to say: &ldquo;We are going to extent the period,&rdquo; or anything like that.  He puts it down in black and white for them so that when they come straight to the question of giving up any of their powers, they will have, side by side with it, their quid pro quo.  I hope that the people whose powers are being interfered with, and who gave the present Executive their support for the last five years, because they posed as the champions of the people, will at last waken up to the fact that these were all promises, and that this was all window dressing in order to deceive these people for the last four or five years.  The President also performed a certain service here by proving the case which was made by those to-day who opposed this all-night sitting.  His attempt to explain this Bill, which he is introducing, shows quite clearly that he did not understand it himself, or that <Col N="972" /> he is half in the land of dreams at the present moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing in this Bill is that Article 38 of the Constitution shall be amended by the deletion of &ldquo;the portion thereof beginning with the words `but a Bill,' and ending with the words `last passed by Dáil Eireann.' &rdquo; Let us see what the Article was before this was put in, and as it stood before these words were deleted and what it is going to be when they are deleted.  Article 38 of the Constitution reads: &ldquo;Every Bill initiated in and passed by Dáil Eireann shall be sent to Seanad Eireann and may, unless it be a Money Bill, be amended in Seanad Eireann and Dáil Eireann shall consider any such amendment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now this is what is proposed to be deleted: &ldquo;But a Bill passed by Dáil Eireann and considered by Seanad Eireann shall, not later than two hundred and seventy days after it shall have been first sent to Seanad Eireann, or such longer period as may be agreed upon by the two Houses, be deemed to be passed by both Houses in the form in which it was last passed by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now why is it proposed to delete this particular portion of the Article?  I was a member of the Joint Committee, and there was a good deal of play about the word &ldquo;considered.&rdquo;  All that I got out of that was that, apparently, as it stands, the Seanad might do what the Dáil did with the Petition, namely, refuse to consider it, and, therefore, this Article would not apply.  Seeing that the Dáil itself sets such a good <Col N="973" /> example, I suppose they think it very well for them to have such a thing to play with, but that the good example is not to be followed elsewhere.  The other part of it is that which mentions the period of 270 days.  That was the period, or such longer period as might be agreed on by the two Houses, within which the Seanad would have to pass a Bill, or else it would be deemed to have been passed by both Houses.  There is a further proposition which is intended to make up for that part which is deleted.  I will come to it later, and do not propose to discuss it now.</P>
    <P>Then we see the effects of this.  One is to omit the portions of the Articles that say that within 270 days any Bill other than a Money Bill shall be deemed to have passed both Houses. In the second part there are to be deleted the words &ldquo;Provided that.&rdquo; These words are introductory to the sentence &ldquo;Provided that every Money Bill shall be sent to Seanad Eireann for its recommendation, and at a period not longer than 21 days after it shall have been sent to Seanad Eireann it shall be returned to Dáil Eireann, which may pass it, accepting or rejecting all or any of the recommendations of Seanad Eireann, and as so passed or if not returned within such period of 21 days shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses.&rdquo;  Apparently all that is intended there is that the words &ldquo;Provided that&rdquo; shall go out of the Article and that the Article is to proceed: &ldquo;Every Money Bill shall be sent to Seanad Eireann for its recommendations, and that a period not longer than 21 days after it shall have been sent to Seanad Eireann it shall be returned to Dáil Eireann, which may pass it, accepting or rejecting all or any of the recommendations of Seanad Eireann, and as so passed or if not returned within such period of 21 days shall be deemed to have been passed by both Houses.&rdquo;  The third deletion is the sentence beginning with the words, &ldquo;When a Bill&rdquo; and ending with the words &ldquo;of the same.&rdquo;  That is the deletion, and the final sentence in Article 38&mdash;namely, &ldquo;When a Bill other than a Money Bill has been sent to Seanad Eireann a joint sitting of the members of both Houses may on resolution passed by Seanad Eireann be <Col N="974" /> convened for the purpose of debating, but not of voting upon, the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us see what power exactly we are depriving the Seanad of or the reverse.  When a Bill other than a Money Bill has been sent to Seanad Eireann there is to be a joint sitting of the members of both Houses.  It may on a resolution passed by Seanad Eireann be convened for the purpose of debating, but not of voting upon, the measure.</P>
    <P>So this deletion proposes doing away with this joint sitting for the purpose of debating a measure on which there has not been agreement, if the measure is other than a Money Bill.  So far as it is a matter largely of deletion we have no particular complaint to make. As I have said very often, we believe that the Seanad is not fulfilling any useful purpose as far as interests of the Irish people are concerned, but the reverse, and accordingly we are not going at any stage to offer any opposition to any proposals which may deprive them of power.  The next proposal, that contained in the second section, is that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Constitution shall be and is hereby amended by the insertion therein of the following Article immediately after Article 38 now contained therein, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;38A.  Whenever a Bill (not being a Money Bill) initiated in and passed by Dáil Eireann and sent to Seanad Eireann is within the stated period hereinafter defined either rejected by Seanad Eireann or passed by Seanad Eireann with amendments to which Dáil Eireann does not agree or is neither passed (with or without amendment) nor rejected by Seanad Eireann within the said stated period, Dáil Eireann may within one year after the said stated period by resolution expressly passed under this Article again send such Bill to Seanad Eireann in the form (save only for such modifications as are hereinafter authorised) in which it was first sent, and if Seanad Eireann does not, within sixty days thereafter <Col N="975" /> or such longer period as may be agreed to by both Houses, pass such Bill either without amendment or with such amendments only as are agreed to by Dáil Eireann, such Bill shall, if Dáil Eireann so resolves after the expiration of such sixty days or longer period aforesaid, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas at the expiration of the said sixty days or longer period aforesaid in the form in which it was so last sent to Seanad Eireann with such (if any) amendments as may have been made therein by Seanad Eireann and agreed to by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have to take this bit by bit to see what bargain we <Col N="976" /> are striking with the Seanad, and what we are going to give them.  As this is a Bill to deprive them of certain privileges they have already this is a bargain that has to be struck.  This is what the Seanad have to get.  We have to ask ourselves why are we singling them out to give them these special privileges when no attempt is to be made to recompense the people as a whole or the Dáil for powers taken away from them.  We have first of all the distinction between Money Bills and ordinary Bills.  I think we should have a separate discussion on the two parts to see exactly how we stand with respect to each of them.  Take Bills, not Money Bills, and see what the Seanad can do with them, as explained in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>What it means, therefore, up to this point is, if the Seanad either rejects a measure or tries to put off considering it or introduces amendments into it to which the Dáil does not agree then there is to be some remedy.</P>

      <P>These measures are all by themselves.  I do not think <Col N="977" /> we can establish any precedents except ones that relate to the same type of matter.  I am much more interested in other sorts of precedents that are being set.  I was going to say, working at this hour of the night, that we should be very careful of what we are passing. We should read it carefully.  Therefore, I believe I am performing a very useful service to the House in getting through in this particular fashion. Within a certain period, anyhow, the Seanad must take action.  We will know what that period is afterwards. Dáil Eireann may within one year after a said stated period add another year on to that.  Within that year Dáil Eireann has the power of doing certain things.  The word &ldquo;suspension&rdquo; has apparently dropped from the Report. The words of the Report were that the Bill was to be suspended for a period. I take it this is the type of suspension that is provided &ldquo;within one year after the said stated period by a resolution expressly passed under this Article against such Bill to Seanad Eireann in the form, save only for such modifications as are hereinafter authorised, in which it was first so sent, and if Seanad Eireann does not within sixty days thereafter or such longer period as may be agreed to by both Houses pass such Bill either without amendment or with such amendments only as are agreed to by Dáil Eireann, such Bill shall, if Dáil Eireann so resolves after the expiration of such sixty days or longer period aforesaid, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I agree with that as a general principle.  But I say if the President did his duty, it would not be necessary.  This Bill confers certain <Col N="979" /> powers, and the fact that there was a condition in a similar Article, portion of which gave rise to a great deal of trouble, should make it necessary to consider it in this way.  If that had been considered as I am trying to consider this, we would not have these difficulties.  It is because these things are not considered carefully and the text read in such a way as to pull out of it what is in it, and to see that there is nothing hidden in it, that we do it in this way.  Really the bringing in of these Constitution Bills is a farce in itself.  If the Constitution is to be regarded as a fundamental, surely it ought not to be rushed through in this particular way, particularly at this time of night.  It is necessary in order to keep ourselves awake to advert fully to the things that are contained in this, to read them and to break them up into their parts.  If I may, I will try as best I can to limit the re-reading.  It is necessary to see exactly where we stand.  We have, to start with, a stated period within which the Seanad must take action.

      <P>One year after this stated period, which appears later to be about eighteen months, the Dáil may by resolution send back a Bill to the Seanad a second time.  It is to be sent back in the form in which it was sent originally or with such amendments, I take it, as are agreed upon or such changes other than those I have mentioned, and if there are any changes other than those they should be amendments which come under the heading &ldquo;save only as are hereinafter authorised.&rdquo; These are to be certified, I understand, by the Ceann Comhairle, as due to the lapse of time.  The next thing is that within sixty days thereafter, or if the Dáil agree to have a longer period&mdash;I take it the other House, if they are disposed to hold up a Bill, will look for the longest possible period&mdash;they may pass such Bill either without amendment or with such amendments as are agreed to by Dáil Eireann, &ldquo;and such Bill shall, if Dáil Eireann so resolves, after the expiration of such sixty days or longer period aforesaid, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas at the expiration of the said sixty days or longer period aforesaid in the form in which it was so last sent to Seanad Eireann, with such amendments, if any, as may have been made therein by Seanad Eireann and agreed <Col N="981" /> to by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  The sum of it all apparently is this: that there is a stated period which is defined later to be eighteen months, and within that period the Seanad must consider that Bill.  If it rejects the Bill or sends it back to the Dáil with amendments to which the Dáil does not agree, there is a year within which the Dáil may take action by resolution and send it back again to the Seanad.  After a second sending up there is a period of sixty days, or a longer period if agreed to by the Dáil, within which the Seanad must finally pass the Bill.  The only restrictions upon sending it up a second time are that it shall have no changes in the form in which it was first sent up, except those agreed to by the Dáil, or such as are certified by the Ceann Comhairle to be necessary owing to the lapse of time.  I think we understand fairly clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have got to this point that we are beginning to see fairly clearly what powers the Seanad is getting instead of the two hundred and seventy days.  I happen also, in this matter, to have had the advantage of being a member of the Committee. It was remarked there, I think by members of the Seanad, certainly by more than one member of the Committee, that in the Referendum the Seanad had a power which was more apparent than real, that they had a power of Referendum which they did not dare to use, that they had a useless power as far as they were concerned.  We are proposing now to give them a power that could be made very effective for a House that wished to obstruct the majority Party <Col N="982" /> here, if that majority Party should not have their own particular viewpoint. In other words, if there should be in this House a majority sent by the Irish people with views other than the views of the present Executive, the Seanad, instead of having a power of Referendum, which they did not dare to use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I say, the Seanad had the power of Referendum, it had the power of holding up for two hundred and seventy days, which is the only power it had.  Here there is a period of about twenty months as the minimum involved.  The bargain they have struck is this, that a power which they did not dare to use, and that would be no good to them in the circumstances that I indicated, is being taken from them.  A body is sent here by the people to carry out a certain programme which is not the type of programme that the Seanad would be likely to favour.  They would not dare to go to the people, and they have not, as a matter of fact, ever attempted to use the Referendum.  They would not dare to use it in the circumstances I indicate, but with the new power given them they could very effectively hold up an Executive or a majority Party here, to whom they are opposed, for a period of some twenty months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that we ought not to give them that power.  When I was speaking on the Seanad generally, I said that as far as I was personally concerned I was not a doctrinaire; as to the question of a single chamber or of two, that I could very well conceive a framework of government in which two Houses would be necessary, but it would be a very different framework of government from the one that is here, and I could see in the Seanad as it exists here nothing but a device to block the way <Col N="983" /> of the Irish people towards the completion of their march to freedom. I see that in this Bill they are to be given a power that they did not have before for doing that, power of holding up legislation during the greater part of the life of a parliament, because probably four years will be about the average duration of a parliament. Five years is the maximum as it is, but we may take it that four years will be about the average period of work of a single parliament.  Therefore this Bill gives the Seanad power to hold up for two full years the action of, say, an executive duly appointed after a general election.</P>
    <P>I think it wrong to take away the powers from the people such as they have for initiating legislation themselves, and further to hamper them by saying that, even after a general election, there is to be a House here consisting of people who, in the new circumstances, will largely elect themselves, and who in the present circumstances are nothing more or less than a tail, so to speak, of the majority Party at present in the House.  It is an indirect way of giving the present Executive power to hold up legislation, over and above whatever powers they may have when they come to be in opposition. They would then have not merely such powers of holding up legislation as their numbers might give them, but they would be looking for the support of this other House which they are building up.  They are preparing that House for the day when they will be trying to prevent the passing of legislation by another Executive.  I said also, when we were considering this before, that what we want is not a House that will be a clog on progress, that if it were possible to devise a second chamber which would give a lead in legislation there would be some reason for a second chamber.  As I have already said, we are conservative by character; we are conservative by reason of the occupation of the greater number of our people, and we are conservative by reason of the forces against which we are contending.  We are up against outside threats, and these are all forces that are tending to keep the nation back.  I appeal to any <Col N="984" /> member here who at any time wished to see the realisation of the aspirations which were common to all of us a few years ago, not to vote for setting up another House which will be a clog upon progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I submit, a Chinn Comhairle, that I am talking very much to the point, that I am speaking of the character of the Seanad in connection with the powers which they are to get.  In this Bill you are giving them powers of holding up a popularly-elected Executive to which they may be opposed; you are giving them the power of holding up legislation for a period which is more than twice as long as the period for which they can hold up legislation at present. And as far as the Referendum is concerned, as I have said, they have nothing in that that would be detrimental to the progress of the country, because if the majority of the people were in favour of a certain line of action there was very little use in the Senate appealing to Caesar; Caesar hath spoken, and therefore that power was one that was more apparent than real.  But you are giving them real power now to hold up legislation for one-half the normal Parliamentary period, and if the Executive were not changed in the interim, the period of office of an Executive which would come in on certain social or political programmes would be held up for two years.  I have heard this House spoken of many times as sovereign.  I would be willing, on my own behalf anyhow, to make a bargain with the President&mdash; to get rid of this Constitution altogether. I know that the Labour members and others would not be prepared to deal with the matter in that way, but I am quite prepared to accept this House as sovereign and representing the people.  There would be some sense in speaking of the House as sovereign if you had no Constitution and no bonds in the form of another House, and things of that kind.  But it is nonsense to speak of this House as being sovereign if it is to give away its sovereign powers by making it possible <Col N="985" /> for another House so to cloak legislation that progress would become practically impossible.  I will leave it to other speakers, if they choose, to deal with other parts of this Bill.  As far as I am concerned, my attitude is this, that I would not give twenty months' power of holding up to the Seanad.  If the Seanad is intended to give a reasonable time to the Dáil for second thoughts, a reasonable time to the Dáil to reconsider its previous decisions, to have amendments to legislation, surely the original 270 days&mdash;nine months&mdash;is sufficient.  I made a motion in the Joint Committee to reduce it to nine months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>When you had got half of the Committee interested in preserving for themselves their powers it was not likely that I would get very much support, and when you had another portion of it interested, as the Executive at present is, in keeping this power, which, as I said the other day about the valve, will be used one way, on account of the fact that they will owe their position to them, they need not be expected to harass the present Executive very much.  Therefore, we had, against that proposition, the Seanad representatives on that Committee. I do not know if all of them were against it, but apparently, in view of the suggestion that I had no vote but my own they were all against it.  Naturally, I only wish that this House was as anxious about retaining its powers and its supremacy as the Seanad was about retaining theirs.  We would then make some progress. Apparently they voted solidly to retain these powers, and I do not blame them if they believe that a second House is valuable, and. having a good opinion of themselves, by all means it was natural that they should try to preserve their powers.  But what does that voting indicate?  You might have expected straight away that you would have got six Seanad members against it, and that you would have got a section of the Dáil members, representing the majority here, against it, expecting that the Seanad would be useful to them.  In fact, the Seanad is going to <Col N="986" /> play the same role in this country as the House of Lords used to play in England: it is going to be a help to the Tories, and the moment any progress is proposed to be made by those who are progressive it will hold them up until the cup becomes full.  As I said in the Committee, from one point of view I might be very glad that this whole series of propositions is going through. Allowing the Seanad to elect itself, although there is no direct contact with the people, and giving them these powers of holding up the popular assembly, can be very useful when the time comes to clip their wings, as it will surely come.</P>
      <P>As I say, my opposition to this is to giving them these powers to hold up for a period of twenty months.  To my thinking the period of nine months that was there was quite long enough.  It would give time to any party interested to get public opinion interested.  It would give time to make sure that nothing was done in haste or without due consideration, but to give them any longer period necessary, to enable them to function in that particular way as a suspending or delaying body, to give mature consideration to anything is to erect a machine for deliberately obstructing the people's advancement.  That is the main ground on which we oppose this measure.  I would like also to know from the President&mdash;perhaps he would not mind answering me before I finish &mdash;whether this is the end of the powers to be conferred on the Seanad.  Have we all the Bills here, or are we going to be presented with another sheaf?</P>

I made my position so clear that they were all anxious to assure me that anything I said would not merely not be used in evidence against me, but that everyone understood what my aim was; seeing that I was not able to push the ending of the Seanad in that Committee, at least I was able to make it as little harmful as possible.  You will find that there is rigorous consistency in every amendment which I moved there, my purpose being to make the Seanad as little harmful as possible. There is one of the Bills which we are opposing, that dealing with the question of age, in regard to which I plead guilty to proposing that the age be changed from 35 to 30, my reason, which was a very clear one, being that I hoped to get a little more progress if there were people in the Seanad under 35.  I feel that as I had no chance of fixing the age at 21 or 10 that I would have to agree to 30.  It gave a chance of getting people there with progressive ideas.</P>

I have indicated fairly fully my objection to this Bill.  The point is that, to my thinking, the period should <Col N="989" /> not be longer than it was.  There is no question of compensating the Seanad, because the powers you take away have no real substance in them.  They were powers that could not be used in order to block the progress of the nation. These powers can be used.  That is the main basis of our objection to this particular Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I am very strongly opposed to the principle of this measure.  The principle, despite the involved verbiage, is simple.  It proposes to extend the period during which the Seanad can hold up legislation passed by this House from a period of nine months to, at least, a minimum period of twenty months.  That is what it proposes to do.  I am opposed to that, and would be opposed to that extension even if we had no proposal to change the method of electing the Seanad; but it is doubly and trebly objectionable when coupled with another proposal before the House, namely, to prevent the election of the Seanad by a direct vote of the people.  The Seanad is being made more unrepresentative, shall I say, and, at the same time, it is being given more power to hold up legislation passed by the representatives of the people.  That is the position in a nutshell, and for that reason I am opposing it, and the President cannot use the argument which he used in the case of the other Bills, namely, that this is a proposal which has been put to the people at a general election or any other time, and that it is the will of the people that it should be passed.  He knows that if it were put to the people it would not be accepted by them, and they would not give this power to the Seanad to hold up legislation passed by the elected representatives of the people.  I do not think it is necessary to say anything more about it.  I propose to vote against the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and <Col N="990" /> add at the end of the motion the words &ldquo;this day twelve months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In support of that amendment I think I can quote with advantage the speech which the President made in introducing the Bill.  If any useful purpose can be served by introducing provisions for delaying a Bill about which there is disagreement in the Seanad, for a period of twenty months, in order to enable reconsideration to be effected, then surely a strong case can be made out for delaying this Bill for a period of twelve months to enable reconsideration to be possible here.  If there ever was a Bill introduced in this or any other House which would require reconsideration, and reconsideration in a perfectly calm and cool atmosphere, this Bill is such a Bill.  The phraseology of the Bill is most involved.  The machinery established by the Bill is most involved.  The average man with average intelligence trying to get behind the purpose of that Bill could not do so unless he had read it over a number of times and then had it translated into ordinary English. Having done that, he might get a glimmering of the idea behind it, and having done that and then proceeding to compare it with the original Article of the Constitution, to find out what changes would be made, he would come to the conclusion that it is not a Bill that should be rushed through in an assembly at a quarter past two in the morning.  If it is essential that provision should be made by which the Seanad can, if they so desire, take twenty months over a Bill, surely it is equally essential that this Dáil ought to have an opportunity of giving it proper consideration.  The purpose of the Bill, stripped of all its qualifications and verbiage, is to increase the power which the Seanad has of vetoing Acts of this House.  The purpose of the Bill is practically to double its powers. Any Bill dealing with the Article of the Constitution concerned, which would be likely to get the support of the Deputies on this side of the House would have to be a Bill that would propose not to increase these powers, but to abolish them.  It is an extraordinary thing, in my opinion, that a Bill of this nature is introduced by the present Government at all, but it becomes a much more <Col N="991" /> extraordinary thing when we consider that this Bill is introduced, as Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, along with another Bill or two other Bills which propose to alter the constitution of the Seanad in a manner which will provide that it will in no sense be a democratically-elected body, representative of the people.  It is proposed to give this power, this extraordinary power, of vetoing Acts of this House, suspending Bills introduced here for a period of twenty months, to an assembly which will be partly nominated and partly elected in a manner which could not confer upon them the right to claim that they were able to speak on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I think that proper consideration has not been given to the idea of abolishing the power of the Seanad to interfere in the acts of this assembly.  It has been denied by the Government that the Seanad was established to give to a particular class in this country a certain power which they could otherwise get, but if there is any strength in this denial then a strong case can be made out for taking out of the hands of the Seanad power to hold up legislation. If, however, the charge is true, and if the Seanad has been established and is being maintained to veto the power and to veto the acts of the people's representatives for a certain privileged class, then this Bill is in accordance with that policy.  The criticisms that were made upon the Bill which has just passed, and the action of the Government in waiting till the year 1928 after all that has happened in between, to effect an amendment holds good in this case also. In this year 1928 we have these proposals to take from the people and the Dáil certain powers and rights which the Constitution bestowed upon them and to confer upon an undemocratic and unrepresentative oligarchy additional powers to interfere with the people's will.  That power of veto should be abolished.  I have stated, of course, that the attitude of this Party is that, if there must be a Seanad&mdash; and we are not strong enough yet to secure its abolition&mdash;it should be a Seanad so much under the control of this Dáil that its operations would be <Col N="992" /> harmless, that we should hold them under our thumb so that they would not be able to squeak unless we lifted our thumb, and certainly we ought to hold them so tight that they could not wriggle.  If there was a Nationalist Government in office&mdash;I will not say even a Republican Government&mdash;that had kept its anchors in general National principles, it would be their purpose to reduce the Seanad to that condition and not to entrench them in the position in which it is now proposed to put them.  It is, I maintain, ridiculous for the majority of the elected representatives of the people of this State to sit here and sleep here while a Bill is being passed through this House to confer the right of vetoing their acts upon an assembly in which we have a number of members who represent nobody, who were nominated by the President of the Executive Council, and who could not be said even to represent him; numbers of persons holding offices and titles of honour from the British Crown, a number of members of the British Parliament, a number of pensioned officers of an alien army&mdash;an assembly of that nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to mention names or anything of that kind.  But this Seanad, which does exist&mdash;and remember the period of office even under the new system will be nine years&mdash;and which has power to reproduce itself, does include persons of that class amongst its members.  It is to a body of that nature, and, consequently, representative of the views that you would expect in a body of that nature, that we propose to give additional powers to veto the acts of the people's representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We go through the farce of holding a general election and of electing 152 Deputies, who are supposed to be the <Col N="993" /> representatives of the people and entitled to speak on their behalf in all matters affecting legislation.  These representatives of the people are proposing, without consulting the people, to confer upon an undemocratic body the right to interfere with the legislation which we, as the people's representatives, consider necessary for the people's welfare&mdash;to give them the right to hold it up for two years. Deputy de Valera stated that the normal life of the Dáil is probably four years.  I am sorry to disagree with him.  That is not my opinion.  The normal life of the Dáil has been much less.  If we take the period of existence of the four or five Dala which have existed here, we will find that the average life is about two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume there is a difference.  In due course, when the present Government has been removed and a Fianna Fáil Government elected, the normal period and the average period will probably be the full period of five years.  But at present we must take the average to be the normal, because the normal has been the average, and that has been about two years.  It is for the average period during which the Dáil remains in existence that we propose to confer upon the Seanad, which remains for a much longer period, the power to hold up legislation.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that we will not be able to convince the Government of the unwisdom of their action.  They are, I think, beyond redemption in matters of that kind.  They have, no doubt, arrived at some arrangement or understanding, as a result of which this Bill has been introduced.  They are going to confer upon the Seanad this power, or else we presume they will resign as a Government if the Dáil refuses to co-operate with them.  I have no doubt that the Dáil will co-operate with them, that the Bill will be passed and that the Seanad will get this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, therefore, to draw the attention of the Government to a matter on which it might be possible to get some alteration of their opinions.  Is it necessary <Col N="994" /> that the procedure by which the veto of the Seanad will be exercised should be as complicated as this?  If somebody sat down, or if a Committee sat down, to devise the most complicated procedure possible, could they have beaten this?  Was it not possible to say that the Seanad will have the right to hold up a Bill for twenty months, and if at the end of twenty months no agreement has been reached the Bill becomes law in spite of them? That would be quite simple.  But what happens here?  This Dáil in its wisdom passes a Bill, and that Bill goes to the Seanad, and the Seanad can either reject, amend, or refuse to consider it.  If they reject it or amend it in a manner not agreeable to the Dáil, or refuse to consider it, a period of eighteen months elapses.  After the conclusion of that eighteen months, the Dáil has discretion for a further period of twelve months to consider whether or not it will pass a resolution concerning the Bill.  If it does pass a resolution the Bill goes again to the Seanad, and if the Seanad refuses to pass it, or to amend it in a manner agreeable to the Dáil, or to consider it, the Dáil, at the expiration of another period of sixty days, again passes a resolution, and then the Bill proceeds to the Governor-General to get his signature across the bottom of it.  There are five separate stages: The Dáil passes the Bill; the Seanad does something with the Bill; the Dáil passes a resolution; the Seanad again does something with the Bill&mdash;rejects it; and the Dáil passes another resolution; and all to effect what I suggest could be effected by a much simpler procedure.  What you want to do is to give to this collection of Lords, Dukes, Earls, and people of that kind, the right to veto our decision.  Could you not say definitely that the Seanad will have the right to hold up a Bill passed by the Dáil, with which they disagree, for a period of twenty months, and that if in the meantime agreement cannot be reached, then the Bill becomes law despite the collection?  That is all that is required.  Instead of that we have a sentence here consisting of some twenty lines, each line containing about ten words.  It is broken up by several provisoes, commas, brackets, <Col N="995" /> and things of that kind, all establishing an elaborate machinery that I contend is unnecessary.  Then a number of provisions are added, all equally complicated, and all equally designed to do the one thing, which could be done in a much simpler manner.</P>
    <P>There is one sub-section of the Bill with which I am in complete agreement. It is, strange to say, a sub-section that the President in his introductory remarks did not refer to, and because he did not refer to it, I propose to refer to it and to indicate the reasons why the sub-section should be carried. That is sub-section (c) of Section 1, to delete the following sentence in Article 38:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When a Bill other than a Money Bill has been sent to Seanad Eireann a joint meeting of the members of both Houses may, on a resolution passed by Seanad Eireann, be convened for the purpose of debating, but not voting, upon the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a senseless provision which it is just as well to get rid of.  Certainly no one on this side of the House has any desire to meet these Senators, and join in a joint sitting to discuss anything. We do not believe any useful purpose would be served by it or any light thrown upon our discussions.  If the President will agree to delete all the other sections of the Bill and leave that one sub-section in it, I am for it, but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>To summarise my objections to the Bill: They are, first of all, that the Seanad should not have power to veto at all.  If they have power to veto, as they have under the existing Constitution, it should not be the function of this Dáil to increase these powers.  If it is proposed to increase the powers, or allow them to retain the powers, a Bill doing so should be worded in a manner that an ordinary individual could understand, and not be a sort of Chinese puzzle, as this is.  For these reasons, I hope the Dáil will reject the Bill, and I hope they will reject it also because, while I am certain that the majority of Deputies present have not read it, they <Col N="996" /> will have been convinced of its nature by the very confused statement concerning it with which the President introduced it.  I hope the Dáil will reject the Bill, and I move the amendment to postpone it for twelve months in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that while the President is at it he might delete as a consistent part of this work the Preamble of the Constitution Act which acknowledges that all lawful authority comes from God to the people.  He might delete that as a joke as soon as he has passed these amendment Bills.  This series of amendments to the Constitution is in fact the answer of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to the coming of the Fianna Fáil Party into this House.  The Public Safety Act was the remedy if we stayed out, and this is the remedy to prevent us making any progress in this House now that we have come in.  Bills of this sort will have a most invidious effect upon Irish life, because they are making a new attack upon a certain minority in this country absolutely necessary, giving them power to interfere with the national life of the country to such an extent that the country will lose all patience with them, and their condition in the end will be worse than it has been in this country before.  In fact the best and the worst that can be said of this Bill is that it does give that type of minority in this country enough rope to hang itself with.  Two years' delay means that a party after it has been in power for two years can at that stage take it for granted that anything in the nature of controversial legislation will be a dead letter, because it will be held up for the life of that Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President seemed to think that because Deputy de Valera was in a minority of one in the Committee, in his view on the matter of the Seanad, that therefore his view was to be taken lightly.  As a matter of fact, it was rather a reflection upon those who represented the Cumann na nGaedheal Party on that Committee that they should be willing to give away the rights and privileges of the House. There is not a great deal that I can say about this Bill.  In principle it is a very simple one.  It is crude enough, <Col N="997" /> and will be an added argument in the mouths of those who are trying to prove that there is no possibility of making use of any institutions in the Free State for the purpose of forwarding the cause of Irish freedom.  It is playing directly into the hands of the younger generation of revolutionaries in this country.  And although we come along here in a humdrum kind of way, taking it for granted that different people will take different views, and we get accustomed to one another, at the same time, in the light of subsequent history, those imposing those limitations upon the progress of the nation will figure in a very sorry light. They will figure as those who have been condemned in the past for opposing the will of the people, for playing the game of the British, and will figure in the future as those who are taking up the attitude of doing the work of the only enemy that Ireland has ever had.  This Bill, if nothing else would, would justify all opposition being put up to the Government.  It is antidemocratic, it is anti-national, and upon those grounds I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment, moved by Deputy Lemass, asking that the consideration of this change in the Constitution should be postponed for 12 months.  When the Joint Committee of both Houses was appointed to discuss the question of the Constitution, it was appointed, as far as I can make out, with special reference to the pending elections of the Seanad.  It was quite natural that in their recommendations the Committee should make proposals to make the procedure for the election to the next Seanad more expeditious and more easy. But whatever the views of the members of this House who are in favour of the Government policy of passing legislation to put all these recommendations of the Committee into operation, I am sure that if they could look at it, from the broad national point of view, or from the democratic point of view, they will see that there is something more at issue than the mere question of the procedure as to the election to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in this Bill, as Deputy Little <Col N="998" /> pointed out, something which no one can say can be regarded as purely a political issue that is raised by one side of this House any more than another. It is an issue that affects all parties in the House, and that is the issue as to whether or not this Dáil, which is elected by the people, is to be sovereign and representative in making the laws of this country, or whether it is now, at this stage, going to place in the hands of the Seanad powers which they had not before for the holding up of legislation.  I suggest that if you are going to make a change of that kind in the Constitution, which will radically affect the relation between the two Houses, without members having had the opportunity of viewing the thing from the point of view of constitutional development&mdash;if they look at it from that narrow point of view alone&mdash;without having the opportunity of examining it from that point of view, and show that you are deaf to all entreaties from this side, to look at it from a national point of view, I think you are setting a very dangerous precedent.</P>
    <P>The English House of Lords is a very old-established institution which had very strong rights grown up after centuries of normal development.  It held a well-established place in the English legislature.  Under modern conditions it was found, no matter what might have been the value of the House of Lords at one time, that modern circumstances demanded that there should be a definite change, and that the Lower House should definitely assert its superiority. Here we are not alone going to change the method of election and to give the Seanad, as it seems to me, much larger powers than the Second House can elsewhere claim in regard to money matters, but we are also, of our own deliberate initiative and our own free will, going to place another body superior to the people&mdash;another body which, no matter what Government may be returned here, and no matter what mandate it may have to carry out certain legislation, will have the power, no matter what the will of the people may be to the contrary, to hold up that legislation for a period of two years.  Holding it up for such a long period is not, in my opinion, as the President insinuated, <Col N="999" /> merely giving sufficient time to think over it and to discuss it.</P>
    <P>We must assume that if you have normal conditions and you have two large parties working in a normal parliamentary manner, any party that in future will form a Government will come back from the country with a majority, with a mandate behind it, and the questions which it will endeavour to legislate will have been discussed thoroughly and will have been understood by the people, if they are not understood now.  We can assume that in the course of time the people will have a better knowledge of these matters, and you now want to close the door to that line of development.  You do not want to give the people the chance to see whether constitutional amendments will be made possible or not.  Will you destroy the right of the Referendum?  Will you take away that power from the people?  You ought to be consistent if you do so, and take away the power also from the Seanad; but you are not doing that.  You take from the will of the people which you prate so much about on the one hand, and at the same time you attack your chief opposition and you hand over new powers to the Seanad when, if you have any faith at all in democratic power, you should equally weaken the Seanad which cannot speak for the people, which has not the same foundation as the Referendum itself would have, or as any body elected to this House would have.  It is a body which has no claim to say that it has the same democratic sanction as the people themselves. While you abolish the Referendum, you deliberately hand over to the Seanad an additional power, and what you pretend to take away with one hand you hand back with the other.</P>
    <P>What is the reason of that?  Are we to assume that you are really working on a definite policy?  If you are working on a definite policy, and if you believe the right thing to do is to take away this power from the people and take it away from the Dáil, why not be logical and take it away also from the Seanad?  What is the reason for giving the power to the Seanad to hold up legislation?  Is there any sanction <Col N="1000" /> or any argument from any other Parliament in the world which could justify it?  I do not believe any Minister on the opposite side can advance any argument, can show any analogy, or give us any case of where a lower chamber of its own initiative gave those powers simply because a certain committee sat, a committee which, in my opinion, was simply an ad hoc committee and had not the resources nor the time at its disposal, nor had it the facilities, to go into the whole question of the relations between the two Houses.  As a result of a few hours sitting of that Committee you are going, at the beginning of the establishment of this new State, to hand over to the Second Chamber a power they could not possibly get without your sanction here.  I suggest that matter is entirely above Party.  It is up to the Government Party who believe that their State is well established, that they have reasonable conditions of stability and security here and that there is a prosperous and peaceful future before the State&mdash;I suggest that they ought to show reasons, historical reasons or democratic reasons, for making this change.</P>
    <P>I say whatever excuse there may have been in 1922 or 1923 to rush legislation of this character through the House without giving Deputies an opportunity to digest it, without giving them at least the same opportunity that it is proposed that the Seanad will have, there is no excuse now.  If there is an attempt to rush the whole thing through in a few hours to give them power to hold up laws for two years, I suggest the question is more important than that.  If we are ever going to get anywhere the Ministry will have to face the thing in a better spirit.  That is not the reply they ought to make to the entry of the Fianna Fáil Party into this House.  I try to look at it as dispassionately as I can.  I say I am in agreement with Deputy Little when he says that we can only regard it as being simply a trick to accomplish that which they could not otherwise secure. It is an attempt to strengthen the powers of the Seanad and give them in addition to the ample powers which they already possess the entirely new power of holding up legislation for <Col N="1001" /> such a long period, which, I think, practically means negativing that type of legislation.  I suggest the House is not cognisant of the facts and is not doing itself justice.  The members of the House, if they are true to themselves and true to Ireland, will stop and ponder over the thing.  They will try to look more clamly than they have been looking at the history of the past two years.  If they are in earnest let those on the other side who say there is a constitutional way show us where the constitutional way is now.  Let them show us how a Party which is returned with a majority will be able to proceed unimpeded in this work of achieving the full national aspirations of the Irish people on constitutional lines.</P>
    <P>If this blockade, this barrier which it is now sought to put in the way of that future majority, is passed by this House into law, I suggest it is incumbent upon them not alone to do that, if they are honest in their argument that there is a constitutional way, but that it is up to them also&mdash;if we can afford to leave the national question out of the matter altogether, and I do not think we can&mdash;to look at it simply from the point of view of the history of development of other countries and to say what are the arguments in favour of this.  Surely the members of the House who have had experience over the past six years and who have taken an interest in the Constitution that we have not taken, who have taken it to their hearts and who believe that there is something in it which could benefit the country and leave the country firm, are not going to allow themselves to be jockeyed into a false position on the pretence that there is an obstruction policy, and are going to create an obstruction which will be the obstruction of a body which will have no claim to speak for the Irish people, and which will not represent the plain people of Ireland.  On the mere pretence, the excuse, that obstruction is being offered in this House&mdash;and why not, when arguments are not produced to defend the legislation that is sought to be passed? &mdash;are they going to be so bereft of their dignity as Deputies and representatives of the people, and are they going to think so little of the future of their <Col N="1002" /> country as to vote simply and purely from the Party point of view because they are told to vote in a certain way? I appeal to the members on the opposite side to view the question more sancly and more dispassionately than that, and to agree with me that this whole question is really a serious question and an important question.  This question of the additional powers of the Seanad ought to be discussed quite separately.  There has been no reason given for bringing this measure forward at this particular juncture.</P>
    <P>When the President was questioned in his opening statement on the reason for urgency in connection with this Bill, he was not able to state it.  He simply put forward an argument which I venture to think had little thought behind it.  The President was anxious to get his summer holidays.  He is so anxious to rush business that he cannot take time to explain what he means when he says that the simple proposal and the whole object of the Bill is to delay legislation and give the Seanad and Dáil sufficient time to consider matters and come to an agreement.  I cannot believe that.  I have heard no argument which would lead me to believe that this is an honest effort to help us towards real peace in the country and real freedom.  I can only regard it as a trick, as an endeavour on the part of a Government who feel that they may be at any time displaced from office, and they want to leave something very definite after them.  I say they have no mandate for that, and if they went to the people to-morrow on the whole question of the Seanad they would find the country would not support them.</P>
    <P>They have no right, even though they may have what they interpreted as a general mandate to set up a certain type of Government and a certain institution, to come along now without having said anything to the people at the election with regard to extending the powers of the Seanad, and act in this fashion under the pretext of arranging for a Seanad election.  They are now trying to alter the Constitution by a subterfuge.  They now come to alter the Constitution, and they are taking a serious step like this, which <Col N="1003" /> may cause trouble in the future and which may waste the energies of the country in a fresh struggle between the two Houses.  This is a matter which requires fuller consideration than we can give it at present.  The proper course is to delete this measure until we have had wiser constitutional opinion on the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Whatever way I vote on this Bill, I can assure the House that I will be glad to hear what is the real view of the Government on this matter.  Are they in earnest in trying to perfect the Constitution or are they simply trying to destroy the Constitution, to tear and render it asunder, not in any way with a view to making it for the good of the country, but simply for their own political advantage, trying to hold themselves in power for a slightly longer period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that we ought to put quite clearly and definitely on the records of the House our opinion of what the meaning and purpose of this Bill is.  It is a bargain made under blackmail with a superior authority. It is compensation to a self-reproducing, nominated Assembly for disturbance in the vested interest it has built up in interfering with the will of the elected Assembly.  That is the definition of the Bill: Compensation to a nominated, self-reproducing Assembly for disturbance in its vested interests in interfering with the will of the elected Assembly. That an elected Assembly of those responsible to an elected Assembly should of its own free will and volition introduce such a Bill is unthinkable. One would have to look very carefully for motives which are not the customary motives by which honest and honourable men justify their actions, in order to find a free elected Assembly doing anything of that kind. There would have to be some suggestion of a bargain, some suggestion of a consideration, or of compensation to that elected Assembly before one could conceive any such thing being done, and what is perfectly obvious is, that whoever is getting a consideration and whoever is getting compensation, it is not either the elected Assembly or that to which the elected Assembly is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must assume that the actual pressure of superior force not merely <Col N="1006" /> exists, but is in operation.  What is the force which enables this nominated, self-reproducing Assembly to enforce, against the elected Assembly, compensation for a vested interest of that character?  It is the Constitution as it exists.  As the Constitution at present exists, the Seanad has the power to hold up, not merely this law, and not merely all laws which pass from this House to it, but to select out of the series of laws which are sent to it that which suits itself, and to reject that which does not suit itself for a period which is altogether longer than the period which intervenes between this date and the date at which an election under the old system shall take place. They could have it either way.  They are in a position to compel this House to make for them better terms than exist under the existing Constitution, and therefore we are forced, if we touch the existing structure at all&mdash; remember, we were not compelled to touch the existing structure&mdash;to alter it in a direction and in a nature which would be beneficial to that self-reproducing, nominated Assembly as against the elected Assembly which derives its power and its authority from the people.</P>
    <P>I want the House to consider that in relation to this Bill and to every one of the Bills which had to do with the election of the Seanad, which has to do with Articles 48 and 47, that in all these matters the choice is completely and absolutely in the hands of the Seanad.  They can pick out of these ten Bills Nos. 5, 7, 9, 13 and 14 to be passed, the others to be rejected, and once they leave our hands we have no power to prevent that choice.  Not merely can they compel us in relation to every individual Bill&mdash;that is the explanation of this Bill to give them better terms than exist under the existing Constitution&mdash;but they can pick out of the bunch exactly what suits them.  They can pass them in spite of us. once they have left our hands, and they can reject for a period too long for us to get control of them those that they do not like.  I do not want to suggest to these good people some of the powers which possibly they may not have adverted to their possession of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> Perhaps I am optimistic in assuming that they do not know the full extent of their power, and the extremely foolish and parlous position in which we are putting ourselves in sending them a whole series of Bills of this kind.  They can do much more than I have told you, and my opinion is, from what I have known of the Seanad and from what I know of the ability of the malevolent brains which do exist there, that they do know, and that this Bill has blackmail written in every line. That is my chief objection to this Bill. It gives power to tighten the grip.  It is usual nowadays to recognise the formula that political liberty without economic self-control is simply for all practical purposes a contradiction in terms.  Not merely is this country controlled politically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Here you have a Bill deliberately limiting the power of the elected assembly&mdash;the assembly which is elected upon a manhood suffrage of 21 years, and with proportional representation. What reasonable idea&mdash;I am not suggesting for a moment there is any democratic idea, but I am assuming that is an open question&mdash;or what sound political or economical purpose has been exhibited and has been given as a justification for limiting in this country by a nominated assembly the complete control of the democratic assembly by the less democratic?  I think I am speaking now within the knowledge of the House, within the recollection of all that was said from the Treasury Bench, and if anything has been said from the non-political <Col N="1008" /> benches, that no suggestion or reason has been given.  We are simply told that is the purpose, that is the machinery, but no one has suggested even that they ought to give any justification for that deliberate invasion of the democratic principle, nor has anyone attempted to show&mdash;I can imagine the argument being put, but it has not been put up, nor has it been attempted &mdash;that that vested interest in interfering with the right of the democratic branch of the legislature to express the will of the people is founded on any sound principles of advantage to the country.  Again&mdash;I speak within the recollection of the House&mdash;has it been put before you that the actual composition of that assembly, with the history of its individuals, and with the corelated brilliance of the whole of its people, what characteristic in wealth or in station to the people has given them a legitimate vested interest in interfering with the free functioning and expression in law of the will of this people?  We have had no suggestion that I have heard of, and we are entitled to it, as to why they are entitled to hold vested interest and where it arises and from what it arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance, now that he has come back, will tell us why this nondemocratic, self-reproducing, nominated body should have a vested interest in interfering with the expression of the will of what we will call the Lower House.  No one has.  Are we simply to take it that because of this compensation for vested interests that it must be a vested interest, and that that vested interest must be legitimate, that because it has been allowed for one reason or another to hold up the will of this people if it chooses for nine months, that it has got a property in the power of holding up, and that that has to be compensated for by increasing the time limit over which they can operate?  To me that is an amazing proposition.  It is a proposition I would like to hear argued. and I would like to see justified, but certainly it is not right, it is not fair, it is not respectful to the House, and it is not democratic to offer us simply that proposition without any justification whatever and to ask us to swallow it whole.  Personally <Col N="1009" /> I will not swallow it whole. At some time or other and by some machinery or other, the thing that is being attempted to be done here now will be upset.  Why is it being done? It is being done because it is part of a policy to ensure that that grip which now exists shall not be disturbed by any combination of the popular will in the reasonably anticipated future.  The sands are shifting.  The people are coming together.  There are possibilities again of a national spirit.  I am not speaking now of this side of the House nor of any other side of the House.  I am speaking of the fact that it is possible to co-relate and coordinate all sections of the national will to give its expression in the voting power of the electorate.  This whole thing is part of the machinery of seeing that that shall not operate, and exactly in the same way as on national grounds we think that we are not merely entitled, but we are bound to oppose the possession of the means of production, the means of life, and the possibilities of development in this country by certain existing powers inside and outside of this country.  So too, on exactly the same grounds, we are bound to attack and to prevent the development, under this Bill, or any other Bill, of that strength into a more effective position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem to me extraordinary that we should be sitting up all night for the purpose of devising machinery to delay us in legislation. I mean that is a very remarkable proposition.  The whole object of this Bill is to delay, to put a brake on the power of this House to legislate&mdash; I mean time delay&mdash;to extend from 9 months to 20 months the power of some outside body to interfere with our legislation.  Are we in such a hurry to delay that for 20 months that we must stay up all night to do it?  Does it seem a reasonable proposition that we should be asked to sit up all night hastily to drive through legislation in order to compensate a nominated, self-reproducing chamber for disturbance in the vested interest it has in interfering with our legislation?  I think it is the most extraordinary proposition that has ever been put before the House.  It is one which nobody with a sense of respect and certainly with a sense of humour would dare offer to an intelligent assembly.  Apart really from the mere point of view of a sense of humour and proportion, certainly from the point of view of any democratic idea, it is a disgrace to the Ministry from which it comes, and it will be a disgrace to the House that passes it if it does pass it.</P>

      <P>It might happen that a Bill which would be quite non-controversial, like, say, the Slaughtered Animals Bill, might have been passed and have gone to the Seanad.  Then, say, within a month of its being passed a dissolution might take place.  That dissolution would rob the Seanad of <Col N="1011" /> any right to examine the Bill, because immediately on the re-assembly the 18 months would be taken as having expired. The object was to enable a Bill like that to run through its stages again and be sent up to the Seanad so that it might be treated as an ordinary Bill.</P>

      <P>Before you put the motion for the closure, we on this side must protest very strongly against the attitude of the Minister in moving it. This Bill was introduced at 1 o'clock. We have been discussing it for 2½ hours. It is a Bill to amend the Constitution and to confer greater powers on the Seanad, and after 2½ hours discussion the Minister thinks it is right to move the closure, that the matter has been sufficiently debated.  I suggest that that is an unwarranted usurpation on the part of the Minister.  Every member in this House is entitled to participate in a debate to amend the Constitution, and every member in this <Col N="1012" /> House who may have pertinent or relevant ideas on the matter is entitled to express them.  At least he would be if it were not as I tried to say in my speech here that the Executive Council are setting themselves up as an autocracy on this Constitution.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That not more than four hours be given to the Committee Stages of each or any of the following Bills, that is to say, the Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Bill, 1928, the Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, 1928, and the Constitution (Amendment No. 13) Bill, 1928, and that the proceedings in Committee in each or any of the aforesaid Bills, if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at the expiration of the aforesaid period of four hours, and that any amendments to each or any of the aforesaid Bills not disposed of shall forthwith be put from the Chair and be decided without further amendment or debate;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That not more than two hours be given to the Report Stages of each or any of the aforesaid Bills, and that the proceedings on the Report Stages of each or any of the aforesaid Bills, if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at the expiration of the aforesaid period of two hours and that any amendments to each or any of the aforesaid Bills not previously disposed of, shall be put forthwith from the Chair and decided without further amendment or debate and that the question, `That the Bill be received for final consideration' or `That the Bill as amended be received for final consideration,' as the case may be, shall be put forthwith from the Chair and decided without debate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I venture to hope that this motion will commend itself to all parties.  Our Standing Orders at present make no provision for dealing with such a thing as deliberate obstruction or members speaking at great length or with great frequency for the purpose of taking up the time of the Dáil.  We have a provision which we have found useful, particularly during the last two or three days, for the closure, but that provision is not really sufficient to meet the circumstances that have arisen.  It was intended for use merely when Deputies who had something to say in a debate and were anxious to say it, and were not, at the same time, anxious to delay the business of the Dáil, but that time would not admit of their being heard. That provision exists, therefore, for bringing the debate to a close.  During the last two days we have, in my opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, according to Article 20 of the Constitution, I submit that the Minister has no power to introduce this resolution into the House at all.  Article 20 says: &ldquo;Each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders, with power to <Col N="1021" /> attach penalties for their infringement, and shall have power to ensure freedom of debate.&rdquo; and so on.  It does not empower the House to make Standing Orders to curtail the freedom of debate. That is a serious legal point, and one which I contend should be submitted to the Law Officers of the Government.  To take an analogous point, namely, the power of attorney which gives positive powers that so-and-so may do certain things.  That power is of no use for negative purposes, for not doing certain things.  I submit that until you change Article 20 you are acting ultra vires in accepting this resolution, and I suggest further that the matter should be submitted for decision to the Law Officers of the Government.</P>

      <P>On the question that this matter should be submitted to the Law Officers of the Government for decision, I am not prepared to agree that a decision of the Law Officers would constitute a decision in this matter, which is a matter of order.  The Deputy asked me to rule that no motion and, in fact, no standing order intended to curtail debate in the House can be discussed in the House because of the provision in Article 20.  I am not prepared to decide in that particular direction that the Constitution means that the House is debarred from making any Standing Order which it thinks fit for the conduct of its own business.  The meaning of the Article seems to me to be that the House has power to make any Standing Order under that Article which it pleases within the limits of that particular Article.  There are other Standing Orders which restrict debate and I think this motion is in order.</P>

      <P>Would I be in order in submitting that question to a Court? The difficulty is that there is a sort of omnibus Order which says that the Ceann Comhairle is the sole judge of order.  That is a very powerful Order. If we submit this to the courts and they hold that the legal interpretation given by a lawyer in this House of that legal provision of the Constitution is, as Deputy Little stated, we are going to be in a very curious position in relation <Col N="1022" /> to our powers to pass Standing Orders which give a power that would be contrary to the express judgment of a court in a matter of law.  It seems to me that we are getting into a very serious position in relation to Standing Orders.  As I understand it, you have a sort of hierarchy in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the point I am putting is that the Constitution overrides Standing Orders, that Standing Orders over-ride precedents, and that precedents over-ride rulings and that they must be taken in that order, that you could never plead a ruling against a precedent, plead a precedent against a Standing Order, or plead a Standing Order against the Constitution. Deputy Little appealed to the highest authority and nothing that is customary, nothing that is in a Standing Order is of the same or even an analogous authority to the Constitution which Deputy Little has pleaded.  The Standing Orders, precedents and rules derive authority, if they have any authority, from the Constitution, and when an appeal is made to the Constitution against even the more probable meaning in a legal sense of a legal phrase in a legal document, which is the Constitution, I suggest that we are doing a rather reckless thing, from the legal point of view and from the point of view of constitutional procedure, if we attempt even to suggest that Standing Orders, precedents or rulings can stand for a moment against even the most&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was about to say, there has been during the past two or three days what most members of the House regard as absolutely deliberate obstruction and waste of time of the House.  The Standing Orders, as I have said, do not provide for dealing <Col N="1023" /> with such a line of action.  We do not propose at the moment to amend Standing Orders.  We think it is better, if it can be managed, to retain Standing Orders and allow freedom of debate, even though that freedom may be abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies are asking questions which will take a good while to answer.  We have set down a motion which is extremely moderate.  I have another one or two in draft in case they are necessary, but I hope they will not be necessary.  As I say, this motion is extremely moderate.  It allows four hours on the Committee Stage.  That is more than ample time if Deputies speak briefly and only when they have some arguments to advance.  The Committee Stage would be got through in less than four hours and every point would be adequately debated. We have, as I say, allotted four hours to the Committee Stage and the motion proposes to allow two hours to the Report Stage.  That also will permit ample discussion if there is no unnecessary talk and if Deputies put their points as briefly as possible.  The fixing of a definite time is in itself an advantage as it restores freedom of debate. While obstruction is going on Deputies who are anxious to have the business discussed as quickly as possible feel bound to refrain from intervention and sometimes they are unable to put the point of view which they desire to put and which they ought to have a reasonable opportunity of putting.  When a definite time has been fixed as is proposed by this motion, every Deputy who wishes to intervene and to take part in the debate, as soon as the previous speaker has sat down can take his chance of catching the Speaker's eye.  We have not had that freedom of debate during the last few days.  I do not want to speak at all on the question of obstruction. It seems to me that the Deputies who indulged in it have been misled by the false analogy of their political predecessors, who thought that if they held out in the Four Courts it would have the same effect as the action of those who held out in the G.P.O.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go any further into it except to say that these Deputies thought a day or two ago that by carrying on the tactics which the old Irish Party carried on in the British House of Commons it would <Col N="1025" /> lead to certain results and perhaps that they would obtain support in the country as a result.  I believe that they were entirely misled, but in any case it seems to me that it is incumbent on the House if necessary to amend Standing Orders and to pass drastic Standing Orders to prevent the time of Deputies and of the House being wasted and to prevent public business being dealt with with reasonable dispatch.  There is no doubt that a certain amount of debate must take place.</P>

      <P>The idea that some Deputies have that the longer a thing is talked about the better it is discussed is entirely wrong, and I think it certainly would be foolish to have taking place here debates of the type that took place on the Treaty, when everybody who spoke made set speeches which had no reference to the course of the discussion prior to that.  I think it would be very foolish to allow that.  I propose a motion that is a very mild and moderate motion, and I hope it will suffice.  If it does not suffice of course we can pass some others.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has no right, no Deputy has the right, to get up in the course of a debate on a particular matter and ask the Ceann Comhairle to supply him with information which, so far as he has gone, does not seem to have any relevance to a point of order that is to be made in a matter before the House. The Ceann Comhairle, if he is to be asked questions, must be asked questions relevant to the matter before the House.  If he is to be asked questions at large, he should, in the ordinary way, have some notice of such question. The question the Deputy asked is a very easy one to answer, but I am very anxious that the occupant of the Chair should not be given an intolerable and an impossible task, and I refuse to accept the principle that a Deputy can get up and ask a question which has no relevance to the motion before us.  If it has any relevance the Deputy should explain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I submit to you is that this resolution could never be introduced as a proposal for a specific Standing Order, as it, in effect, proposes to apply the closure in anticipation, and there is no power under Standing Orders which permits you to decide that the closure shall be applied at a certain specific time in the debate. That would be in itself a new Standing Order.  That would be introducing, in itself, what is known as the guillotine in another place, and there has been no specific provision in the Standing Order for a measure of that description.  If they intend proposing to adopt that process as part of the ordinary rule of debate in this House, as part of the rules of debate which are going to govern a particular measure, it can only be introduced.  I submit, as a new Standing Order.  That is the point of order I am putting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point of order is that the motion on the Order Paper is, in fact, a Standing Order, and should be subjected to the processes to which Standing Orders are subjected.  That is one point.  The other point is that there is no power in the Standing Orders to enable any Deputy to move a motion such as this, to make a rule such as it is proposed to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Without due notice having been given beforehand, that this is a Standing Order, that it cannot be introduced as it is at present, and that in view of the fact that it has not been introduced as a Standing Order it cannot now be considered, that notice of motion has been given but not notice of a new Standing Order, and so the ordinary rules in regard to a motion do not apply, that if what the Minister for Finance is proposing has to be considered in this House at all that the motion must be withdrawn, and introduced again as a Standing Order. That is the point I wish to make.  I would specifically also like to stress this particular point, that, as I said before, you cannot under the Standing Orders anticipate the application of the closure or you cannot apply the closure in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The <Col N="1028" /> Deputy's point is that this is a proposal for a new Standing Order.  That is not so.  It is a proposal for an Order of the House relating to the Committee and Report Stages of particular Bills. It is not an Order which would apply to business generally.  It is a motion which, if adopted, would become an Order of the House and would have validity only with regard to these particular Bills.</P>
      <P>That is on the point of the Standing Orders.  The other point, I think, is that this is a proposal for an Order of the House for which he finds no authority under the Standing Orders, that, in fact, it applies the closure in anticipation, and that the closure can only be applied under the provisions of Standing Order 52.  We do not require specific authority under the Standing Orders for making Orders of the House.  The power of the House to conduct its own business must be regarded as altogether unlimited, and unless the Deputy can point to a Standing Order which would specifically exclude this kind of motion, then this kind of motion would be in order. Unless something in the Standing Orders or in the general procedure of the House, can be cited as being against this particular type of motion, then this motion is in order.  The matter was, in fact, considered, and I think it does not require a specific Standing Order giving authority for the making of this kind of Order of the House. Therefore, this is not a proposal for a Standing Order.  It is a proposal for an Order of the House, which, it must be assumed, the House is competent to make, and there appears to me to be nothing in Standing Order 52 which would prevent the House from making this particular kind of Order on any Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I submit that you are bound by Standing Order 52 in so far as Standing Order 52 states&mdash;at least it does not specifically state it, but it implies&mdash;that the closure cannot be moved until after a question has been proposed from the Chair, either in the Dáil or in Committee of the whole Dáil, when a Deputy may claim to move, &ldquo;That the question be now put.&rdquo;  It restricts <Col N="1029" /> the closure to questions which have been already proposed from the Chair. The point I have made I think still stands, that this is an attempt to closure the debate in advance.  Now, with regard to that, there is no Standing Order under which that can be done, at least I contend that there is not.</P>

      <P>I submit that we are bound to conduct the business in accordance with this Standing Order, and that no specific Order of the House, beyond one to suspend the Standing Orders, can set these Standing Orders aside in respect of any Bill, proposal, or motion put before the House; that nothing except a motion to suspend Standing Orders can set Standing Orders aside, and that, until Standing Orders have been so set aside, the business in this House must be conducted in accordance with them, and that no motion or order in relation to any one particular Bill or proposal can be introduced validly unless the Standing Orders have been suspended for the purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>A motion would have to be introduced for the suspension of the Standing Orders to consider a matter of extreme urgency.  According to Standing Order 129, any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended for the day of sitting and for a particular purpose.  I think that that is very important.  I think that the power to suspend or over-ride the Standing Orders by any special Order or motion is very strictly limited.  I think there is only one way in which it <Col N="1030" /> can be possibly done, and that is by giving due notice that on the day when it is proposed to take these Bills, a motion will be introduced to suspend the Standing Order or Orders in regard to these particular measures.  I think that is a relevant point.  I think that in considering that point you must also take into consideration Article 20 of the Constitution, that each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders.  Rules are not mere temporary, ephemeral things introduced as the exigencies of Party procedure require. Rules are something that have to be carefully considered and defined and decided upon, and when once decided upon must stand until revoked.  You cannot introduce a rule ad hoc simply for the purpose of permitting you to do something which, under the Standing Orders, you are forbidden to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, will the Deputy explain under what Standing Order this particular procedure is forbidden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is forbidden under the whole Standing Orders, in so far as no provision for the conduct of debate upon these lines has been included in the Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On that definite point, I am prepared to decide without any difficulty.  The House is entitled to direct its own procedure, bound by the Standing Orders.  But to say that, because the Standing Orders make no express provision for this particular procedure, it is a procedure which it would be disorderly for the House to discuss and decide upon, is not valid.  On that point, I am ruling quite clearly against the Deputy.  This is not a Standing Order.  It is an Order of the House dealing with a special thing, and it is not in contravention of any Standing Order.  The Deputy has not quoted any Standing Order which, it may be argued, is contrary to it.  For that reason, the motion is in order, as far as the points the Deputy raised are concerned. The position about Standing Orders is, that the House has power to make any regulations which it may deem proper for the conduct of its own business, and that without any limitation whatsoever.  When it makes Standing <Col N="1031" /> Orders, it cannot make other regulations in contravention of these Standing Orders without suspending a particular Standing Order or Orders.  In this case no suspension of any particular Standing Order or Orders appears to be necessary.  Therefore, this particular motion is in order without the suspension of any Standing Order.  The House may, by resolution, decide any question of procedure.  This particular motion does not suspend Standing Order 52.</P>

Here I find that it is not necessary to suspend any Standing Order, and I am ruling this motion, as far as Deputy MacEntee's points are concerned, as being in order.</P>

If the House decides on a particular procedure, and if that is in contravention of the Standing Orders, it must suspend the Standing Orders.  That has been made abundantly clear.

      <P>I am submitting that for the moment.  The suggestion here, &ldquo;shall have been adequately discussed,&rdquo; seems to me to be the most probable meaning there.  If there was no power to suspend the Standing Orders I could see the Chair possibly using a more or less probable meaning in relation to the Standing Order, but in so far as the apparent meaning of the Standing Order is &ldquo;shall have been after the event satisfied that adequate discussion has taken place&rdquo; there is a perfectly orderly procedure to get over that doubt by suspending the Standing Orders.  The most regular way would seem to be to suspend the Standing Orders and then bring in this resolutions in the way that the Standing Order seems to specifically say&mdash;that is, the one of adopting Deputy MacEntee's suggestion that you shall first suspend, as you have the power to do, the Standing Order, and in so doing you have suspended the apparent obligation that is on you.</P>

      <P>If we take the amendments handed in, there are four on the Order Paper, and there are five others.  In my judgement there are two ways of discussing the amendments to this motion.  Amendment 1 (a) is to delete the first part of the motion, lines 1 to 10 inclusive.  That is the widest amendment, and if I accepted this amendment, I would put the question first: &ldquo;That these words stand part of the motion.&rdquo;  Amendment 2 (d) is to delete the second part of the motion, the part which deals with the Report Stage.  That is the next amendment that would be put.  That is one way of putting the question on these amendments.  The other way of putting the amendments would be this: Amendment 1 by Deputy Lemass is, I think, out of order, because it proposes a suspension of the Standing Order, which should be done by substantive motion.  Amendment 2 proposes to delete the word &ldquo;hours&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sittings.&rdquo;  That is in both the case of the Report and Committee Stages.  Amendment 3 proposes to delete the word &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute the word twelve, and to delete &ldquo;two&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;eight.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the question of these two amendments <Col N="1037" /> could be most usefully put by dividing the Committee Stage and the Report Stage, and by putting the question relating to four hours in the first part of the motion and then putting the question in regard to the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; in the second part of the motion.  Either of these amendments would decide the question at issue.  The amendments on the Order Paper which were in time and are in order are quite satisfactory to get a decision on the question.</P>

      <P>Tuesday was the first preceding day.  Monday was the second; Sunday was a dies non and does not count, and Saturday was the third preceding day, so that the motion, in order to be in order and to be permitted to be discussed here in accordance with the ruling which you have given relative to the amendments to that motion, should have been handed in before 11 a.m. on Friday.  For the reason, and in accordance with the ruling which you have already given relative to the amendments which were proposed to that motion and which could not, by reason of the fact that Sunday was a dies non, have been handed in in time to comply with Standing Order 25, I submit that the motion is out of order and cannot be considered to-day on account of insufficient notice.  I do not submit that it is out of order, but it should not appear, and it is improperly on the Order Paper on the grounds of insufficient notice.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point appears correct.  The <Col N="1039" /> motion was circulated and the amendments were circulated; the amendments which arrived on Tuesday, strictly speaking, should have arrived on Monday.  We circulated the amendments received on Tuesday.  Other amendments were received too late on Saturday.  This particular motion was received after 11 o'clock on Friday.  In its final form it was not there until Saturday, and for that reason the motion has not four days' notice.  None of the amendments is in order from that point of view, but the motion and the amendments are in order on the basis that they are all one day late, and they are all subject to the same position from that point of view.</P>

We take it as a courtesy, I will not even press it as a right for the moment, if the Minister would prefer to do it as a matter of courtesy.  It looks as if we are going to get it as a right.  There is a desire, however, to have a good feeling within this House, and we prefer it as a matter of courtesy rather than compulsion.

If it were now to be ruled that that was wrong, it would mean certainly that the ruling and that the general practice of this House for a very considerable period has been entirely wrong.  There might be arguments for treating Sunday as a dies non, but there is no order with regard to it.

      <P>In support of the Minister's point.  I draw your <Col N="1041" /> attention to Standing Order 28, where, dealing with the matter of questions, it says: &ldquo;but no question shall be handed in on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday.&rdquo;  I take it that there is no suggestion that Saturday is a dies non in any way, or that a public holiday is a dies non, and by implication Sunday is put in specially there to put it in the ordinary category with Saturday or a public holiday.  If it were either implied or specifically stated anywhere in the Standing Orders that it was a dies non, Sunday would not appear in that category there.</P>

That machinery is closed up on Sundays and holidays, and the word &ldquo;question&rdquo; is meant specially to deal with that.  It is a different question altogether with regard to a motion when it is handed in at a certain time on a Saturday, and where it is in time to catch the post, and where it reaches the Deputies in sufficient time.

      <P>I would urge that if we are to take Standing Orders 25 and 28 together, the clear meaning is, that so far as motions are concerned, they might even be put down on a Sunday, and that for the purpose of any notice for motions Sunday is to count.  The wording of the two Standing Orders is very similar.  Standing Order 25 says: &ldquo;And shall reach the clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the 4th preceding day&rdquo; Standing Order 28 says that the &ldquo;questions must be in writing and must reach the Clerk not later than 4 o'clock p.m. on the second day preceding that on which they are to be asked, but no question shall be handed in on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday.&rdquo;  I think you said, sir, that these words were taken out of the Standing Orders with reference to motions.  I had not remembered that they were in.  But if they were in and they were taken out, then obviously the clear intention of the Dáil was to provide that for the purposes of notices of motions, Sunday should count, and that they might even be handed in.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that this question is really settled by Standing Order 25?  Is not this Order prepared under your supervision?  Then I take it from the fact that the motion and certain amendments appear on the Order Paper that you have been satisfied that notice has been given, and that therefore you were satisfied with the notices given and that they complied with the last sentence of the Standing Order 25.  The last sentence of Standing Order 25 says:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that by permission of the Ceann Comhairle motions may be made on shorter notice.&rdquo;  My point is this, that these notices appear on the Order Paper, and that therefore the Ceann Comhairle has satisfied himself that the motion may be moved by his having it inserted on the Order Paper, because the Order Paper is prepared under his supervision.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Thrift, I submit that his points and the points made by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government <Col N="1043" /> have been already ruled on; and that Sunday is a dies non for the purpose of considering all legal documents whatsoever.  Sunday, unless specifically stated otherwise in a particular document, is a dies non.  You are bound, I submit, to be guided by that ordinary rule.  Secondly, in reply to the point made by Deputy Thrift, I respectfully draw your attention to the fact that on account of the fact that Sunday is for all practical purposes and business a dies non, certain amendments which we proposed to hand in with this motion reached the office too late to fulfil the conditions prescribed by Standing Order 25, and reached the office too late, because the real intention of the Standing Order in respect of the motion was not itself fulfilled, in so far as the notice as to this particular motion did not reach Deputies in time to permit those interested in the matter to table amendments which they thought advisable.  On account of the insufficiency of the notice given in regard to that particular motion, these amendments reached the office too late. You have ruled that in view of the fact that they reached the office too late&mdash; that the condition relative to the two days' notice was not complied with&mdash; they could not be considered.  I submit that your ruling in regard to the motion must be in accordance with the ruling you have already given relative to the amendments which we propose to table, and that since these amendments have been ruled out of order on the ground of insufficient notice, the motion itself is out of order, that it is not due to-day for consideration, and should be taken at a later stage.</P>

It seems to me a motion must be ruled out of order before it is moved.  If it could be ruled out of order after it had been moved it could quite easily be ruled out of order when passed.

      <P>I think that Deputy Thrift made the point that because this motion was on the Order Paper it could be discussed.  I think it would be a very dangerous precedent to establish that every motion appearing on the Order Paper is by that very fact in order.  That is exactly what I think Deputy Thrift said&mdash;that any motion appearing on the Order Paper could be discussed and that the fact of its appearing on the Order Paper has to be taken that you have ruled that it could be discussed.  As to the point raised by the Minister for Finance that once a motion is moved it cannot be ruled out of order, I submit that that is ridiculous.  Under the Standing Orders the Ceann Comhairle is the sole judge of order. If at any time a Deputy rises in his place and draws his attention to the fact that a motion is not in order, the Ceann Comhairle is entitled to decide whether or not the motion moved is in order.</P>

The point seems to me to be that technically the Standing Order has not been complied with in relation to the time limit on the motion itself.  I would suggest to you that you should exercise your discretion to align an irregularity in relation to the amendments.

In exactly the same way the point is that it has been put to you now that you should exercise your discretion in favour of the other side in order to get over some irregularity in the presentation of the main motion.  I mean the feeling you have which decided you not to exercise that discretion in favour of the plaintiff will also prevent you exercising your discretion in favour of the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is at what point a motion or amendment can be ruled out of order. Until the question is put from the Chair for decision, a question on a point of order may be raised on it, and, on the point of order being accepted by the Chair, the motion or the amendment may be withheld by the Chair from the decision of the House.  With regard to the motion and the amendment, there is a motion and there is a set of amendments on the Order Paper, as well as a set of amendments which have been circulated in typescript.  Standing Order 25 prescribes that a motion should reach the Clerk not later than 11 o'clock on the fourth preceding day.  That particular provision when the Dáil is meeting on Wednesday, or even on Tuesday, has been pretty uniformly applied as to the motion reaching the Clerk in time for circulation on Saturday.  Naturally the result of that practice has been that the second part of the Standing Order, which refers to amendments, has been construed to allow amendments to reach the Clerk up to 11 o'clock on Tuesday, or up to the time on Tuesday that the Order Paper is going to the press.  That is without prejudice as to whether or not Sunday is dies non.  If we are going to argue the matter purely on technicalities it will be quite arguable that since provision is made in one Standing Order to exclude Sundays, and since Sunday is not excluded in this particular Standing Order it must be counted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, apart altogether from technicalities, if the Standing Order were <Col N="1046" /> interpreted in practice so as to compel Deputies to give notices of motion before 11 o'clock on Friday for the following Wednesday, and if the second part of the Standing Order with regard to amendments were construed strictly in that way, Sunday being taken to be a dies non, the result would be that the motion would be circulated from the office on Friday evening to reach Deputies on Saturday morning, and amendments to that motion would have to reach the Clerk's office before 11 o'clock on Monday.  Deputies will realise that from the point of view of people who want to put in amendments, that would be very difficult; in fact, an almost impossible task, particularly if the 11 o'clock rule was construed strictly.  Therefore, it has been the practice to put motions received on Saturday on the Order Paper, and to accept amendments, not only up to 11 o'clock on Tuesday, but up to whatever time on Tuesday the Order Paper is sent to the press.  The time at which it is sent varies slightly, but it is never later.  I think, than four o'clock.  In this particular instance that exact procedure was followed. This motion was received on Saturday, and, as often happens, the motion was received in a particular form on Friday and in the final form on Saturday. That happens to most motions presented to the Chair.  The motion was circulated on Saturday, and as it did not reach Deputies until Monday amendments were accepted on Monday &mdash;very late on Monday&mdash;and on Tuesday. While it would be quite possible to argue that even the amendments on the Order Paper were not received in time, that argument would not be admitted by the Chair.  As regards the other amendments which we received late on Tuesday evening and then circulated, it could be argued that within the ordinary practice which the House allows, and if you wanted to be strict on the matter, you could rule these particular amendments out.</P>
    <P>The situation appears to me to be that if the Standing Order may be construed quite properly to include Sunday, which is a point to be decided in any event, the common practice which has been followed has proved to be for the convenience of Deputies, and it is <Col N="1047" /> that motions for Wednesday are circulated on Saturday, and that amendments are accepted up to Tuesday evening. I propose to allow the motion now to be discussed on that basis.  With regard to the amendments, I am not sure if there is any technical difficulty at all arising from them, for it seems to me that the framers of the amendments may have questions which they desire to be discussed.  In accordance with the general practice, which is for the convenience of the proposers of motions and the movers of amendments, motions are accepted on Saturday for Wednesday, and amendments have been accepted on Tuesday for Wednesday. Therefore, I am accepting the motion and the amendments that I received on Tuesday in time for the Order Paper on Wednesday.  I suggest that the amendments to the motions should be taken in a particular form.  I think that two of the amendments on the Order Paper, Nos. 2 and 3, give an opportunity for a discussion of all the amendments and an opportunity for a decision by the House on the matters arising from all the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the statement you have made, I would like to represent to you, so far at least as one Deputy is concerned, that the present practice of circulating amendments handed in at the office on Saturdays is certainly not to the convenience of Deputies, in so far as it shortens the time they have for consideration of particular motions.  Compensation is not afforded to them by the fact that certain amendments received up to a certain hour on Tuesdays are allowed to appear on the Order Paper, because it means that a Deputy has something less than one day to consider the motion handed in on Saturday.  While your ruling may be based literally on the practice, I certainly think that the Standing Order ought to be rigorously observed, and that henceforth notices of motions handed in on Saturday should not appear on Wednesday's Order Paper.</P>

I now propose to take the amendments, and I want to get a decision as to what amendments Deputies want taken.</P>

If it was proposed to suspend a Standing Order I would have moved an amendment that it be suspended.  Instead of that, I tabled an amendment to the motion that the Dáil, instead of passing the motion, should come to a different opinion, and that the closure should not be operative.</P>

      <P>With reference to the suggested decision you have indicated&mdash;I mean the decision that you would possibly come to with respect to amendments&mdash;there is one very fatal objection to dealing with them in the manner which you have suggested.  The whole point of procedure as far as I can see is to give an opportunity on the Committee Stage so that each particular point in the Bill can be properly dealt with and the decision of the House taken on them.  If you bulk all these amendments and give only four hours for the whole thing, and after a certain time the closure is moved while perhaps only one amendment has been dealt with, that would be an unfair procedure.  The question, I think, you should put to the House is the one dealing with the time limitation, if there is to be a limitation of time, on each amendment.  It is quite unfair to say that it is wasting time. Now apparently the Government are going to take a hand in wasting time after their talk about the Opposition wasting time.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the motion on the Order Paper is in two parts.  One part deals with the Committee Stage of these Bills, and the other with the Report Stage of them.  If on part one of the motion the decision is taken that the words &ldquo;four hours&rdquo; stand or that &ldquo;four hours&rdquo; become six, ten, twelve or any number of hours whatever, and similarly in the second part of the motion that the words &ldquo;two hours&rdquo; stand or that &ldquo;two hours&rdquo; become any other number of hours, that would be conclusive, and it would be impossible to move a further amendment which would prolong that period.  The essence of the motion is the period has to be decided.  Amendment 4 will be out of order no matter what decision had been previously reached with regard to the number of hours' discussion it gets, a certain number of hours on the Committee Stage and a certain number of hours on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>My point was not precisely with respect to amendment No. 4.  I felt your ruling with regard to other amendments being out of order was apparently suggested by your feeling that the question could be adequately dealt with by the amendments on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an aspect of the whole question which is not covered by that.  It is the aspect I have indicated, namely, <Col N="1050" /> that it really upsets the whole arrangement which has gone on for some years with respect to the discussion of Bills so that each particular section would be properly dealt with and amendments could be discussed by the House.  This idea of bulking the whole time for amendments and moving the closure, whether certain amendments are good or not, is a most unreasonable way of dealing with it.  For instance, these amendments that you are ruling out of order aim at omitting or excepting certain Bills from the general rule.  Three Bills are mentioned here.  It is quite possible that there may be a decision by the House to limit the debate to one of these three Bills, a decision which you are ruling out of account.</P>

That raises exactly the same type of debate as the motion itself.  The debate proceeds on the motion and amendment. In this particular case, the amendments are specific, and I think the Deputies who have amendments down to the motion must get an opportunity of proposing them.</P>

      <P>What I wish to say about the amendment and the motion is that I think the Government could save a good deal of public money by carrying out their policy to its logical conclusion, and doing with this Parliament what they did with the Parliament that was in existence in June, 1922&mdash; suppress it altogether.  They would save a lot of time.  Let them bring in a motion and get the majority to steam-roll it through inside five minutes, if they like, or within as short a time as possible, by having a Closure Division, and then a Division on the motion to give them complete and absolute power.  I suppose that there is nothing in the Constitution or in the Standing Orders to prevent them doing that if they like to do it.  If they did that, if instead of keeping the majority up all night, and making them walk through the Division lobbies four times on every motion, they did it all in the one motion, and got the majority to give them complete and absolute power for a couple of years, it would save a lot of time.  I saw a letter the other day in a paper which stated that it cost something like eight shillings a column to print the Official Debates, and I suppose it takes something to print the Official Divisions. So that if the Government are going to have no real discussion on these motions I suggest to them that, in order to save public money, they should bring in one motion to set themselves up as a dictatorship for a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will look with great interest at the actions of the minority that holds the balance of power here.  We will look with great interest to see if this minority is going to stand for the using of the guillotine on the temporary majority on this side of the House. The President, or his Party, caused a statement to be issued to the papers the other day that the Evil Literature Bill was being delayed because of our action here.  No opposition has been offered by Fianna Fáil in this assembly to any motion that we considered was for the good of the people as a whole, and even since the Government brought in these ten Constitution Amendment Bills a couple of Bills went through <Col N="1055" /> the Dáil without any undue delay whatsoever.  They had the Bill regulating mutual assurance to cover up the mistakes that were made by the Government some time ago.  These mistakes were hurting the local public bodies, and when they brought in a Bill to correct them we offered no opposition whatever to it.  It got a First Reading without a debate, and without a division.  There is another Bill on the Order Paper regarding the Trades Loans Act that has been printed.  If the Government would bring in Bills like that, instead of bringing in Constitution Amendment Bills to do away with the democratic clauses of the Constitution, they would have absolutely no opposition from us; they would get all the help we could give them in framing proper measures, measures that would be in the best interests of the people.  Perhaps the President is afraid to introduce the Evil Literature Bill.  Perhaps he is afraid that it might get a very fast passage through the Dáil, and that it would be put into operation against these ten Constitution Amendment Bills that he has brought in.  I think that they are the most evil literature that has been circulated in this country for a long time.</P>

      <P>The excuse the Government is giving for passing this motion is that they want to save Parliamentary time for constructive Bills.  What constructive work have the Government brought in that has been opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party?  Are we opposing a co-operative Bill, or are we opposing the Evil Literature Bill that the Government prate so much about at the street corners?  Let them bring in these Bills and see what will happen.  There is absolutely no justification for bringing in the motion that the Minister for Finance has introduced.  When introducing it he said that the Fianna Fáil Party was adopting what he called the Four Courts tactics.  I believe that in introducing this motion the Government are introducing in another form the tactics which they adopted on the 29th and 30th June, 1922.  They are going to curtail the rights of the people's representatives here to discuss Bills and subjects which vitally affect the lives of the people.  I believe that if Bills which vitally affected the lives of the people had been properly and adequately discussed in June, 1922, we would not have had the bloodshed that occurred in 1922 and 1923.  Instead of rushing through Constitution Amendment Bills they should give them proper and due consideration.  Instead of trying to rush them through, they should be delayed, and the people's representatives should be given plenty of time to think what exactly these constitutional amendments meant to the life of the country in the future.  They would then be doing very good work <Col N="1059" /> for Ireland.  If they want to put them through, and if they think there is justification for doing so, there is no justification whatever for rushing them through.  If they are going to justify the abolition of Articles 47 and 48 they should justify it in a manner that we can appreciate.  There is no good trying to justify the abolition of Articles 47 and 48 by giving a promise of what is going to happen in the future to another Article of the Constitution. If they are going to justify the abolition of Articles 47 and 48 by promising to amend Article 50, Article 50 should be amended in the way they promise before they abolish Articles 47 and 48.</P>

      <P>If we knew what was going to happen to Article 50, and if there was going to be some way by which the people could get out of the trap into which they have been put by England, then it might not require a guillotine motion to discuss an amendment of other Articles in the Constitution.

      <P>The motion which the Minister for Finance moved deals with three Bills to amend the Constitution.  The Deputy is in order.  The Deputy would not be in order in discussing the Constitution as a whole, but he will be in order in discussing it in so far as the motion affects particular Articles.</P>

      <P>I think the Government are introducing Bills to close up the escape which the people have in the Constitution from the trap into which England has put them.  If they are going to provide an escape in the future they should provide that escape before closing up the only one that exists at present.  We object to the closing up of any escape that the people of this country have from the clutches of England, <Col N="1060" /> and we object more forcibly to the closing up of the only means of escape that the people at present have. Articles 47 and 48 are practically the only means of escape that the people have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which stands in my name is &ldquo;to delete the word `hours' wherever it occurs and substitute the word `sittings.' &rdquo; The word &ldquo;hours&rdquo; occurs in the motion of the Minister for Finance, which says that not more than four hours shall be given to the Committee Stage of any of the following Bills, namely, the Constitution Amendment Bills Nos. 6, 10 and 13.  The motion also says that not more than two hours be given during the Report Stage to each of these Bills.  I am moving to delete the word &ldquo;hours&rdquo; so that it would read that not more than two sittings be given to each of the Bills on Report Stage, and not more than four sittings be given to them in Committee.  I submit that four hours is too little time to give consideration in Committee to any of these Constitution Amendment Bills, which are three of the most important <Col N="1061" /> Bills that have been introduced into this Dáil since its inception.  I believe that we should give a full and adequate consideration to them.  I do not know that it will require four sittings to give them adequate consideration, but I say that, if it is necessary to give four sittings to consider them, four sittings should be given.  Anyone who has read the Orders of the Day will notice that there has been circulated a large number of amendments to the Constitution Amendment No. 6 Bill. That was the only one of these Bills that had got a Second Reading until to-day.  If those amendments are going to receive adequate consideration it will require much more than four hours.  I say if it requires four days to be given, they should be given.</P>
      <P>This Constitution is supposed to be the fundamental law by which we all guide our Governmental actions here, and it should not be rushed through like a mere Standing Order, that it could be changed from day to day without hardly any notice.  As the Constitution stands at present, in another two years it will require a two-thirds majority to amend it.  As was pointed out here during this present sitting, if it requires a two-thirds majority to amend the Constitution, the minority that now holds the balance of power will be in a position to dictate the Constitution of this country and will be in a position to prevent it being amended; that is, of course, being amended in a constitutional way.  They cannot prevent it being amended in an unconstitutional way, the way in which England always prevented the Irish people from framing their Constitution.  We hold that before the minority which holds the present balance of power in this country, because of the disagreement in national ranks, is given the power in their hands to keep the Constitution as it is, that Constitution should be very carefully discussed and certainly no amendment to it should be passed through the Committee Stage in four hours.  That is, if Deputies want to devote more than four hours to it, and I believe that if they are doing their duty to the country they will devote more than four hours to the Committee Stage of any one of these Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Bill to which the Minister <Col N="1062" /> for Finance proposes on the Committee Stage to devote only four hours is the Constitution Amendment No. 6 Bill, and the second is the Constitution Amendment No. 10 Bill.  I think that there should be four sittings devoted to each of these Bills and that Deputies should have a fair chance of keeping awake during the discussion.  Deputies should have a good night's sleep, and they should have nothing on their minds, only the consideration of the work before them.  These Bills are important enough for that, and when they are being discussed their discussion should not be interrupted by loud yawns.  Would any Deputy tell the House how all the amendments that have been put down to the Constitution Amendment No. 6 Bill could be adequately discussed in four hours?  The amendments that have gone in are, quite possibly, only a few of the amendments, which might be doubled before the Bill comes up for discussion.</P>

He may want not to give into the hands of the present Seanad absolute control over the Co-operative Bill that is to come in the near future.  Perhaps he may have more interest in the farmers than to be giving into the hands of the Seanad, that is proposed to be elected, the power of veto over a Bill that is very necessary to the economic welfare of the farmers.

I submit that the time is altogether inadequate, apart altogether from whatever amendments Deputy Heffernan or anybody else may have to introduce. We may have amendments here designed to prevent people, who are biased in favour of foreign rule in this country, from having a veto over laws that the people's representatives here may make in the interest of the people.  We want to see these amendments adequately discussed and if we cannot carry them, we want to show to the people that we at least have put forward reasons why they should be carried.  If there are any Deputies going to give the power of veto to <Col N="1064" /> a section, a few dozen people who are known to be biased in favour of English domination, we can say to the people they did it with their eyes open and they did it after receiving a warning from us as to what they were doing. Four hours is not sufficient in order to do that.  If it requires four days, they should be given and there should be four ordinary sittings at which Deputies would be ordinarily awake.</P>

      <P>I want to know why they are rushing these Bills through in four hours, and what is the great necessity for it.  Why particularly should Constitution Amendment Bill No. 10. which deals with the Referendum and the Initiative, be rushed through? Deputy Thrift's motion has been <Col N="1068" /> passed, and he has another motion down whereby a special committee shall be set up to consider how petitions are to be presented and received.  It will take some months to reach Deputy Thrift's motion, and if the Government set up the Joint Committee, I suppose they can keep that Committee in session for some months.  Why then is it necessary to introduce this Bill to abolish these two Articles, and rush it through the House in four hours?  Several months will have to pass before we will be in a position to catch President Cosgrave napping again.  We caught him napping once, and Deputy Thrift stepped in to save him.  Deputy Thrift has another motion down which will save the President from our catching him napping for another few months. Why then the necessity for rushing the Bills through at this time of the Session?  If the Government have good reasons, which they can stand over, to give for the abolition of Articles 47 and 48, they could have plenty of time to give them next Autumn, and they could devote the time from now until the Summer Recess in discussing the Estimates, the Co-operative Bill, the Evil Literature Bill, or any other Bill which they may think fit to introduce for the benefit of the people.  Why are they spending the time of the House in doing a thing which is not necessary, particularly in view of the fact that there are many urgent things that could be done here in the time that has been wasted in discussing the Constitution Amendment Bill No. 10?  Why not introduce the Co-operative Bill, the Evil Literature Bill, and any other Bill that may be for the good of the people?</P>

      <P>If the Government want to do work for the people of this country, there is no necessity for the introduction of this motion, and the Dáil should reject it and tell the Government to bring in Bills here that would obtain general agreement from the Nationalists of this country and from the people who want to see the Irish nation survive the attacks made upon it by England and her tools in this <Col N="1069" /> country.  We are opposing the four hours closure.  The closure is a weapon which should only be used by the Ceann Comhairle after due deliberation, and after he has seen that any motion before the House has been adequately discussed.  There is a Standing Order empowering the Ceann Comhairle or the Chairman for the time being to silence any Deputy whom he may think is speaking for the purpose of obstructing the business of the Dáil.  Surely that Standing Order plus the power that the Ceann Comhairle has to accept a motion to closure a whole debate on any motion that he thinks has been adequately discussed, is sufficient without bringing in this motion which, on the face of it, is in direct contravention of Article 20 of the Constitution. Article 20 of the Constitution was quoted here during some discussion that took place on a point of order.  Now that we are strictly in order in discussing this motion, I want to quote the Article.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with powers to attach penalties for their infringement, and shall have power to ensure freedom of debate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely there is no freedom in a debate which is going to be limited beforehand without knowing how much time it will require to debate the motion under discussion in a proper manner. That is not securing the freedom of debate that is guaranteed to all Deputies under the Constitution.  We shall be very much interested in seeing whether the majority that happens to hold the balance of power here for the moment will stand for putting the closure and for using the guillotine on Deputies on this side of the House.  We hope that all Deputies will reject this motion introduced by the Minister for Finance&mdash;a motion of which all Deputies have got very little notice.  This notice of motion was only in the hands of most of us on Monday evening.  I am sure that if a large number of independent Deputies and Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies consider that motion in a proper manner they will not vote for it.  I hope that before they take this step of flouting Article 20 of the Constitution by passing this motion, <Col N="1070" /> they will look a second time, that they will pause before they take that step, and if the Minister for Finance insists upon putting this motion before 8 o'clock this morning that in order to give the principle involved due consideration they will reject this motion. As I said before, and I do not want to repeat it, it will require perhaps four sittings to discuss these Constitution Amendment Bills adequately, and if it requires four sittings they should be given.  I hope all Deputies, Cumann na nGaedheal, Independent and Labour, will stand with us in demanding that if it requires four sittings to discuss these Constitution Amendment Bills we should get these four sittings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed, as I indicated earlier, to this motion in toto.  It is a vicious motion, vicious in its purpose and equally vicious in the manner in which it proposes to effect its purpose.  The purposes, of course, is to prevent adequate discussion in the Committee Stage of these three named Bills.  It is completely at variance with the whole spirit of the Standing Orders with reference to the stages of Bills and the discussion of Bills.  It is altogether unnecessary if the purpose was to confine debate within reasonable limits, because the Standing Order dealing with the closure proposes a method of doing that which I hold is quite sufficient and is not at all open to the abuses which the method proposed by the Minister for Finance is. Standing Order 52, I hold, is as I have said, sufficient.  By Standing Order 52: &ldquo;After a question (except a question already barred from debate under the Standing Orders) has been proposed from the Chair either in the Dáil or in a Committee of the whole Dáil, a Deputy may claim to move: `That the question be now put,' and unless it shall appear to the Ceann Comhairle that such a motion is an infringement of the rights of a minority or that the question has not been adequately discussed or that the motion is otherwise an abuse of those Standing Orders the question `That the question be now put' shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there is power in that to keep the debate within proper limits.  It is <Col N="1071" /> a power that has been used if not abused already, but at least this can be said of it that it gives the Ceann Comhairle an opportunity of seeing that an amendment to sections of a bill or any other questions which in his opinion ought to be discussed, should be discussed and that a proper time for their discussion should be given.</P>
    <P>Now remember this is proposed with reference to the Committee stage.  I think this article 87 or number 87 of the Standing Orders indicates quite clearly what ought to be the procedure in the case of a Bill in Committee.  In Committee Standing Order 87/(1), says:&mdash;&ldquo;When an amendment is offered proposing to insert a new section in a Bill such amendment may be moved when the number of the section, before which it is proposed to insert a new section, is read from the chair, and the question on such amendment shall be first decided.&rdquo;  Sub-section (2) of the same Standing Order says:&mdash;&ldquo;When the amendments (if any) offered to a section have been disposed of, the Chairman shall put the question, `That such section (or such section as amended) stand part of the Bill.' &rdquo; Now the portion of that section which I have just read &ldquo;when the amendments (if any) offered to a section have been disposed of,&rdquo; indicates that when the Standing Orders were being drawn up and when the Dáil was assenting to these Standing Orders, the importance of dealing with each amendment and disposing of it in a regular manner, was clearly before their minds, and this motion of the Minister for Finance is to put that aside.  The idea in this motion is to allot a certain time and to see that no matter where we have reached in the discussion of the amendments at that time, irrespective of what amendments we have to discuss and irrespective of their importance, that the closure should be put in operation and that the debate should cease.</P>
    <P>We have had experience already in the case of the Estimates of the futility to attempt to prepare a time-table in advance in matters of that particular kind, and I believe it has not been merely our experience here for the last six or eight months, but it has been the experience of previous Dala, that <Col N="1072" /> you cannot set a time-table in advance for a whole block of business and expect to do the business efficiently in that way.  What happens is: there is a certain amount of latitude allowed for the earlier questions quite irrespective of their importance relatively, and when the time is occupied these other questions which are relevantly far more important have to be scamped through, and no proper attention paid to them at all.  It is on that account that I have indicated my opposition to any attempt to limit debate in the way in which it is indicated in this motion.  Though I shall vote for the four sittings as against four hours, I, for one, am not satisfied with a limitation of four sittings&mdash;I do not know until the discussion has proceeded whether four days would be sufficient. We expect they ought to be, but we cannot be sure.  There is a disposition, as was indicated by the Minister for Finance, on the part of the Government to try new methods to prevent proper discussion from our side on these amendments, but they themselves will occupy a great portion of the time which is going to be allotted.  Apparently they think that the method they have used up to the present, that is, not to intervene in the debate at all, has not been so effective, and that it would be more effective if they did get a certain time fixed and occupy a major portion of that time themselves putting their views and blocking out the Opposition altogether.</P>
    <P>Well, it has been bad enough up to the present, but if these tactics are going to be used it seems to me that being here and calling this a deliberative assembly is all a farce, and I will begin to agree with Deputy Aiken that they might as well do what they did before, and bring in a Bill to suppress the Dáil, and constitute themselves dictators. We hear a good deal, and I think we had it from the Minister for Justice early to-night, about a representative assembly.  If one section of this House is going to be deprived of its rights to put forward amendments and to discuss in detail everything put forward by the Government, then this House ceases to be in any sense a representative assembly.  These Bills we intended discussing.  We are prevented from <Col N="1073" /> discussing them by these people who talk about this being a representative assembly, and representative government, instead of being improved, is hindered by the sending of certain questions to the people outside.</P>
    <P>These persons have no hesitation themselves in interfering with its liberties and handing over the power of veto to a body that cannot be called, in any sense of the word, a representative institution.  We will be able to see the full effects of this motion by examining the thing in detail and how it is likely to operate upon the several Bills that are mentioned here.  We have this No. 6 Bill amending the Constitution. Let us look for a moment at the scope of that Bill so as to see the various things that are covered in it, and the things to which naturally an Opposition that objects to in these Bills in principle would be likely to move in detail upon them.  We have been beaten, so to speak, at this stage on the main question about these Bills.  But we want to have them examined in detail and prevent greater harm that might be inflicted upon the country.</P>
    <P>No. 6 Bill is one that abolishes the present system of election and substitutes instead election by the Dáil and Seanad combined.  There is, first of all, the question in detail.  I take it the main principle of the Bill was to set aside the present system of election and that on Committee it would be open to consider the question of the alteration that is proposed here.  Now the alteration that is proposed here is an election by the Dáil and Seanad combined.  Is it not natural that there should be an amendment to delete the portion that refers to the Seanad and have a definite decision of the Dáil on the question whether the Seanad should be any part whatever of the electorate?  Suppose the question of giving the Seanad a part in the election should appear to be proper to the majority, is there not another question as to the manner in which the Seanad should participate in the election?</P>
    <P>What about the suggestion that was made?  I think it was made and later withdrawn.  I am not quite certain, but I have a recollection that the matter cropped up in the Joint Committee proceedings. The suggestion was that a <Col N="1074" /> certain proportion of the Senators should be elected by the Seanad itself and a certain proportion by the Dáil. Then comes the question whether this should be by secret ballot or by open vote.  Each one of these is a separate and distinct question which ought to be separately considered.  It would be most unfair because a certain amount of time was occupied with the discussion of the question as to whether the Seanad should participate in the election, that the time occupied in that discussion should be used to limit the time that might be given to the question, for example, of alternative ways in which the Seanad might participate; or, again, you might have the question of the manner of voting.</P>
    <P>The manner of voting is a most important one, if that other Article of the Constitution is not going to be scrapped.  I will admit that it is of very little use, but there is no other way of putting it into operation.  If that is the test, it stands condemned immediately. That is the Article which suggests that the Senators should be people who have served the country in some particular way.  Who is going to judge that?  It is one of these dressings that will try to get certain men of standing in the Seanad.  It is a futile Article except as a mere sort of gesture. If it were to be given effect to the only way we could do it would be to have public opinion focussed on the electorate, and on those who nominate and vote for Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to show that we are going in this motion, if it is passed, to apply the closure in the worst possible manner, in a way that is unnecessary, on account of the fact that there is already provision here for the closure in a way which would be reasonable.  In this particular case it is going to be applied in such a way as to end all real discussion.  I was trying to show its dangers by taking this particular Bill, No. 6, indicating in advance the type of question that was likely to be considered in the Committee Stage, and showing how the operation of this would cut out. <Col N="1075" /> perhaps, consideration of some of the most important questions that would remain once the general principle had been decided upon, as apparently it has been by this Second Reading.  That is the very reason why you have this Committee Stage discussion at all.  It is to enable detailed amendments to be moved, and each particular matter to be discussed and a proper, deliberate decision of the House taken upon them.</P>
      <P>Let us look similarly at how it would operate on the next one of the Bills, No. 10. No. 10 proposes to delete Articles 47 and 48 and make other certain changes in Articles 14 and 50.  Article 47 deals with the Referendum and Article 48 deals mainly with the Initiative. These are two distinct types of questions.  In fact, they are types of questions which you will find great differences of opinion upon.  One is regarded as more or less a conservative or blocking or restrictive Article in a sense.  The other is one which is a progressive Article, and the progressive parties here are naturally more interested in the Initiative, whereas those who are more conservative are interested in Article 47.  There is no attempt whatever to bulk these two together for the time being unless you divide between the two, and the second, as well as the first, is going to mean inadequate discussion and bad business from the point of view of having this Bill properly considered and thought out and properly decided on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as far as No. 6 and No. 10 are concerned.  Now let us look at No. 13.  When we look at No. 13 we see that there is likely to be a variety of amendments and valuable amendments with respect to all the periods that are mentioned there. Apart altogether from the general idea of giving the Seanad this power of obstruction, which this Bill is going to do, each one of these periods is distinct. They have different influences on the power of obstruction which is being given to the Seanad, and on every one of them you would want to have separate discussion and a separate decision. I need only point to the amendments <Col N="1076" /> that have been tabled on No. 6 to show that what I have said is a fair anticipation. As we have them actually here in black and white, they are the best ones to be considered&mdash;much better than merely talking by way of anticipation. As I have been on some of the others, looking at them here and analysing them, we can see the variety of different questions that have to be dealt with separately in connection with the Committee Stage of this particular Bill.  I say this now from the point of view of having adequate discussion and doing our work in a business-like manner, apart altogether from the fact that the Standing Orders are explicit on the point that each particular section has to be properly discussed, and that each particular section has to be put separately.</P>
      <P>Now, putting all these separate sections can have only one effect if this time limit is adopted.  It means again that the first couple of sections may receive adequate consideration if the Executive does not try new tactics, endeavouring to monopolise the whole of the time and preventing any discussion or any view being expressed except their own.  Apart from that, we can, in examining these Bills here, see if there are reasonable amendments, not amendments from the point of view of occupying the time, but amendments that deal with aspects of the question that will arise of necessity in the Committee Stage.  For instance, there is the first one in my own name.  It deals with the question of whether the Seanad should be a part or not of the electorate.  The next one is from Deputy Fahy, and it refers to the question of eliminating certain members of the Seanad.  It suggests substituting, instead of the words &ldquo;the Seanad as a whole,&rdquo;&ldquo;such members of the Seanad as have been elected to the Seanad by popular suffrage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can easily see that that amendment is a reasonable amendment from the point of view of representation of the people, or getting, so to speak, an election one step removed from the people.  Those who have been elected on a popular suffrage could in some sense be regarded as representing the people who <Col N="1077" /> voted on their behalf, and I hold that to eliminate discussion on a question of that particular kind would be altogether wrong.  I am going through all these amendments to show that serious points are raised by each one of them. To cut off discussion on them, by any such process as that indicated by the Minister for Finance, is practically to make a farce of the whole business. You might as well say &ldquo;Let there be one vote, and let the majority have that one vote, and let there be no such question as an opposing point of view being presented to the point of view put forth by the majority Party.&rdquo;  The next amendment proposes to insert the words &ldquo;with the exception of retiring members nominated for re-election.&rdquo; There is another principle.  It is quite distinct from any of those which we have up to the present been dealing with.  I think that any reasonable member of the Dáil will admit that these are matters that ought to be considered separately, and that this particular matter requires a certain amount of consideration. When you have 60 members coming down here to water this House and to prevent it from being regarded as the popularly elected one, the question of the right of members who are retiring to vote should be carefully considered and discussed.  I know it was discussed before the Joint Committee. If the question was regarded as being of sufficient importance to be discussed before that Committee, I imagine it ought to be regarded also as of sufficient importance to be considered here.</P>

      <P>Then as regards the next question, it is altogether distinct from any of the points raised by the previous ones.  This deals with the question of leaving a certain proportion of vacancies to be filled by the Seanad and the remainder to be filled by the Dáil.  There, again, you have a separate and a distinct idea which is worthy of a separate debate.  In the next one, still another principle is involved, the question at issue being that no person who holds the office of Lord Lieutenant or Deputy-Lieutenant for any county, or any other office of honour or profit under the British Crown, should be allowed to vote at <Col N="1078" /> such elections.  I hold that it is a very serious matter that there should be in the legislature in this part of Ireland people who have very definite personal attachments to a foreign state.</P>

I am not going into the merits of these amendments, but I am pointing out the principle that is in each one of them.  I am trying to make the point that they are all distinct and separate principles, that none of them is frivolous, and that every one of them merits separate attention from the Dáil, and that the effect of this motion, moved by the Minister for Finance, is to prevent anything like a separate discussion upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out that in this particular amendment there is a very important principle involved, whether we should tolerate there being in any part of the legislature here an office-holder appointed from outside.  I have heard many statements from the other benches as to the independence of this House, for example.  I think if we want to have any feeling of confidence in the legislature here or any real respect for it as representing the will or the viewpoint of the Irish people, then we must have time, and time should be given for a discussion of this particular question. I now come to amendment 6, which, I admit, has a certain amount of relation to amendment No. 5.  All the previous amendments, that is, up to amendment No. 5, dealt with distinct <Col N="1079" /> and separate things, but I admit that amendment No. 6 is more or less related to amendment No. 5.  This amendment comes under the general idea that we ought to have representatives who in no sense can be regarded as having any particular allegiance to a foreign state&mdash;that is to say, a person who is a soldier or an officer in an army outside of Saorstát Eireann, whether he is serving full-time, on half-pay, or in an honorary capacity.</P>
      <P>I say that that amendment has an important bearing on the independence of these institutions in so far as they are claimed to be independent by the Executive opposite.  I think that when these questions come to be discussed the Executive, if it is consistent, will admit that a case can be made for these amendments, and I think that we should not now by means of this guillotine motion prevent a proper discussion or a proper decision by the Dáil upon them.  The next amendment is the one which says that no member shall vote in any election unless he is certified as having voted in not less than one half the divisions taken in the House.  You can easily see the idea that is behind that amendment.  The effect of it will be to try and see that those who exercise the franchise will be people who have thought it worth their while to be present when decisions affecting the interests of the country were being taken here.  Again, that is one of the amendments that ought not to be ruled out or prevented from being discussed by a motion of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next amendment is more or less related to amendments 5 and 6, which I have already referred to.  It deals with the independence of the electors. It is provided that no member of either House shall vote who is the holder of a title of honour conferred by the King of England.  We have, I think, in the Constitution, a reference to titles of honour.  It was made a point in the Constitution that no titles of honour should be conferred on citizens of this State except with the advice or consent of the Executive Council.  I have not got the exact words of the Article beside me, but the effect of it is that the Executive Council is to have the right of veto on any titles of honour <Col N="1080" /> which it might be proposed to confer upon the citizens of this part of Ireland. This putting into the Constitution a limit on titles of honour shows that the Executive regarded it as important that they should have the right to veto these titles.</P>
    <P>They were thought as being the means of corrupting, seducing or otherwise interfering with the patriotism of the persons on whom the titles were conferred.  If that be so, I for one would like to go further than is proposed in the Constitution on that matter. If that be so, and if there is a fear, and a right fear, that these titles might be used to seduce Irish citizens from loyalty to their country, then it becomes a serious matter if the holders of titles veto here legislation in the Second House, and it is proposed to give them important powers.  Again I make the point, that is a separate and distinct question, and it ought to be differently and distinctly discussed here, and we ought to have a separate decision on it.  To prevent us doing that is to make futile all the machinery devised in the Standing Orders for the proper consideration of measures brought before this House.</P>
    <P>The next and final one is the question as to whether this election is to be by secret ballot or by open voting.  There again you have another principle, and a very important one.  If that particular Article in the Constitution is going to be given any sanction whatever, the only sanction I have indicated as available is the sanction of the backing up of public opinion&mdash;public opinion to be used as an effective means of getting proper Senators for the Second House, who will be there from the point of view of having an independent judgment on matters of national importance.</P>
    <P>If you are going to have public opinion used as a means of enforcing that particular viewpoint, then the Parties and individuals who take responsibility for voting for these Senators should be able to have their names and votes down on the records just as you have when we are taking any other important decision here.  In taking important decisions there may be unpopularity attached, and there are personal interests sometimes alleged to be <Col N="1081" /> attached to them, and none of us should say we ought to hide from the public how we vote on these matters.  That being so, can you not see that a good case can be made for having this voting open, and an individual record kept of the votes and not merely having the total vote lumped together?  I do not propose to deal with this subject any further except to say I, for one, am altogether dissatisfied with the tactics of the Executive Council in connection with all these matters.</P>
    <P>There are some of us anyhow that these midnight treaties or midnight pressures are not going to affect, and whether we have all-night or all-day sittings, or day and night sittings, we have a feeling that we can very easily manage so as to keep our wits about us.  If we are not completely prevented by the guillotine from expressing our views, we do not care how long the sittings are.  I have spoken to some about it, and we do not care how long the sittings are, or whether you have day or night sittings, or whether you sit Sunday and Monday, but what we do care for is, that we get adequate opportunity for those who have views on matters to express them, so that they may be able to convert those who may have open minds on the matters, and so that if the Press put them to the country the public may be able to form an opinion.  A lot of people wished that we should come in here, not because they agreed with our policy, but they believed that the presence of a strong Opposition would cause questions to be discussed in a manner in which they would not be discussed in if there was no such Opposition.  An Opposition is very little use here if the arguments that are put forward on the shortcomings of the Executive, on the things it does not do, and on the things it does badly, and on the things it neglects doing, are not taken out to the people.  Then it is quite obvious that the Opposition is no use, for where you have disciplined parties, as we have, to oppose us here, the result of all argument, the result of everything you show as being wise or foolish is obliterated by the simple process of calling for a division, going into <Col N="1082" /> the division lobby, and getting a few votes of a majority.</P>
    <P>The value of opposition is ended unless you are able by means of it to inform public opinion and get it alive to the pros and cons of questions that come up here for discussion.  You prevent that absolutely by a motion such as that of the Minister for Finance. Personally, I am not surprised at the numbers of things that come from the opposite side, but the Minister for Finance, at any rate, has tried occasionally&mdash;I have been sometimes wondering, sitting here looking at some of the men on the opposite side, watching their tactics, but the plausibility of the Minister for Finance and the apparent reasonableness with which he tackles some of the questions, is more or less impressive, and I am surprised to find that above all the others he should have brought in a measure of this kind.  All I can say is that if the one person who tries to give a semblance of reasonableness to his attitude is going to act in this particular manner, anybody who is opposing the present majority might as well not be here at all.  There is no value to the country when it is predetermined the moment the Government brings in a Bill and whips up its majority; then discussion is vain and you do not even get it to the country. These are my reasons for opposing the Bill, and I hope members of the House who think in this matter will see what they are doing, and that they will oppose putting the closure in this particular manner.  It is provided for sufficiently in a manner far more reasonable, and which will give better results so far as discussion is concerned, in its application, and will save time.  If the object of it is to save time, it will save time just as effectively as this particular motion.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the next amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;two hours&rdquo; wherever they occur.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Dáil the advisability of passing this amendment. It is, of course, clear that the words &ldquo;two hours,&rdquo; if deleted, would be substituted by some other words to provide that a longer discussion than that contemplated by the motion would be permitted to take place upon the Report Stage of the Bills in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> It will be remembered by Deputies that on the Second Reading of these Bills the provision of the closure was outlined and discussion was terminated before many Deputies had an opportunity of expressing their views on the principles of the Bill.  As these Bills are important Constitution amendments, I think to curtail the discussion on the Report Stage, as the discussion on the Second Reading was curtailed, is undesirable, and that while we of course would much prefer that there should be no limit of this nature placed on the discussion, if there is to be a limit it should be for a much longer period than the two hours suggested.  The introduction of a motion of this kind is of course, from the nature of it, just what would be expected from the Government.  It has been pointed out that when a certain section of the people proposed to avail of the Constitution to achieve their particular objects the Constitution was altered.  Similarly when a Party in the Dáil proposed to exercise the powers given them in the Standing Order, in order to make effective their position on certain measures, the Standing Orders were altered. Throughout the whole business under discussion during the past few days, there is the same underlying motive. The Government is relying on its power to alter the rules of the game for want of ability to play the game.  They take advantage of the power they have, whenever the game is going against them, to alter the rules so as to put their opponents off-side.  That is what is behind this motion.  When they find the Opposition efforts to their proposals are not to their liking they proceed to curtail the liberties of private Deputies, so as to ensure that that opposition will be restricted.  As I said the Bills on which it is proposed to limit discussion are all important Bills.  I will refer particularly to Constitution Amendment Bill No. 10, the Second Reading of which was passed either last night or this morning.  As I said the discussion on the Second Reading was arbitrarily terminated by the use of Standing Order 52&mdash;the provision of the closure.  The use of the closure in that manner was objected to <Col N="1088" /> by a number of Deputies and we are anxious to express views concerning that Bill which had not been expressed before the closure was applied.  The only opportunity we will have to speak upon the Bill as a whole will be when that Bill comes before the Dáil on the Report Stage.  I take it that the amendment already carried is an indication that the Dáil is not prepared to alter this motion in respect to the previous effect of the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The motion as a whole of course will come before the Dáil, and I trust it will be rejected.  Certainly if there was any spirit of sportsmanship amongst members of the Government Party it would be rejected; it would never have been introduced.  That spirit is not there and we have long since given up any hope of finding even a shadow of it.  If the discussion on the Committee Stage is to be curtailed, as apparently it is&mdash;the discussion on the Second Reading having been already curtailed&mdash;we think the restriction should be taken off when the Report Stage comes along, and the House given an adequate opportunity of discussing these Bills as they emerge from Committee, so that the fullest possible light might be thrown on their implications.  The introduction of a motion of this kind at this time is not really designed to facilitate the business of the Dáil or to ensure that that business will be put through in a rapid manner.  That may be the ostensible purpose of the motion, and the reason why the movers come for it, but the real effect will be the opposite. It will result in increased delay in getting through work of the Dáil that is of real importance.  It is a matter of real importance that no serious amendment to the Constitution shall be effected without full consideration.</P>
    <P>It will result in increased delay in getting through the work of the Dáil. That is of great importance, and it is a matter of real importance also that serious amendments to the Constitution should not be effected without the fullest consideration.  In the long run it would save time.  We know that the Government in the past have jumped to conclusions and have taken hasty action which they had afterwards to <Col N="1089" /> endeavour to undo.  We will have under discussion in the near future a Bill the purpose of which is to repair one mistake of that nature&mdash;that is, the Public Bodies Mutual Assurance Bill. If we take our time now, if we hasten slowly, we can make sure that every step we take is the right step before we take it, and as I said, in the long run it will result in a saving of time and possibly in a saving of considerable expense to the people.  Therefore, we strongly resent any proposal to curtail the time for the discussion of these Bills on the Report Stage.  Two hours is certainly inadequate.  There is every reason to believe that the purpose of this motion is to enable the Government to do a little obstructing of its own.  If the discussion upon the Report Stage of any one of these Bills is limited to two hours, the Minister moving the Bill can speak for the entire two hours, and it will not be possible for any other Deputy to express his views on the Bill at all.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out on the discussion on the previous amendment, the provision of the closure is a much fairer and a much better method of curtailing discussion than that suggested here.  It does provide that it cannot be applied unless a reasonable case can be made, through the Ceann Comhairle, to show that no injustice is being done by its application. But there is nothing whatever to prevent an injustice being done by the application of this motion.  In fact, it <Col N="1090" /> is almost certain that injustice will be done, that important minority sections in the House will not be given an opportunity to speak on these Bills at all, and will have to give silent votes on them.  I suggest that for that reason the motion should be rejected and the amendment carried to provide that a much longer period than that suggested would be given for discussion on the Report Stage of these Bills.  The period suggested in amendment No. 3 is eight hours.  I do not think it will be necessary to take eight hours on each of the Bills, but the limit fixed should be wide, so that if a debate of considerable magnitude should be necessary it should be possible that this guillotine motion would not be put into operation.  I, therefore, move the amendment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries whether he is aware that the lands on the Trinity College Estate, County Kerry, purchased about fourteen years ago, have not yet been vested in the tenants; and whether, in view of the loss sustained yearly by the tenants on this estate as a result of the delay on the part of the Irish Land Commission in this matter, he will take the necessary steps to expedite the vesting of this estate in the tenants.</P>
