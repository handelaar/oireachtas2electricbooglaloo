      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state (1) the total number of applications for loans received by the Agricultural Credit Corporation up to May 31st, 1928; (2) the number and total amount of all loans granted; (3) the number and total amount of loans granted on personal security; (4) the number and total amount of loans granted on mortgage on land and buildings; (5) the number and total amount of loans granted on chattel mortgages; and (6) the number and total amount of advances made to co-operative credit societies.</P>

      <P>The question asked by the Deputy relates to details of the work being performed by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The Deputy will realise that the Corporation is not a Government Department, but a Limited Liability Company operating under the Companies Acts.  It is true that the Corporation has been set up in pursuance of an Act of the Oireachtas, that the Minister for Finance is at present the largest shareholder and has representatives on the Board, and that the State guarantees the dividend on the shares and repayment of the principal in the event of the Corporation being wound up, but none of these facts alters the status of the Company.  After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot undertake to answer questions relating to the day-to-day administration of the Corporation, and I cannot, accordingly, deal with the question asked by the Deputy. I can only suggest that the Deputy <Col N="388" /> should apply personally to the Board of the Corporation, who may be willing to furnish him with the information he requires.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will, of course, understand that this decision does not affect general questions concerning the administration of the Corporation, which may be considered to reflect on the policy of the Government in establishing it.  I shall continue to deal with these questions as before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. BOLAND Mr. G. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey Section, which surveyed the Tully Bog, Castlerea, County Roscommon, in 1924, certified the survey as correct; that errors were subsequently found to have been made in the survey; whether he will state if these errors were corrected; if so, whether other sections corrected them, and at what cost; and whether he can state if this man is still employed in his old position in the Ordnance Survey Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The area known as Tully Bog, Co. Roscommon, contains about 1,000 acres of bog which is almost entirely devoid of the usual physical features which are of such value to surveyors, and prior to the revision of 1924, the area as shown on the ordnance maps was without detail.  The work referred to by the Deputy was carried out by a Surveyor belonging to the section then in the district, and his results were examined by the Superintendent of the section.  Ordinarily a test of accuracy would have been applied by means of what are known as check lines, but owing to the flooded state of the bog (which had considerably impeded the Surveyor) these check lines were not undertaken at the time.  Later on it was decided to have the work tested by means of check lines, and a Surveyor was accordingly detached from the nearest section.  He found it necessary to make some alterations due to fresh &ldquo;lockspitting&rdquo; and the shifting <Col N="393" /> of an undefined road which had been utilised as the basis of the original survey.</P>
      <P>It seems clear that in the circumstances mentioned the alterations made in the course of the second survey cannot be regarded as what are known as &ldquo;errors.&rdquo;  It is not the duty of the Superintendent of a section to certify the accuracy of the work of the Surveyors, as that would obviously be an impossible task.  In the case in question the Superintendent, who is still employed, is a most reliable officer, and has an excellent record in the Department.  The cost of the revision of the first survey was not any greater than would have been involved had the check lines been originally possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been publicly stated in the Press that there was an error, and that in this Department an error of that nature was criminal.  In any case that was stated in the paper &ldquo;Honesty.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it has not been contradicted.  It was stated that five private &ldquo;sappers&rdquo;&mdash;that is what they are called&mdash;were sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from 56 to 90 days for slight errors.  It has been stated that this particular individual was charged by a civilian employee who had 22 years' service with having deliberately altered his map.  If the Minister says there is no error I will have to accept it, but it was also stated that there was an error and that the smaller people were punished with imprisonment. If that is so, it is a most extraordinary thing that this man should be retained in the service.  I can give the Minister the references and the papers and bring them to his attention. Possibly they are worthy of note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I could not examine anything that appeared in a paper which specialises in that sort of thing, as I believe this paper does.  Apart <Col N="394" /> from the paper, if the Deputy has any grounds for believing that there is anything that should be investigated, and will put down a question or write to me, I shall have it examined, but so far as I have investigated this matter for the purpose of answering this question I am satisfied there was no error in the accepted sense of the word.  That is, the survey was not completed on the ordinary form at the time.  Certain checks were not applied, and there were certain errors due to the survey not being completed on the ordinary form at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the latter part of the question, as to whether this man is still in the service, will the Minister say whether it is a fact that this definite charge is made against him, namely, of altering another person's maps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question.  I know that a certain individual who was in the Department made certain charges which were fully investigated, with the result that the person who was bringing the charges was dismissed.  I do not know whether it is this person who was dismissed who is making these charges.  If it is, I am satisfied that the person dismissed was rightly dismissed.  I do not know whether there was any such charge made against this man.</P>

      <P>James Donnelly was sentenced to nine calendar months imprisonment on the 10th February, 1928. On his committal to prison that day he dressed in prison clothes, but on the following day he refused to wear them. On the 14th February he applied for permission to wear his own clothes on the grounds that he was a political offender.  This application was not acceded to.  On the 16th February he made a similar application on the ground that he had serviceable clothing and permission was granted on the following day.  In the meantime he refused to wear prison clothes and remained in bed.  His health has not been adversely affected as a consequence. He received one visit from his wife on the 7th May last.  He refused to work, except during the period 12th March to 15th May, and consequently he is not entitled to the privileges of receiving visits or letters.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the houses known as &ldquo;The Puzzle,&rdquo; in the village of Crumlin, County Dublin, which are inhabited by tenants of the South Dublin Rural District Council, were condemned so long ago as 1913, as being insanitary and unsafe; and whether, as the Council have not taken any steps to provide alternative accommodation for these tenants the Minister can take any action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Eight of sixteen houses originally on this site have been demolished. The tenants of some of them have been provided with labourers' cottages.  General sanitary accommodation has been provided for the remainder and some minor repairs carried out to the houses.  The Council <Col N="408" /> have reserved sites in the neighbourhood for the provision of further cottages, and I understand it is their intention to demolish the old houses and provide alternative accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the conditions were so bad that certain of the houses had to be destroyed. In the case of some tenants it was possible to give them other accommodation; but it will be some time before the Council can provide the additional accommodation necessary for all the tenants, but so far as it is within the power of the Council I understand they are giving the closest possible attention to the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether, in view of the fact that loans of less than £50 under the Agricultural Credit Act, 1927, are available only through co-operative credit societies, he will state (1) the number of such societies at present existing in the Free State; (2) the number organised since January 1, 1928; and (3) whether he will consider the advisability of earmarking a definite portion of the State subsidy to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society to meet the expenses of organising and supervising co-operative credit societies.</P>

      <P>(1) The number of co-operative credit societies at present in active operation in the Free State is approximately 106, including 50 societies newly established, and 10 societies re-established, during the past few years, under the Department's scheme of State advances to credit societies.  (2) The number of societies organised since 1st January last is four, and the organisation of three additional societies is almost completed. (3) In regard to the concluding portion of the question, the organisation and supervision of credit societies is one of the main purposes for which a grant from State funds has been made to the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  Up to the present it has not been considered necessary to earmark a definite portion of that subsidy for the purpose in question, but should the desirability of doing so arise in connection with the working of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1927, or otherwise, the question will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>The Drummond Estate was the subject of proceedings for sale by the vendor direct to the tenants under the Irish Land Act, 1903, and purchase agreements signed by the parties were lodged with the Land Commission.  There is no reference in any of these purchase agreements to the question of turbary but it was ascertained by the Land Commission when dealing with the estate that tenants in the townlands referred to had been allowed by the vendor to cut turf on a bog situated in the townland of Glencuttaun Lower.  It was the vendor's intention that this bog should be vested in trustees on behalf of the tenants cutting turbary thereon but as it formed portion of six tenanted holdings this could not be done and the six holdings were vested in the respective tenants thereof in accordance with their purchase agreements.  The Land Commission are at present preparing Regulations under Section 21 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, as extended by Section 42 of the Land Act, 1923, under which there will be conferred on the tenants in need of turbary rights of turbary on the bog in Glencuttaun Lower.  Copies of proposed Regulations have been served on all parties affected; some of them have lodged objections and the Land Commission will not be in a position to complete the Regulations and to point out to the tenants boundaries of their turbary plots until these objections have been finally disposed of.  An Inspector is at present engaged on inquiries as to these objections with a view to settling the disputed matters and any case that <Col N="414" /> cannot be so settled will be listed for hearing before the Commissioners.</P>

      <P>We intend opposing this Bill.  We intend also opposing the First Readings of all these Bills, because we are opposed to the principles of the Bills.  The electorate that is suggested is the members of the Dáil and Seanad voting together.  When we remember that there are 60 members of the Seanad and that there are, roughly, 150 members here in this House, to allow the Seanad to take part in voting for the filling of any vacancies gives the Seanad altogether an undue power &mdash;the power of reproducing itself.  If we remember the conditions under which the Seanad was set up, and remember that the main intention then was to give undue power, under weight, to a certain section of the community, I think we ought to be very careful before we give it the power to reproduce itself.  Whatever reasons there might have been four or five years ago for thinking that a certain section of the community required special protection and required to be given certain privileges over and above those to which they would be entitled by their numbers, there ought to be no reason to-day, and consequently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we are indicating the reasons why we think that this House ought not give this Bill even a First Reading.  The fact is that it is a diminution of the powers of this House which have been derived directly from the people, whereas the <Col N="419" /> Seanad was largely&mdash;half of it, at least&mdash;a nominated body at the start, and on the last occasion on which there was a popular election a large section of the people practically boycotted that election and only 23 per cent. voted. The suggestion now is that here we are to have a Seanad, composed in that particular fashion, given 60 votes in the election of members of the Seanad, as against 150 votes to members in this House.  Therefore it gives, as I say, a <Col N="420" /> Seanad, that was set up under very exceptional circumstances, powers which we contend they should not have.  The situation originally was very different from that which has actually arisen.  To give this Bill a First Reading now and to admit this Bill is simply taking away all the powers of the people and practically putting a nominated Seanad in control.  That is mainly the reason why we think it ought not get even a First Reading.</P>

      <P>An Act to amend the Constitution by deleting the provisions now contained therein as to the reference to a Committee of Privileges of the question whether certain Bills are or are not Money Bills, and by making in lieu thereof other provision for the reference of such question to a Committee of Privileges.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a statement explaining why it is that we on this side intend to oppose the First Reading of this Bill, I do not wish to say anything that could or should properly be said on Second Reading.  We object to a Bill of this kind being introduced into this House at all, and our objection to it has very little to do with the principle contained in the Bill which would properly be discussed on the Second Stage.  The section of the Constitution which it is proposed to amend by this Bill is one which defines the procedure which takes place when a Bill certified to be a Money Bill by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann is objected to by a number of the members of the Dáil or Seanad.  In so far as this Bill seeks to change the section of the Constitution which gives power to the Dáil as well as power to the Seanad in respect of Money Bills, it differs from the other Bills, the First Readings of which are being taken to-day.  In order to explain exactly why it is that this Bill should not be given a First Reading, I would like, with the permission of the House, to refer to the section of the Constitution and the paragraph of the Report of the Joint Committee dealing with the powers of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a matter for a Second Reading speech.  The question before us is that leave be granted to print and circulate the Bill.  We have not the Bill before us as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that the section of the Constitution&mdash;I do not propose to read the entire section&mdash;provides that the Chairman of Dáil Eireann shall certify any Bill which, in his opinion, is a Money Bill, to be a Money Bill, but, if within three days after a Bill has been passed by Dáil Eireann, two-fifths of the members of either House by notice in writing addressed to the Chairman of the House of which they are members so require, the question whether the Bill is or is not a Money Bill shall be referred to a Committee of Privileges. The constitution of that Committee is defined in the section.  The Joint Committee recommend that Article 35 be amended by the substitution of seven days for three days so that the period within which that notification by two-fifths of the members must be given will be extended by four days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another alteration suggested, and that is that two-fifths of the members of either House should retain the power by notice in writing of having this Bill referred to a Committee of Privileges.  It is also provided that a majority of the members of the Seanad present and voting at a sitting of Seanad Eireann, at which not less than 30 members are present, shall decide that the question whether <Col N="423" /> a Bill is or is not a Money Bill shall be referred to the Committee of Privileges. The one purpose of the Bill is to alter the period of three days to seven days and give to the Seanad a power which it is obvious even from the Report of the Committee it is not desirable the Seanad should have.</P>
    <P>In so far as that is the case, it could be argued that the introduction of this Bill is primarily intended to occupy the time of the Dáil uselessly.  The amendment which it is proposed to make can be legitimately described as a frivolous amendment.  The powers given to the Dáil and Seanad under this Article have not been exercised. The period which the Article allows for the exercise of these powers is quite adequate.  The introduction of a Bill at this stage, in view of the congested state of the Order Paper and the anxiety of a number of Deputies to take summer holidays, is altogether unjustifiable.  I think, therefore, the Dáil should refuse a First Reading.</P>
    <P>If the Bill gets a First Reading and comes up on the Second Reading we will be able to discuss only the principle of the Bill and we will have to confine our remarks to what is contained in the Bill.  My arguments now are intended to convince the House that the Bill should not be introduced at all.  The Article of the Constitution to which it refers is an Article which gives the Dáil as well as the Seanad powers in respect of Money Bills.  I do not know whether it is intended in this Bill to limit the powers of the Dáil in that matter.  I take it from the Report of the Joint Committee it is not intended to do so and that it is merely intended to extend the time during which the Seanad may make up its mind whether or not it is going to contest the Ceann Comhairle's definition of a Money Bill.</P>
    <P>The attitude of this Party, of course, is that the Seanad should not be there at all, that they should have no power whatever to interfere with a decision come to in this House.  I do not intend to press that point now.  The point is, if Senators cannot make up their minds in three days as to whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill, they cannot make up their minds in seven days, <Col N="424" /> and that it is only a waste of time and money to print this Bill for the purpose of extending the period.  I think, therefore, that this Dáil should refuse to give the Bill a First Reading.  I think, if they are to do so, they cannot be annoyed if the duration of this session is unduly prolonged, and if the summer holidays which they are looking forward to should be put back indefinitely, because when you have the Government dealing with frivolous matters of this nature it cannot be expected that the more serious business which appears on the Order Paper can get the attention which it deserves and which we hope to give it.  I would like to know before the Bill is put to a vote if it is intended to alter the definition of what is or is not a Money Bill.  A Money Bill, as defined in the Constitution, is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Or the time of the Dáil.  Personally, I would like to have some information as to why it is thought necessary that the Seanad should have this power of disputing a decision arrived at here.  The Dáil, undoubtedly, should possess the power to dispute the Ceann Comhairle's ruling if they thought that that ruling was incorrect, but I do not see why the Seanad should possess that power, and if they are given that power we do not see why they could not make up their minds to exercise it within the period already defined in the Constitution. We have some respect for the Constitution. There are certain Articles of the Constitution which it is quite possible <Col N="425" /> we would not alter, and we do not like to see it treated in this frivolous manner&mdash;these petty amendments being introduced periodically.  We believe if that practice continues that it will be impossible for anyone in the country to consider the Constitution as anything but the plaything of the Dáil, a thing to be taken in when there is nothing else to be done, and altered, a thing of no real significance whatever.  The case the Government may be able to make for some of the more serious amendments to be passed during the present session cannot be made for this Bill&mdash; a mere trivial amendment to enable Senators to be slower in making up their minds than they are at present. The report of the Committee suggests that in addition to the power given to two-fifths of the members of the Seanad to refer the Bill to the Committee of Privileges, they should also have the power by a majority of the members of the Seanad present and voting at the sitting of the Seanad at which not less than 30 members were present to refer it to the Committee of Privileges.</P>

      <P>I will say it again, please God, if it is necessary.  The Seanad do possess the power by the Constitution, as at present drafted, to hold up a Bill and to send it to the Committee of Privileges by two-fifths of their members giving notice in writing. It is now proposed, in addition to that power, to give them power, by majority voting at a meeting, to do the same thing.  I do not think it is necessary that this duplication of power should be given to them.  I would like to know also if it is usual to have 30 members present at a meeting of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to submit a point of order.  Standing Order 82 says:</P>
      <P>If such motion be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement from the Deputy who moves, and a statement from a Deputy who opposes the motion, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.  If leave to introduce the Bill be given, an Order shall be made for its Second Reading, and the Bill shall be printed.</P>
      <P>My first point of order is that we are not discussing at all the question of whether the Bill shall be printed.  That is a necessary consequence and does not come within the decision of a vote of the House at all.  If the House does take a certain action in voting in a particular way, then it is mandatory upon the House, or whatever organisation there is behind the House for carrying out its executive work, that the Bill shall be printed.</P>

      <P>We are anxious to find out what we can do in this matter, and, unless I am very much mistaken, you have ruled that what we are discussing here is that a particular Bill shall be introduced and shall be printed.  When you look up the records I think you will find, whether that was your intention or not, that that is exactly what was said.  I submit as a point of order that we are entitled to discuss, until we are ruled out, the question whether the Bill shall be printed.

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The position under the Standing Order, as I explained at some length on a previous occasion, is that a motion shall be made that leave be given to introduce a Bill.  If that motion be opposed, an explanatory statement must be permitted from the Deputy moving it and also a statement from a Deputy opposing. I have allowed two statements. The President, having been notified that there was opposition to the Bill, made a statement, and I allowed a statement also from Deputy O'Kelly. The Standing Order allows the Ceann Comhairle discretion to put the question and I propose to put the question without allowing any further statement. I do not understand the Deputy's point of order.</P>

      <P>I am not limiting debate, because debate is not contemplated by the Standing Order. The Standing Order explicity excludes debate and contemplates an explanatory statement from the Deputy moving the Bill and a statement from the Deputy opposing it.  In this particular instance there has been a statement, and it is not proposed to allow a further statement from a Deputy of the same Party as the Deputy who made the statement in opposition.</P>

      <P>I am opposing the introduction of the Bill because I think a wrong procedure has been adopted in carrying out the Report of the Joint Committee which sat to consider the constitution of the Seanad.  We have nine Bills dealing with this Report.  It may be a very excellent rule of procedure to incorporate the Report in nine Bills, but my idea would be, in order that we might discuss the matter properly, and as nearly all the sections are interwoven and hinge on one another, that they should be introduced in one Bill.  I cannot see why, for the purpose of having a proper discussion on the whole Report in regard to the suggested amendments in the constitution of Seanad Eireann, that these Bills should not be incorporated in one Bill. If that is done we will have a very intelligent debate, and it will perhaps save time.  I do not know whether I would be in order now in moving a motion on the matter, but I would suggest to the President that he should consider the question of incorporating the nine Bills in one Bill and give the <Col N="435" /> House an opportunity of discussing the amendments together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In reading over the Report I observe that while there was general approval given to the main recommendations there were many differences of opinion on the several recommendations.  As each matter considered generally dealt with one section of the Constitution, I thought it better in order to get a definite decision on each matter dealing with the Constitution, to have a separate Bill for each amendment that is made.  The other method would have opened up pretty considerable avenues of discussion and it was with a view to getting the best consideration given to each proposal that we brought in a Bill dealing with each recommendation of the Committee.</P>

      <P>The President referred to the fact that there were cross currents at the Committee, that were not divided along party lines, but there were many recommendations which one party opposed in one case and upheld in another.  There was a complete absence of what one might call ordinary party divisions.  I might suggest to the President that it would be better to carry out that principle by leaving all these Bills to an open vote of the House.  That would seem to fulfil the purpose which he had in view in the remarks he has now made in meeting the difficulty which existed in the Committee.</P>

      <P>I submit that it is quite impossible for me, or any other person, to make a reasoned statement opposing the introduction of the Bill without referring to the purpose of the Bill&mdash;the purpose of the Bill as disclosed in the Title and in the explanatory statement made by the President. The President said that the purpose of the Bill was to give effect to recommendation No. 8 of the Committee. I wish to make the House aware of the purpose for which the Bill is being introduced, the reason why this House and this State are being put to the expense of printing this frivolous amendment of the Constitution&mdash;an amendment which, even if it were a good one and one which could be accepted by the good sense of the House, nevertheless for the very cogent reasons given by Deputy O'Hanlon, might easily have been embodied as a special section or even a sub-section in the Constitutional Amendment Bills No. 12 or No. 13 which have been introduced to-day.  In order that the House may decide that the Bill is one which, in the general interest of the public and of the State, it is desirable to print and circulate and proceed with further, we should make ourselves aware of the purpose which, according to the explanatory statement made by the President, is to give effect to recommendation No. 8. <Col N="437" /> The President has referred to that recommendation. The Report is an official report issued by the Joint Committee on the Constitution of Seanad Eireann, and I take it that for the purpose of refreshing the minds of Deputies, who no doubt have read this Report with the closest attention, and bringing home to them what it is desired to do by means of this Bill, I am entitled to read recommendation No. 8, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee recommends that Article 39 of the Constitution be amended to provide that a Bill initiated in and passed by Seanad Eireann which has been amended by Dáil Eireann shall for the passage of the Bill into law be in the same position as if the Bill had been initiated in Dáil Eireann, and shall accordingly be subject to the provisions set out under the recommendation in paragraph 7 above. The Joint Committee further recommends the deletion of the words: &ldquo;If rejected by Dáil Eireann it shall not be introduced again in the same session, but Dáil Eireann may reconsider it on its own motion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are two references there.  The first is to Article 39 of the Constitution, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am entitled to make a statement and I must develop that statement, and the statement must be, at any rate, a coherent, reasonable statement, proceeding from reason to reason, up to the final conclusion, the final conclusion, of course, being that this Bill should not be read a First Time.  In connection with that, I would refer you to Standing Order 82 and also to the debate on the First Reading of the Constitution (Amendment No. 8) Bill which was taken on last Thursday.  On that Bill I put an interpretation, and I think that you more or less assented to it, that there was no limitation imposed by the Standing Order upon a Deputy in the course of his statement, provided that what he was saying was relevant to the motion&mdash;that there was no limitation placed upon a Deputy opposing a First Reading, either in regard to the matter or the length of his statement, provided it was relevant.  The President referred to recommendation 8 and recommendation 8 refers to recommendation 7 of the Report.  That is a very important recommendation, and I should like Deputies, if they have the Report at hand, to read it.  If they have not, with your permission, I propose to read it.  I submit that it is quite impossible to oppose the First Reading of a Bill unless we are permitted to refer to those things which are implicit in the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, on a point of order, that as the specific reason given for introducing the Bill was that it did implement a particular Article of the Report, it must obviously be in order that every Deputy should be continuously in possession of knowledge of what that Article meant.  I have read the Report with great care but I am not going to charge my <Col N="439" /> memory, and I am perfectly sure no Deputy can charge his memory, with knowing what Article 8 or 7 or 3, or any other Article of it, means.  I suggest that it is absolutely necessary.  If the President had not given that explanation, had not stated that it was to implement clause 8 of something, perhaps there might be something in it. But the only reason he gave was that it is to implement the particular clause, and it is not humanly possible for us to be expected to remember the contents and meaning of every clause of every report simply by number and name.  It would be just as much in order for him to say that it was to implement sub-section 2 of clause 8 of Part I of some Bill, and that we would be expected to remember exactly what the contents and ambit of that was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I read clause 8, and in it there is this reference: &ldquo;and shall accordingly be subject to the provisions set out in the recommendations of paragraph 7 above.&rdquo; The reason I wish that this matter should be fully understood at this stage is this: This Bill, though the title of it would lead one to believe that it was only a formal amendment of the Constitution and that the content of it is not very important, makes a fundamental change in the Constitution.  We remember with what pride this Constitution was put before the people. We remember the labour that was used in the making of it, the time that was given to it, and we remember how, in order to show how superior it was to all other constitutions on the face of the globe, the Provisional Government I think it was, issued to the people, and presented to Dáil Eireann, a publication entitled &ldquo;Selected Constitutions of the World.&rdquo;</P>

This publication was issued by the Government, and I think it contains something like nineteen constitutions.  Nine of these constitutions are monarchial and ten of them are Republican States.  Eleven of the nineteen are unitary States and eight are federations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been allowed to make my statement.  I proceeded to say that this Bill should be refused a First Reading on the ground that it proposes a constitutional change of much greater importance than might be covered by the Title of the Bill, or than might be ascertained from a superficial reading of recommendation 8.  I believe, and I have discussed the matter with some Deputies, that some of the Deputies who assented to this proposal never contemplated that it made it mandatory upon the Dáil to pass, within two months after it was presented to the Dáil, a Bill which had been initiated in the Seanad.  I think, when I am attempting to prove a case of this description, I am entitled to the fullest latitude and should not be crabbed, cabined and confined within the mere personal discretion of the Ceann Comhairle. I think that the statement I have made is a sufficiently grave one. <Col N="443" /> I note that the President finds many matters to laugh and joke at in this Constitution&mdash;this Constitution which he defended by force of arms, this Constitution for which he spent twenty millions of the people's money, this Constitution for which he sent men to their graves.  This Constitution, which was a matter of life and death for Irishmen, has become for him the subject for jest and laughter.  We are here endeavouring to make operative and real the principle which is enshrined in Article 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>All powers of government and all authority, legislative, executive and judicial, in Ireland are derived from the people of Ireland, and the same shall be exercised in the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) through the organisations established by, or under, and in accord, with this Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We who wish to make that principle a real and vital, a governing and determining, principle in the constitutional evolution of this body are entitled whenever the Executive introduces a Bill which proposes to overthrow and to emasculate that Article of the Constitution&mdash;not only Article 39 but Article 2 of the Constitution&mdash;we are entitled to oppose that to the uttermost in our power and to state as fully and as clearly as the facilities which have been given to us permit, our reasons for the objection.  I submit <Col N="444" /> that if in making a statement upon those lines we fail to carry conviction, that is the only penalty which can be meted out to us; but we should be permitted that.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will turn to recommendations No. 7 and No. 8 and Articles 38 and 39, and study them clearly, they will see that this Bill which it is proposed now to introduce will have the effect of placing Seanad Eireann in a privileged position, making it a privileged component in the Oireachtas under the Constitution and making it possible for it to enforce its will against the decision of the Dáil by the mere automatic lapse of time.  That is a very serious matter; that is a very serious constitutional amendment to take lightly, even to take so lightly as to go to the extent of permitting a Bill embodying that amendment to be introduced into the Dáil.  For those reasons, therefore, I ask the Dáil to refuse permission to introduce the Bill. If I were permitted time I could develop and prove that case, but in deference to the ruling of the Chair I shall not do so.  Not being allowed to adduce reasons for my statement, I will content myself with saying that I believe this amendment would very seriously affect the Constitution and I ask the Dáil to refuse a First Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the provisions of Article 52 of the Constitution requiring that the members of the Executive Council shall all be members of Dáil Eireann by providing that certain members of the Executive Council shall be members of Dáil Eireann and that the remainder shall be members of the Oircachtas and by making consequential provision in the Constitution as to the right of attendance and audience of Ministers at and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>That is in accordance with recommendation No. 10.</P>

      <P>Personally I feel a certain amount of embarrassment almost amounting to trepidation as a member of this House who is young and unlearned in its forms and ceremonies.  I say that specially in so far as to me Constitutions are things large and important and not to be touched lightly by smaller men, who should not lay hands at all upon sacred instruments of that kind.  I am sorry Deputy O'Hanlon is not here.  One of the difficulties I have is very much the difficulty which the Independents had under the leadership of Deputy O'Hanlon, in relation to a previous one in which he found it difficult to see how one could consistently pick out of an organised structure of the national Constitution, here and there, a particular section for the <Col N="447" /> purpose of incontinent, unexplained and unilluminated scrapping.  It is almost impossible for anyone to contemplate Constitution (Amendment 15) Bill, 1928, without feeling the very greatest trepidation when one sees that it is preceded by Constitution (Amendment) Bills 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9 and 8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, seven and six too. Let us see what the House is faced with in this little Amendment Bill.  I am going to show that it has very, very significant, internationally significant, dangerously internationally significant qualities.  It is not that alone, but the whole atmosphere in relation to government which is represented by throwing at the Dáil Constitution (Amendment) Bills 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, and God only knows how many more afterwards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am submitting to you, sir, is this&mdash;it was submitted with perfect order by my co-respondent, if I might so call him, Deputy O'Hanlon. You cannot take these things separately.  It is a fact that must be taken into account by the Dáil, I submit with all possible respect to you.  I am sorry that the President is going. I submit that we cannot consider one of these things by itself alone.  I mean that it may be a question whether or not one would take one particular brick out of a house.  You might consider it.  But when you are asked to consider the taking of that brick out of the house, when you have already taken seven or eight other bricks out in significant and critical places, you are entitled to inquire, before you attempt to remove that brick, what is going to be the effect upon the whole structure, and what is the attitude of mind towards the whole structure and its continued existence.  When people have the insolence, the impertinence, the careless disregard of constitutional law and practice and the utter contempt of democratic government which is represented by letting a wild bull loose amongst constitutional provisions, <Col N="448" /> to stamp where he likes, to leave the print of his feet here, there, and everywhere&mdash;you cannot consider one single amendment without&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has got to consider this Bill at the moment.  This is a separate Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only adverting, adumbrating, if I may say so, the atmosphere of constitutional objection which surrounds an objection to a specific act.  Is it possible for us to take out of the Constitution Article 52 and not regard the effect the taking out or leaving in or altering Article 52 can have upon other Articles?  Is it possible for us to regard the suggestion of an alteration of that kind in vacuo, in utter disregard of the fact that we have actual knowledge that it is part of a system?  That Amendment Bill 15 is part of a system which contains eleven, twelve and thirteen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has already passed Constitution (Amendment) Bills 11, 12, and 13 and the Deputy cannot now refer to them.  He must keep to Constitution (Amendment No. 15) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will do so.  I have five good reasons.  One of the reasons why one should not attempt to enter upon the consideration of allowing to be printed or initiated, as another job to be run through, Constitution (Amendment No. 15) Bill, is because the Dáil in its wisdom has already over-loaded itself with amendments 11, 12, 13 and 14 to the Constitution. There is a perfectly sound reason in the fact that you will not have time.  But you ought not to do it if you have time.  I can see number 12, for instance, taking fifteen days of Parliamentary time.  I can see 11&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot go back on this. He has mentioned numbers 11 and 12 for the fifth time.  The Deputy must now confine himself to making his objection to number 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am at is this&mdash;you raised it yourself very kindly&mdash;that the Dáil having committed itself to these Bills has <Col N="449" /> already got such a load of constitutional change that it will not be even able to come to this Bill if we waste money on printing it.  It will not be able to give it the consideration or the time which it ought to give to it.  That seems to me a reason in itself good enough.  This Bill is entitled &ldquo;an Act to amend the provisions of Article 52 of the Constitution requiring that the members of the Executive Council shall all be members of Dáil Eireann by providing that certain members of the Executive Council shall be members of Dáil Eireann and that the remainder shall be members of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Now, the memory of the front Opposition Bench&mdash;I am anticipating&mdash;I mean the memory of the front Government Bench is very short.  It is so short that they do not even remember that for party purposes they defined &ldquo;Oireachtas.&rdquo; What was their definition of &ldquo;Oireachtas,&rdquo; and try and fit it into this Bill which you are asked to waste the money of the ratepayers of this country in even printing?  What are the &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo;?  They consist of three parts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the fifth&mdash;Seanad Eireann, the Dáil and Buckingham Palace, &ldquo;and the remainder shall be members of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Seanad Eireann, Dáil Eireann and Buckingham Palace.  I suppose somebody really did advert to the meaning of the terms which we used in drafting this Bill.  We are entitled to assume that those who did advert to it adverted to it with a knowledge of the fact that the Oireachtas had been, for Governmental purposes, itself part of the scheme of which this Bill is one integral and necessary part. It defines &ldquo;Oireachtas,&rdquo; and if that definition of &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; stands, then this Bill wants throwing out.  I do not know who is responsible for putting that word in.  If it means what they defined it to mean&mdash;the Seanad and the Dáil and the King, which King?  The Seanad and the Dáil and the King&mdash;<Col N="450" /> that is their own definition of &ldquo;Oireachtas,&rdquo; and this Bill has got to stand over that, and every single provision of it has got to be consistent with that Party definition.  They had an opportunity of defining &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; in three separate ways.  Two of them were given to them by my friend and colleague, Deputy Little.</P>

I take it his object would have been to let members on this side of the House really understand.  He has not given that explanation.  The President is allowed to give an explanatory statement.  As far as I understand the ruling I am entitled to make a statement.  I must, at least, be able to make an explanatory statement.

      <P>I am asking that you refuse to give a First Reading to this Bill, that you refuse to print or publish or have any responsibility for a measure which apparently separates Dáil Eireann from the Oireachtas.  I am asking you to refuse to give a First Reading to a Bill which calls upon you to make consequential provision for the attendance of the Oireachtas outside the Dáil, which only consists of the King and the Seanad.  You cannot do it.  You cannot compel the King to come here.</P>

      <P>I want to know how the words on the face of that thing can possibly be carried out.  I cannot see it, and because the President would not give any explanation as to how it is to be done, I say that it is waste of money.  I say that that is a sound reason.  It is consequential; if we pass this thing, we have to print it.  &ldquo;If leave to introduce a Bill be given an Order shall be made for Second Reading and the Bill shall be printed.&rdquo;  We cannot afford to print a thing like that. We ought not to try.  Why should it <Col N="455" /> be printed?  I am objecting now deliberately to the cost of printing a Bill which, on the face of it, is utterly inconsistent. It contains an international unconstitutional amendment, which has inherent in it a suggestion of power in this Dáil not in the Oireachtas; which has the suggestion that there is inherent in the Dáil power to make consequential arrangements providing for the attendance of the King.  It is a waste of money.</P>

If the Legislature consists, as my friend Deputy Lemass said the other day in relation to the shamrock, of three leaves &mdash;the King, the Dáil and the Seanad&mdash; how on earth can certain members be members of Dáil Eireann and the remainder be members of the Oireachtas, considering that you have still two leaves left, the King in Buckingham Palace and the somnolent people up above?</P>

That is a degradation of a democratic principle. They had other machinery.  Everything that is democratic in this thing could have been done without this under the Extern Ministers.  I object to it because it is a further step in the abolition of Extern Ministers.  There we had a case where we, in our Constitution, decided that we should not be restricted in the ambit of our choice, that we should not be restricted to the choice of the caucus of the Executive Council or the caucus of the Party upholding the Executive.  We had there <Col N="458" /> the principle where the House could go outside and choose its own Ministers, who would be responsible to the House irrespective of the Executive Council. We had that machinery, but this machinery is utterly degrading from that point of view.  It is to give power to the Executive Council, which is a unit, which works as a unit, which has to be dismissed as a unit, to take in any recollection of the bad old days which they might have enshrined and put in cold storage above&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nuair a cuireadh an díosbóireacht ar ath-ló, bhíos ag cainnt ar cheist an telegrafa.  Ar feadh na gcúig mblian seo thart tá an uimhir de telegrama a tugadh isteach ag oifigí an phuist ag laghdú.  Ní amháin go bhfuil an uimhir ag dul síos, ach go bhfuil an t-ioncum ag laghdú.  I 1923-24 sé an méid ioncuim a bhí ann ná £266,207 agus i 1927 £221,900.  Mar a theasbáin an Teachta Lemass, tá laghdú ar chostas an seirbhís telegrafa fén duthaigh agus tá sé níos áirde san gcathair.  Ní dubhairt an Rúnaidhe Páirliminte go rabh aon iarracht ghá dhéanamh chun an costas do laghdú. Dubhairt an tAire go mbeadh an costas nua ar mhuinntir tráchtála agus ní ar an mhuinntir coitchianta ach ní chreidim sin.  Is é mo thuairim go mbeidh an costas ní amháin ar na daoine atá ag obair i gcúrsaí tráchtála ach go mbeidh sé an-mhór in áiteacha ar fuid na tíre, áiteacha ná fuil i ngiorracht d'oifig phuist agus in a bhfuil táille le n-íoc.  Béidh sé ar na daoine seo&mdash;daoine atá ina gcomhnaí ar oileán no b'fhéidir sa Ghaeltacht&mdash; an costas nua d'íoc agus an táille chó maith.</P>
      <P>Tá cheist polasaí a bhaineas leis an gceist seo.  Tá an guthán ghá leathnú ar fuid na tíre agus táthar ag súil go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó airgid ag teacht isteach ar a shon san.  Ach go dtí seo caitheadh a lán airgid ar an ngutháan agus ní amháin ar an nguthán ach ar thelegrafa chó maith.  Cuireadh ceist ar an Aire mar gheall ar na daoine atá ina gcomhnuí ar an teórainn agus níor fhreagair an tAire an cheist chó soiléir agus ba chóir do. Ní bheidh aon bhac ar na daoine atá ina gcomhnaí in aice leis an dteorainn dul thar an teorann agus telegram do chur ar an sean-íoc&mdash;sgilling amháin. Ní dubhairt an tAire dada mar gheall ar an mbealach no ar an gcaoi ina socrófar an cheist sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dubhairt an tAire go raibh an Rialtas chun connartha nua do dhéanamh le Rialtas na Bhreataine Móire no go rabhadar ag ceapadh an chonnartha atá ann d'atharú.  Ní mór dó teasbáint dúinn cad a dhéanfaidh sé ar an gceist seo&mdash;ceist na ndaoine in a gcomhnaí ar thaobh na teorann agus atá in-án dul isteach ins na sé condaethe agus telegrafa do chur ar 1/-.  Dubhairt an tAire go mbeidh an méid céanna telegrafa le chur feasta agus 1/6 orra agus a bhí; agus dá mbeadh aon laghdú orra ní bheadh sé mór.  Más rud é go bhfuil an méid céanna telegrafa ag dul tríd an bpost saoileann sé go mbeidh <Col N="461" /> sé in án rud éigin do dhéanamh annso agus annsúd chun an costas do laghdú. Is dó liom gur sgadán dearg é sin atá an tAire ag iarraidh a tharrac isteach. Deireann sé gurab é bun agus bárr na ceiste seo ná go bhfuil an costas rothrom ar na daoine lasmuich de lucht tráchtála agus de na daoine a bhfuil spéis speisialta aca ins an cheist seo. Deir an tAire go mbeidh gá le cáin mhór chun na hoibre seo do choimeád mar atá.</P>
    <P>Isé teacht isteach an telegram ná 1/3½ ach isé an costas atá ar an Roinn mar gheall ar an telegram san ná 2/5. Tá 1/1½ cailte ar gach telegram.  Ní ceart don Rialtas an costas san do chur ar dhaoine eile&mdash;daoine nách bhfuil baint acu, no fíor-bheagán bainte aca &mdash;leis an gceist seo.  Dubhairt sé nach féidir socrú no system níos fearr do dhéanamh ionnus go ndíolfe na seirbhísí asta fhéin.  Deir sé go bhfuil an iomad d'airgead na ndaoine gá chaitheamh agus go mba cheart an t-ualach san d'atharú ó ghuailnibh na ndaoine coitchianta go dtí guailnibh na ndaoine a chuireann telegrama tríd an bpost.</P>

      <P>Tá a rabh le rá agam ráidhte.  Ós rud é go bhfuil an Teachta de Bhulbh mí-shásta liom agus go n-abrann sé go bhfuilim a léigheamh m'oráide, b'fhéidir go mbeidh sé níos sásta liom má chromaim ar an Bhéarla.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister for Finance, in asking the Dáil to pass this Bill, has thrown a red herring into the discussion and cleverly evaded the important question of whether or not economies should be effected in the administration of the telegraph service by saying that the whole question is that under present circumstances an enormous burden has been placed on the rest of the community who are not themselves in the habit of sending telegrams and that the whole of that burden should be borne by the business community or whatever other people are mainly sending these telegrams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House expected, and I hope before the discussion closes the Minister will say something more than he has on this important question of effecting economy in the administration of the telegraph service.  The question, in my opinion, is not chiefly the changing of the burden, or the lessening of the burden, of the subsidy which he claims the taxpayer is paying for an <Col N="463" /> adequate telegraph service, but whether the cost to the business community and those who are sending telegrams could not have been greatly reduced if the Minister, during the past few years, had taken steps to see that this service, which we know he and other Ministers stress as a service, which is being conducted on business lines and which would bear favourable comparison with business concerns, had gone into the matter or had got his Parliamentary Secretary to go into this business of telegraph administration, as the director of a private business concern would have done.  I think he would have found considerable room for economies, and by effecting those economies it would not have been necessary either to charge the tax-paying community with a burden of £150,000 per year, nor would it have been necessary to inflict upon those who are sending telegrams an extra fee of sixpence per telegram.  The cost has been estimated by the Minister for Finance at 2/7 per telegram, while the receipts in respect of each telegram come to only 1/3½, so that there is a loss of 1/3½ per telegram, or £150,000 per year.  The Minister has not vouchsafed any details to show us in what way he computes that cost of 2/7, nor has he, as he might have, when he contemplates that an addition should be made to the charge for telegrams, gone on to show what the result would be in a detailed manner.  He has simply said that he does not anticipate any considerable diminution in the number of telegrams.  He says that he is not convinced, so far as the arguments may have been made by representatives of the business community, that this new charge inflicts a further burden upon the producers and upon the business community generally.  He is not satisfied that that is a fair statement of the case, and he wants to lead the House to believe that the burden, in fact, will mainly fall upon individuals concerned in betting.  It has been pointed out by various other Deputies that that is an over-statement, that there are certain merchants in the country engaged in the egg trade, for example, whose business demands that they should be in daily and constant intercourse with the <Col N="464" /> English markets.  I think unless the Minister can produce further details to prove the strength of his argument, the House would be well advised to follow their own common sense and to agree with me that, instead of inflicting a burden upon the people interested in gambling, the burden will be inflicted upon merchants such as I have mentioned, whose business makes it necessary for them to be in constant touch with other agents and with the English markets.</P>
    <P>How will the extra cost imposed upon them work out?  The Minister says it will not effect any diminution in the number of telegrams and that any diminution that may eventually be caused will be more than counterbalanced by the economies that will be effected.  It is an extraordinary way to carry out economies that you should first have to impose an additional cost on the consumer in order to carry your economies subsequently into effect. Why not carry out the economies in any case and show the House what has been done and what could be done in order to reduce the cost before you inflict a further burden upon the producer?</P>
    <P>The trunk system of telephones is now fairly well established throughout the country and it may be the attitude of the Ministry that they desire to subsidise in this strange way the telephone service by compelling the people to use it.  I think they said pretty definitely that in the vicinity of Dublin telegrams had decreased considerably and they have tried to argue that there is a greater loss in the administration of the telegraph service in Dublin City and round about than down the country and that that is caused by the fact that an increasing number of people about Dublin who would otherwise have used the telegraph are now using the telephone.  If the Minister wants telephones to become more widely used, if it is his desire to carry it still further down the country and get a larger number of people to instal telephones, I think he could have found a more economical and desirable way to achieve his end than by putting an extra cost on telegrams, because at the present time there is a heavy loss on the telephone <Col N="465" /> as well as on the telegraph service.  It is not a case of what you lose on the swing you gain on the roundabouts.  It is quite possible, and I venture to predict what will happen is, that you are going to have a continual loss both on the swings and the roundabouts, and the Ministry in imposing this new rate have not looked forward sufficiently and contemplated the result of their action.</P>
    <P>They have not contemplated what exactly is going to happen in connection with the telephones.  They had a vague idea that there would be an increase in the telephone service, and there the matter stands.  As a matter of fact, even if there is an increase, and if there was a proportionate increase such as we would expect if a large number of people now considered that telegrams were too expensive, and that it would be more profitable and cheaper to use the telephone, even if a large number of people changed their habits in that respect, we are not at all sure, and we have not received any assurance from the Minister that the telephone service, as it stands at present, would be able to cope with any new demand on a large scale.  The telephone service is greatly in arrear, and until the telephone service is properly established and developed and is able to stand on its own legs largely, and to show that it can be run as a business proposition, the cost of the telegraph service should not be made prohibitive for those availing of it.  The Post Office, as a whole, is being run, we are told, as a business proposition. But until that stage has been reached, until the telephone service is working clearly and definitely as a separate unit and has shown indications that it will in future be able to pay its way, I submit that it is a mistaken policy to assist it in this manner by trying to force people to establish telephones in their houses and make it too expensive for them to pay 1/6 for a telegram.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the delivery fee in out-of-the-way districts where the people are poor.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance thinks that these people are not very much interested in the matter of telegrams, and that they only get a few during the year.  Nevertheless, in those cases where <Col N="466" /> the total income of the poorer people is very small, and where the people are living in places which are remote from telegraph offices, porterage fees are excessive. While the Minister is trying to lead us to believe that it will be possible to effect economies in the service and add on an additional cost to the price of the telegrams, and at the same time to give even a better service &mdash;not alone to maintain the present service, but to make it cheaper for the people in remote districts, to reduce the delivery or porterage fees for the poorer people in remote places&mdash;he has given us no definite idea as to what he has in mind.  He has made a statement. He showed by a certain amount of information, which will be naturally irritating to the people who live in those remote places that are not favourably situated, that these charges for porterage are going to continue there, and not only that, but the cost of the telegrams is to be increased by 50 per cent. The Minister also stated that economies would be effected this year, and perhaps this was an attempt to answer those who thought that, perhaps, better efforts might be made to secure economies and to carry out this work on a system that would bear better comparison with business methods.  He stated that the temporary staffs that had been employed throughout the past few years had been largely got rid of; that large numbers of auxiliary postmen and staffs in the lower grades of the Post Office had been got rid of, and that in that way economies had been uneffected. Great hardship had been undoubtedly caused to large numbers of these people who had been in what they thought was a quasi-permanent form of employment for years past.</P>

      <P>This Bill seems to be a step in the right direction, and it is time that some steps be taken to encourage and protect what is supposed to be a most important trade. It will chiefly affect store cattle and, of course, that trade, except for this particular year, seems to be the most important trade of all.  As we are not perhaps in a position to complete or fatten all our stores, we are compelled to export most of them.  The amendments that were introduced in connection with the Bill seemed to be workable and well-advised.  As far as sheep are concerned, I do not suppose we export many store sheep.  I do not know how many, but I believe the number is very small.  Similarly in regard to store pigs.  There is no mention made of horses.  I do not know if horses get foot-and-mouth disease.</P>

      <P>I suppose they do not.  It will, as I say, chiefly affect the question of store cattle and, as those traders have suffered a great deal and had great difficulties put in their way owing to the particular measure adopted, this Bill certainly will be a great relief to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it will also have the effect of a better and more severe veterinary inspection at the ports.  That matter does not always get the attention it deserves.  In regard to the fat cattle trade, it is a matter of the very greatest importance, because somehow or other tubercular cattle are allowed to go through the ports from time to time.  The Bill, as I said previously, is, no doubt, a great boon.  It is a pity, I think, that it could not go a step further, but, as the Minister explained, that perhaps would be going too far.  Owing to detention, the dealers in cattle sometimes suffer very <Col N="474" /> serious financial losses.  At times the periods of detention are unduly prolonged. It would be a great thing if this detention could be obviated, when we consider that those concerned are not getting any particular relief under this Bill.  I hope that, as a result of this Bill, the inspections at the ports will be more severe than they have been in the past.  It is very detrimental, no doubt, to the cattle trade of this country when animals from Ireland are shown in the markets suffering, perhaps, from tuberculosis.  The dealers at the fairs buy these animals rather cheaply and sell them at a greater profit than if they had bought good cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'REILLY Mr. O'REILLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be hoped that through the operations of this Bill that sort of thing will be stopped.  The stamps are to cost 2½d. and if, as we hope, we have not an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the country for a great many years, the money spent on these stamps will amount to a considerable sum.  It was strange, for instance, that during the war we had no outbreak of foot and mouth disease here.  I suppose we have to thank Providence for that, but other people might suggest other reasons for it.  At all events, a good deal of money will accumulate through the operation of this system in regard to the stamps, so that the trustees will have sufficient funds at their disposal to meet a very serious outbreak of disease if, unhappily, such a thing should occur. These outbreaks in England, and sometimes in this country, result in very serious losses, especially in the districts and counties where people go in for the feeding of store cattle.  It is the custom with dealers, if there is a rumour of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease to go around and make large purchases.  Occasionally the producers who sell their stock in such circumstances suffer great losses, while the dealers reap great profits.  It would be a great thing if we could devise some means of giving the unfortunate producer a more stable market than he has at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> In the agricultural line, at all events, the producer suffers most.  All the misfortune that occurs seems to fall back on him.  This measure may, perhaps, partly save him.  I hope it is not the last attempt that we will have to save him. I hope that Bills such as this will continue to be brought in, and that under them some attempt will be made to recoup producers for the losses they have incurred during the last five, six or seven years.  The outlook has improved somewhat as regards the fat cattle.  As regards store cattle, in general we are not able to turn them out in a fit condition.  The Scotsmen think that they are not far enough advanced, and sometimes they are not inclined to pay the price that we here think we should get for them.  I suppose that is due to the fact that we are not able to feed them well enough. The result, at any rate, is that the country suffers a great loss.</P>

On the question of pigs, I do not say that it will affect pigs so much, because we do not export pigs to any great extent.  For some years past we have exported more pork than pigs.

      <P>I do not think I had any strands on my eyes on the Report Stage.  I do not suppose it makes any difference anyway.  As to the method of assessment, it is most important, and is a thing that might lead to serious abuses.  I believe the amendment brought in to have cattle slaughtered, the bodies sold and the prices paid to the trustees, is a good one.  The trustees, I take it, will pay the value assessed to the owner.  That is a very wise amendment, and it will prevent a good deal of abuse which might arise. In the cattle trade, and I suppose in other trades, everything does not go perfectly straight.  The Bill is guarding against everything, and even the other Government in this country has taken steps to adopt a Bill on the same lines as this, so that there will be no hardship as far as that is concerned.  It seemed to me as if there was a tendency to draw all the traffic to the Dublin Port, and that might not be a bad thing, and then Dublin would nearly have all the good things.  I hope other disabilities the trade suffers from will also be attended to.</P>

      <P>It was suggested that this Bill be recommitted when it came to the Report Stage.  We had the Committee Stage about a fortnight ago, and certain amendments I suggested were agreed to in order to enable the Deputies to read the Bill as a whole with these amendments inserted, and it was agreed when the Bill came up for Report to have it recommitted and that amendments the House wished to make could be inserted.  The <Col N="478" /> Bill came up this day week on Report, and at that stage it was quite clear there was some misunderstanding&mdash;I was not clear as to what the misunderstanding was&mdash;and I agreed to adjourn the Report Stage until to-day.  We have the Report Stage now.  So far as I see, there is only one amendment on the paper, and that is the amendment to Section 10, which I now move:&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the last day when this Bill came up we had a certain objection to its being taken that day, as we had not had time to consider it. Since then we have had time to consider the Bill, but we have not been able to suggest any amendment that would make the Bill worth while in the way of saving the timber of this country.  The big point is that there are not sufficient woods or forests in the country.  Then there is the point that timber was cut down in woods and forests during the last ten or twenty years and exported on a huge scale. This Bill could be made much simpler by simply introducing a one-clause Act setting forth that the Minister for Agriculture be empowered to deal with forestry.  Every single section of the Bill states the Minister has power to do so and so, and if passed it will make the Minister a dictator in the timber trade.  There are people interested in the trade and they have issued circulars. From reading these circulars one would come to the conclusion that the people in the trade seemed to be fearful of the results of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They certainly have very good reason to be so, because it really depends on the Minister for Agriculture whether, for instance, a certain timber merchant is going to be driven <Col N="479" /> out of business.  The absolute power lies with the Minister to allow one man to cut down a tree or trees and to prevent another man from doing so. It is, perhaps, not possible as regards the present Minister, but it might be possible in the case of a Minister for Agriculture who would be addicted to allow his feelings to get the better of him, to issue these orders or refuse to issue them in such a way as to put timber in the way of certain merchants and prevent other merchants from getting timber at all.  For instance, there is Section 2 where the question of the Minister's power arises first. It says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister may, from time to time, by order made under this sub-section declare that this Act or such part thereof as may be specified in such order shall not apply to any tree of the species named in such order.&rdquo;  It must, of course, be admitted that it does not give the Minister very much power to differentiate between one merchant and another, but it gives him power to specify that such a tree should not be amongst the trees specified as those to which this Act applies.  I admit that that is a very difficult point to deal with.  It is very difficult for us at this stage of the Bill to make out a list of trees to which the Act should apply.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult for us to be sure, when we passed the Act, that we had specified every tree to which the Act should apply, and that we would not have to come again after a few months and introduce an amending Bill, mentioning some tree that was omitted.  At any rate, there might possibly have been another method found to deal with it, and, if it referred only to the trees that should come under the Act, that section would not be so bad, but it seems to have a wider application.  It seems not only to apply to the Order with regard to cutting such trees, but it has a wider application inasmuch as it refers to every other Order.  When you come to Section 7 it says: &ldquo;Whenever a felling notice has been given in respect of any tree the Minister may, unless such tree is an exempted tree within the meaning of this section, within but <Col N="480" /> not after twenty-one days from the date on which such notice was so given, make and serve on the owner by or on whose behalf such notice was given or his successor in title an Order (in this section referred to as a Prohibition Order) in the prescribed form prohibiting the cutting down or uprooting of such tree.&rdquo;  I believe that that is really a dangerous section.  As I said, a Minister&mdash;I need not say the Minister in this case&mdash;of Agriculture might, for some reason or another, prevent a man from selling his wood or his forest to a certain merchant. Let us suppose that a Minister did not want a certain merchant to do business. He might prevent an order going there and might, for some reason, say that these trees must not be cut down, and after two or three months another merchant might come along who might be permitted to cut down the trees.  On the other hand, a Minister might, for some reason or another, prevent a man who wanted to have trees cut and, such trees being mature and ready for market, a man might be seriously injured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not only could a grave injury be done to a merchant under this section, a merchant whose only means of livelihood was the timber trade, but the owner of trees might be seriously injured.  The Minister for Agriculture might prevent him from getting a permit to cut timber while prices were good and while the timber was in a proper state for cutting.  At a later stage, when the timber was not in a good state and when prices were not so good, the permit might come along and the owner of the timber might lose seriously as a result.  In Section 8 there is a certain amount of arbitrary power given to the Minister which is not as serious as in Section 7, but another very serious section is Section 9, under which the Minister &ldquo;may if he so thinks fit, grant to any persons a general permit grant in the prescribed form to cut down or uproot any trees in any specified wood in the ordinary course of thinning or clearing such wood either with a view to replanting, or in accordance with the general practice of good forestry.&rdquo;  I know that the Minister, in introducing this Bill, gave us an explanation that it would be practically impossible to give any sort of special permit for thinning out any forest or any wood, but this section might have been made a little more watertight, because, as it reads, it appears to me that the Minister can if he so thinks fit, grant a general permit to a person to cut timber even though it was not being done for the purpose of thinning or in accordance with the general practice of forestry or anything else.  A man might, for instance, cut his timber at a certain stage when it did not require thinning or when it could be sold for building poles, scaffolding poles or things of that sort, or where it did not require thinning he might be granted a permit <Col N="482" /> under the pretence that the permit would be used by this man for thinning whereas in reality it might be used for the purpose of cutting down timber for sale, thereby depriving the country of the small amount of timber which we have got.</P>
      <P>In Section 13 we see again that the Minister, for some reason or another which I do not quite understand, has taken to himself the power of discretion as to whether anybody shall be proceeded against under this Act or not. The section says: &ldquo;Proceedings for an offence under this Act shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Minister.  Every offence under any provision of this Act may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister as prosecutor.&rdquo;  I do not know for what reason sub-section (1) was inserted&mdash;that proceedings shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Minister.  One would imagine that in the ordinary way if a Civic Guard were to see an offence committed under the Act he would have power to proceed just as he would for an offence under any other Act, but for some reason or another there is a provision put in here that the proceedings shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Minister.  That appears to me to give power to the Minister to proceed in certain cases or not to proceed in certain cases as he thinks fit. There is always danger in cases of this sort that the personal element will have influence, and that an offender under this Act who is personally known to the Minister, or personally known to a friend of the Minister's, will not have proceedings taken against him, whereas if he were not so known proceedings would be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a clause in the Bill which asks merchants to make returns of exports of timber, but for what reason we do not know.  We are all well aware that the export of timber from this country is not very large.  As a matter of fact, the import of timber is larger, but the big difference is that the timber that is exported is practically all exported in a raw or unmanufactured state, whereas the timber imported is all imported in a manufactured state.  The timber that we send <Col N="483" /> out of the country goes out without having given any employment practically. It may provide some little employment in the cutting down or in bringing it to the port, but the timber that comes in does not give any employment. The most part of it comes in in the manufactured state.  I do not want to delay the time of the Dáil by quoting figures, but if anybody would get the trade and shipping statistics for 1927 and read up the returns of the imports and exports of timber he will see this point very well illustrated.  He will see that not only is the timber brought in sawn into boards, but that even big sums of money went out of the country for wooden boxes and things of that sort while, as everybody knows, our own carpenters and workpeople are idle in the country.  None of the timber exported is manufactured.  It is all sent out in the raw, unmanufactured state, and gives practically no employment before leaving this country.  For those reasons, I, for one, will oppose this Bill &mdash;I might say more for the provisions it does not contain than for the provisions it does contain.  I have also very strong objections to arbitrary powers being given to any Minister in a case like this, where it is absolutely in his power to make or break people in certain trades.</P>

      <P>I am not in favour of this Bill.  I think it is altogether too bad.  I consider it is pretty hard luck on a man who planted trees years ago to have to comply with all those rules and regulations.  Afforestation is certainly a good thing for any country, but in most European countries, anyway, I think it is worked on certain well-defined principles.  In regard to afforestation as we have it in Ireland, I do not think it is fair to compel men who planted, say, thirty, forty, fifty or sixty acres of land for the purpose of getting a monetary benefit out of it at a future date to comply with such orders as are in the Bill.  I do not think that it is equitable, or that people will agree to such a principle. The Bill is entirely too drastic.  There are a good many points in it, and it is not easy to understand how they will work out; for instance, compliance with the statement in felling notices.  I suppose if exporters get permission to cut down trees you can see that the orders will be complied with, but I do not see how you can devise means by which farmers who cut down trees will use them for the specific purpose mentioned in this measure.  It will take a good deal of vigilance to see what they will do with such timber.  It is difficult to see how that will work.  The Bill compels you to give notice when you want to cut down trees.  It would, perhaps, be a good thing if it compelled people to cut down certain trees.  There are a good many places in Ireland where good land is destroyed by trees, especially the ash, which do an amount of damage to tillage.  They impoverish the soil, and in the autumn, when the leaves fall, they are a serious destruction to grass, as they turn it sour.  It might not, as I say, be a bad thing to compel people to cut down such trees. There is another matter in connection with timber felled in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had to import wood to make egg boxes.  People were not allowed to export <Col N="485" /> eggs in native timber; it was considered to be too damp.  That, to a certain extent, prevented the cutting of timber&mdash;it was a good deal of protection. The passing of a Bill of this description means a great loss of time. It will not have any effect, because most of the timber that was useful, that beautified the country and helped to change the climate, has already gone. We started to close the door when the steed had been stolen.  It will not have any beneficial effect on afforestation.  If the Government could see its way to devise a regular scheme of afforestation, under which they would take 1,000 acres in places, put men to tend the trees, have them properly looked after, see that the fences were kept up, and have a regular staff to look after them, we could possibly produce timber that would be really beneficial or be turned into use.  Most of the timber here, except in the last few years, is ornamental.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions there does not seem to be any object in the Bill except to prevent people from cutting timber altogether.  There are cases where it is necessary to cut timber; where trees are a distinct loss to the farmer, where they diminish the productivity of the land.  Three months in the back end, from the time the leaves start to drop until the wind blows them away, are practically a loss.  Of course we cannot expect to have it both ways. It is for these reasons I believe that an afforestation scheme should be in existence whereby you could have trees in places where they would be tended and looked after properly.</P>
    <P>The general permit for felling trees does not exist for more than one year; it will have to be renewed the following year.  I do not see the reason for that, except that it will create more work and consequently more expense. If any person burns any shrubs in contravention of this section that will also bring about a certain amount of difficulty. Farmers, like other individuals, are not always in agreement.  Sometimes petty animosities arise, and they take every opportunity of intensifying them and having their own revenge. This section may give rise to abuses. Farmers may be let in for what they do not expect.  The definition of furze and whins seems to be especially accurate. <Col N="486" /> I suppose the Minister expected that some serious question might arise on that point.  I know that there is a difference of opinion in some parts of the country as to what is a whin bush and what is a furze bush.  It was well that that was defined.</P>
    <P>Taking it all round, the Bill will not serve any useful purpose.  If, instead of having all this expense of supervision, you let the farmers have the trees free, you certainly would have a good deal of afforestation.  This Bill assumes that farmers have not cultivated a taste for landscape; that they have no taste for ornamentation, and are materialistic purely and simply. That is not the case.  Farmers always had a good deal of taste for Nature's beauties.  More than any other section of the community, they are in constant touch with nature.  They are not handling inanimate machinery.  They are constantly in communion with Nature, and I believe that this is a sort of slur on that good point that they possess.  If they get the opportunity, and if the Minister would consider giving them young trees free, I believe that they would plant them in proper places and protect them, and that they would beautify the landscape and ornament the country.  They are not such uncouth individuals as some people believe.  They do not simply fell the trees and fell them for money. In cases where they did cut them down and sell them, they did it because the trees were interfering with the productivity of the land.  I do not know many farmers who cut down trees for fun or merely for money.  I believe they cut them down because it is going to be beneficial to their farms or to themselves. What did take place was that, when some landlords were notified that their land was to be sold, they preceeded to cut down the trees.  In a good many cases they had too many of them; the land was overcrowded.  I think that we would be better employed if we started a scheme to replant these lands and gave them some assistance. No doubt these trees were put in the best position from the point of view of ornamentation and on the best land, because it takes good land to grow good trees.  I do not believe we <Col N="487" /> will ever grow them on poor land.  At the same time, this Bill can, more or less, be taken as an insult by the intelligent farmer, and that is one of the reasons I oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Title of the Bill very carefully and I cannot understand how any Deputy, having read the Title, can see his way to oppose it, particularly at this stage. The Title reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An Act to make further and better provision for promoting afforestation and for that purpose to amend the Forestry Act, 1919, to restrict the felling of trees, and to make other provisions connected therewith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill, and I believe that there has been a general demand for some years for a Bill of this kind.  That does not necessarily commit me to every detail of the Bill.  The principle is there, and I cannot understand how any Deputy, especially a Deputy like Deputy O'Reilly, who speaks for the farming community, opposes the Bill.  It was generally agreed that the amendments put down for the Committee Stage should be allowed to go through, so that the Bill could be reprinted and Deputies would have an opportunity of studying it and seeing whether they could put down any amendment.  Not one amendment has been put down.  I rise particularly to inform the Minister that there is a fear amongst certain saw-millers and people engaged in the wood-working industry that the operations of this Bill will affect them detrimentally. I have not been given any good reason for that particular statement, but I have been warned by one man who is a saw-miller and gives a reasonable amount of employment that when this Bill comes into operation he will have to close down.  He makes the claim that there should be a prohibition against the export of timber from this country.  I realise that if you prohibit the export of timber in the round and raw state, that is going to be detrimental to persons who have trees to fell and sell, and that you would thereby give a monopoly to people to buy timber at their own prices in their <Col N="488" /> own country.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that the measure, if it passes, will not be allowed to be administered in a detrimental way so far as the saw-millers and the people engaged in woodwork are concerned.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would prefer to see a preference given in the case of timber that has been cut down and offered for sale to people engaged in manufacturing it in this country rather than see it going in unlimited quantities out of the country in a raw state.  At any rate, as far as I can see, the people engaged in saw-milling are not going to be in any worse position in the future than they were before this Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister has anything to say as to the way the Bill is likely to be administered so far as it concerns people engaged in the saw-milling industry in this country. Apart from this objection, I could not make a case against the Bill, especially in view of the principle which it contains and the Title.  I, therefore propose to vote for the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy used the wrong word because it was the Title he emphasised several times and he said in view of the Title he could not see how anyone would vote against it.  We would be well satisfied with the Title of this Bill if the provisions were not so faulty. Taking it as it is now amended, I do not think anybody can hold it is going to have any good effect upon afforestation. There is provision made for the acquisition of land.  I admit that is a useful provision, except that I think there should be some provision made for securing that where a fairly big area of land, suitable for afforestation, is taken over such land as is suitable in that area for agricultural purposes should not be liable to be taken over for afforestation.  There are districts, for instance, in the County Wicklow where you have hundreds of acres suitable in the main only for afforestation <Col N="489" /> but that contain, here and there, a good many acres of land suitable for agricultural purposes and for tillage purposes.  To the people living in such areas that land is of great importance. I think it would be a great pity if, in the administration of this Act, that land is taken over completely. People in this area would have a very big grievance and some of those familiar with the provisions of this Bill are rather worried as to what it may mean in the future.</P>
      <P>It is to be remembered that it does nothing to preserve existing supplies. There are provisions in it by which the Minister may prohibit the felling of trees and there is an important provision, of course, that nobody is entitled to cut a tree without a licence or without giving notice that he intends to fell.  It does not mean that there is to be any diminution in the felling of timber in the State.  It means that if the Minister and his Department choose there will be a diminution, but there is no provision made for a check on that power. There is no provision made by which the Dáil or any other body can see whether the Act is being administered with that object in view or not.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for Deputy O'Reilly; I am only responsible for myself.  To-morrow, if there was a Minister for Agriculture in power who choose to do it, he could issue so many licences for the felling of timber that the felling would proceed at a much more rapid rate than before The whole principle of the Bill to me is repugnant.  I do not think any Department <Col N="490" /> should be entrusted with so much power as is given to the Department of Agriculture by this Bill.  It may be all right, as I said on Second Reading, to say that the present Minister for Agriculture will not, anyhow, abuse this power and will be careful to see that licences are issued fairly and that no undue influence is used upon the Department.  And he may be careful to see that too many licences are not issued; but to-morrow you may have a Minister for Agriculture that may not be so careful or so scrupulous. I think in all legislation we should consider, not the present Minister or his staff, but we should consider human nature as it is.  Even taking conditions as they are, we have seen that less than a year ago a member of the staff of the Broadcasting Corporation was dismissed for a very harmless letter in the newspapers.  Now, if one Department of Government can take such action as that, is it unreasonable to assume that another Department will give more preference to applications for the felling of timber from members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party than from somebody opposed to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything ridiculous in the suggestion, and similarly we saw recently, too, when we had a discussion here on the matter, when a Minister of the Government practically admitted that he had used his power to destroy the employment of a man who was opposed to him politically.  He at least stated that he would not sanction or negotiate with a very good organisation simply because this man was connected with it.  In face of examples of that kind, I suggest that the House should be rather careful about giving a Department such powers.  However, it is not merely the Minister that we are trusting on this occasion.  It is the Gárda Síochána.  There is one section of the Act which says: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any person to cut down or uproot any tree unless not less than 21 days before the commencement of the cutting down or uprooting of such tree the owner thereof or his predecessor in title, or some person on be half of such owner or predecessor in title, shall have given to the sergeant <Col N="491" /> in charge of the Gárda Síochána station nearest to such tree a notice in writing (in this Act referred to as a felling notice) of intention to cut down or uproot such tree.&rdquo;  There is nothing said of what proof there is to be of the delivery of this notice.  If the sergeant likes to take it and deliver it, well and good.  But if the sergeant likes to put it into the fire, the man who had gone to the trouble of giving this notice will have to bear the penalty either in the form of a fine or imprisonment.  The whole Bill is full of pitfalls, and, further, I believe it does not represent the mind of the Government.  I have correspondence here before me extending from 1923 right up to the present day which shows that the present Bill is not on the lines on which the Government intended to proceed at all.

      <P>I have this further remark to make, that with regard to the power that the Bill gives to the Ministry to hold up the raw material of important industries, this is a very dangerous measure.  The wood-working industry&mdash;one or two of them at least&mdash; are showing signs of life at the moment; they are making a big bid for life in the country, and their position is at least not like that of many other industries&mdash;they are not declining.  In this <Col N="492" /> case, if they are to be depending for raw material on the whim of a Minister or the whim of a Government Department, upon all the delays and laxities that can take place in a human Department, then I do not see that they can ever have that confidence that industrialists require to have in order to carry on under the present competitive conditions. It will be a very serious matter if, when a furniture factory or a coach building firm are negotiating for the purchase of wood, and they send in their application for a licence, that application is unduly held up, held up a long time, so that they may say: &ldquo;Can we get timber at home, or must we import it, and what is the difference going to be in our position, what does it mean in the way of cost and so on?&rdquo; That will be a very serious position for any industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would have welcomed a Bill to deal with afforestation if it had given security on these points, and particularly if it had dealt with the important question of restricting the export of timber.  I think it is rather a strange thing that the Government should have, at the public expense, circulated a journal, the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal,&rdquo; which gives particulars from month to month of what other countries are doing to conserve their resources. Last month, for instance, the last number is entirely devoted to a survey of what other countries are doing to conserve their timber resources; what they are doing to encourage afforestation, and matters like that.  In that survey there is mention of two or three European countries which have prohibited the export of timber.  It is rather curious that the Government who have circulated that information now at the same time find fault with us for bringing up such a proposal&mdash;find fault with us for going to the extent of doing that, and going to the extent of introducing a Bill where that proposal could not even be considered, where it had to be ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle.  I would like, if the Minister chooses to reply, he would explain that, because there are not such differences in the circumstances of this country and other countries.  We have <Col N="493" /> very little developed resources apart from the land at the moment, and if there is any country in which it could be held that there was reason to restrict or to prohibit the export of timber it is this country.  If that were done I do not believe that any single owner of a plantation in Ireland would suffer one penny loss, and certainly I would prefer to see in the Bill a provision made for compensating such owners, so that the timber could be conserved.  I believe it would be a good bargain between the nation and that individual if the Bill included a provision which would compensate the owner and, at the same time conserve the timber, so that before it was exported, if it were necessary to export it at all, it might include the labour ratio which all countries are endeavouring to ensure will be in their export products at the present time.  It is with a good deal of reluctance that we have decided that we cannot vote for this Bill, but in face of the numerous defects which it contains, and in face of the serious risk it means to many industries, we can see no alternative to that course.</P>

      <P>We were led to believe during the last two years that afforestation was a most important thing as far as this country was concerned. It was dealt with under, as far as I can recollect, three different heads. That was from the point of view of the supply of timber for our own needs; secondly, for the purpose of having an effect on the climate, and thirdly, from the point of view of beautifying the landscape.  The beginning of this Bill says: &ldquo;It is an Act to make further and better provision for promoting afforestation.&rdquo;  I think that this Bill, if it is meant to promote afforestation in this country, is only a joke.  Because I do not see how it is going to have any effect at all on afforestation.  There was one statement made here by Deputy O'Reilly.  Like our friend, the Deputy gone out there, I am not Deputy O'Reilly's keeper.  Deputy O'Reilly said that good land was required to grow trees.  I do not agree with that at all.</P>

      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to cut down or uproot any tree unless, not less than twenty-one days before the commencement of the cutting down or uprooting of such tree, the owner thereof or his predecessor entitled, or some person on behalf of such owner or predecessor shall have given to the sergeant in charge of the Gárda Síochána station nearest to such tree a notice in writing (in this Act referred to as a felling notice) of intention to cut down or uproot such tree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is where the nonsense comes in. Just imagine to yourself, if you know anything about timber at all, a timber cruiser going round a wood.  He marks down trees to be felled.  He goes around and finds out the different classes of wood.  Let us say, for instance, that he wants beech, ash, Douglas fir, larch, pine&mdash;whatever you like. He has to take the cubical content of each tree if it is sound.  First of all, he has to ascertain whether the tree is a sound one.  Many trees look sound but they do not prove to be when you examine them.  He has to find out <Col N="495" /> whether there is enough wood in the tree to suit his purpose.  Then he goes to the next tree and finds out how much is in that.  Perhaps he is told off to mark down forty or fifty trees.  When they are working at timber it is generally cut down in the winter time and a wood is not a very healthy or happy place to work in in the winter time, because the ground is generally soft and boggy.  He has his work cut out to find out what he actually wants.  Then he has to come along under this funny Bill and send in a statement in writing about each tree to the Civic Guard. Then the sergeant of the Gárda Síochána goes around and he cruises through the wood and looks after the timber.  Probably he does not know what the timber is, because he might not know larch from beech.  He has to see if all this thing is according to the law.  I suppose it means that a batch of forms has to be signed about every tree in the wood.  There is where the nonsense comes in.  Now we come along:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every felling notice shall be in the prescribed form and shall state the name and address of the owner by or on whose behalf such notice is given, a place in Saorstát Eireann at which documents may be served under this Act and such other particulars as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>I will let that pass without comment.</P>
    <P>Where a felling notice contains a statement that a tree is being cut down or uprooted for a specified purpose, it shall not be lawful for any person to use or deal with such tree or any substantial part thereof or cause or permit the same to be used or dealt with when cut down or uprooted in pursuance of such felling notice for any purpose other than the purpose so stated in such felling notice.</P>
    <P>We go a step further then, and we come to the Gárda Síochána sergeant.  We suppose that he has ploughed through the mythical wood and has seen every tree is correct and according to the formal notice.  The forms are sent along, we presume, to the saw miller and if he <Col N="496" /> attempts to use any tree not according to the prescribed form he is liable to be prosecuted under the Act.  Supposing that I were to cut down fifty trees out of a wood and I brought along the sergeant, and supposing the sergeant has enough knowledge of forestry to know if the trees I cut down are the trees entered on the prescribed form, then we go a step further and we come to the saw miller.  How does the saw miller know that these were the trees cut according to the prescribed forms?  If he does not know, he is liable to be prosecuted under the law.  And we are told this is an Act to promote afforestation.</P>
    <P>Whenever a felling notice has been given in respect of any tree the Minister may, unless such tree is an exempted tree within the meaning of this section...</P>
    <P>We will suppose this is all right and proper.  Is it the Minister or the Gárda Síochána sergeant who is to determine each provision in this Act?  Perhaps the Minister would give us some explanation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will read no more.  That is all nonsense. I ask you, how are we going to promote afforestation under a Bill like that?  We see the nonsense of it here. <Col N="497" /> We have in this country hillsides that could grow coniferous timber, and it is a very valuable timber nowadays when they are even making silk stockings out of it.  We have all these hills going to waste.  We have unemployed, and we have a climate absolutely reeking with dampness.  We are told, according to the scientists, that the effect of increased afforestation is to take some of the dampness out of the air&mdash;at least to put it in circulation and take it out of the ground.  We have all the hillsides lying derelict.  We have the stumps of what were formerly good honest pine trees still lying in the ground.</P>

How is it possible for a Gárda Síochána sergeant to go along and cruise around every tree in a wood that is going to be cut down for the purpose of making articles of furniture, for example?  He could not possibly do it, because I daresay 90 per cent. of the Gárda Síochána could not tell you the difference between larch and pine.  Here it devolves on the sergeant of the Gárda Síochána to go out with a timber cruiser and find out every tree that is to be cut down and see if it is entered on the forms. Why, you will have the Civic Guards running around the country like wet hens, not knowing whether they are going or coming back.  In my opinion there should have been a forest ranger appointed.  Trees could be planted on the hillsides, and the forest ranger could look after them, because he would know his job.  Let him give around felling notices.  This thing, otherwise, is all nonsense, and nobody <Col N="498" /> could do otherwise than oppose the Bill on these grounds.</P>

      <P>I wish to offer my protest against one part of the Bill that I know will be broken.  This Bill invites people to become law breakers, and I have a very strong objection to any Act being passed that is certain to be broken.  In my part of the country ash trees grow from seedlings without being planted.  In tillage land a man would commit a thousand breaches of the law by ploughing down seedlings in the spring time.  If these young ash trees were allowed to grow on the hedges the land would become useless for tillage purposes.  Deputy Gorey may laugh, but if he was compelled to allow seedlings to grow on his land in Kilkenny, he would find that it would be necessary to burrow like a rabbit to get rid of them or to leave open spaces. He would not, at any rate, succeed in getting an open course for his dogs. If we let the young trees grow on the hedges in County Longford, there would be no tillage or grazing land. As a matter of fact, people could not keep cattle, as they would destroy the young trees that we are supposed to protect.  I think the Bill is a ridiculous one from that point of view, as well as from the point of view of not acquiring small portions of land for planting. These are the reasons that make me oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>In marking my objection to the Bill, I do so because I feel it is entirely aimed at the setting up of a form of control over property that I hold belongs to the individual. The result of it will be that it will have an opposite effect to that of developing afforestation.  There can be no doubt about it, that, up to the present, there has been only one form of incentive for the planting of timber, mainly to beautify a district.  Perhaps another incentive would be its commercial value.  That work has been undertaken by individuals.  What has been done by the State, so far as results go, is practically nil.  The tendency in this Bill is to take property out of the hands <Col N="499" /> of the owners.  Timber is property just as much as any other thing.  The moment you interfere with property you tighten up every source from which enterprise would have a chance of developing.  This Bill deliberately aims at taking control from the owners of timber&mdash;a control which they had a reasonable belief they were empowered to exercise&mdash;and hands it over to an authority set up by the Dáil, with power to say what shall be done.  That is very arbitrary.  It is incredible that this system should be extended.  If logically extended, in a short time farmers may be told by an Act passed in this House that they can only do such and such with whatever stock they have on their farms, or that they shall do such and such with their crops or other chattels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is thought that farming, or the development of any industry in this country, can best be served by abolishing private ownership, without establishing some form of State compensation, or taking over and running industries under State direction, individual enterprise and development will come to a standstill.  I have a fair amount of experience of timber growing, and I have a fair amount of experience of the conversion of timber into a commercial asset, and I find, undoubtedly, that in recent years the clearance of timber has been greatest.  At the same time during a period of great depression timber has been very useful for firewood, but if the Dáil thinks that this is a suitable time for interfering, especially when employment is so scarce, the result will be that there will be a tightening up of industrial development and a number of saw-mills must close down.  Does the State consider that this is a suitable time to cause more unemployment?  If there was any real sincerity about this Bill, granting that there is necessity for conserving our timber supplies, I think the State should first set a good example. I know properties that were taken over by the State during the last few years on which a considerable amount of timber was growing.  That timber was sold, not in the ordinary way, but at a much cheaper rate.  As a matter <Col N="500" /> of fact, I heard of a property that was taken over by the Land Commission where the timber was sold for a few pounds an acre.  In other cases I know that timber has been ruthlessly cut down.  The owner got the timber on the farm, and is simply using it for commercial purposes.  What the value of that land will be subsequently is problematical. I am sure it will not be able to bear the annuity fixed on it.</P>
    <P>I am sure, from my experience, that the land will not be able to bear the annuity that is put on it, and I am also satisfied that, as some of the people who have been given this property do not belong to this country at all, as soon as they have taken the timber off it they will clear away back to their own country, leaving the land valueless to the person who gets it, and there will consequently be a loss to the State.</P>
    <P>In the Sligo end of my constituency there is Lough Gill, which is a very pretty place and regarded as a beauty resort, and there is some fine timber around there.  I am told that land there came into the hands of the Land Commission recently and they are scarifying the beauty of the place by cutting the timber away.  Very severe protests have been made by the local people against that.  If the Government were really sincere in their desire to maintain these beauty spots and conserve the timber they would, first of all, see that they made the best use of those plantations that came into their hands, but instead of that they are the great scarifiers themselves.  In this Bill they make no attempt at all to provide any form of compensation to the owners for the rights that they are taking over from them.  There has been a good deal of talk in this House, and generally all over the country, about Russia and about the Bolshies in Russia and in this country, but this is really a very Bolshevist Bill and a very big advance in the direction of what has been condemned as very unfavourable. I can easily see that the Bill will undoubtedly inflict very great hardships on people who purchased forests during the last few years with the definite objective in view of cutting the timber and making use of it.  If these <Col N="501" /> people are handicapped by the Bill, as presumably they will be, quite a recent investment will be tied up.  Perhaps these people had weighed the whole situation and had intended to turn over their money in the course of the next few years, but now that money is lost.  It comes to this, that it will practically mean the end of any possibility of encouraging investment, with the immediate result that the Bill will inevitably lead to an increase in unemployment. It will also add in an extended and in a more dangerous way to the impossibility of any immediate improvement, or any improvement at any time, with regard to the investment of money with a view to the development of further industrial projects.</P>
    <P>There is nothing decent in the Bill; there is nothing honest in it.  If there was any show of sincerity on the part of the people who introduced it, they would first show a good example with the property that they have in their own hands, with which they can do what they like.  They are handing it over to Englishmen engaged in saw-milling as tenants and allowing the trees to be cut down and used for commercial purposes by these people, who will only use the land as long as there is any money to be made out of the timber.  As long as I see that attitude and know that they have done practically nothing by way of tackling this problem of afforestation in a big way, as it requires to be tackled, I am certainly opposed to the Bill.  The House should be very careful about giving a mandate of this sort to a Government to allow them to gather up all the control they are aiming at, which is really to direct the farmer as to what he should do with his own goods. Before giving that control into the hands of any man in this House, or in this country, the House should carefully consider it and see what it amounts to.  As I say, I do not see any use in the Bill.  I see many things that are very dangerous in it, and I do not believe that the people who introduced it have any honest intention.  Their tendency is very largely to get control <Col N="502" /> of all the business, power and influence in the country, and their aim is directly at a dictatorship.  A tendency towards a dictatorship is a bad thing. It has not had good results in any country that has had experience of it. Mexico is a sufficient example of a dictatorship. In other countries similarly we condemned it, but still every move that we have been making in this big scheme of centralising, of taking the rights, liberties and powers from individuals and vesting them in any one person, is tending in a direction which will inevitably react and leave this country in a very dangerous position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House takes a division on this Bill, I should like to make some general observations with regard to the new taxation that it is proposed to impose.  The Minister, in the Bill of which he now seeks to have a final reading, imposes a burden of nearly £1,000,000 in fresh taxation, although for the past few years, not alone the Minister himself, but all the members of his Party, have made great capital in the country out of the extraordinary reduction that has been made in taxation under their administration. At the present time, while they institute comparisons between the rate of taxation in the Free State and in Great Britain, they are very careful to keep secret an important part of the comparison which would make the country hesitate as to the reality of such a comparison.  In the first place, in Great Britain, where the sum of eight hundred million pounds is raised from the people annually, there is approximately three hundred and fifty millions of that money going into the service of the public debt.  That is about 44 per cent. of the total expenditure, whereas in the Free State only a comparatively small amount is going towards the service of the public debt &mdash;I think about one million six hundred thousand pounds, which would not be quite 7 per cent. of the total expenditure.  So that really, as far as the Free State and Great Britain are concerned, we have first, before we can <Col N="508" /> institute a comparison in regard to the amount of the taxation per head of the population, to make allowance for the fact that in Great Britain nearly half of the total amount of the expenditure goes towards debt services.</P>
      <P>There is also the important fact that in Great Britain there are numerous social services in regard to unemployment benefit, national health insurance benefit, medical services, education and other matters which we have not in this country.  In England it is estimated that nearly 20 per cent. of the national income goes in taxation, and that is considered to be an abnormally high percentage of the income of the people.  But, at any rate, it is a percentage which responsible thinkers in England consider has a good foundation behind it.  In this country we are entirely in the dark as far as Government statistics can give us any knowledge as to the amount of the revenue of the State which is being absorbed annually for the maintenance of the Central administration.  Taking as a basis for calculation subsistence allowance of £32 per head of the population in the Free State, we get a total subsistence allowance of £101,000,000 for the entire population of 3,000,000.  In order to get the national income from which to substract that subsistence allowance, and therefore see what available margin is left for taxation, we would, on the basis which was suggested to the Financial Relations Commission of 1897 by Sir Robert Giffen, have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just been wondering where I was at the adjournment of this debate, but I think I had succeeded in convincing every section of this House that of the ten local appointments I had got prior to the Act of 1926 not one had been given on the grounds of merit.  It is right also that I should tell you, A Chinn Comhairle, for your personal edification, and it might be useful as a precedent, as to how I got one of the appointments. At a certain time when a local body was being charged by the predecessor in title of the present Minister for Local Government with a breach of a statutory duty it became imperative that the body should appoint a solicitor, the previous solicitor having gone to a better world.  Accordingly, an election was called for.  The local solicitor, a man of capacity and standing in his profession, adopted the usual customary role of canvassing for the position.  When it came to the day of the election I was proposed and seconded, not having asked a single member of the council to vote for me, either directly or indirectly.  I was proposed and some other member of the council got up and proposed that the local solicitor be appointed, but the <Col N="510" /> chairman promptly ruled his amendment out of order.  He said the matter was too serious and I was declared unanimously elected.  I give that as a precedent which may come in useful some time in the future.</P>
      <P>We have heard during this debate, and I think we had them three times last week from Deputy de Valera, lectures on moral responsibility.  I personally would say nothing of any nature offensive to Deputy de Valera &mdash;he never said anything offensive to anybody&mdash;but I say of the many strange roles he has occupied during his time, and he has occupied many, none is more strange and more unfitted to him, in my respectful submission to the House, than the role of professor of moral obligations.  Not to be outdone, he was followed by Deputy Ward who spoke as to what had to be taken into consideration when he applied for that position in Monaghan which it is hoped by some people would become vacant in a short period.  He says that when it becomes vacant and he becomes an applicant for it that the electoral moral code must be taken into consideration. I do know what I should say in reply, and that is that if Deputy Ward does apply for that appointment to the Local Appointments Commission and sends with his application a copy of the speech which he made in this House on Friday last, and if the Local Appointments Commission appoint him I would be in favour of repealing the Act in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said by Deputy Ward that the poor man must suffer under the Act as it stands.  The Act as it stands is the poor man's charter.  Let there be no mistake about it.  Deputy Ward tries to side-track the issue by telling us that the poor man's son has no chance unless he gets a post-graduate course.  What is there in a post-graduate course?  Let him be consistent. He tells you that, over and above these things, you must look to a man's moral code.  What is there in a post-graduate course that will strengthen a man's moral code?  So far as I understand a post-graduate course, a man's moral code would be just as narrow and bigoted after that course <Col N="511" /> as it was before it.  I repeat that that Act, about which I had hoped I would have heard something from members on the Labour Benches, is the poor man's charter and must be looked on as such.  I dislike its title.  The title is wrong.  It should be called &ldquo;An Act to perpetuate, foster, and encourage corruption.&rdquo;  It can have no other effect.  It is intended to have no other effect, and any man who wants the local authorities of our country to do their duty free from corruption, free from jobbery, must, as the only alternative open to him, vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words in regard to this Bill. I want to say at the outset that I look on this Bill, not as an amending Bill, but as one to repeal the Act, because if it were carried and if it were made mandatory on the Public Appointments Commissioners to send down at least three names to the local authority, you might as well scrap the original Act immediately.  I want to say that we supported and voted for the original Act because we were then, and are still, convinced that under that Act the poor man's son for the first time, if he had the ability, got a fair chance.  If the best man is to be appointed, no case can be made for sending down three names.  We know quite well, and no Deputy can blind himself to the fact, that if the names of three candidates are sent down, the three of them may be qualified, but while the man placed first may have got twenty or thirty marks more than the man placed third on the list, if the man placed third on the list is able to exert more influence with a particular public body than the man placed first, undoubtedly the man whose name is third on the list will get the position.  That is a fact.  I say that as one who has had a few years' experience of public bodies.  I say that of my own knowledge.  For the last eight or nine years there has been an improvement in public bodies.  There has been a better outlook, and there has been very little corruption or bribery compared to what there was previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> We do not claim that a poor man's son should get any preference, and when Deputy Ward states that the Act works against the poor man, that because a man can get a post-graduate course and become better qualified than a poor man's son, there is an injustice to a poor man's son, we say that we do not claim that a poor man's son should get the appointment unless he is at least as well qualified as any other applicant.  We want nothing for the poor man's son except bare justice, and it is because we want that and to see that he will get a fair show we are in favour of the Act.  I want to give the Dáil an illustration of what happened very recently.  A certain public body in my own constituency were continuously criticising and protesting against the Act, and their protest was mainly on the ground that it was an insult to the members of public bodies, that if the Act was never there they would appoint the best man.  Let us see what happened last year.  This was in my own constituency.  This particular local authority had occasion to appoint a man to take charge of the engines and machinery in an institution, and they decided to advertise for a man for that position.  They decided at their meeting to ask the firm that had supplied the machinery to send down one of their best men to hold an examination into the qualifications of the applicants.  That was done.</P>
    <P>There were nine or ten applicants. The examination was held, and the examiner sent in his report to the County Board of Health and allotted his marks as a result of the examination.  In his report he stated that he could not understand how a man with the ability of the person put first on the list was applying for such a small job.  He said that if he were to apply for the position of foreman in their own works he would have no hesitation in recommending him.  Notwithstanding that, the Board by a majority appointed the man fifth on the list.  If there was nothing else except that one case, it would force me to vote against this Bill.  If the promoters of it want to see men appointed on merit, only because of their qualifications, and not because of any opinions they may have, <Col N="513" /> then, I think, they are very ill-advised in putting forward the Bill.  For the reasons I have given, and for no other reasons, I will be compelled to vote against the Bill.  There is just another point I want to mention.  I agree that there has been a good deal of criticism of the main Act and the working of it. Whether that is well founded or not I do not know.  Personally I believe that a lot of it is not, but some of it may be well founded.  For that reason we have put down an amendment, but I suggest that you are not going to improve the position by making the Civil Service Commissioners rather than the Public Appointments Commissioners responsible for the duty put upon them. It is said that the Public Appointments Commissioners are unpopular, and that people have not confidence in them. What is the reason?  The reason, I suggest, is simply because the Public Appointments Commissioners have been making appointments, and I suggest, if this Bill were carried and if the Civil Service Commissioners were made responsible for administering the Act, that, within one month of that responsibility being put upon them, the Civil Service Commissioners would be just as unpopular, and would receive as much criticism as the Public Appointments Commissioners.  That, I think, is a fact, and, that being so, I cannot see my way to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey has had the advantage of being able to give us details of an appointment that was made in Tipperary.  I take it that if we could be in the happy position of finding some of the details of the appointments made by this body there might be a lot to be said for the body.  The first point is that, after all the talk that has been going on about corruption in connection with public bodies, when boiled down all we have got from the Minister is one particular case in which the people who were found guilty were prosecuted.  There is just the same amount of talk, perhaps more, about this particular body which is now in charge of public appointments.  The Minister has been challenging us to produce some specific case of corruption.  He challenged us <Col N="514" /> with an air of assurance that there were no leakages.  That in itself was suspicious.  I do not believe it would be possible in the case of a body which works along the lines of this Public Appointments Commission for anybody to produce what the Minister asked for &mdash;a specific case with all the details attached, whereas in the case of public bodies it is entirely different.  We have had one case quoted by Deputy Morrissey in which he really knew the order of merit of the different applicants for the position.  I suggest that he knew that because the local body was cognisant of the facts.  The same thing happened in County Roscommon where there was a case of corruption. The people got to know about it and men of public spirit took action, with the result that those who were in fault were punished.  The present arrangement is that what I would call a star chamber body, and that is what it is, has charge of these appointments.  It is certainly a most objectionable method.  How are we going to find out what has happened there?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, for instance, said that he was inclined to support Deputy O'Connell's amendment in a good many points, but that the matter of sending for papers was one of the points which he could not support.  I suggest that there are good reasons why he could not do that. They are confidential, he said, and he mentioned some of the particulars in which they are confidential, but he left out some others.  Perhaps I could throw some light on that.  Perhaps the political opinions of some of the applicants would have something to do with it.  That, I suggest, is a more important reason why these documents could not be produced.  It comes in the long run to a matter of confidence. Everybody admits that.  Does anybody suggest that there is confidence in the administration of the present Act? This Party represents at least one-third of the people of this country and we are not satisfied with it.  We know that people have been turned down for political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Civil Service itself, I would invite the Government to have a show down of their appointments <Col N="515" /> since 1922.  Let us know all the people who got temporary appointments since 1922.  Then we will have some information. Let us examine who these people are and what their claims are. It is well known that a lot of those who were put in for political reasons were afterwards allowed to sit for a very inferior type of examination, and they qualified.  After having filled up all the gaps in the Civil Service, the Government proceeded to get control of local appointments altogether.  The President tells us, and it seems also to be the opinion of those who spoke against the Bill, that if the third, fourth, or the fifth man is selected he is the third, fourth, or fifth man according to merit.  We are not suggesting that the names of the men should not be sent down in order of merit, but that the House should see that the people applying for positions should be qualified, and if there is a body which is prepared to allow the Civil Service Commissioners to make an appointment, if they find that in any particular district things would not be done as they would like them, they can ask the Civil Service Commissioners to send down the name of only one man.  As I said before it all amounts to confidence, and I would like to see what guarantee or proofs we have of confidence.  I say we have far less guarantees that this body which is acting now will be as immune from corruption, if you like, because it is not confined to people in the country.  Corruption can come as far as Dublin just as it can come to the country.  A specific case cannot be produced for the reason that it is done in a star chamber way.  That in itself has been a very serious objection, whereas if the Council gets the option of having several names sent down it can judge for itself.  At least there is a choice.  The Bill provides that not less than three names will be sent down if a panel is asked for.  There may be canvassing and all that, as there was under the old system.  I am not at all advocating a return to the old system for the reason I stated, that there may be cases where it is essential to have the appointments made at headquarters, but in any case where corruption <Col N="516" /> occurred the knowledge that it had occurred spread all round the country and people were prosecuted. If anything like that occurs in the future the same thing could happen, and these people will be removed at the elections from the bodies on which they sit.  Public opinion will see that they are punished.  What happens to the present body that makes its appointments in this way is quite another matter.  There may be all sorts of influences, and I fear there are all sorts of influences worked there, political and other influences.  That is the opinion of a very large section in this country.  We have no choice; we have to put up with it.</P>
    <P>Some people say there are three secret societies pulling the wires.  I know one myself.  I was a member before it became a job-seeking society. That is the I.R.B.  I know it has a big influence.  I know that people have been impeached in this House for filling the service or one department of the service, with nominees of this society.  I am not satisfied that that is not taking place now.  One member praised the Appointments Commissioners. I do not wish to condemn any public official, but I certainly say they should stop it.  If they praise them we claim the right to attack them, to attack people in the Government service. I am prepared to attack them, not under cover, but in the open.  They are people who would stoop to anything to get their own back on political opponents, and I think that there is a good case for passing this Bill. Deputy O'Connell has been told already by the Minister principally responsible &mdash;the Minister for Finance&mdash;that what he wants in his amendment cannot be granted.  That is the papers in connection with these appointments.  I suggest there are other reasons besides those given by the Minister, reasons which should not weigh with any decent people.  That is the reason this amendment cannot be accepted.  That inquiry would satisfy our Party, if we could be sure that we would get all the papers in connection with the appointments. I am perfectly certain that we want all public appointments to be made honestly, fairly and squarely <Col N="517" /> and that every citizen of the country should have the right to claim these positions on merit.  That will not happen. If this inquiry is granted it will be a white-washing thing.  You will not get access to the papers you require, and it will be valueless.  I say here and now that that body is worked on political lines.  There has been discrimination against people of a certain type.  That is a statement over which I can stand.</P>

That is the reason why I think the Labour Party ought to think twice before they vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>As one having some connection with local authorities for some time past, and having something to do with the uprooting of the evil of corruption in Roscommon when it made its appearance there, I wish to say a few words on this.  I think the promoters of the Bill have failed to grasp the underlying principle of the original Act.  The original Act tried to get the best men appointed, to give the poor man's son an equal chance with the rich man's son, and to prevent corruption. These were the three things aimed at and, to my mind, the Act has <Col N="518" /> justified itself.  I am rather surprised to hear the allegations made by Deputy Boland with regard to people being turned down by the Appointments Commissioners for political reasons. This is the first time I have ever heard that allegation.  I certainly did hear allegations against the Appointments Commissioners from various quarters, but I always found them being made by people who do not understand the procedure. I do not think that people who speak as Deputy Boland spoke understand the procedure.  If they did these statements would not have been made.</P>

      <P>I think I have more experience of the working of these things than Deputy Boland has.  I have seen appointments made, and I want to take this opportunity of saying that, although Roscommon came forward to uproot that evil of corruption, the evil was never in Roscommon until that time.  Immediately it made its appearance we uprooted it.  To a large extent the exposing of the evil in Roscommon is responsible for this Bill, and I am glad of it.  If Deputy Boland and other Deputies are right that there can be discrimination against candidates, we have been entirely misled with regard to the method of selection.  My understanding of it is&mdash;and I hope if I am wrong the Minister for Local Government will correct me&mdash;that a Selection Board is set up by the Appointments Commissioners.  These boards are drawn from various people over the country&mdash;from the medical profession if it is a medical appointment, and so on.  The members of the Selection Board do not know the applicants when they come to sit in judgment and the applicants do not know the Selection Board.  How there could be bribery and corruption in that case I do not know.  That is what we are led to believe.  The Selection Board, at least so we are told, send on the best names to the Commission.</P>

      <P>If a local authority is to get down a panel of three names it takes away the three points for which the original Act was passed&mdash;that is, the appointment of the best man, giving the poor man's son an equal chance with the rich man's son, and preventing corruption. Deputy Boland has said that they want three names sent down, not in order of merit, but that they should be qualified for the position.  I suppose 75 per cent. of the local appointments in the country are appointments of doctors.  I have never known any applicant for a medical appointment who was not qualified.  In the case in Roscommon, where bribery and corruption were proved, there were only three applicants for the position.  So that I do not see any merit whatever in sending down a panel of three names.  There is absolutely none, as far as I can see. The Appointments Commissioners hold office, as far as I can understand, at the will of the Executive Council.  If the present Bill is passed, the Civil Service Commission will be in the position of <Col N="521" /> making the appointments.  I wonder which would be the better of the two from Deputy Boland's point of view? I do not see how the Bill is going to get over the discrimination which they allege against the Appointments Commission. I do not see how the Civil Service Commission will get over it.</P>
      <P>Certainly I do not agree, and I have said so in this House, with the interpretation of a certain section of the Act as it exists, but I agreed with the Act when passed.  I think it was a good measure, and I think that if the public got the best man, which I believe they do, they have nothing to cavil at. Because I differ from the opinion of the Minister for Local Government in the interpretation of a certain section of the Act I desire to support Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  I think that some examination should be made, particularly with regard to Section 5, and I think that the local authorities all over the country are entitled to have their views heard on the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ward in speaking on the Bill now before the House said that there appears to be a good deal of confusion in the minds of some Deputies as to what the real purpose of the Bill is.  Might one ask the House what is the real purpose of the Bill proposed from the point of view of Deputies opposite?  Is it to see that the best men are qualified and that the best qualified men obtained the posts?  Is it to see that the best appointments are made?  I suggest that is not the object. Anybody who listened to the analysis of the Bill by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health can only come to one conclusion, and that conclusion is that this Bill was never intended to pass.  The Minister for Local Government, by his analysis of the Bill, has shown the measure to be illogical, impossible, and utterly unthinkable. We suggest that the object for which this Bill has been introduced is purely political propaganda and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are about in a few days to elect the new Councils in the country, and this Bill has been held out with one object and one object only, and that is the restoration of patronage to those people who in the past proved that they were not fit to use the patronage that <Col N="522" /> was placed in their keeping.  I listened to a Deputy who does not belong to our Party frankly telling this House how the public appointments were filled in the past.  Anybody who heard Deputy Wolfe explain how the appointments by the local boards were made must come to the conclusion that the Act which we on this side of the House are now defending was entirely justified, and has achieved its object.</P>

      <P>I am referring to Deputy Jasper Wolfe.  In speaking on this Bill Deputy Jasper Wolfe made the very statement that Deputy Anthony attributes to him.  He paid one of the greatest tributes to this country of freedom from religious intolerance. It might be just as well to quote Deputy Jasper Wolfe's own words.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I, like other members, voted for the man I knew best, for the candidate whose friends I knew best, but I never voted for a relative.  I did like everybody else.  It was the common custom.  We all held it our duty to vote for the candidate we knew best or whose friends we knew best, but while that was so, we all looked forward to the day when we would be relieved of that responsibility. Those who were interested in the national cause at the time looked forward to the day when we would have a Parliament and a Civil Service of our own, free and unbiased, and when we could impose that duty on a body such as we have in existence to-day in the case of the Appointments Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> Putting these two statements of Deputy Wolfe side by side, what conclusion can any man come to here who is not influenced by his own political opinion, but looks upon the appointment and the creation of appointments made from the real standpoint of merit and merit alone&mdash;what conclusion can any Deputy come to but that in the past the old County Councils failed most miserably in this particular respect in the discharge of their public duties?  Are we now to restore to them that old system of jobbery and patronage? Perhaps, at the present time, while the elections are being fought, some party capital may be made out of this Bill in the country by members of the Fianna Fáil Party opposite, but as far as doing anything practical, as far as improving the status of the men we appoint, as far as filling these appointments on the merits which Deputy Boland claims, this Bill has nothing whatever in it to recommend it to this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ward spoke about the appointment of fully qualified men.  I think Deputy Brennan answered that very admirably.  He told the House that most of the cases under consideration were appointments of medical men, and he knew of no man in the medical profession whose name was sent down to fill these appointments who was not qualified.  I venture to point out to Deputy Ward, who as a doctor and graduate of the National University knows as well as I do, there are various grades and various standings in the obtaining of a degree in the University and all the learned professions as in practically every other walk of life. He knows as well as I do that there are such things as honour degrees, such things as gold medallists for courses either in the medical or legal profession. And what the Appointments Commission has done, as far as the filling of these appointments is concerned, is to appoint the best men who hold the highest credentials and who are best qualified to discharge their duties.  But, said Deputy Ward, doctors with the highest qualifications are often a failure.  Was there ever such a silly statement made in a House <Col N="524" /> of this kind as that statement by Deputy Ward?  That was a statement unsupported by one single solitary argument.  That was a statement that no graduate in a university could support. That was a statement as illogical as it is impossible.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has any idea of the training through which men in the learned professions pass knows very well that those men who reach the top of the ladder&mdash;that those men who make their mark, whether in science, art, law or medicine&mdash;are men, in nine cases out of ten, who have had a distinguished course generally in passing through their university careers.  We find that the Appointments Commissioners have chosen the most eminent of those men to fill these posts.  I would also suggest that in the filling of these posts, as Deputy Brennan very justly said, the poor man's son came in for his own and that the appointment was filled upon merit.  Deputy Ward held that the poor man's son had no possibility of being appointed under the present system.  This was another wild statement, made without a shred of argument to support it.  Anybody who thinks for a moment of how the son of the poor man obtains his qualifications in the learned professions knows that they are generally obtained through securing scholarships in the various universities, and that these poor men's sons are the cream of the country; that those poor men's sons when they go to the university are a credit to the university, and that they are, in nine cases out of ten, honours graduates and very frequently gold medallists.</P>
    <P>I can recall one instance in the city of Dublin where, in one family, five men went through the Christian Brothers' Schools in Westland Row and each obtained a scholarship in the National University and, in addition, each and every one of them obtained the very highest honours degrees.  Four of these five men are to-day filling lucrative appointments, and why? Because in passing through the university their record was as honourable as their record in passing through the schools.</P>
    <P>How can Deputy Ward justify a statement such as he made?  Deputy <Col N="525" /> Ward suggested that we on these benches have no right to raise our voices on behalf of the universities at all.  We have many men sitting on these benches who are graduates of the universities and who, perhaps, know as much about the question as Deputy Ward.  I think that was a most uncalled-for and unjustifiable claim on behalf of Deputy Ward.  We on these benches claim that we have just as much right to speak on behalf of the universities as have the Fianna Fáil Deputies on the benches opposite.  I would remind Deputies on the opposite benches of one very extraordinary fact which perhaps slipped the memory of Deputy Ward, and it was this: Deputy Ward said that we had no right to speak on behalf of the National University&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The words that I have used are true in substance and in fact.  They may not be the exact words.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am contesting a statement made by a member on the opposite benches.  I submit I am entitled to rebut that statement.  If that statement has been permitted to be made by a Deputy on the opposite side, a Deputy on this side is entitled if he can to rebut it.  I will dispose of it in half-a-dozen words.  I would merely remind this House that at the last election in September the National <Col N="528" /> University selected in the person of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and in the person of Professor Tierney two candidates to sit and vote with the Government Party in this House.  The electors of the National University knew perfectly well that the men they placed at the top of the poll had voted for the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.  I think that disposes absolutely of the statement made by Deputy Ward.</P>
      <P>Just one word in conclusion.  It has been stated in this House that under the present system of appointments there can be no chance whatever for those holding Republican or Fianna Fáil views.  That was a statement, like other wild statements made in this House, that was entirely unsupported by any evidence, and it was a statement without the slightest justification. I would recall that, so far as the appointments are concerned, Deputy Boland thought it was fair that these appointments should be filled on merit and on merit alone.  We, on these benches, have proved that merit and merit alone has been taken into consideration. I can call to mind one appointment where an immediate member of the family of a member on the Front Bench on the opposite side received a medical appointment quite recently. If the Commissioners were animated by political bias they would never, under any circumstances, have made such an appointment.  The fact that such an appointment has been made is clearly a rebuttal of the unsupported statement made by Deputy Ward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get down to the whole facts at issue.  The Appointments Commissioners have done very useful service to the State.  They have, in the words of Deputy Brennan, put an end to corruption. Allegations of corruption were made by members on the opposite side, but there has not been a single instance of corruption proved in this House.  If statements of corruption are made on a matter of public importance like this, there should be some evidence to support them.  There has not been one word of evidence to support the charge of corruption in these cases.  I think, as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health <Col N="529" /> has said, we have been now switched off from the point of view of corruption to get on to something else.  I have no doubt but that this Bill that is now before the House will be defeated. It deserves to be defeated.  It has no merits to recommend it.  As I said, it was never intended to pass.  It was introduced purely as political propaganda and to have an effect upon the Local Government elections that will be held in a few days.  We feel sure that the people in the country have far too much common-sense to be taken in by this Bill which is being dangled before their noses, and I hope that the result of the elections will prove that we are right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to bring the discussion back to the actual Bill that is before the House, I would like to remind Deputies that this is not a Bill to abolish the existing Act.  It is a Bill to amend it.  It is not proposed by Deputies on this side of the House to revert to the old system in its entirety. We believe that there are objections to the present system.  We believe that there are objections to the old system, but that the system proposed by this Bill is a better system than either of them.  I do not deny that political prejudice might not operate just as fiercely in a local body, and that a person holding particular political views might have as little chance of getting an appointment under a local body under the old system as he might have now under the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I believe that political influence does play a considerable part in the appointments that are made by the Local Appointments Commissioners, and I believe other influences might also operate when they are arriving at their decisions.  I agree that the same objections can be levelled, and justly levelled, against the old system of making public appointments.  I do not think that any perfect system can be devised, human nature being what it is and the system of local government being what it is.  But we want to get a system that will ensure the least possible amount of corruption and the best possible results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Hennessy, when speaking on this Bill, misquoted a speech I <Col N="530" /> made upon the estimate for the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  He represented me as having said that because patronage was being taken out of the hands of members of local bodies, therefore the best type of member would not in future be secured for these bodies.  I said nothing of the sort.  What I did say, and I will repeat it, is this, that when the attitude of the Government is that they say to every member of every public board, and to every candidate for a public board, &ldquo;You are potentially corrupt; you are not to be trusted in the making of public appointments.  Because you are a member of a public board, or a candidate for a public board, you are probably dishonest.&rdquo;  I say that while that is the attitude of the Government, the situation thus created is one which will not produce on public boards the best types of members.  If Deputy Dr. Hennessy has any doubt about that, I would ask him to consult the campaign managers of his own Party.  They have been very active recently getting ratepayers' candidates all over the country.  Look at their names in the paper.  Did you ever see such a collection of ward-heelers and job-hunters in your life? The campaigners of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party would be very anxious to get good candidates elected to public boards because these candidates, by their proper administration of local affairs, would bring credit to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  But they have not been able to do so, and I suggest one reason is because the system of local government is breaking down in consequence of the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Brennan said that the purpose of the Principal Act was threefold. Firstly, it was to secure the appointment of the best men; secondly, to give a chance to the poor man's son, and, thirdly, to abolish corruption.  Let us examine these three points and satisfy ourselves that the present Act does meet these points and that the amending Bill would not.  Take the question of the appointment of the best men.  Is it seriously contended that appointments have been made by the Local Appointments Commissioners <Col N="531" /> which are not bad?  I know men, and I do not want to produce their names in this House, who were appointed as dispensary doctors by the Local Appointments Commissioners and who have not been sober since the day they were appointed.</P>

The doctor was accompanied by this officer carrying a bottle under his arm.  The man who was ill had consumption and he died shortly afterwards.

      <P>I do not think Deputy Lemass has proved anything against the doctor by giving the statement of the man who was going around with him, who evidently made it as a joke.  I really do not think that that should be produced against the ability of the doctor&mdash;to say that a joke was <Col N="534" /> made by a man who was carrying the bottle around.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat the story, but the doctor examined this man, gave him a drop out of the bottle, left him there, and the man was dead a few weeks after.  I want to get back to the Local Appointments Commissioners. We were assured that the present system provides for the appointment of the best men.  I say it has not done so.  I say that it can undoubtedly make good appointments, and I have no doubt that good appointments have been made.  But I have no doubt that bad appointments have been made exactly as under the old system and exactly, probably, as they would be under the system contemplated by this Bill.  If that system was in operation good appointments would be made and bad appointments would be made.  It is incorrect to say that the general level in one case will be good and in the other case bad.  There will be good and bad in both cases.  We have to provide some system that will prevent people who are absolutely inefficient being appointed, and to ensure that appointments will be made in the best possible way.  We are told that the present system provides for the poor man's son.  We have had bucketfuls of drivel from many Deputies about the poor man's son.</P>

      <P>The third and important point stressed in the debate is that the present system has provided for the abolition of corruption.  Many definitions of corruption are possible.  Probably the least objectionable form of corruption is bribery.  I am not going to give a lecture on morals.  Corruption of any kind is objectionable, but I maintain that the system of corruption which undoubtedly prevailed under the old conditions was much less objectionable than the system of corruption which could prevail under the present conditions.  Whether or not there is corruption under the present system I cannot prove.  I believe as I said that influences other than the right influences are taken into consideration when appointments are made, but the Minister for Finance, at any rate, and, I think, the Minister for Local Government, were very anxious to make it known to everyone concerned that no proposal could be entertained which <Col N="536" /> would result in the casting of a single ray of light on the transactions of the Local Appointments Commissioners or of any of the appointments made by them.</P>

The arguments which have been advanced in favour of the present system all break down under examination. It does not always ensure the appointment of the best man; it does not ensure preferential treatment for the poor man's son that we hear so much about; it does not secure the abolition of corruption.  Now, what this Bill proposes to do is this: The Bill proposes to ensure that for every position only a qualified man can be appointed.  It does not leave any loophole by which unqualified persons can be appointed.</P>

We provide in the Bill that the local authorities can ask the Civil Service Commissioners, as we suggest, either for the name of one candidate only or for a panel of not less than three, and the only names that would be sent down by the Civil Service Commissioners to the local authorities would be the names of qualified persons.  Therefore, no matter which of them was appointed, it would be a qualified person, a person whom the Civil Service Commissioners considered to be well qualified for the post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hennessy is talking about doctors only.  I am talking about all appointments.  Under the old system there was a ratification of the appointment by the local authority after the appointment had been made, and that system did not work well. We suggest that the ratification should come before the appointment is made, and that system would work better. The Bill also provides that the appointment would be made in the light of day, that the appointment would not be made behind closed doors in Dublin, but in the light of day, at a public meeting of a public body, and made by the body that has got to foot the bill.  When we consider, therefore, the present system, the old system, and the system suggested in this Bill, and examine them critically, we will see that this Bill does, in fact, provide for a system that is better than either of the other two.  It does ensure that qualified persons would be appointed; it does ensure that the appointment <Col N="539" /> will be made publicly, and that anything that may be suggestive of corruption in the appointment can be and will be examined by the rate-payers of the locality.  It does provide that the appointment will be made by the members of the local body, who are the representatives of the people who pay the bill.  Again I say that no system that you can devise will be absolutely knave proof, and that corruption will not be possible, that no system you can provide will ensure that the best man will always be appointed.  But I say that the system suggested by this Bill will ensure that good men will be appointed, and that they will be appointed in the best way, and, therefore, I hope that the Dáil will pass the Bill.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose the Bill and to support Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  In my view, the speakers in favour of the Bill, as well as many of those who spoke against the amendment, provided the best argument for an inquiry before this Bill should become an Act, especially the speech delivered by Deputy Lemass.  We have heard a good deal about the best man being evolved by an examination, whether under the old system or the new, but in that respect I would ask this question: Is there any human institution that we know of that can always secure, either by a competitive examination or by any other class of examination, that the best man does always win?  My experience, both of competitive examinations and of others, is that the best man does not always win.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is, as the Deputy must know, a very great and a very marked difference of opinion as to whether competitive examinations always produce the best man.  Deputy Lemass made what I presume he must have considered a very strong point when he suggested that the right type of man will not go up for county council elections because it is said, in effect, to them that they are <Col N="540" /> potentially corrupt, inasmuch as the right to make appointments is taken from them.  Does Deputy Lemass suggest equally that Deputies in this House are also corrupt because of the fact that they have not the right to make appointments, for instance, to the Civil Service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the right.

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of the appointment of a secretary to the Minister for Finance.  Would the Civil Service Commissioners send up three names for the Dáil to select one?  These things have been operating in my mind during the time I was listening to some of the speeches.  The question arises as to how we are to judge of the merits, <Col N="541" /> or demerits, of the old system as compared with the new.  Speaking for myself, I find myself in entire agreement with the principle underlying the setting up of the Local Appointments Commissioners, and I have already said that there is a case for an inquiry. That has been borne out by the speeches delivered for the Bill and against the amendment.  Deputy Boland said something about the spoils to the victors.  I have very vivid recollections of that particular slogan, as used in the city of Cork during the regime of Deputy Boland's own Party there&mdash;the spoils to the victors.  In each case they went to the victors.  That is my experience. That is why I say that in principle I agree with the Act, though I do suggest that there is a case for inquiry, and I commend that to the consideration of the House.  I am not altogether in agreement with many of the Deputies who spoke about corruption in public boards.  There may have been corruption here and there throughout the country, but perhaps a little less objectionable term to use would be nepotism.  Undoubtedly there was a good deal of that, and the Local Appointments Commission has certainly done some service in that particular regard.  It has done one other thing: it has relieved members of public boards of the annoyance of canvassing.  I am quite sure that members of public boards will agree with me that one of their greatest embarrassments was to be canvassed by a number of applicants for positions.  I have in my mind's eye at the moment the case of a very cultured lady who occupies a very high position in the National University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She had occasion to wait on me in connection with a very small appointment. It was really only a part-time appointment, and was at a time when the party for whom Deputy Lemass speaks had considerable power by virtue of its numbers on that Board.  I was going to vote for the best-qualified candidate, the one who had the best degrees coupled with a certain amount of experience.  Members of the party for whom Deputy Lemass speaks turned down that candidate in favour of a less qualified person.  Deputy Ward, I think, spoke of some medical appointments in his own district that <Col N="542" /> had been made.  I do not want to go into that.  I do not want to get all the saw-bones in Ireland up against me in connection with this matter, but I know that, so far as Cork city and county are concerned, they have succeeded in most cases at any rate in getting the best qualified men.  I do not want to enter into that further, but the fact is that under no system that human ingenuity can devise can you ensure that you will always get the best men.  The Minister for Local Government, speaking in this debate some days ago, took exception to the use of the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; by, I think, Deputy Ward, and asked the Deputy to specify cases of corruption.  I do not want to have a bit each way on the two great parties, but I would like to see the Cumann na nGaedheal Party a little more consistent in that regard, particularly the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister waxed quite indignant with Deputy Ward when the Deputy suggested that there was corruption, and asked the Deputy for specific cases of corruption in Government departments. The Minister resented the use of such a word.  Why is it that his conscience smites him when the word is used in this connection?  On other occasions he has heard the word used in connection with the dissolution of the old Cork Corporation, against whom not a whittle of corruption was proved, and we have not heard from the Minister for Local Government any objection to the use of the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; there!  I would like if the Minister would be a little more consistent in that regard at any rate.  I throw out this challenge to the Minister&mdash;I know he would hardly have the hardihood to say it on any public platform in the city of Cork&mdash;and not alone to the Minister, but also to some of the Cork Deputies who may be listening to me, to state whether there was corruption in the old Cork Corporation or not.  I would like to point out to some of these purists in public life, the people who came in to purify the politics of Cork, as, of course, they have attempted to purify politics in public life in other parts of Ireland, that some of them at any rate were instrumental in getting the old Cork Corporation dissolved.</P>

      <P>The question which I wish to discuss with the Minister for Justice concerns the treatment meted out to Mr. James Donnelly, a prisoner in Mountjoy jail.  Last February, Mr. Donnelly was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment on the charge of having escaped from Mountjoy prison in 1925. He is one of the prisoners in Mountjoy to whom, as was admitted by Ministers in a previous debate, the term a political prisoner could be justly applied. There is nothing whatever in the charge on which he was sentenced which would in any way lead anyone to understand that he could be a criminal, or was the type of individual who would enjoy consorting with criminals.</P>

      <P>Mr. Donnelly, on committal, objected to being forced to wear the uniform which is usually associated with criminals, and in consequence was left for a period of nine days during the coldest month of the year without clothes.  At the end of that period, he was permitted to wear his own clothes again.  I say that the treatment given to James Donnelly, a man who should be known to many of the colleagues of the Minister for Justice and a man who never did a criminal act in his life, was, under the circumstances, of such a kind <Col N="544" /> that no decent man should be proud of it.  I am aware that in discussing the conditions in Mountjoy prison we are at a disadvantage, because we have found that we cannot rely upon the information given concerning the conditions there, and which is supplied to us by the Minister.  I have no doubt but that the Minister imparts that information to this House in good faith as he receives it from the officials in charge, but it has been definitely proved and definitely established that statements made in this House concerning conditions in Mountjoy prison were untrue.</P>

      <P>On the 14th March last, the Minister for Justice, speaking on &ldquo;Review of Prisoners' Cases&mdash;Proposed Select Committee,&rdquo; said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Another statement was made by Deputy Ruttledge, and here his language became most extraordinarily strong.  He declared that cruelty was being practised upon Gilmore in Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>Mr. G. BOLAND: So there was.</P>
      <P>Mr. FITZGERALD - KENNEY: That statement is untrue.</P>
      <P>Mr. G. BOLAND: So there was.</P>
      <P>Mr. FITZGERALD - KENNEY: That statement has no foundation.</P>
      <P>Mr. G. BOLAND: Will the Minister allow an independent investigation?</P>
      <P>Mr. FITZGERALD - KENNEY: That statement, I say, is without any foundation.  Never was there a single act of cruelty on that man at any time since he has been in Mountjoy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Gilmore has since been released, and I have had the opportunity of talking to him, and he has told me stories of the treatment administered to him that would make a person's blood run cold when listening to them.  He told me that on an occasion when his mother made application to visit him an official of the Minister's Department, one Mr. Sheehan, went to Gilmore in Mountjoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing the reliability of the reports concerning Mountjoy Prison given in this House. I did say the Minister probably was giving these reports in the Dáil on the strength of statements given to him by Mr. Sheehan, who, I understand, has replaced the Prisons Board.  Mr. Sheehan informed Gilmore he would allow him to see his mother on the condition that he would not tell her of the treatment he had received.  That is one of the statements made by Gilmore, and if the Minister thinks these statements are untrue or inaccurate he can investigate the facts. The Minister said last week that allegations as to the ill-treatment of certain women prisoners were untrue. One of these prisoners has been taken out of prison and put into hospital, and if the Minister thinks the charge of ill-treatment is untrue he can go to Mercer's Hospital and see the marks of bruises on her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to a particular case in England where on a statement made, I think, by a couple of individuals, an inquiry was held into the conduct of certain police officials, an inquiry which was given every publicity and has aroused considerable interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should confine himself to the question of Donnelly's treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to that case in order to show that things have happened here, and particularly to the individual in question, Donnelly, of a much more serious nature than the things concerned in that English inquiry. There is no suggestion here that the matter should be investigated with a view to altering it.  We merely have a sort of bland denial of all charges by the Minister.  I have no doubt the Minister is acting in good faith, but I would ask him as a man has he satisfied himself that the information supplied to him by his officials is correct.  The system which exists in this country of treating political prisoners as criminals is one which we have inherited from the British.  I think that is nothing for a supposedly Irish Government to be proud of.  With the exception of England this is the only country in the world in which such a system exists.  A man like Donnelly, convicted admittedly on a charge that was political&mdash; and it was admitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was speaking here on the prisoners debate that Donnelly was a political prisoner&mdash;should not be asked to declare himself a criminal and should not be subject to the same treatment in <Col N="547" /> prison as a common criminal.  He should, I think, be given preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government may be such that persons who do certain things or hold certain views should be detained, and cut off from association with their fellows.  Well and good.  Is it also the policy of the Government that there should be not merely imprisonment, but that there should also be an attempt at degradation, merely because people who are not criminals hold certain political views and take action which they think these views force on them?  I would like if the Minister would state if there is any intention on the part of the Government to consider an alteration of the present regulations so as to provide for special treatment for political prisoners.  We do not, of course, agree with the laws under which these prisoners are sentenced. We do not think the crimes, as they are called, with which they are charged are in fact anything of which anybody need be ashamed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, I think, a different mentality to his colleagues, and he will be able to see the justice of the case which can be made out for specialised treatment of political prisoners.  I think I am correct in saying he has it in his power without any legislation to provide by order for that special treatment.  If so, is he prepared to prevent a repetition of the scenes that have occurred in Mountjoy&mdash;these beatings and ill-treatment&mdash;and remove the objection to giving these prisoners a criminal status? If he is prepared to issue such an order or make such a regulation he would be <Col N="548" /> doing something which would result in considerable improvement on the present system.  The case of James Donnelly brings this matter up particularly. He has been subject to considerable ill-treatment, being left naked for nine days because he refused to accept that criminal status, although he was admittedly a political prisoner charged with the offence of escaping from jail three years ago.  If in his case specialised treatment is not possible, then we must take it the Government has accepted the traditions of Dublin Castle which were designed not merely to punish political prisoners but to degrade them in the eyes of their fellows.</P>

If the Minister is sincere in the answers he has given to this House, and I believe he is, he has evidently been misled, for I myself saw the marks yesterday evening&mdash;and the Minister himself might also see, or send a doctor to see, her&mdash; on Mrs. MacDermott who was released from Mountjoy last Sunday.  As we all know, the Minister told us here last week that no physical violence was used on this woman, but these black marks are to be seen on her arms and legs.</P>

I am going to keep myself strictly relevant to the question at issue&mdash;that is, to what happened to James Donnelly.  Deputy Dr. Ryan said that he did not wish to waste the <Col N="549" /> time in which I would have to speak, but the time which I will take up in speaking will be only three or four minutes.  James Donnelly was sentenced and brought into prison on the 10th February, 1928.  He put on prison clothes for one day and made an application, which was not acceded to since he put it on certain grounds, that he might be allowed to wear his own clothes.  He refused to wear prison clothes in the meantime and went to bed.  He was not naked.  He was covered by bed clothes, and even in the month of February one can be quite warm in bed.  He subsequently made application on the 16th February that he might be allowed to wear his own clothes, and he, like every other prisoner who makes application to the Prisons Board on proper grounds and shows that it is not necessary for the purposes of health or cleanliness to wear prison clothes, was allowed at the discretion of the Board to wear his own clothes.  As soon as he made application, on the 16th February, it was granted.</P>

I must say that I am a little surprised that Deputy Lemass has allowed a long time to elapse from the <Col N="550" /> cold days of February to the warm days of June before bringing this matter before this House and dissertating upon the evils which James Donnelly is supposed to have suffered.  James Donnelly, however, when he found himself unhappily situated went to bed.  May I make the suggestion that Deputy Lemass should now do the same?</P>
