      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>(for Mr. Flinn) asked the Minister for Finance what are the costs of income tax collection and administration for the years 1923-24 and subsequent years under the following heads:&mdash;(a) Fees and remuneration paid to the Law Officers for services in connection with income and super-tax; (b) the salaries, expenses and all charges of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to income tax matters; (c) the salaries, expenses and all charges for the Special Commissioners for income tax; (d) the salaries, fees, emoluments, allowances, and all expenses of the Inspectors of Taxes; (e) the total expenses of the various offices of the Inspectors covering the salaries of their staffs, wages of attendants, insurance, carriage of documents, postage, telephones, and all expenses per year; (f) the fees, poundage, remuneration, allowances or otherwise paid to Collectors of Taxes in the State; (g) the heads in detail of annual expenses as follows: Stationery chargeable for income and super-tax uses. postage likewise chargeable, rents paid, including apportioned rents of Government Offices otherwise occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Accounts of expenditure are not kept in accordance with the classification set out in the question. In a large office like that of the Revenue Commissioners, dealing with several heads of revenue, where many officers are necessarily engaged in other work as well as in the administration and collection of income tax and super-tax, it would be almost impossible <Col N="583" /> to segregate the cost appropriate to these taxes from the other expenditure, and such an operation, if attempted in any great detail, would be both tedious and expensive, the result being incommensurate with the outlay.  It is considered, therefore, that an estimate for one year made on broad lines will give information sufficiently approximate.  For this purpose, the latest year for which complete returns of expenditure are available, viz., 1926-27, has been chosen, and to all items relating solely to the cost of administration and collection of income tax and super-tax there has been added the appropriate share of all other expenditure calculated on the most reliable basis available.  The total so arrived at is £268,000 approximately.</P>

      <P>No technical classes in cigarette manufacture were held in Dublin prior to the establishment of the factories named.</P>
      <P>I doubt if the work of the ordinary employees in these factories calls for such technical skill or training as would have justified the local committees in organising classes of the kind suggested.</P>

    <P>Amendment:</P>
    <P>1. To delete all words after the word &ldquo;so&rdquo; in the second line, and substitute the words &ldquo;that a pension at the rate of ten shillings per week shall be payable from the 6th day of April next to every pensioner whose yearly means, as calculated under the Old Age Pensions Act, no not exceed £15 12s. 6d.&rdquo;&mdash;(Aire Airgid.)</P>

      <P>In speaking last evening to the motion before the House, I endeavoured to show, first, that the members of the Government Party, I am sure almost without exception, are entirely sympathetic with the best possible treatment of the blind, the aged and the infirm, but that this treatment is to a large extent governed by the financial resources of the State; that these resources are of a limited nature, and that pensions can be only paid in accordance with these limitations.  I pointed out that the practical sympathy of the Government with the old age pensioners was shown by an annual payment of £2,267,000.  To that the Government proposes to add an additional burden of £150,000.  I also pointed out that the money for the reduction of taxation to stabilise the credit of the country, and to arrest economic decay, further depleted these limited resources that were in the hands of the Government to meet the claim that is made upon them to-day.  Deputy Morrissey in moving his motion was of opinion that the economic conditions of the country have now improved to such an extent that we can pay without any difficulty the sum of £500,000 which his motion involves. How any Deputy can suggest that the Saorstát is in a prosperous condition, in view of the fact that we are at present faced with an adverse balance of something like £15,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The post-war economic slump to which the Minister for Finance referred, although it is being checked and although the decline in industry has been stayed, that economic slump is still with us and is only partially removed.  It was only due to the wise operations of finance which that particular Minister undertook by lightening the burden of taxation that this decline was arrested. I do not think that the most cheerful optimist can say that we could lightly face an increase on the burden of taxation of £500,000 per annum.  The partial improvement that has just set in could be very easily checked, and if there is one thing more effective than another to check that improvement, retard the return of prosperity in real measure it will be the imposition of such a sum as Deputy Morrissey asks the House to approve to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has made it perfectly clear that every penny of the additional £150,000 must be found by increased taxation.  That was the point that weighed with Deputies on these Benches when they came to the conclusion that the Minister for Finance could go no further in this matter.  We are not automatic machines replying to the press of a button as suggested, but we are individuals anxious to do our duty to the people who sent us here and anxious to do our duty to the nation as a whole.</P>

      <P>I say it is the duty of the Minister in framing his Budget to take each and every one of those various considerations carefully in review, and to come to no conclusions which, in his opinion, will not enable equal justice to be done to all parties in the State.  That is what I mean when I say that the Minister for Finance cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.  I have listened very carefully to what members on the Labour Benches, for whom I have the greatest respect, have said, but I listened in vain for a single constructive suggestion.  They told us that £500,000 could be found, but they did not put forward one single suggestion in reference to the important statement made by the Minister for Finance as to how the money was to be raised.</P>
      <P>Of course, we have had suggestions from the Fianna Fáil economists and we know what the suggestions are worth.  They were not made in the spirit of dealing with this as a business proposition, as it is entitled to be dealt with, but were made with the one aim and object of, as one of the members of the opposite party expressed it, throwing the Cumann na nGaedheal Party over the precipice.

      <P>The cure for the problem that now confronts the House and the suggestions made to raise the necessary money may be briefly summed up <Col N="601" /> in that wonderful cry which is so effective on the hustings but has so little weight in this House: &ldquo;Reduction of Salaries.&rdquo;  I think that was the greatest canard that ever was launched on an unthinking people.  We have been told that if we wipe out the Governor-General's salary and the salaries paid to the members of the Executive, that if we reduce the salaries of civil servants in cases where they exceed £1,000 that this money can be found.  I suggest that if the salary of the Governor-General and the salaries paid to the members of the Executive were wiped out and that you reduced by ten per cent. all salaries now paid to civil servants, the sum that you would thus place at the disposal of the Minister for Finance would probably be between £20,000 and £30,000.</P>

But when you are dealing not with £20,000 or £30,000 but with half a million of money, the members of the Fianna Fáil Party know as well as I do that this suggestion of theirs has no truth either in substance or in fact. Let me say that, in my opinion, we have in this State the most efficient Civil Service perhaps in the whole of Europe. In conjunction with members from the Fianna Fáil and the Labour Benches.  I had the opportunity of going through the State accounts as a member of the Public Accounts Committee.  It was my experience of the civil servants who appeared before us that a more courteous or efficient body of individuals could not come before any Committee.  I wish to pay that small tribute to them, and I am sure it will be the desire of the other members of the Committee to do the same.  If you were to reduce the salaries of civil servants there could be only one possible result and that is that you will reduce the efficiency of the service.  If you want efficiency you have got to pay for it.  I feel sure that Deputies on the Labour Benches at least will admit that the labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>

      <P>I never referred to that particular item in the whole campaign except in reply to an interrupter, and I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me to refer to it now.  The Fianna Fáil Party has brought particularly under our notice two services in which reductions might be made.  The first to which they refer was the teaching profession, and the next the Gárda Síochána.  I think these are the two most important services in the State, the one engaged in the education of the youth of the nation and the other in the repression of crime.  I think Deputy O'Connell could inform the House, if he wished, that although the salaries of the teaching profession have been increased here, that still they are considerably less than the salaries paid across the Channel.  I think he could also inform us that at the present time there is a demand from this body for a scheme of pensions of some kind, and I presume that at a later stage the Deputy will be rising in the interests of the class of which he is such a great ornament to ask the Minister for Finance to give pensions for the teachers as well as for the blind, the aged and the infirm.  Deputy O'Connell knows that although the salaries for those in the teaching profession here have been increased that at the present moment we are not obtaining men of the proper type and acquirements to enter it. Therefore I suggest it would be an unparalleled disaster to interfere with the teaching profession by a reduction of salaries.  As regards the Gárda Síochána, I think I may suggest, without engendering any heat or raising any controversial issues, that very significant events have occurred quite recently that will be fresh to the minds of Deputies.  You can reduce the salaries paid to the Gárda Síochána, but if you do what does it mean?  How will you deal with the repression of crime?  There are at the moment clear and unmistakable symptoms that the hardly-won peace which we are now <Col N="603" /> enjoying needs the most careful attention of those guardians of the interests of the State.  If you reduce this force you at once give way to crime and all that follows from the perpetration of crime.  I would also remind members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the salaries paid in the Free State to the members of the Gárda Síochána are less than the salaries paid across the Channel, and that there is a steady leakage of some of the most efficient men in the Gárda Síochána who are being lured away to the other side by the certainty of being able to earn a greater wage. I have dealt very effectively, I think, with how the sum of £500,000 is to be raised.  I have yet to deal with the gem of the whole Fianna Fáil scheme and with the crowning point put forward from the Fianna Fáil Benches.</P>

I do not wish to raise any old controversies in this House.  I do not wish to say one word that would create bitterness of any kind, but the outstanding fact remains, as the President rightly pointed out, that there is an annual charge of £1,100,000 on the inhabitants of this country as the result of the Civil War.

With regard to that, I do not want to have the causes discussed, but to-day the only reference as to the cause of the Civil War was by Deputy Gerald Boland in interruption. That is the only reference I heard to it.  I heard yesterday, from Deputy Jordan I think, that the Minister for Agriculture had exculpated the Fianna Fáil Party of any responsibility for the Civil War.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, that is all I have heard.  Deputy Byrne must be allowed to state that there is a cost and that it must be met.  If that is a fact I do not see what we want to discuss the causes of it for, which is another question, but if you are going to discuss the causes it is quite clear the discussion would have to be open to everybody. There is no necessity for us to get into a great state of heat when people mention the Civil War.  Unfortunately and undeniably, there was a Civil War, and that being so, I do not know why we should get excited.  I do not propose to allow Deputy Byrne to go into the causes of the Civil War. I think that particular subject was ruled out of order yesterday by the Chair, although certain references were made, even to the causes of it, while I was in the Chair, by a Deputy on this side of the House.  What I did not like in Deputy Byrne's speech was his preface, that he was not going to say a word that would revive old animosities.  My experience of prefaces of that kind is that they generally lead up to statements which seem to revive animosities. I think that the basis of the whole matter is that when you are discussing matters of finance, you have various items of expenditure.  It is quite fruitless to discuss the causes of these at this juncture.  I agree with <Col N="606" /> Deputy Boland that the cause of the Civil War should not be discussed, but I do not agree with Deputy Boland's insinuation that it has been discussed by one side and not by another.  If there was anything said about it I would hear it.</P>

It is the cool assumption of that that I resent.  I do not want to have any discussion of it or the causes of it.  That a charge has arisen out of it I quite admit, but I do object to allowing any Deputy coolly to assume that all the responsibility for that war is on this side of the House, I think I am entitled to protest with heat against any such assumption being allowed to pass.</P>

We on these benches, have been called automatic men, devoid of intelligence.  We have gone into the matter more closely than members of <Col N="607" /> the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have put the greatest possible pressure on the Minister for Finance to induce him to do what he has done with this addition of £150,000.  We thought we did owe a certain duty to the old age pensioners, and we believe that by the payment of that £150,000 we are discharging our duty to them.  I, like other Deputies, promised from platforms during the elections to do all I possibly could for the old age pensioners. I have kept that promise faithfully and well, but then the members on those benches owe a duty to the Executive, and that is to vote for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us supporting the motion are at a serious disadvantage in endeavouring to deal with it.  We are at a disadvantage to this extent, that we read in the Press where certain Deputies promised at certain meetings throughout the country that the shilling a week would be restored to the old age pensioners, and that certain other relief would be afforded in the matter of taxation. When one considers that any Deputy elected to this Dáil is in a position to make an announcement before the Dáil comes to a decision on that matter, one can only conclude that the decisions of this nature are not taken in the Dáil, but are taken elsewhere in places to which we have no recourse, that the decisions are cut and dried in advance and that we are simply here making a protest while decisions are arrived at elsewhere.  If I had any doubts in my mind at all as to the attitude of the present Government towards old age pensioners, towards the poor and afflicted, they have been dissipated by the speech I have just listened to.  They were dissipated, to some extent, by the speech made by the Minister for Finance yesterday, and particularly by the speech of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  When we find the Minister for Local Government and Public Health saying that no case has been made by those who support this motion, that to show that a person cannot secure frugal comfort on 16/- a week, we are naturally forced to ask him has he made out a case that <Col N="608" /> a person can live on it?  Has he made out a case that a person can secure anything like frugal comfort on 16/- a week?  When we find him, in reply to a question, stating that a convict in jail costs 13/2 per week we can arrive at some conclusion as to what standard of living the present Government thinks an old age pensioner should get.  The standard of comfort that is going to be given to the old age pensioner who has worked for the State for 30, 40 or 50 years and produced wealth for it is to be a convict standard of living.  The difference between 13/2 for a convict in jail and 16/- for an old age pensioner is to be the difference between their standards of living.  That gives us an idea as to what standard of living the Government consider right for these old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sets of people in this country at the moment that I would like to contrast.  When the administration of this country was handed over to the present Government, there were two sets of people whom one might say were starting from scratch: there were those who were paying income tax and those who were in receipt of old age pensions.  Those people who are living on unearned or inherited income had done nothing whatever to enrich the country.  Yet the payment of income tax has gone down by 10 per cent., and the payment to the old age pensioner has been cut down by from 10 to 27 per cent.  Can any proof be more positive that this Government has proved itself to be a rich man's Government.  I will take a case that I am very familiar with&mdash;the case of the small farmer who is endeavouring to get the old age pension, and whose means of support are such that when he hands over his way of living to his son or daughter he cannot retain for himself the competence that will enable him to sustain life for the remainder of his years.  I find that the standard by which his income is valued is such that that man or his wife cannot get the old age pension. Yet I find that that man has been engaged for 30, 40 or 50 years in producing wealth for the State, while the rack-renting landlord or the son of the <Col N="609" /> rack-renting landlord, who has been trying to prevent that farmer from producing for the State, has his income tax reduced by 10 per cent.  Some of the methods by which it is sought to prevent these people from securing the old age pension are ridiculous.  I am sorry that the Minister for Finance and the President are absent.  Where a person looking for an old age pension has a sum of £100, it is suggested that it is capable of bringing him in £10 a year. I would like to know by what means a person who has £100 can get a return of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about the inability to provide money.  Deputy J.J. Byrne went to a great deal of trouble to convince us that it was impossible to provide money to meet this demand.  Is there anything so ridiculous as the statement made yesterday that it was possible for us to give the increase proposed by the Minister, but that the whole fabric of the State would collapse and there would be bankruptcy all round if Deputy Morrissey's motion were carried?  What is the difference between the amount in the motion and in the amendment?  Is there anything more ludicrous than that statement made by a responsible Minister to this House?  We were told that if we had not to meet certain expenses relating to certain things that occurred a few years ago that we might be able to meet the old age pensions demand. When the Minister for Finance found that he had a certain few hundred thousand pounds to play with, did he keep his promise to the old age pensioners? Did he devote the three or four hundred thousand pounds available to the restoration of the shilling? He did not.  He thought of those people who are the mainstay and backbone of the present administration; he thought of the men of money and reduced income tax, and told those people who have been the producers of the wealth of the State that they were entitled to nothing.  He had a way then of handing back the shilling a week that had been taken from the old age pensioners. But clearly the present administration has nothing but a pauper standard of living for the old age pensioner. and the only difference they recognise between <Col N="610" /> the convict and the old age pensioner is 2/10 a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Mr. MULLINS Mr. MULLINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened yesterday evening to this debate in the hope of finding some change in the mentality and attitude of those on the Government benches towards the old people of this country.  I am sorry that no change was apparent.  The only thing that is apparent is a hardening of outlook and that materialistic considerations weigh more with them than the interests of the old people.  They seem to think that the only thing that counts in connection with this question is money.  They do not consider for a moment the rights of the case.  They do not consider the people who have lived in the country to the age of 60 years and who have helped to build it up and to create wealth.  They do not consider that it is the primary duty of a civilised community to look after the old people who are no longer able to work, and that in spite of the fact that some of their own Deputies admit that of all the rotten Acts passed by this Dáil in the past five years that Act of 1924 took the bun.  In my opinion, it is only a continuance of the great fraud that was started in 1921, a continuance of the big game of bluff and endeavour to make the old people and the people of the country generally believe that the Minister for Finance is going to restore the shilling. As some Deputies pointed out, hardly 50 per cent. of the old people will benefit by this restoration, hardly 15 per cent. will benefit to any appreciable extent in the congested areas of West Cork, Kerry, Donegal, etc.  The rate of pension remains the same.  Yet Deputies on the other side tell us that the Minister has kept his word&mdash; Deputy Sheehy stated that the Minister had &ldquo;almost kept his word.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance, in the course of his defence last evening, said that every penny additional given to the old age pensioners would have to come out of increased taxation.  Other Deputies have dealt with that matter.  The Minister added to that that the country would be unable to stand a rise in taxation.  The only thing I should like to say in connection with that is, that it was found possible in this House to <Col N="611" /> provide money for many other things. When the Government wanted money for certain purposes, it was found possible to provide it in spite of the bad economic condition of the country. Here is a thing that goes to the very roots of this boasted freedom and of this boasted civilisation that some of the Deputies on the other side of the House are so fond of talking about; here is a thing that goes to the roots of the boasted status of which they constitute themselves the defenders, that unmasks the hypocrisy of their attitude in connection with the entire position, and they say they cannot find money for it without further taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister later stated that if the Dáil went further than he proposed it would postpone necessary measures. Why, he does not tell us.  He added that the old age pensioners should wait for further progress before additional assistance could be given to them.  If the 300,000 people who, I infer, were affected by this Old Age Pensions Act had been in a position to fight, I wonder what would have been the attitude of the Dáil and of the Minister for Finance towards them in 1924? Were they not the weakest section of the community&mdash;the section that could not hit back?  Were they not the people who were down?  Had they been in a position to organise, had they been in a position to do what other people in this country succeeded in doing&mdash;forming a great national organisation and putting their case properly before the people&mdash;had they been in a position to utilise the influence which they undoubtedly commanded, does the Minister not think there would have been almost a revolution at the time he passed that Act in 1924 amending the Old Age Pensions Act? Yet, he speaks of prosperity of the country having turned the corner, and of the improvement in trade conditions and things generally&mdash;he speaks of all that, while, as Deputy Morrissey said in introducing his motion, the first martyrs of the so-called liberty which we have obtained in this country which was once Ireland are the old people who cannot hit back.  The Minister, the Government generally and the Deputies on the opposite benches are <Col N="612" /> attempting to camouflage the whole thing, to side-track the real issue, to make the people believe that this State, which can be represented on the League of Nations, which can afford the luxury of a Seanad and a Governor-General, which can afford the luxury of an Army Pensions Scheme which more affluent States would not and could not undertake&mdash;that this State cannot provide for the old people who have gone through the toil and stress of life in this country.  These self-constituted defenders of the wonderful social system which we live under, this magnificent freedom we have, refuse to improve the condition of the old people, and give them only the right to starve in their own country. The Minister for Finance said further that there was no foundation whatever for describing the cut in the old age pensions as robbery.  If it was not robbery, there is no other word in the English language that can characterise it sufficiently.  If it was not robbery to take from the people who were down and unable to retaliate and to give back to the people who were in a position to press the Minister for Finance, then I do not know what robbery really is.</P>
    <P>The President approached this question in the same flippant manner in which he approached the question of unemployment in this House.  He approached it jokingly, trying to pass the thing off, trying to score little debating points off opponents and trying to camouflage, as other Deputies on the Government Benches tried to camouflage, the real issue.  He said that the teachers' salaries were cut down and that the salaries of the Gárda Síochána were cut down before the old age pensions were reduced in 1924.  He said that they had done this for the benefit of the country and that they had established a sound policy.  Yes, they have established a sound policy, a policy, as another Deputy I think mentioned, of taking from the weak to give to the strong. They have established the sound policy of attempting to exterminate the weaker people in this country who cannot retaliate.  They have established a sound policy on the very same lines as they have cut the old age <Col N="613" /> pensions.  They have cut the workers' wages from Cork to Donegal in this Free State.  That is the sound policy which President Cosgrave so jocosely speaks of in this House and of which he is so proud.  There is one thing certain, that the attempt which the President made in this debate yesterday to draw a red herring across the trail, the attempt to camouflage the issue so that the responsibility for the cut in the old age pensions would be attributed to incidents that occurred in this country a few years ago, will be seen through by the people whom Deputy J.J. Byrne characterised as the &ldquo;unthinking people&rdquo; of this country.  One other Deputy on the Government Benches&mdash;Deputy Sheehy &mdash;in the course of a flowery oration stated that the Minister had &ldquo;almost kept his promise.&rdquo;  I wonder what the people will think of the word &ldquo;almost&rdquo; in that statement.  The country, the Deputy said, was progressing and in a short period it might be possible completely to restore the old age pensions.  That is the mentality of the Government Benches&mdash; the policy of wait, dilly-dally and delay instead of adopting the bold course, instead of making a noble gesture and giving to these people a thing that is their due.  That is the way they are being treated as slaves and given, as Deputy Hogan said, convict status instead of being treated as honourable citizens of this State who have helped to build the country up.  Instead of being treated properly, they are being treated as if they were people whom the Government could afford to ignore, as people who did not count.</P>
    <P>The real capitalistic mentality, the mentality which is associated with the rotten social system which exists in this country, is exemplified in the speeches of the President and of the Ministers.  The country is progressing; there is happiness; there is prosperity &mdash;but the old age pensioners can afford to wait.  They cannot hit back.  Therefore they are not to be tolerated or counted.  Deputy Carey, in the course of a brief speech, said that the increase of one shilling was quite enough.  In reply to suggestions from this side of the House as to how economies could be <Col N="614" /> effected and the cut restored without increasing taxation, the Deputy said that no member would be in this House were it not for the work done by the Army pensioners.  I know that down in my constituency there is a list of them. If Deputy Carey would only take a walk through his own constituency he would find that the same story obtains there as in my constituency, and that very little work was done by any of these pensioners to secure the vaunted freedom which we possess in this country which was once Ireland.  Deputy J.J. Byrne suggested, in regard to the economies which could be effected, that only £20,000 or thereabouts could be saved.  The Minister for Finance some time ago, in the debate on our proposals for economy, discussed the possible economies that could be effected in the Civil Service.  By adopting some of our proposals&mdash;some of the suggestions that we put forward for economies&mdash;he found that £216,000, representing relief in taxation equal to a farthing in the lb. on sugar, could be saved.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister desires to be shown the way to economise.  I think he has his mind made up, like the other Ministers in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, there are economies that can be effected.  There is a way by which the old age pension can be restored to its former status without increasing taxation or inflicting hardship on any section of the community.  We demand that that restoration be made. The people of the country demand it. The electors have sent you here, and they have sent us here, to see that the interests of the people as a whole are safeguarded.  The interests of the weakest class are in your control now. It is up to the members of the Dáil to make it plain to the Government in the Division Lobbies that the people whom Deputies represent demand a restoration of the pre-1924 status.  As has been suggested here, the Minister, instead of trying to evade the issue and trying to draw a red herring across the <Col N="615" /> trail and bluff the people further, should examine the position in Great Britain and Northern Ireland with respect to contributory pensions at the age of 65.  I strongly support the motion.  I think the old people in the country who are supposed to benefit under this so-called restoration will get a very unpleasant surprise when they find out it is merely a continuance of the bluff that has existed for the last five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters before the House: the motion by Deputy Morrissey to restore things as they were before the Act of 1924, and the Government's amendment, moved by the Minister for Finance, that refuses to go as far as Deputy Morrissey's motion goes, but that restores the shilling to sixty per cent. of the actual number of old age pensioners.  I want to make it quite clear we are not claiming that we are restoring sixty per cent. in the way of money taken away in 1924.  What we do say is this: that with the most careful estimates we can possibly make we may safely claim that sixty per cent. of the old age pensioners will get the additional shilling.  That is what is involved in the Minister's amendment. We admit that forty per cent. of the actual number of old age pensioners, those at present receiving some form of old age pension, will not receive any extra benefit.  The question is, what is a proper policy for the House to assume in the interests of the country&mdash;in the interests, not of any particular class, but in the interests of the country as a whole?  What is the proper policy to assume in regard to those two rival proposals?  Is the wisest course merely, according to the last Deputy, to ignore material considerations, to ignore that it is a question of pounds, shillings and pence&mdash; that the whole thing is a matter of pounds, shillings and pence?  That is quite a characteristic remark and a characteristic ignoring of the real facts of the situation that I might expect from the opposite benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I did not say &ldquo;ignore material considerations&rdquo;<Col N="616" /> in attempting to solve this problem.  I said the mentality over there appeared to take no account of anything but material considerations.</P>

      <P>There may be a point in the personal explanation. I fail to see it.  The fact remains that what interests the old age pensioners, this House and the Government is how much they are going to get.  That, I understand, was the burden of the case made, up to the speech of the last Deputy.  We are to ignore these things; we are not to benefit the State but to be guilty, if I may use the phrase guilty, of a splendid, a noble gesture&mdash;that was the phrase used.  We were not to exercise any wisdom; we were to give up the policy of dilly-dally.  We, unfortunately, as a Government have not merely to give a popular vote as Deputies of this House but we have to weigh up every consideration. Whether other Deputies like the matter or not, we have to ask ourselves: &ldquo;Can the country at the present moment afford to do this?&rdquo; Even if we were only looking at the interests of the old age pensioners themselves, would it be wise if we take a step that we now think financially unsound for the country which will hit everybody in the country, old age pensioners and everybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increased prosperity of the country.  Our contention has been that we have turned the corner; that we have, to a certain extent, been able to overcome the effects of our own civil strife; that we are recovering as other countries are recovering from the inevitable depression that followed the European War.  All we ask is that we should utilise and make the most of that beginning of prosperity; that we should not, merely in order to be able to perform a noble gesture, do something that would be undoubtedly popular but that would damage, as we know it would damage, the whole future prosperity of this country. Remember that we are dealing with a question of prosperity.  Deputy Morrissey's speech and his personal explanations would suggest that it is <Col N="617" /> not the question.  What he has to face is not what the Minister has to face&mdash; whether the country is prospering or not&mdash;but whether actually the country has sufficiently prospered.  He has to show that it has sufficiently prospered to meet this additional charge.  It is no good quoting statements from Ministers or others unless the Deputy is prepared to accept them as to prosperity.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>We have been taunted again and again because, when demands were made for expenditure of this kind, for various types of expenditure, we always asked the question: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; I suggest it is our duty as a Government to put that factor before the House. Any Deputy who has been in the House for four or five years will bear me out when I say that the House is liable to forget, when asking for increased services, the question of the provision of money.  Unfortunately it is the business and the duty of the Government to ask themselves that question and to put that question clearly before the House.  To taunt us that we continually ask that question is not to get rid of or answer the question.  We have to repeat the question again and again from these benches because in our minds no satisfactory answer has been given to that question in this and other matters.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate there were I admit, speaking generally, two methods suggested of meeting this expenditure.  One apparently was&mdash;I do not say that the suggestion was put forward&mdash;that we ought to increase taxation, but when the question was put, would certain people agree to taxation, the answer was yes.  The Minister for Finance has dealt with the unwisdom from some points of view of doing that.</P>
    <P>I think one of the Labour Deputies made it quite clear that his assent to that proposition was certainly conditional. It was by no means unqualified. He assents to taxation, but only taxation of certain values.  It was not to be on tea or sugar apparently.  In other words&mdash;and this is to a certain extent what it means&mdash;we are to be asked, I presume, judging from some <Col N="618" /> references made from the other benches&mdash;I hope I am not misinterpreting the Deputy&mdash;but certainly the suggestion has been made in this House that we should go back on the cut in the income tax; that we should restore the income tax to where it was before the last Budget.  When the problem of the last Budget was before the Government they had to face a certain situation.  With the surplus that year at their disposal they could have done various popular things, things that would have got them votes at the General Election.  They knew that there was an election coming on; but they determined in the interests of the country as a whole that the interests of the country would be better served, that more industries would be established, and that it would be an impetus to establishing industries to give this reduction in the income tax.  They knew and realised that it would be a very solid effort to make a contribution, and not merely a passing contribution, but a permanent contribution, to the problem of solving unemployment and to the problem of dealing with unemployment if the income tax were cut down by one shilling in the £.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that I am rather shocked to find from the opposite benches the suggestion that that was no good for the country?  I thought it was one of the economic doctrines of at least a portion of these benches that the best way of benefiting the country was to have no income tax at all.  Certainly the proposal to abolish the income tax altogether has not come from any Deputies on these benches.  But any argument apparently is good enough with which to whack the Government or to whack the Minister for Finance.  The other method proposed was a reduction of expenditure. There is not a more popular cry than the cry of a reduction of expenditure. I think it was Deputy Lemass who said that if the Minister had devoted his time to seeing how expenditure could be diminished, rather than to seeing how taxation could be increased, he would benefit the country enormously. Some other Deputies on the benches opposite have not the experience of this House or of Parliaments that might help them to deal with that question <Col N="619" /> What has been our experience of this matter in the Dáil?  There are various Votes and Estimates which are in the hands of Deputies every year.  When we come to discuss those Votes, what is our experience?  Has the demand from various quarters of the House and from every party in the House been a demand for diminished expenditure? Nearly every Deputy who has been a member of this House for the last four years knows perfectly well that one of the most difficult tasks, and in some respects one of the most unpopular tasks, that the Government or the Minister for Finance has to face is that he has to refuse demands for increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>There has been hardly a single vote, with one or two notable exceptions, in which the demand has not been for increased expenditure.  The one or two exceptions would be in certain things like the Governor-General's Vote and matters of that kind.  In all the other items the demand has been for increased expenditure.  As each item comes up it has been pointed out &ldquo;economies are very well, but this is not the proper place in which to practise economy, this is a remunerative expenditure; instead of having this Vote less it should be more.  This expenditure will pay for itself, and it will help to develop the nation and help the prosperity of the State.  Economy here would be fatal.&rdquo;  I suggest to those who are so keen on suggesting methods of dealing with expenditure just to wait until the debates on the Estimates come round next April, and to show us where, with safety and with proper regard for the interests of the State, real economies can be effected.  It was only a few months ago that there was a motion in this House which led to the setting up of a Committee, a motion that coincided with the view taken beforehand by the Government that certain money was necessary for relief work. In addition to that, a Committee to deal with the problems of unemployment was set up.  Do Deputies think that that may not lead to increased expenditure on the part of the State?  Is it not the experience of everybody who has to deal with public affairs that that <Col N="620" /> is so?  I will ask Deputies to deal with this motion seriously.  Is it not a fact that one of the hardest tasks that the Minister for Finance is faced with is having to refuse to give way to the increased demand for increased expenditure? We have plenty of examples of it.  Our experience is demands for increased expenditure practically on the one hand, and demands for decreased taxation, when you have to raise the money to meet the demands for increased expenditure.  Perhaps it was not without a certain amount of symbolism, if I may use the word, that the day this motion was tabled by Deputy Morrissey&mdash;a motion that would cost the State half a million a year&mdash;the front page in two Dublin dailies was taken up by a demand for decreased taxation.  That is precisely the task that the Government have to face year after year, and every Deputy who has been in this House knows that that is the case.  I think it was Deputy Ward who suggested&mdash;I have taken down his words&mdash;&ldquo;We should ask ourselves a question: Can the country afford extravagant salaries and pensions that are paid to other sections of the community, largely in the State's service, such as civil servants, teachers, police, local government officials, and so on?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking of my own particular service, I can hold out no prospects of a reduction in that service to the Deputy. The salaries of the teachers were increased, undoubtedly, from what they were in 1914.  That is so, and there was very good reason for it.  The salaries of the teachers were decreased a couple of years ago, and there was good reason for that too.  But I do not think, in the interests of the service and in the interest of education, that a further decrease can be contemplated by the Government.  No further decrease in the Vote for Education can be contemplated by the Government. I see a demand made for it.  I can tell Deputy Ward that I can gather, so far as I am concerned, that it would be disastrous to the interests of education, and, being disastrous to the interests of education, I believe it would be disastrous to the interests of the country. I believe what the country wants is <Col N="621" /> not less but more money spent on education. Undoubtedly the Minister for Finance will have put up to him a demand not for less expenditure on education but for greater expenditure, and where is he to meet it?  I would ask the Deputies to consider all these things.  It is not an increase in this particular expenditure alone that the Government have to consider.  It is a demand for increased expenditure in every useful service.  I would ask Deputies who are supporting Deputy Morrissey's motion to the full extent to bear that in mind.  Of course there are other suggestions made also.  One is the question of dealing with the Civil Service.  Deputy Byrne, to a large extent, has answered that already.  I do not intend to traverse again the ground that he has covered, and covered fully.  There is one thing in that connection, and that is the question of the Treaty rights of the civil servants.  Is it intended to repudiate these rights or not?  On the other hand, there is the question of efficiency.  I am fully convinced, and I know those who have been directly or indirectly concerned with the Government of this country for the last five or six years will bear me out, that the money spent on the higher posts in the Civil Service is well spent money.  The other great item of expenditure which, I think, Deputy Corry first mentioned, and which was repeated again and again, is Army pensions.  We as a Government, and I as a member of the Government, do not intend to deprive of their pensions the men whom we believe to have saved the country when it was face to face with destruction. I will be surprised if members of the Labour Party will subscribe to a policy of that kind either.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the various questions as to <Col N="622" /> how this increased expenditure is to be met.  I am dealing with the suggestion made by Deputies from the opposite benches, that these Army pensions we have voted should be done away with.  They do not err on the side of generosity.  I have heard criticism of them, and the criticism generally has been from the opposite side to generosity.  I think those who have been in the Dáil before the present year will remember that when the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence were criticised, it was not because the pensions had been too many or too big.  Everybody knows the jeer that greeted the Minister for Defence: &ldquo;When is the Pensions Bill coming on that you promised?&rdquo; The demands have been here, as elsewhere, not for less expenditure, but greater expenditure.  Apart from that, this Government, as long as it is in power, will not completely forget the men who saved the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other item is immense savings on the Army.  I think it was the Deputy, who I understand has a large Army experience, possibly in different armies, who suggested that out of the expenditure of two and a quarter millions on the Army, three-quarters of a million could be saved.  Anybody who has listened to Budget speeches in this House&mdash;and if they have not listened they might at least go to the trouble of reading them&mdash;will understand that of the expenditure on the Army of two and a quarter millions only one and a half millions is met out of taxation. That is, that the Government have recognised that owing to the abnormal condition of the country from 1922 onwards, a certain amount of money that could not be regarded as normal expenditure had to be spent on the Army, and that it was only fair that that should be met, not out of ordinary revenue, but by means of borrowing. That was done.  Already, therefore, the saving of three-quarters of a million, mentioned, I think, by Deputy Carney, does not save you one penny as far as this is concerned.  If you take the normal expenditure of the Army as being one and a half millions, his suggestion of a reduction by three-quarters of a million brings you to the one <Col N="623" /> and a half millions, which is precisely the sum that is met out of taxation in our Budget.</P>

      <P>I made it quite clear that that was not Deputy Redmond's suggestion.  We do not think&mdash;I think we have the bulk of the country behind us in not thinking&mdash;that an effort to pare down the Army and the Gárda Síochána will be to the permanent advantage of the country.  We feel that if that were done&mdash;done unduly&mdash;the country might have to pay very dearly for it and that everybody would suffer&mdash;old age pensioners and everybody else.  The other suggestion made was that we were spending too much under the Secret Service.  I wish we were, because I feel there might be some opportunity of dealing with some of the plots that are still in existence against the safety of the State.  I remember a very celebrated occasion in this House when it was suggested that we did not spend enough&mdash;that a certain disaster that recently befell this State would not have occurred had we been more generous in spending in that particular way.  The President, I think, was taunted with the question: Did he in America say that we cut off one shilling from the old age pensioners? What he did tell the American people was, and it is a factor which should be borne in mind, speaking in a country in which old age pensions were not a national or a local charge, that we spent such a large proportion of our revenue &mdash;one-ninth or whatever the exact figure may be&mdash;on old age pensions; that there were few other countries in Europe, if any, that spent such an amount of their revenue on this particular service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> What we have to face therefore is this: The Minister for Finance is convinced that with safety to the State he can restore the shilling to 60 per cent. of those who at present enjoy the old age pension, but to go beyond that he does not think would be good for the finances or the safety of the State.  We have had, since taking over the Government of the country, to undertake services that were never performed in this country before.  New forms of expenditure had to be met.  These could only be met ultimately by taxation.  If you increase old age pensions you can only increase them by a very considerable increase in taxation.  Is the present moment the time to do that?  The answer of the Government is, that in giving the concession that they now give, they meet 60 per cent. of the cases. And remember it is the needy cases that are the ones that will get the increase; these will be dealt with and their claim will be satisfied.  If the signs of prosperity that we now see continue, then will be the time to consider whether there should not be an expansion of the concession now given.</P>

      <P>Not belonging to a party, the members of which see eye to eye on all questions, I think I will be absolved from being whipped up to speak on this motion.  I should say at the outset that I am in entire agreement with the terms of Deputy Morrissey's motion and with his objects.  If that motion had been accepted without question by the Government, and if when it was tabled they said, &ldquo;We will give that,&rdquo; I would have very serious misgivings that the old age pensioners would get any more than they have to-day.  Why do I say that?  When this cut was made in 1924, I think I am right in saying that it was sandwiched between a cut on the teachers and on the Civic Guards.  It was represented to the House, and I think accepted&mdash;I am glad to say I was not in the House when the cut was made&mdash;but I think it was accepted that there was a ten per cent. reduction on old age pensions, teachers' salaries and the Civic Guards. This motion of Deputy Morrissey, if it has done nothing else, has shown us exactly what 10 per cent. means on old age pensions.  What happened?  The <Col N="625" /> Minister for Finance on that occasion said to the old age pensioner: &ldquo;Let me see your purse, how much have you got in it?  You have 15/- in that purse, I will take out one shilling as the State wants it,&rdquo; but by a little bit of legerdemain he took two shillings along with it; he palmed the other two shillings, and no Deputy saw the Minister palming the two shillings.</P>

      <P>Somebody had a little gibe at the Independent members, but the hope to-day is here on those benches for the old age pensioners. The reason I am anxious to speak upon this subject is because the Minister for Finance has tabled an amendment to this motion.  As I said earlier, suppose he had not.  Suppose he agreed to accept this motion. There are several ways, by administration and by instruction, to see that although on paper it is supposed to cost a half million of money, that that half million of money would never go to the old age pensioners.  And the hope that I see that the pensioners are going to benefit by this amendment is that the Minister for Finance has gone one-third of the way.  He says that the old age pensioners are going to be benefited by £175,000 per annum.  This is a definite statement, and it is up to this House to see that by no political or administrative jugglery that £175,000 will become a myth, but that it will be a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various suggestions have been put forward as to how the £175,000 is to be got.  I make no suggestion.  It has been suggested that a reduction in the cost of the Army could be made.  That that could be done, I am quite certain. It has been suggested that the salaries of the Civic Guards could be reduced. They could be reduced.  On the other hand, the Minister for Finance suggested that restoring the whole shilling and to restore all pensioners to their <Col N="626" /> old status would mean putting an additional burden in the way of a tax of an extra sixpence on tea and one penny on sugar.  I have nothing to do with that.  The Minister is giving away no Budget secrets, I am sure, but what I am concerned about is that he has given a definite guarantee to find £175,000 more for the old age pensioners than they have enjoyed for the last four years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Morrissey upon having brought forward this motion.  I am sorry that the Minister for Finance is not in the House, because I would make an endeavour to bring Deputy Morrissey's motion and the Minister's amendment a little bit more into consonance than they appear at the moment.  I think, while the Minister has made this offer of £175,000, which I hope will not be spoiled in administration, he might go a little bit further in the way of giving a guarantee that the moment the finances of the country warrant it, he will go the whole way in the restoration of the shilling and, perhaps more than that, that he will consent to reduce the age from 70 to 65.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carney touched upon the question of dud rifles and ammunition. Perhaps it will be unpopular if I say that I wish to God a good rifle or good ammunition never came into this country.  I would also like to see whatever dud guns there are in the country loaded with confetti, but, unfortunately for us, we are more in the habit of attending funerals these times than political marriages.  Confetti is usually used in marriages.  When we have all those at this House and the people outside united in the bonds of toleration, when old age pensioners and other citizens will not be laid on the table and dissected for political purposes, I think then we will find we will be able to get the money; that we will be in a sounder economic position when everyone is pulling together for the common weal, and when those little issues, quite proper in their way, are not being used by one side and the other for political advantage.  I do not wish to delay the House any longer or to interfere with Deputy Morrissey in his reply, which, I understand, is to conclude by 5 o'clock.  I throw out the suggestion, if <Col N="627" /> the Minister for Finance thinks it worth while, and Deputy Morrissey thinks it feasible, that there should be a little advance on both sides, so that after all the extraneous matter and the heat imported into the debate, when it is over, the people outside will say that the Dáil, in considering the question of the old age pensioners, had treated them fairly.</P>

      <P>Members of all Parties outside the Government Party enjoy the happy privilege of being in the position of supporting and voting for anything brought forward of a popular character, regardless of what effect their action may have upon the finances of the State.  If Deputy Morrissey's motion is passed it will cost £500,000, and that money will have to be found by the Minister for Finance. He has definitely stated here that if it is to be found it must be found by additional taxation, and additional taxation at the present moment is unthinkable.  I have very little doubt that when the Budget comes on important savings can be effected.  But what about the demands in connection with the reduction of taxation on particular matters, the beer and spirit duties, the entertainment taxes, the motor taxes, and many other things that at the present time are handicapping the trade and commerce of the country, and incidentally creating unemployment?  I cannot understand the attitude of the Labour Party in stating that the reduction of income tax has not benefited materially the people they represent. The remedy for unemployment is to provide employment, and the way to provide employment is to reduce taxation, to encourage the development of industry, the development of trade and commerce, and to attract capital into the country.  The fact of our income tax being lower than the income tax in England or in Northern Ireland has attracted capital into the country, and I believe, now that the conditions in this country are more stable and peaceful than they were, you will see development at a rapid rate in the future.  One of the real difficulties in this country is unemployment, and I believe the reduction of the income tax will go further than anything else the <Col N="628" /> Government could do to provide employment.</P>
      <P>This motion brought forward by Deputy Morrissey is, of course, one that we should all like to vote for if the conditions in the country justified it.  My opinion is that this motion was not brought forward so much in the interest of the old age pensioners as that it is the third round of a contest that has taken place here in an endeavour to defeat the Government. The first two rounds of the contest have failed, and the third round will fail.  I believe if the Government were defeated it would be the worst day the old age pensioners of this country ever saw.</P>
      <P>Therefore, whilst I am very confident that with improved conditions in the country in the near future the Minister, possibly at Budget time, may reinstate the full amount to the old age pensioners, I am satisfied that he has met Deputies fairly, and that what he has proposed will relieve the persons who at the present time are suffering the severest privations by the cut.</P>

      <P>When giving my vote I am anxious to satisfy myself that by so doing I am not increasing the cost of living on the very poor in the area which I represent. I represent one of the Dublin constituencies in which possibly you would find more poverty and destitution than in any other part of Ireland.  The suggestion has frequently been made here that if Deputy Morrissey's motion is carried it may mean an increase in the cost of tea or sugar on these poor people.  An increase of one halfpenny or one penny a pound in the case of a workman who has a family of seven or eight children would indeed be a very serious matter. I am not prepared to ask these poverty-stricken people who use, perhaps, <Col N="629" /> in the case of each family, six or seven pounds of sugar in the week, to contribute an additional 3d. out of the St. Vincent de Paul dole which they get or out of the poor relief which they receive towards this motion of Deputy Morrissey's.  Can I have an assurance from the Minister that this is not his last word, if he finds he is in a position to give more from the surplus which may be there when he is preparing his Budget?  If the surplus is there when he is preparing his Budget, I would like to know from him will the old age pensioners have first claim on that surplus? So far, no one has asked for that assurance.</P>

Next year, if I am here, I hope to be able to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a surplus, and that he promised in 1928 that he would give the old age pensioners the first claim on it.  I would like to know also from the Minister if he can give us any assurance as to whether there is any possibility in the near future of the old people getting any consideration from him, and that if there is a surplus available it will not be devoted to decreases in taxation in regard to those who are not as badly in need of relief as the old age pensioners.  I am not here to be used by any party for political advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the start that, as far as some of us are concerned, in discussions of this kind we are inclined to sympathise very much with the Minister for Finance, because we know full well that with him lies the responsibility of seeing now proposals are to be met from the financial point of view.  I want to assure him and the Minister for Education, who spoke as if we were altogether forgetful of these things, that, in making up our minds to support Deputy Morrissey's motion we took care to satisfy ourselves how the increase in expenditure which it would mean, if we were not able to get reductions in other quarters, should be borne.  There are people, of course, always who want to have their loaves and eat them. There are people also who are like the cat that wants the fish, but will not wet its feet in order to get them.  We believe in this case that the fish are worth wetting our feet for.  We believe that to meet the needs of the old people and to give them the restoration of the cut which Deputy Morrissey's motion proposes, it is worth making certain sacrifices, even if we have to make them.</P>
      <P>There are Deputies here who, some years ago, made certain declarations which, perhaps, it would not be out of place to remind them of now.  On the 21st January, 1919, there was, side by side with a certain declaration of independence, also a statement called a democratic programme which was supposed to express their social ideas. There are two paragraphs, but one is more immediately germane to this report than the other.  The two go together, and, with your permission, A Chinn Comhairle, I will read both. They say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children and to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as citizens of a free and Gaelic Ireland.  The Irish <Col N="631" /> Republic fully realises the necessity of abolishing the present odious, degrading and foreign poor law system and substituting therefor a sympathetic native scheme for the care of the nation's aged and infirm, who shall not be regarded as a burden but rather entitled to the nation's gratitude and consideration.  Likewise....</P>
    <P>I think, A Chinn Comhairle, that is sufficient for my purpose.  I wish to remind Deputies who subscribed to that declaration that they should ask themselves before they vote whether they mean to be true to that declaration, when they can be true to it, or whether they mean to run away from it.</P>
    <P>To my mind, there is no money that is so well-spent, and no money for which we get such value as the money that is spent on the children and on the old.  I certainly will not be one who will ask the Minister for Education to try to reduce the Education Vote.  I hope that Deputy Morrissey's motion will pass, and that the next motion that we will have in the Dáil will be to give an old age pension to everybody over 70; to reduce the administration costs by not inquiring whether they are needy or not, but to give a pension to everybody over 70 years. That would remove from these poor people the fear and the danger of being left destitute in their old age.  I believe that is nothing more or less for the community than an ordinary form of contributory insurance.  The taxpayers, if such a course were adopted, would be simply insuring themselves. When they became old and were no longer able to work they would be insuring themselves against being left destitute.  It is nothing more or less than that.  At present it does not appear to be that, I will admit.  Why? Because we have to provide now for those who were not provided for, for the aged of the present period; but once it is established it is nothing more or less than an insurance by the community of its members.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, with most of the members who have spoken on our side, that this money can be got at the present time without putting any further <Col N="632" /> burden by way of extra taxation on the people.  When we look through the Estimates for the current year and see, for example, a sum of £1,623,000 for the Civic Guard, a sum of over £2,262,000 for the Army, a sum of £217,160 for Army pensions, not to speak of other similar sums, anybody who examines the amounts in detail will find that by a reduction of these the half million which is required can be very easily got.  If this House is prepared to pass the motion, and pass immediately after it a motion that there should be a committee to go into these matters and see wherein these reductions can be made, I am sure that a composite committee of this House would be able to find where the savings could be effected.  If the Minister wanted to provide for a new war he would have no difficulty in finding the amount.</P>
    <P>We were told yesterday by Deputy Law&mdash;I am quoting from a newspaper &mdash;that it was the worst form of economy to underpay those who had charge of public affairs.  I agree with him, but to underpay men is a very different thing from what we propose to do.  We are not asking you to underpay men.  What we say is: give them a reasonable sum, such as the country can afford.  Give them such a sum as will save them from necessity and relieve them from anxiety with regard to earning their bread, or educating their children.  Save them from all these things certainly, but do not make the mistake of thinking that you are going to get such service as the nation needs simply by paying them big salaries.  It was not the reward of money that ever got decent service for any nation in the past or that will ever get it in the future.  We will get service from those who look for rewards, not financial rewards.  Even empires which can afford to give big sums in order to attract people into their service do not get the best service by the amount of money they give.  The best service given is from that part of the community who are honoured by being able to serve, who feel that the fact that they are able to serve and that they get the opportunity of serving, is the highest reward they can get, and they <Col N="633" /> look for no other profit.  They are relieved of the anxiety of having to earn their bread.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned we expect that the people who go voluntarily into the public service&mdash;they are not compelled to do it&mdash;whether they go up for election and become Ministers, or whether they go into the service otherwise voluntarily, when the scale is known&mdash;if they choose that particular way of satisfying their ambitions, if you like&mdash;will be content to get from the people of this country the amounts the people can afford ordinarily to give them.  We believe that the salaries, whether in the higher Civil Service, where salaries are over £1,000 a year, or in the case of Ministers, are based on a standard which this country cannot afford to pay unless we are going to get the money by reducing the sum that is given to the old age pensioners, or denying children the education they should get in order to fit them to be good citizens to the nation.  Our attitude in the matter is very clear.  We are for the motion.  We hope it is going to be the first step for a more general pension for all who are over 70, and for checking the waste of money spent in administration of the present code. We hope that those who are on the opposite side, and who at one time subscribed to the democratic programme, now that they have an opportunity of acting up to their professions, will act up to them and will vote for the motion.</P>

May I remind the Minister for Finance, and Deputy Alfred Byrne, that the Minister made this statement on the Budget in 1925:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We believe some revision of the Old Age Pension Act, 1924, will have to be given precedence of any further reduction of taxation, however much required&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not. And might I remind the Minister, and Deputy Alfred Byrne, that in the last Budget, when the Minister had a sum equal to the sum that had been taken from the old age pensioners&mdash;in other words, the Minister had over a half a million pounds, roughly the amount that was taken from the old age pensioners&mdash;instead of keeping that very definite promise and giving the old age pensioners precedence over any further reduction in taxation, &ldquo;however much required,&rdquo; he gave it to the people who were fortunate enough to be able to pay income tax.  And when the Minister and Deputies on the Government Benches ask where the money is to be got, and when we are asked what is to be taxed, tea or sugar&mdash;why these two are singled out I do not know, unless it is to provide Deputy Alfred Byrne with an excuse for voting for the Minister's amendment&mdash;I say the proper place to get the money is where you put it when you took it from the old age pensioners.  The Minister took over half a million pounds from the old age pensioners, and last year he gave over half a million pounds to the people who pay income tax.  The President, I think, said that income tax was responsible for half the revenue of Great <Col N="635" /> Britain, and that it is responsible for only 25 per cent. of the revenue of the Free State.  Whose fault is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are told by the President and by other speakers on the Government Benches that this motion is put down for the purpose of making political capital out of the old age pensioners, I suppose I would be entitled to say that the Ministry reduced the income tax last year for the purpose of making political capital.  They made monetary capital out of it as well as political capital, because they were able to run two elections with apparently unlimited funds, with full-page advertisements in the papers day-in and day-out.  Certainly the money to pay for these costly advertisements did not come from the old age pensioners. But what amused me most in this speech&mdash;and there were speeches made from the Government Benches which had very little to do with the motion, if anything at all&mdash;was how that Minister, above all others, could tell us that the best way to improve people's positions in life was to reduce their salaries and their pensions.  The Minister, quite solemnly and seriously, told the Dáil that they did a good turn to the old age pensioners by cutting down their pensions in 1924, and that, as a matter of fact, if they were to accept this motion they would be injuring the old age pensioners, because taxation would be so much increased as a result that their last position would be worse than their first.  I hope that the Minister will extend that principle to the Government Departments, starting with himself.  When we hear all this talk, particularly from Deputy Alfred Byrne, of the fear that the taxation would hit the people in his constituency, who, according to himself, are the poorest in Ireland&mdash;the taxation would hit &ldquo;the poorest of the poor&rdquo;&mdash; would Deputy Alfred Byrne tell the House how much taxable commodities a person can buy on nine &ldquo;bob&rdquo; a week?  When Deputy Alfred Byrne accuses not only this Party, but accuses me personally, of trying to exploit the poor and the aged by putting down this motion, I might remind the House, and particularly the new members, that there is no member of this House ever <Col N="636" /> exploited the poor more than Deputy Alfred Byrne himself.  He even went to the extent of parading them outside and got crippled men into the Dáil to obtain political kudos for himself.</P>

Perhaps, there is some little connection between Deputy Byrne's attitude to-day and the fact that he was asked to preside at the big meeting which was held in O'Connell Street a short time ago.  Deputy Alfred Byrne should be the last person in this House, or outside of it, to speak of exploiting the poor.  There is no man in this House who has done it more successfully, so far, than Deputy Alfred Byrne.  Leaving the Deputy, and coming to the President, I usually listen to the President with a good deal of pleasure.  Notwithstanding what some people may think, I listened to the President with a good deal of pleasure yesterday.  I must say that he talked nonsense in the most delightful way.  I was inclined to say that there was no Deputy in this House who could talk nonsense so delightfully as the President until I listened to Deputy J.J. Byrne to-day and then I had to change my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one thing quite evident from the President's speech.  That was that he knew nothing whatever about the motion or amendment with the exception of a few notes he got from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, as he was going out. Therefore, he joked on everything, from Document No. 2 to the salaries of the national teachers and the Gárda Síochána.  When I had the temerity to make an interjection the President characterised it as senseless.  Those of us who know the President for the last <Col N="637" /> five or six years are aware that when something is said which the President does not like he always pretends to be intensely angry and indignant.  When the President reminded us that England had been making a lot of money out of this country for a number of years, I simply interjected that it was the first time I heard the President admit that, and that he did not make the statement in the discussions in this House on the London Pact.  It will be for the House to judge whether that interjection was a senseless one or not. It was at least as sensible as the answer the President gave us in the discussion with regard to Article 5, when he said that the only figure he had in his mind was a huge nought and that he got it. He did.  But with all the President's talk, and all the figures supplied by the Minister for Finance and all the confusing figures brought in by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, we cannot get away from the fact that what was given to the old and to the blind of this country by a foreign government&mdash;by the British Government&mdash;was filched from them by their own Government.  Nothing can get away from the fact that there is at least one section of the people in this country who have a perfect right to say that they were better off under the British Government than they are under an Irish Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this aspect of the question to the House: that under the Minister's amendment a person who should have some special concern for the Minister, the person who is thrifty and industrious, who buys Savings Certificates or puts whatever savings he has in the Post Office Savings Bank, is cutting a switch to beat himself, because those very savings will be brought against him when he comes to 70 years of age and applies for a pension.  The amount of his pension will depend on whether he was a waster or whether he was thrifty and industrious.  If he was thrifty and industrious he will get either no pension or a small pension, whereas if he was a waster, or an idler, he will get the full pension.  That is what the <Col N="638" /> Minister's amendment amounts to.  There can be no question about that.  Let Deputies face up to that fact and not try to get out of their responsibilities and to change their previous convictions by simply saying that we on these benches are trying to make political capital.  It seems to me that the only way you can make political capital is by doing something that the majority of the people of the country think you ought to do.  I contend that that is what we are here to carry out&mdash;the wishes of the majority of the people.  I contend&mdash;I defy contradiction from any member of the House&mdash;that it is the desire of the majority of the people that the old age pensioners should be put in at least as good position as they were when this State came into being. That is all the motion seeks.  All that has been said about political capital is all so much moonshine.  Listening to the Minister for Finance last night, I understood, for the first time, how he had enveloped the members of his Party in such a fog that they had agreed to support his amendment.  He read out, I presume for the Party meeting, the figures which he trotted out here last night.  I suppose, quite rightly, that they had faith in the Minister, that they took his statement for what it was worth, and that they believed, until they were disillusioned yesterday, when, I suppose, it was too late, that every old age pensioner was getting back the shilling.  I hope they see the difference now, and I hope Deputy Alfred Byrne will remember that in 1924 he referred to the Minister's Bill not as an Old Age Pensions Bill, but as an Old Age Punishment Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the only serious contribution to this debate from the Government Benches came from the Minister for Education.  I did not agree with what he said, but I congratulate the Minister for Education on the way in which he kept to the motion, and dealt with it.  As I have said, I do not agree with his arguments. I do not believe for one moment that this State would collapse if the old age pensioners got what is their due.  I do not believe for a moment that if it were necessary to increase taxation to meet this motion <Col N="639" /> the people of the country would not stand for it.  I believe they would.  I was asked yesterday if I would be prepared to advocate an increase of taxation, if it were necessary, in order to give effect to this motion.  I said then, unhesitatingly, and I say now, that I am prepared to do that and go before the country at any time.  I do not believe that there is any necessity whatever to increase taxation upon any of the necessaries of life in order to give effect to this motion.  If it is necessary to increase taxation at all, the taxation can be got from other things.  I have pointed out to the Minister that the proper place to find this money is where he put it, when he took it from the old age pensioners &mdash;the pockets of those who are fortunate enough to be able to pay income-tax. I hope the House will pass this motion.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Go n-ordóidh an Ceann Comhairle do Chléireach na Dála a Rit do thabhairt amach chun ball do thogha chun an fholúntais atá i nDáilcheanntar Bhuirge Bhaile Atha Cliath Thuaidh, folúntas a thárla toisc nár toghadh ach seachtar in ionad ochtair chun an Dáilcheanntar <Col N="643" /> san d'ionadú i nDáil Eireann ag an Toghachán Generálta a comóradh ar an 15adh lá de Mheán Fhomhair, 1927.</P>
    <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which exists in the Borough Constituency of Dublin North, caused by the fact that only seven persons instead of eight were elected to represent that Constituency in Dáil Eireann at the General Election held on the 15th day of September, 1927.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The circumstances leading to the tabling of this motion are well known to Deputies, as they are well known to the general public, and it is scarcely necessary for me to take up the time of the House by referring to them. The fact is that since the General Election of the 15th September last the constituency of Dublin North, which is entitled to eight members in this House, has had only seven representatives.  No person has claimed the eighth seat.  No steps have been taken, either by petition in the courts or otherwise, to remove the anomaly that exists.  That being so and the constituents of Dublin North being disfranchised to that extent, the Executive felt it incumbent on it to take legal advice with a view to removing the anomaly.  The Executive has been advised that the seat is vacant and that the proper and legal step which should be taken in order to give the people of that constituency the representation which they are entitled to in this House, is that a writ should be moved and that the electorate should be put in a position that they should be enabled to elect a person who will fill that eighth seat.  As I have said, the facts are well known, and so far as the law is concerned, I think it is very simple.  At the last General Election for the borough constituency of Dublin North, it transpired, subsequent to the election, that one of the persons returned by the Returning Officer as elected to serve in the Dáil for the constituency, was, upon the date of election, a person who had been, on the 21st November, 1924, duly adjudicated bankrupt in the High Court of Justice in Bankruptcy of Saorstát Eireann, <Col N="644" /> who had not since effected a settlement with his creditors through that Court or obtained his certificate of conformity, and was therefore an undischarged bankrupt.  He was, therefore, within the terms of the provisions of Section 51, sub-section (2), paragraph (c) of the Electoral Act of 1923, a person disqualified from being elected or sitting as a member of the Dáil.  The terms of that sub-section are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Each of the following persons shall be disqualified from being elected or sitting as a member of the Dáil, that is to say:&mdash;An undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>The gentleman involved was disqualified from being elected.  He was, therefore, from the legal point of view, not elected.  If every elector in the constituency had voted for him he could not have been elected, and therefore he was not elected.  The seat is vacant and the Executive is advised that the proper method of dealing with the position which has arisen is that a Writ should be moved in this House, and that the House should accept the motion which is tabled, and therefore enable the electorate to fill the vacancy that has arisen in the circumstances which I have described.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> From the time that I saw the motion of the Parliamentary Secretary on the Order Paper I began to wonder by what sleight of reasoning it was going to be urged, on behalf of the Executive, I take it, that only seven members were elected for the Borough Constituency of Dublin North.  As evidence to the contrary, we had our ears when we heard the Clerk on the 11th of October declare that there were eight members elected for the Constituency of Dublin North.  We have it on the official record what the Clerk said on that occasion.  He reported that: &ldquo;The following are the names of the persons returned to serve in the Dáil, together with the names of the Constituencies for which they have been elected.&rdquo;  And then in the section dealing with the Constituency of Dublin Borough North we have the following names returned: Alfred Byrne, John Joseph Byrne, Mrs. Margaret Collins-O'Driscoll, Eamon Cooney.  James Larkin, Patrick Leonard, Richard Mulcahy, Sean T. O'Kelly.</P>
    <P>There are eight names there and they are returned by the Clerk as having been duly elected; and the Returning Officer, who is Sub-Sheriff of Dublin, is known to most of us.  We think he is a competent officer and we believe that he did not return these members as having been duly elected without having very good reason to believe that they were duly elected.  Lest there would be any doubt about it, we have further evidence here in the proceedings of the Dáil, as set out under the Orders of the Ceann Comhairle himself.  In these proceedings we have the very same thing repeated.  Once more it sets forth: &ldquo;The following are the names of the persons returned to serve in the Dáil, together with the names of the constituencies for which they have been elected...&rdquo;  We find again on that return eight Deputies as having been elected.</P>
    <P>If there was a duty on the part of the Executive to question the election of one of the candidates, I imagine that that would be the proper time to do it.  If there was a vacancy because of the fact that one of those who were returned as elected was not in fact elected there was still no vacancy in <Col N="646" /> reality, because there was another candidate up.  If that other candidate who was returned as elected was not elected then the next person to him should have been elected.  In any case, we are being asked here, on the simple statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, to decide this question and to say now that there is in fact a vacancy in Dublin North, and the only reason given as to why we should come to that conclusion is that one of the members who was returned as elected has not come to claim his seat.  I do not know that any specific period is set down in law within which he has to claim his seat.  We have no assurance that he may not come to-morrow or the day after.  The fact that he could come to-morrow or the day after to claim his seat ends anything like the first reason anyhow given by the Parliamentary Secretary from having any weight with us.  It enables us to conclude nothing.  We are not going to conclude that there is a vacancy then because he did not turn up so far.  The other ground that is being given is that he is in fact a bankrupt.  I, for one, have no evidence that he is a bankrupt. I say no member in this House has any evidence on which he can come to the belief that he is a bankrupt.  We have simply the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary and I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary get up before any Court and expect to get judgment on such a statement, a simple, unsupported statement of his own? I contend that we have no evidence in this case on which, as a Court, we could decide, and I do not think we should be asked to decide this question without being treated as any Court should be treated.  And we are not a proper Court at all to decide it.  In law we would be acting ultra vires in attempting to decide it.  And even if we were not acting ultra vires in law, I believe this would be an improper Court to decide anything of the kind.  A Court ought to be in the position in which it could judge, with judicial detachment, a case put before it.  We do not pretend to be such a Court.  We decide questions here on certain party lines.</P>

      <P>My argument is that this is not the proper place to determine a question of this kind.  This means a party vote, and I, for one, have not seen sufficient detachment, on the other side anyway, to make me believe that we would have a judgment on this matter on its merits.  I think we ought not to put the members of the majority Party here to such a strain as to expect them to decide impartially in this case. I do not think that any of us ought to be asked to decide this question, because there is another place where it should be tried, and I hold, whatever chance there is for justice in such a place, that there is very little chance for getting justice here, considering the nature of the question.  I hold, first of all, that we have no evidence on which, as a court, we should decide this case, and even if there were evidence we are not the proper court, because the judicial impartiality which ought to be in a court, which would win respect for its decision, cannot be found here in a matter of this kind.  Why did not the Executive Council object to this when the Return was announced here?</P>

      <P>Why, if they were <Col N="648" /> such guardians of the rights of the constituency, as they pretend now to be, did they not do it then?  The reason, I suggest, is this: That then they would not have the extra vote that they hope to get now, that, if they did it then, they would in fact have to say who was the member elected if it was not Mr. Larkin.  I presume Mr. Larkin is the member they refer to.  They have not mentioned the name, but by a process of elimination I take it it is Mr. Larkin.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not tell us whose name it was.  I suggest that they then would have to say, if Mr. Larkin was not declared elected, that then, certainly, Mrs. Clarke should have been declared elected.  What is Proportional Representation for?  As the name indicates, it is to give proportional representation to the various sections of the community.  And for what is this election suggested now? In order to defeat the whole purpose of Proportional Representation.  They hope, by getting a by-election in this particular case, to get a seat that they were not entitled to by the votes at the last election.  If we must assume, for instance, that the votes given for Mr. Larkin were to be lost, they want not merely the votes given to Mr. Larkin should be lost, but that the votes given to the next person should be lost, and they want to get the seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold, from the way in which they have introduced this motion here, that this is conclusive proof to us that the members on the opposite side, the majority here, are not impartial, and that they cannot be the proper judges in a case of this kind.  Therefore I move the amendment in my name.  The effect of this is that we do not take upon ourselves here to determine the question.  Remember, that is the question. It might be regarded as ultra vires by the Electoral Act.  Certain English statutes are held to continue here.  By these statutes the English House of Commons has given away from itself in the past the right of considering these controverted elections and did it probably for the very same reason that I am suggesting here&mdash;that a Parliament consisting of parties, where party issues are at stake, and <Col N="649" /> where party issues and party considerations are involved in whether a certain person is or is not a member, made it evident that the House of Commons was not the place to try a case of that kind, and that, therefore, the proper place to try this was in a court of law.  We have repeatedly heard from the President how independent the courts are and how impartial they are.  Very well, then, they certainly would be less impartial than I ever thought they were, if they could not be more impartial than this House could possibly be in cases of this kind.  I therefore move my amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like at first to ask your ruling as to whether the motion that is before us is in order.  I want to raise a point of order in connection with it.  As has been pointed out already, the only official information which we have with regard to the matter of this election has been what was communicated to the Dáil officially by the Clerk the first day the Dáil met.  We have had no other official communication from you, sir.  Hitherto, when vacancies arose, either as the result of the death of a Deputy or imprisonment, you officially informed the Dáil of the vacancy, and thereafter the Government or somebody in the House moved for a writ in the usual way.  I hold that no vacancy does occur here until you officially inform the Dáil that there is a vacancy, and then will be the time to move for a writ.  I ask your ruling on that point.</P>

      <P>I take it that Deputy O'Connell's point of order, when divorced from a certain amount of argument on the motion, is that the motion cannot be moved until an announcement has been made by the Ceann Comhairle that a particular person elected to serve in the Dáil has been disqualified.  Is that so?</P>

      <P>The procedure is as Deputy O'Connell has stated it in the case of disqualification, but this motion is a motion for the issue of a writ, not on the grounds of disqualification, as the Deputy will notice, <Col N="650" /> but on the grounds that only seven, instead of eight, persons were elected. I am not concerned, as Ceann Comhairle, with whether or not the statement made on the motion can be sustained or will be adopted by the House.  That is a question, of course, for argument.  As far as I am concerned, the motion is in order, and as far as the point made by the Deputy is concerned, the Deputy is, I think, adverting to the procedure for disqualification of a member deemed to have been elected.  The motion attacks the matter at an earlier stage.</P>

It states: &ldquo;The following are the names of the persons returned to serve in the Dáil, together with the names of the constituencies for which they have been elected.&rdquo;  This is the return of persons to serve in the Dáil.  I am not concerned with any more than this.  When a person has been duly elected, if he becomes disqualified as the Deputy has suggested, the court in that case communicates, according to practice, with the Chairman of the Dáil, who announces the fact to the House.  In this case the writ is not being moved on the ground that the person mentioned is disqualified to sit.  It is being moved on the ground that, legally, he was <Col N="651" /> never elected, and the Ceann Comhairle is not in a position manifestly to give a decision on the point as to whether he was or was not legally elected, or as to whether he was, or was not, qualified to be elected.  Therefore, I could not decide the point of order without deciding the further point the motion puts to the House to decide.</P>

It is a common <Col N="652" /> form of motion&mdash;a motion on the assumption that certain facts are as stated.  It is not a motion for the solution of a legal problem.

How can we consider a motion of that description unless you in proper form are informed of the facts?  If there is a vacancy through death, presumably you will be made aware of it; if there is a vacancy arising out of a petition to disqualify a member, surely you have the writ of the court?  Here you are asked to assume that a vacancy exists, whereas, contrary to that, the facts themselves, the proper assumptions that could be placed upon the facts, are that there is no vacancy.  The names of eight people have been returned to serve in the Dáil.  I ask you to rule on this point.  If those eight names have been returned to you, is that not a proof that those eight people were duly elected?  If the eight names have been returned to you as duly qualified to serve in the Dáil, is not that prima facie proof that these eight have been duly elected?</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee's point of order was simply in the same terms as the speech of Deputy de Valera on the amendment.  It was quite a relevant speech.  Deputy MacEntee's point of order was simply setting forth the same points.  Deputies are perfectly entitled to discuss the amendment and the motion, but arguments for or against the amendment or the motion do not constitute points of order, and it is not for the Ceann Comhairle to decide, and it <Col N="653" /> would be impossible for the Ceann Comhairle to answer, the alleged points of order that have been put to him without making his view upon the whole question clear.  He could not do that without entering into the merits of the motion and the amendment. This House is not in a position, by motion, to settle a legal question, and when the House has passed this motion, if it does pass this motion, if there are any legal rights of any individual at stake, that individual will still have the legal rights he has now. Neither this motion nor any other motion can take away from any person's legal rights.  The courts will not take cognisance of a motion of the Dáil unless in cases where they are coerced to do so by the Constitution or the ordinary law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the first and principal argument that emanated from the Parliamentary Secretary and it is the first time that it has been put forward for declaring a seat vacant. The real question at issue is whether there has been a valid election in this case.  We are asked to decide that, and nobody knows better than the Parliamentary Secretary and Ministers that this is not the kind of court that ought to be asked to decide that.  We are asked to declare the issue of a Writ for a new election.  Therefore we are definitely asked to decide whether or not there is a vacancy.  Somebody said that we were not asked to decide that.  The terms of the motion definitely asks us to decide that a vacancy exists in North Dublin City.  We have the whole machinery of the electoral law and we are the people who are asked to decide what is clearly and definitely a legal question.  Most of us are lay members <Col N="656" /> and we are asked to decide what is clearly a matter for the courts to decide. The machinery for an election, as ordinary persons understand it, provides for a Writ being first issued by the Clerk of the Dáil, then sent to the Sheriff or Sub-Sheriff, who holds an election and he, after the usual procedure has been gone through, declares that certain people are elected to serve in the Dáil.  That has been done.  The Sheriff has made that declaration, and that declaration has been announced to the Dáil.  Until the courts have declared otherwise, I hold that the Returning Officer's certificate is conclusive evidence as to who has been elected to the Dáil.  Deputy de Valera has said that this was to be decided by a Party vote. There I do not agree with him.  I am not looking at this matter from any Party point of view whatever.  We have no concern with the person elected.  We are not in any way concerned with his interests.  What we are concerned with are precedents which are set up in this Dáil.</P>

      <P>It may be, but if that is so you are not entitled to put it into the Act.  If what I have stated is correct, then there is not only one, but eight vacancies in North Dublin. Surely if we are going to have the position adumbrated by the Parliamentary Secretary it opens up a vista of all sorts of abuses in elections hereafter. It would be quite easy to have people nominated and elected, and a vacancy declared later when it would be easy for the Party with the majority to have one of their representatives elected.  It is not in any spirit of hostility to the Ministers or the Government I am opposing the motion.  I ask them seriously to reconsider the matter.  They tell us they have the best possible advice, but we have not heard anything further as to the nature of that advice. I think it is not in the interests of this Parliament that a precedent of this kind should be set up, whereby on the mere statement of a Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else who is as well entitled to move a motion of this kind as the Parliamentary Secretary, <Col N="658" /> the Dáil would declare a seat vacant. That is a wrong precedent to set up, and I hope the House will not do so.</P>

      <P>We have before us for discussion a substantive motion and an amendment to that motion.  The amendment was moved by Deputy de Valera, and in the course of his speech he did not say one single word in favour of his amendment. He did not adduce one single argument in favour of it.  He attacked the substantive proposition, but the amendment he left severely alone, and it appears to me he did so because he had never gone to the trouble to think out what was the meaning of his amendment, or how that amendment, if carried, was going to be put into active operation.  Deputy de Valera's amendment, I take it, meant something, probably not something thought out, not something thought to a finish, but some vague idea floating through Deputy de Valera's mind.  He uses the words &ldquo;to be postponed.&rdquo; Postponed to what? Postponed until the decision of a court has been taken.  Therefore, Deputy de Valera has visualised the possibility of a decision of the court upon this matter. Would Deputy de Valera inform the House, if he has worked out the rounded circle of his thoughts, what is to be the nature of these proceedings? What is the court?</P>

      <P>I am delighted at the intervention, because it shows the Deputy has not done what we have done.  We have thought the matter out fully, and we have come to the conclusion that there is no form of action by which this matter can be decided in the courts.  If the Deputy <Col N="659" /> will inform the House what is the cause of action which he says can be tested, I am sure everyone will be greatly obliged to him.  Will the Deputy inform the House who is to be the plaintiff, what is the court, and what does he mean precisely by the certificate of a court?  I would like to know from him the form of procedure to be adopted. What is the endorsement on the writ to be?  What sort of procedure is to be adopted, or has the Deputy ever thought of that at all.  I venture to think not.  Certainly we are advised that, as soon as the time for the bringing of an election petition had passed, then there was no way by which this matter could be tested in the Courts unless possibly the gentleman in question, Mr. Larkin, might have brought a declaration in the court, if he had a right and it had been refused, which it had never been.  Mr. Larkin's rights, if he has any rights, are still open in the courts, but nobody can question now in the courts this particular issue which is before the House as to whether seven or eight people have been elected.</P>

      <P>I heard a great deal that if a petition had been brought that a certain person who stood in the interests of Fianna Fáil would have been elected.  That person did not bring a petition.  No one brought a petition and the time has lapsed.  Now, the question that the Dáil has to decide is whether the Dáil is going to sit as a full House or with one short.  I entirely agree with Deputy O'Connell.  I am in entire agreement with him in a good deal that he said in his speech: that this is a matter of precedent, that this is to decide the rights of this Chamber, and that these rights should not be lightly frittered away: that this Chamber, which is one of the principal members of the Oireachtas to which sovereign power has been given, must be very careful to safeguard its own rights and its own inherent privileges.  Both Deputy de Valera and Deputy O'Connell said that the House was asked to decide this question upon the mere statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that the gentleman in question, Mr. James <Col N="660" /> Larkin, had been declared a bankrupt. This motion has been upon the notice paper for a considerable period of time, and it was open to every Deputy who had any doubt about the question to investigate the bankruptcy files if he felt so inclined.  If any Deputy was doubtful about the fact that Mr. Larkin at the time of his nomination&mdash; that is a matter with which I will deal in a moment, but it is not important&mdash; at the time at which the Returning Officer declared him elected for the city of Dublin, was in fact a bankrupt, if anyone had been doubtful about that he could have investigated the matter for himself and looked over the bankruptcy files.  If there is any doubt in Deputy O'Connell's mind, or in the mind of Deputy de Valera, I have actually here in my own hand a declaration under the seal of the Court of Bankruptcy, which is by statute evidence everywhere, that on the 7th October, 1927, Mr. James Larkin was in fact a bankrupt.</P>

      <P>I hope, a Chinn-Comhairle, I will not offend against your ruling again.  I will ask no more questions, rhetorical or otherwise.  I hold in my hand, however, at the moment a document under the seal of the Court of Bankruptcy in Ireland. showing that on the 7th October, 1927, this Larkin, James, who was a candidate for North City Dublin, was duly declared a bankrupt.  Deputy O'Connell dealt with one question.  He said that this Mr. James Larkin, who was seeking to be elected as a Deputy, should not have been nominated at all, or else that he was validly elected. That, at least, was as far as I could follow the Deputy's argument.</P>

      <P>I think that when the Deputy peruses the Electoral Act he will see that that conclusion does not follow.  He will find that, I think, if he looks at Section 51, sub-sections (1) and (2), of the Act. The Deputy said that this might require a court to decide it, that it was a matter of law and that laymen should not be called upon to decide matters of law.  Again I am in entire agreement with the Deputy.  As far as possible, laymen should not be called upon to interpret the law, and even the lawmakers, like Deputy O'Connell, should not be called upon to interpret the law that they themselves have made.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was, as a matter of fact, a member of the House which passed this particular Act.  Of that I do not say anything, but I do say this much: the Deputy has a competent knowledge of the English language, and a simpler sentence to interpret could not be put in a form of writing, whether it be a work of literature or an Act of the Oireachtas. I do not think that the Deputy, or any other Deputy, will have the slightest difficulty in interpreting Section 51 of the Act, which says:</P>
      <P>Every citizen of Saorstát Eireann, without distinction of sex, who is of full age and is not subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in this section, shall be eligible to be elected and subject to taking the Oath prescribed by the Constitution of Dáil Eireann to sit as a member of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2), which is the important sub-section, says:</P>
      <P>Each of the following persons shall be disqualified from being elected or sitting as a member of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There are two things.  There are certain categories of people who are prohibited from being elected or from sitting.  They are two different things. They cannot be elected and they cannot sit.  The first two categories I need not quote in the Section, but the third, sub-section (c), is the one which governs this case:</P>
      <P>An undischarged bankrupt under adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>Here you have a gentleman nominated, correctly nominated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Correctly nominated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because between nomination and election he might&mdash;the word here is &ldquo;election&rdquo;&mdash;have paid off his debts in full, and been discharged.  That is a conceivable state of events.  There was nothing to stop it.  All he had to do was to pay his debts and therefore he could have been nominated correctly. There is nothing in the statute which <Col N="663" /> says he shall not be nominated.  It says he shall not be elected, but I do not think it requires any great knowledge of law, or anything except a simple knowledge of the ordinary usage of ordinary terms in the English language, to realise that when you say a man is incapable of being elected, it means that he simply cannot be elected, and that in consequence his election is void.  He is a person incapable of being elected. From the point of view of the election law, he has practically no existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>But he is nominated and gets votes, and takes them from other people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt he is nominated and gets votes, but he is incapable of being elected. The Deputy may think that the law should be that no undischarged bankrupt shall be nominated.  That is not what is laid down.  What is laid down is, that he shall not be elected and being ineligible to be elected it seems to me to be as clear as daylight&mdash;he who runs may read&mdash;that not being capable of being elected he could not be elected and he was not elected.  What is the result?  The result is that there are only seven persons now representing North Dublin City.  A great point was made here of the fact that a return was made by the Returning Officer saying that eight people were returned.  If Deputies read Section 27, sub-section (1) which is the very sub-section which Deputy de Valera alludes to in his amendment, they would find that the duty of the Returning Officer is to see, in the first place, that the nomination papers are valid, and secondly to count the votes.  The Returning Officer counts the votes and sends to the Clerk the names of those persons who have received the maximum number of votes entitling them, if not otherwise disqualified&mdash;which is a matter he does not go into&mdash;to represent that particular constituency.  He does not decide any question of validity except the question of the validity of individual ballot papers.  He decides that and on that he is final until his decision is set aside on an election petition, but he decides nothing else.  He simply counts the votes and he sends on the result of his <Col N="664" /> count to the Clerk and the Clerk announces it to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As I said a short time ago I agree with Deputy O'Connell that this is a question of Parliamentary privilege, a question of the privilege, power and importance of this Chamber of which we are members.  If we are powerless to regulate our own procedure, if we say that to the world, if we fling away our own authority and the dignity of this Chamber, if we say that this Chamber can decide nothing&mdash;this Chamber the most important Chamber in the State&mdash; this Chamber which for practical purposes exercises sovereign power in this State&mdash;if we who have been sent here as delegates by the people are to fling aside the powers which are inherent in this State, or are to decline the powers which are inherent in this assembly, if we are to say that we can do nothing, that we have no powers to decide as to whether there is or is not a vacancy in this House, if we are to have no control over the members of the House, if we are to have no control over the proceedings of this House, then we have done our best to reduce this Chamber and the Oireachtas to contempt.  We have exactly the same power to declare that there is a vacancy in a Parliamentary constituency which we know in fact exists, as we have over other proceedings in this House.  We have exactly the same power as we had to make Standing Orders for the rule and regulation of the proceedings in this House.  Our powers are delegated to us by the people.  They are inherent in us.  The Oireachtas, except in so far as its powers are confined and limited by the Constitution, has sovereign power in this State, and Deputies, if they were to reject this motion upon the ground that it was ultra vires, would take away from the dignity of this assembly and they would destroy the heritage which they ought to bequeath to their successors on these benches.</P>

      <P>With the concluding portion of the Minister's speech I must say that I am not in agreement.  If I may respectfully say so, the Minister seems to have got beyond his brief.  The Minister has stated that we have the power in this House to decide whether there is a vacancy <Col N="665" /> or not.  With respect to him, that is not even what we are asked to do by the motion that he is asking us to pass. That motion assumes that there is a vacancy, and all his arguments have gone to support that assumption.  We have never been asked, even by this motion, to decide the question as to whether there is a vacancy or not. With respect, I submit that the question as to whether there is a vacancy or not depends upon the existing law. Therefore, I think the Minister has perhaps overstepped the mark in that respect. What is his case?  As far as I can gather, it is that this person was never eligible for election and that there was no election.</P>

He asked what, I think, must really have been a rhetorical question.  What court is now to decide whether there was a vacancy or not?  Of course, when he asked this question, he knew as well as I do that the time has gone by to ask a court to decide that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>The question that I put to the Minister and the Government is this.  If they are now anxious to take this exceptional and unusual course, why did they not take a petition during the period laid down for it and have it declared, in a proper way, by a legally-constituted tribunal, that there was a vacancy and that only seven and not eight people had been elected for the constituency of North Dublin.  That is my point.  I complain about what I may describe as the exceedingly irregular form of this procedure. It should not be adopted and followed hereafter.  On the face of it, it looks extraordinary that the Government should come down to the House, long after the time has lapsed for <Col N="666" /> taking proceedings in accordance with the ordinary law, and declare that a certain state of affairs exists which they should have had declared in a proper way, according to the existing law by a proper tribunal.  Supposing that a vacancy does exist&mdash;that is the assumption that we are asked, as stated by the Ceann Comhairle, to pass this motion on.  The names of the eight Deputies were read out by the Clerk as having been elected to serve in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. As having been returned to serve in the Dáil, as elected for the constituency. Now, that being so, the only official cognisance that this House has got of the state of affairs is in the official records.  Therefore, I submit that the onus of displacing these records rests entirely upon the Government, who seek to show that these eight were not duly elected.  Have they discharged that onus?  That is the question that we have to put ourselves this afternoon. As far as I understand Parliamentary procedure, the only evidence&mdash;I think this is largely a question of evidence and not of law&mdash;that this Dáil can take into consideration is the evidence brought before it through the proper channels and in the proper way.  I should have considered that the proper manner to have adduced evidence of the identity as well as the bankruptcy of this Mr. James Larkin would have been through the Ceann Comhairle.  I suggest that at least an order or certificate should have been produced by the Ceann Comhairle from the Bankruptcy Judge, and in that way have officially informed this House that this person was at the time of election a bankrupt. Then there would be no question&mdash;as there is not now a question&mdash;for us to decide as to whether there is a vacancy or not, because if that had been so Mr. James Larkin would never have been elected.</P>

But when communications are made to this House and are brought forward by way of official documents, they should be made through the Ceann Comhairle.  I am glad in this instance they have been so made.  Let me briefly state what I believe the question is for us to decide. I do not believe for a moment that we are asked to decide&mdash;with all respect to my learned friend, the Minister for Justice, I do not believe that we should have or would have the power to decide &mdash;whether or not there is a vacancy in any constituency in this country.

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Byrne has very kindly anticipated me by saying that that is all we are asked to do.  The amendment in the name of Deputy de Valera suggests that this motion should be postponed until such time as the certificate of a competent court is received by the Clerk of the Dáil declaring that a vacancy does, in fact, exist.  With the terms of that amendment I am not in agreement.  I am in favour of the postponement of a motion such as this until a certificate of a competent court is received by either the Ceann Comhairle or the Clerk of the Dáil declaring, not that a vacancy does, in fact, exist, but that a state of affairs exists which, in law as at present in force in this country, means that a vacancy does exist.  That is the position as far as I understand it. It might be well if Ministers would consider the possibility of an alteration of the law in respect of the position of the Under-Sheriff and similar officials.  The Under-Sheriff was not responsible.  He was not the proper judicial authority to say whether this person was eligible for election or not.  I do not know whether or not it would be wise to make him so responsible.  At any rate, the question is worth consideration and investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My complaint is not so much that the law should take its course and that a person who was not eligible for election should be so regarded, but that those responsible for this motion did not take the steps they should and could have taken within the time laid down&mdash;that they did not lodge a petition and have a decision by the courts that seven, and not eight, members were returned for the constituency in question.  I think it is regrettable that such a motion as this should have to be brought forward.  It is a bad precedent. It is a matter that should be guarded against in the future.  I, for one, distinctly blame the Government for not taking the ordinary course and lodging a petition within the time limited, instead of asking the House <Col N="669" /> now to take a course which should be repugnant to it and which is not in the ordinary way of Parliamentary procedure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Duggan, in moving the motion which stands in his name, and the Minister for Justice in supporting it, submitted certain arguments in favour of the motion and in favour of its passing by the Dáil.  I submit that those arguments are of no importance.  I submit that they do not matter one iota, that the important matter before the Dáil is not the arguments advanced in support of the motion, but the motion itself.  The motion itself will be on the records of this House long after the arguments advanced in favour of it are forgotten. The motion itself will establish a precedent upon which this Executive or some succeeding Executive may take similar action in other cases in the future.  I suggest&mdash;I believe it will be admitted as a fact&mdash;that the only reason why any arguments are being put forward in favour of this motion is because the Government Party has not a majority in the House, and in order to secure the passing of the motion the Government must convince a certain number of other Deputies of the wisdom of their proceeding.  If they had a clear majority of the House, if they were independent of criticism from the Opposition Benches, they need advance no argument whatsoever. They could merely introduce the motion and steam-roll it through the Dáil, declaring a vacancy in the Borough Constituency of Dublin North.  I submit that the motion, as it is worded, can be passed at any time in relation to any person and in relation to any constituency.  Any Party with a cast-iron majority in this House could, by introducing and carrying a motion of that nature, disqualify any member they chose.</P>

      <P>Everything was done in a manner which indicated that the Government knew quite well that eight persons had been elected.  In the cloakroom of this House, where I hang my hat and coat, there is a peg next to mine inscribed &ldquo;Mr. James Larkin,&rdquo; which indicates that he was expected to hang his hat there some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not merely could this motion be passed in relation to any person, and in relation to any constituency, but I submit that there is nothing on the face of the motion which indicates that it has any relation to Mr. James Larkin at all.  Mr. Larkin's name was not mentioned by the Deputy who proposed the motion.  If that motion is passed to-day it is quite possible we will find to-morrow that Deputy J.J. Byrne will be disqualified.  I think it would be too much to hope for that, but if the Government would give any indication that that is their intention, I think they would carry their motion unanimously.  But although we can treat the matter humorously when Deputy Byrne's name is mentioned in relation to it, nevertheless the matter that the House must take into consideration is that if that motion is passed Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, Deputy Alfred Byrne, or the Minister for Local Government might be stopped at the door of this House to-morrow by <Col N="672" /> an usher and told that he could not enter because his seat has been declared vacant.  The Ceann Comhairle, when that point of order was mentioned, stated that the passing of this motion would not deprive Mr. James Larkin of any rights which he now exercises; and if Mr. James Larkin is legally a member of this House, then it is quite conceivable that we will have nine members from Dublin City North sitting here in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I think that the case which has been put forward in support of this motion is one which is based purely and simply on expediency.  Deputies over there know, or think they know, that Mr. Larkin should not have been elected, but the fact remains that Mr. Larkin was nominated, his nomination was accepted by the returning officer, he went before the people, and more than 7,000 people voted for him.  All these people know as much about Mr. Larkin as the eight demi-gods who sit on the Front Bench opposite can claim to know, and if this House has any respect for its rights, and has any respect for its privileges, we suggest that the manner in which a case of this nature should be dealt with is that indicated in the amendment and not in the motion.  The precedent which would be established by the motion is a dangerous one, and one which might possibly be availed of by some unscrupulous Executive in the future to disqualify an opponent for whose removal they were particularly anxious. It could be done.  I think that any person with an ordinary knowledge of English who reads the motion, who forgets the arguments that were advanced in support of it, and who thinks of the motion alone, will have to admit that that is so, and certainly a future Ceann Comhairle would have difficulty in ruling such a motion out of order if it was introduced in relation even to a Deputy who had actually taken his seat in the House.  In face of these circumstances I think that Deputies, and particularly independent Deputies, and Deputies who are in opposition, in view of their vulnerable position, should be the first to stand up, oppose this motion and reject it.</P>

      <P>Mr. Larkin has had many advocates, at one time or another, but the last advocate he had, in the shape of Deputy Redmond, was perhaps the strangest advocate he ever had.  So far driven was he to find a defence for him that he has told the House that he is not satisfied as to his identity, and because he is not satisfied as to his identity he is not prepared to vote for this motion.  If ever there was a motion which has been side-tracked, or which it has been attempted to sidetrack, it is this one.  The matter is really a simple one, unless we go out of our way to decide it.  You have been told time and time again during this debate that eight members were elected, but it is as clear as there is a roof over us that only seven members were elected.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite right in his interruption, but even with that document before him he will not take the trouble to read it correctly.  What that document informs him is that there were eight members returned as elected, but in fact there were only seven members elected.  Deputy after Deputy has been reading that document, which is as simple as can be, which tells you that the returning officer, who discharges no official duties, returned eight members as elected.  Then we are told that we should produce a certificate from the courts.  The certificate has been produced from the only court that has jurisdiction in the matter. That certificate shows, under the seal of the court, that at the date of the so-called election one candidate was not fit to be elected and could not be elected; it shows that so far as that <Col N="674" /> candidate was concerned he was not elected and could not be elected.  The position is exactly the same as this: supposing the name of a fictitious candidate were put up, are we to be told that for all time&mdash;because we could not very well bring an election petition against a fictitious candidate, having nobody to name as respondent&mdash;the name of that candidate is to remain as being elected?</P>

      <P>We have been told that the Dáil is not an impartial tribunal, that we are not impartial judges, that we cannot decide this question. There is no question to decide. We have got a certificate from a court of competent jurisdiction that a man who was declared elected had not, in fact, been elected.  From that certificate there runs the statutory consequence that seven members were elected or, accepting for a moment that the eighth man was declared elected, he was not elected; there were only seven elected.  Consequently a vacancy arises, and so far as I can see, the only course open to anybody is that suggested in the motion.  There is no other course. We have been told that we should go to court, that a petition should have been brought.  By whom?  It was open to any elector to bring a petition if he wished.  No elector did so, but because no elector brought a petition, is it suggested that the Government, at the public expense, should take the necessary steps to declare the candidate disqualified? Seven members only were elected, and if you take seven from eight you find one remaining&mdash;one remaining seat to be filled, and, as I understand it, the motion is to fill that seat, regardless of who is entitled to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">

      <P>I suggest that the alternative course and the proper course to take, if the amendment is not the proper course, is to declare the <Col N="675" /> eight members who were properly elected.  According to the Act, a bankrupt is incapable of being elected. Therefore, he was not elected.  If he was not elected, the law lays it down that there are eight people elected. Therefore there must have been eight people elected at that election, and all that has happened is that a mistake has been made in this House.  Whether the mistake is the sheriff's mistake or the mistake of the officers of this House is merely a matter of detail.  The important thing is that a mistake has been made.  If the plea of laches is made, that certain people have neglected to do things they ought to have done, I submit that every Party in this House is estopped from proceeding in this matter; we are on all sides prevented from taking a petition, and there is no machinery in this House for dealing with the matter at all.  Therefore, we are either placed in the position of leaving the seat vacant or, on the other hand, correcting the mistake that was made by this House.  Now there appears to be evidence, irregularly produced in this House, not in an impartial manner, by the Chairman but by a member of a Party, and I submit that that is a grossly irregular procedure. We are asked by one Party to do something which is doubtful law. We are frankly told it is doubtful law, that an action may be taken against us for doing it, and that we may lose that action.  Is that a proper procedure for a Government to take?  If it is doubtful we cannot do it.  There is the difficult question of identity.  There is no evidence to show that this James Larkin is a bankrupt.  I understand there were two James Larkins up for election, and there is no evidence before the House to show which of the two James Larkins is concerned here. I put that forward seriously as a lawyer.  I say that we must have evidence to show that the James Larkin mentioned in the document produced irregularly from one side of the House is the James Larkin who is a bankrupt. So that on three or four counts we are called upon to do doubtful things on doubtful evidence.  I submit that the way of registering our objection to the course indicated by the Government, <Col N="676" /> and the only way open to us, this evening, is to vote for the amendment and not for the resolution.</P>

      <P>Laymen are called on to contemplate, I hope with a great deal of enlightenment, certainly with a great deal of entertainment, lawyers talking law to them.  Deputy Wolfe told us that there were only seven elected. Then he told us that there were only seven elected, and he then told us that if we did not believe it he would say it again.  That was the whole of the argument of Deputy Wolfe&mdash;&ldquo;I said it, I am saying it again, and I will keep on saying it until you believe it.&rdquo; That may be law; it is not argument in a body of laymen. It seems to me that we have on the records of the House, in a manner which would seem to be authoritative amongst laymen a prima facie case that James Larkin is a member of this House.  That is the way it seems to me as a layman. We have offered to us a motion which assumes that that prima facie case is wrong.  That motion has been ruled in order and therefore it is in order.  We have been told by the Ceann Comhairle that if this House passes this motion it makes no difference whatever in law.  I am glad to hear that.  Therefore, in fact if what we agree to, when we pass this motion, is wrong in law, we will carry on another election in which the candidate will be void, and in which there will be two candidates, possibly the same member in two capacities, because the same man may be re-elected, and there will be nothing to decide the question as to who is the member.  It is declared to be an open question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic issue which is raised tonight is an issue which has been raised many times and in many different ways by this House&mdash;the right of this House to interpret the law of this land.  That is what we as laymen claim to do.  We are offered the opinion of law officers who within the knowledge of every single member of this House have treated with scant respect the considered opinions of judges, expressed in a form in which they would be authoritative amongst laymen.  It is on the authority of such law officers that we are asked now to disregard the election of this man.  I am leaving out Deputy Wolfe. <Col N="677" /> The Minister for Justice has picked up the Act, he has read the clauses, and has told us that it is as plain as a man can read.  That is the same authority that told us that a considered judgment, in a form in which it was authoritative amongst laymen, delivered by a High Court Judge, was a matter of no importance whatever.  We laymen have been asked to interpret this law because it is so plain.</P>
    <P>There was a precedent for that, the famous precedent of the Workmen's Compensation Act in England.  When Mr. Joseph Chamberlain was asked what it was about, and what it meant, he said: &ldquo;It is perfectly simple: any Unionist election agent will tell you what it means.&rdquo; The same philosophy. Any Party majority will tell you what it means.  Any Party majority will tell you what any Act of this Parliament apparently will mean.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Justice is not here, because I want to say something which I would like him to hear. I understand we are going to lose him, that he is going to carry the traditions and eloquence of this House to another and a great land, and I am glad to know that we are sending in his person a typical example of the old style of eloquence, which is not professed, I think, by any other member of this House except my esteemed colleague from Cork, Deputy Timothy Sheehy. We had, for the first time in my experience of this House, a revival of the peroration, the peroration that lasted three-quarters of the time.  Apart from telling, just as every lawyer would, that it was so plain that you must understand it, and that if you did not understand it he would tell it to you over and over again until you believed him, the rest was the peroration&mdash; whether or not in failing to claim for this House an authority which possibly this House did not possess&mdash;because that is the issue&mdash;in failing to claim that we had here, by the right of a Party majority, the power to decide things which possibly we have not at all, we were degrading and throwing away the sovereign traditions of this glorious and sovereign Parliament. That is not the issue.  The issue is that we have an Electoral Act of 1923 which is so utterly and so incompetently <Col N="678" /> drawn that there is no remedy in it, no remedy for any possible complication, difficulty or misunderstanding which can possibly arise in an election by electors.  That is the issue, not whether we are going to degrade this House by failing to claim for it powers which, possibly, it does not possess, but, whether or not, this House when it could steamroll things through, did steamroll things through so badly that they would be a disgrace, apparently, to any House.</P>
    <P>In the last election there were a series of complications.  There was one in Limerick, and there were two or three more.  I do not particularly want to go into details.  One thing that was admitted on all sides was that, whatever the complication was, there was no remedy for it.  We are told that in this case there is no court to decide anything.  Whatever happens under the electoral law, according to the interpretation of the gentleman opposite, is to be decided by a Party majority here.  I say that is a disgraceful proceeding.  I say it cannot be true. I say that these people cannot have spent five years here learning to legislate without learning something about how to legislate, and that they cannot possibly have passed through this House an Act so utterly incompetent to do all the things that the Act ought to have done.  For the honour and reputation of those who have occupied those Benches for the last five years, and as a tribute, no doubt deserved, to the knowledge and wisdom, the insight and the foresight of every one of those men, you must say that there must be some remedy outside a Party majority for deciding questions of whether or not men are properly elected to this House.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to Carlow-Kilkenny but to North Dublin, and I have observed the way in which Deputies on the far side contemplate an election.  The admission is that it is going to be a gain for the Government. That is their attitude; it is the one pleasurable party item that I got from the debate.  Why should not this House decide the matter?  It is the question of the filling up of a vacancy. That, by implication, must mean that the House must decide there is a vacancy. It is for the House to decide that, and I agree with what Deputy Wolfe said and what Deputy Redmond ended by saying, that there are not, as Deputy O'Connell seemed to imagine, points of law at issue.  There are certain facts. The law does come in to a certain extent, but the law is so simple that even a layman like Deputy Flinn could be expected to understand it.  What is the point of law?  It is the point read out by the Minister for Justice.  Section 51 &mdash;a particular sub-section of it&mdash;sets out that &ldquo;Each of the following persons shall be disqualified from being elected.&rdquo; and one of the persons is an undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann.  If it be decided that a person named James Larkin was an undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann, then it follows as surely as the night follows the day that James Larkin could not have been elected to this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot distinguish between a point of fact and a point of law.  I am speaking of law in its application.  There may be a point of fact to be decided.  The Deputy spoke of the identification of the man.  One point of fact is identification, and there may be another point of fact.  Was this man adjudicated a <Col N="681" /> bankrupt, and is he still a bankrupt? If the House decides in full session that it is not competent to determine that, or it is not the proper way to do it, then let the House determine other means. It is a very simple matter.  Documents can be produced from official custody, documents which show that this man definitely is a bankrupt.  I ask the House to agree with me that once two points of fact are decided, that the point of law is a very simple matter. That is to say, if we agree that that person was adjudged a bankrupt and was still a bankrupt on the night of the election, that he was incapable of being elected a member of this House. If that is agreed to, then there is a vacancy.  That is a simple case.</P>
      <P>Attempts have been made to cloud the issue by bringing in other matters. We are told we had in this House an authoritative statement that so and so was returned to serve as a Deputy for a constituency, or a constituency was given for which he was elected.  Does the House mean to say that they are going to accept the return of the Returning Officer as a judgment?  We had Deputy Lemass's valuable point that James Larkin has a peg for his hat and coat somewhere near the Deputy's.  So the judgment of the Returning Officer having been authenticated by the carpenter who put up the peg, or the usher who looks after the department, is going to be accepted as a statement contrary to clear law that James Larkin is, or ever could have been, a member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Returning Officer may in good faith have returned him; the Clerk of this House may have read out correctly and accurately the names returned to him by the Returning Officer.  That is not a proof or any justification against the law of James Larkin becoming a member of this House.  He was incapable on the night of the election of being elected a member of this House and that still runs.  The second point brought in and the point to which some attention has been paid is the matter of time, and why this action has been postponed and why when there were proper means of determining this question it was not determined in proper time.  We are establishing precedents here and we are establishing <Col N="682" /> what, I think, is a very valuable precedent, that the laws made by this House governing the return of members to this House are not to be flouted by people who go up for election and are declared elected mistakenly. We must end that attempt to get over what this House has declared to be the law.  Who should have moved in the early days after the election? An aggrieved person or the disappointed candidate, or the candidate lower on the list?  If the candidate lower on the list did not decide to go on but declared that James Larkin was not elected, then an elector in the North Dublin Constituency could have brought a petition.  But was it the Government's duty within 21 days after the election to make up its mind and go forward with the petition? Would not the clamour that we have heard of the Government claiming by such action to get an extra seat&mdash; would not that have been redoubled if within 21 days this Government had decided to petition the courts in the matter of the return of James Larkin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the law on that subject, but I am informed on very good authority that it would not have meant the recounting of votes, because the votes cast for Mr. Larkin were properly cast.  It was for either of the disappointed candidates at the election or for any elector in the North Dublin Constituency to bring it up by way of petition.  It was not a matter for the Government.  The Government in fact had postponed its decision, had postponed taking action until the people who had a better right than they had, failed to take the proper <Col N="683" /> steps.  We are now faced with the position clearly that if two points of fact can be established there is a vacancy in North Dublin and I think the implication of the amendment is that once it is declared there is a vacancy, the proper way of filling it is by the issue of a writ, so that it seems to me we have only two points to decide, some way of identifying this gentleman and some way of proving was he on the night of the election an undischarged bankrupt. If the House does not think that there is evidence here on these two points, let us hear in what way the House wants evidence brought to its notice and what evidence it will take on either of these two points.  I say in regard to one point that there is quite satisfactory evidence.  There is a certificate from the Registar of the High Court of Bankruptcy that James Larkin had been adjudged a bankrupt on a particular date and that on the night of the election he was still an undischarged bankrupt.  If it is thought that that document is not produced in a proper way then let us retrace the ground.  It is right that this thing should be done in a proper way.  Let us get segregated the points upon which people have doubts.  Is there any doubt about the law?  If this man was an undischarged bankrupt is it not as clear as anything can be that on the night of the election he was incapable of being elected?  It is now a matter of determining the two facts.  If that is the case what is the House's will with regard to the determination of the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While saying that let me say this further&mdash;one way that can be adopted is the way of the amendment.  Deputy de Valera was asked did he, when putting down the amendment, envisage the procedure.  He said no, that was for the people who put down the motion to decide.  In other words the people who have made up their minds as to a certain course of procedure are supposed to determine for the man who objects to that course of procedure what the procedure should be.  The Deputy carefully evaded it and nobody on that side of the House has answered the question &mdash;what court is to decide it?  Or what is the approach to the court?  What is the proper writ and what is the proper <Col N="684" /> form in which one will go to a judge? When these things have been looked into, there is no way of approach to any court in this country on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy made any suggestion of value?  There must be somebody oscillating on the Deputy's Bench, because I cannot hear him.  There is, at any rate, one thing that the House should not commit itself to, and that is an amendment to decide that we should postpone filling a vacancy until we get a certificate of a competent court declaring that the vacancy does exist.  If there is an approach to the court at all it is possibly the best way to go about this whole matter.  Let those who say there is an approach at all say what is the proper procedure and what steps should be taken, to whom does one apply, and what does one hope to get from the court?  When that is put up, that question can be examined, but as we are advised, there is not now any approach to any court by this House on this matter.  There is an approach to the court in another way.  There is the man who may think himself aggrieved by this motion.  Mr. Larkin may believe he was elected.  If Mr. Larkin believes that or if he believed it in the past, it was his duty then and now to present himself for admission to this House.  What the Ceann Comhairle will do in that event, I do not know. If he keeps him out, Mr. Larkin has rights in the courts against the Ceann Comhairle, and if he lets him in I believe it would be the duty of the Government, being advised as it is, to move that Mr. Larkin be expelled and try to persuade the House to expel him, and if they succeeded in this. then he has his rights against this House.  In no way are his rights defeated or prejudiced by the passing of this motion. There is one man who has an approach to the court, but only one man.  There is no approach to the court by this House.  And that being the case, we ask the House to declare that in fact a vacancy does exist on law.  I am assuming that the House is satisfied with certain points of fact.  If not we <Col N="685" /> will have these examined in some other way.  I await the suggestion as to how they can be examined.</P>

It passed a law as to what its composition would be and it must face what I think is clearly a breach of the law.  It has to determine how that breach is to be amended. There is an obvious way.  The amendment as well as the motion implies that if there is a vacancy declared the proper attitude is to issue a writ.</P>

All aggrieved parties who could have taken steps within twenty-one days and did not are estopped by their negligence, but nobody is estopped except those whose only method was to approach the courts by way of petition.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that in his opinion it was not necessary to take up the time of the House on this question, but a lot of discussion has gone on since he made that suggestion, and the longer we discuss that matter the more involved it seems to become.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would have us believe that the sole motive behind the motion is to put matters right in so far as representation in this House is concerned.  He wants to know why the aggrieved person did not move in the matter within 21 days after the election.  Might I suggest that his Party were also interested in that election, and if they were so confident of the result of any procedure which might follow the submission of their claim, they certainly would have moved.  Why did they not move in the matter?  Because I believe by moving within 21 days it would have meant a re-count of the votes, and the Government are well aware what the result of that re-count would have been.  It is alleged that our opposition to this motion is because we are not confident of winning the seat.  That is a matter which only time could tell.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us the Executive had been advised that the seat was vacant, and the main argument he submitted in favour of the motion was that Deputy Larkin did not present himself here and take his seat.  That was the main argument upon which the Parliamentary Secretary based the motion.</P>

      <P>I took a note of it at the time.  When one realises that most of the Front Bench have been here for the last five years, that they were here when the Electoral Act was put through the House, and being discussed and considered, what a sad commentary on their great statesmanship and foresight that they have made absolutely no provision for any circumstances which might arise as a result of candidates who are not eligible presenting themselves for election.  I should like to ask the Ministry could they prove that there are no others besides Deputy Larkin ineligible for membership of this Assembly, and were any steps taken to ascertain the eligibility of any of the candidates in the last election? The Electoral Act, so far as I can learn, made no provision for that.  I know, and most of us know, that the Returning Officer, Mr. Sherlock, took legal advice with reference to Mr. Larkin's nomination, and he stated in the public Press that Mr. Larkin's nomination was quite in order.  Mr. Larkin complied with the conditions set forth in the Electoral Act, and he was duly declared elected.  I was present in Pearse Street Library when the Returning Officer said: &ldquo;I have to declare the following candidates duly elected to represent the constituency of North Dublin.&rdquo;  There were three returned on the first count, and one was Deputy Larkin.  Mr. Sherlock had legal opinion, and his declaration and the declaration made here by the Clerk of the House have now been found to be contrary to the law.  They have been found to be based upon false tactics on the part of one of the candidates. The Minister for Industry and Commerce would have us believe that is the reason why he asks the House to pass this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to submit for the consideration of the Deputies this aspect of the question, that if the motion is passed the same fate may be meted out to any of the Deputies to-morrow. What is to prevent this automatic majority from doing so?  I would specially warn some of the Deputies on the Independent Benches, and particularly Deputy Alfred Byrne, because there were times in the not far-distant past when some of the Front Bench opposite <Col N="691" /> seemed very anxious to get rid of Deputy Byrne.  They had a very safe majority then.  I remember reading in the public press that Deputy Byrne was termed a Uriah Heap.  There are others along with Deputy Byrne who were not in the good graces of the Front Benchers some time ago.  A situation like we are now considering might arise again in the near future. Are you going to provide a future majority of this House with this weapon of throwing out anybody they might desire to get rid of?  That is a serious matter for consideration.  I think the intelligent Deputies here, and the people of the country generally, will recognize the real motive behind this motion.  What is the real motive?  I submit, in the first place, that Mr. Larkin would not have been allowed to stand as a candidate were it not for the belief in the minds of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party that he would be overwhelmingly defeated; secondly, that his candidature would split the Republican vote in that constituency; and, thirdly, that his defeat would reflect itself on the industrial field and help to strengthen the exploiting classes of this country.  That was the real reason why Mr. Larkin was allowed to stand as a candidate.</P>
    <P>Certain measures could have been found to meet the case if he was legally ineligible.  Surely there must be some method by which steps could have been taken to prevent his nomination, or are we to have another situation like what Deputy Murphy suggests occurring again?  If the motion is carried, a writ issued, and Mr. Larkin presents himself again&mdash;he is eligible for nomination&mdash;and is elected, how long is this sort of thing to continue before it will be stopped?  We have heard a good deal about law.  The Front Bench opposite is well versed in law as we understand it in this country.  They can quote law probably more eloquently than most of us on this side of the House, and they can quote it better than they observed it in the past.  They may furnish all the legal arguments that subtle minds can bring forth, but I suggest the common people of the country will understand the true position. <Col N="692" /> They will know that this great Government of ours which boasted of the last man and the last shilling are afraid of the personality of one man.</P>

      <P>Found out through the &ldquo;Irish Independent,&rdquo; perhaps. We have found a lot of things out through that source.  Larkin outside the House will be a more powerful force.  He will be a rallying centre for all manner of discontent.  I think it should be obvious that this motion is not only autocratic, but stupid.  We have heard a lot of talk about constitutionalism. Ministers sitting opposite sanctioned the execution of men in this country, declaring that it was in defence of the Constitution.  What a mockery you have made of your Constitution here to-night.  Constitutional law will soon become a joke in this country.  Given a little more time and with a little more of the ray of criticism which has been thrown on the front benches during the last few months, constitutional law, as the Ministers understand it and wish it to be understood, will have become a joke. When that day comes those who stand for that form of constitutional law in this country had need beware.  This Assembly is only a strong organ of authority as long as the people believe in it.  This action of yours must inevitably undermine its authority.  It will <Col N="693" /> create sympathy with those who advocate abstention from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Now that the Ceann Comhairle has arrived I wish to make the point that to-day I incurred his censure for making repeated interruptions.  It is so hard to sit here and listen to all the hypocritical pretence that is dished up to us, and it is so utterly hopeless to get up and attempt to put forth a case in defence of truth in view of the fact that we are faced with this automatic majority, that at times one feels compelled to interrupt when a glaring misrepresentation of facts is being made. Not being an experienced Parliamentary debater, I suppose I will be excused.</P>
      <P>We are told that Mr. Larkin is a bankrupt.  I have asked the question, and I think it was worth an answer, whether the Ministry can tell us if there are any other Deputies in the House bankrupts.  No steps were taken, as far as I was concerned at any rate, to ascertain my eligibility in that respect.  There is one thing certain, when speaking of bankruptcy, that the Minister has proved itself to be bankrupt in statesmanship and bankrupt in honesty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it was a question of fact as to whether the man was bankrupt or not.  There is the second point as to whether this particular man, who, we are told, is a bankrupt, is the man in question.  There was a case of bankruptcy in which a Mr. Larkin was involved.  It was not an ordinary case, the case of a person refusing to pay what one would term just debts.  It was a law case, and I submit that any man who can get out of paying lawyers in this country should get some better title than that of bankrupt.  I have nothing further to say.  I hope, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce assured us, that the Whips will be taken off for the division.  If they are, then surely any man of intelligence will vote in favour of the amendment.  The motion has been conceived in a state of panic and fear like a lot of other legislative measures which have been brought in here.  I have reason for saying fear. By passing the amendment we can get over the difficulty which the Minister for Industry and Commerce submitted was the main difficulty in connection with the amendment, that is the constitution of the court and the method by which we could proceed in bringing the case before that court.  If the House is prepared to treat this matter seriously it should pass the amendment. If it is not, then you are going to set up a precedent which will certainly be a very dangerous one.  It is a very grave matter.  I was surprised to hear the Parliamentary Secretary suggest that the House should pass the motion without giving any lengthy consideration to it.  I hope that will not occur and that the House will pass the amendment.</P>

By agreement, either a substantive motion or some form of amendment could presumably be moved.  At this stage I would not like to accept from Deputy O'Connell any form of words, because it might only lead to a rather useless debate.  If a form of words could be got by agreement, then the question of procedure can be easily got over.  There will be no difficulty in arranging for that.  Perhaps in the interval, between this and the resumption of the debate, Deputy O'Connell and the Minister would consult with me as to the form the amendment should take.  If the matter was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I presume that the motion and the amendment would remain on the Order Paper until the report was made, and that when the report <Col N="696" /> was made the debate would be resumed.</P>

      <P>Whether I am on my feet or in the Chair, I do not want the Deputy to give a direction to proceed with business.  There is a general principle involved in this case as to the making of charges against civil servants in the House.  If the Deputy wants to make a charge against a civil servant, named, or so clearly indicated as to be capable of identification, I suggest that that charge should be made, firstly, to the Minister responsible rather than in the House under the cover of the privilege of the House.  If the Minister responsible does not prove <Col N="700" /> to the satisfaction of the Deputy that there is nothing in the charge, then the Deputy can attack the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary in the House, on the ground that the occurrence took place in his Department.  We are concerned here&mdash;I think the Deputy will agree with me&mdash;with Ministers and their administration rather than directly with civil servants.  As a general matter of procedure, it is objectionable that a charge of corruption should be made casually&mdash;these adjournment proceedings might, perhaps, be regarded as somewhat casual&mdash;against an official. I do not know if the Deputy himself would like to proceed on that basis.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy explained that by saying he would make a charge against a particular official that he had interfered with the division of land on behalf of a relative. If the Deputy takes the matter up with the Parliamentary Secretary, it will be more satisfactory.  If necessary, the matter can be raised at a later stage in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until Friday at 12 noon.</P>
