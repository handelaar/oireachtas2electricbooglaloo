      <P>In the case of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa it is understood that the salary of the Governor-General is expressly exempted from income tax under the statutes of those Dominions.  There is no corresponding statutory exemption in Saorstát Eireann and the salary of the Governor-General is accordingly assessable to Saorstát Eireann income tax and super tax.  I have no information as to the position in regard to the salary of the Governor of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister for Finance aware that the relief grant given last Christmas expired, and that not one man received a day's work since the 31st March last from any of the relief authorities?  In view of that fact, will he see that something is done to relieve the poverty and destitution that exist in Dublin to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Unemployment which was set up definitely regarded the voting of relief moneys and the carrying out of works with them, as has been done for a number of years recently, as a very unsatisfactory way of meeting the distress situation.  They said that relief works, as they were carried out in connection <Col N="391" /> with such a scheme, were regarded as being generally demoralising and excessively costly.  I think that it is practically impossible to prevent, what is in effect, a waste of money in connection with such schemes, and I think that the situation would need to be shown to be very serious indeed, and to be impossible to meet in any other way before we would be justified in coming to the Dáil with proposals for a vote of money now which would certainly have to be accompanied by taxation proposals.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give an undertaking to consult with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as to the number of applications already lying in his Department and the number of schemes that can be submitted by the local authorities throughout the country, but which cannot be undertaken without some financial assistance from the Government?</P>

      <P>I notice the Minister has fallen back on the report of the Committee on Unemployment as a reason for not giving a grant from the Central Funds this year.  In view of his falling back on that report, I ask if he is prepared before the winter is out to have some of the recommendations of that Committee put into effect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, in view of the fact that much unemployment exists in the City of Cork, and as he has now stated that the giving of these grants was both demoralising and costly, consider an alternative scheme whereby useful reproductive work would be provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now practically invited the House to show that exceptional conditions exist, and that if that can be proved something will be done by the Government. I will ask the Minister if he will ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is sympathetic in this matter, to investigate the list of names sent in.  Practically the names of 200 of these families have been sent <Col N="392" /> in to the Local Government Board as the cases of persons requiring either relief work or food.  Is the Minister aware that nothing has been done since this list was sent in?  Will the Minister for Finance consult the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who, I am aware, is rather sympathetic in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister for Finance if he is satisfied that the conditions are so much better now than they have been for the last four or five years, that there is no necessity this year for a grant?  Are we to take it that the conditions have improved so much that destitution is not as rife now as one or two years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are grounds for the Deputy saying &ldquo;for the last four or five years.&rdquo; There was a grant last year.  I think there was no grant the year before.  It is extremely difficult, I know, to say whether the conditions are fractionally better or worse in a particular year.  There was one year in which the conditions were worse than in any other.  That was the year in which the fluke epidemic took place.  As regards the other years, it is very difficult to say.  It is not my duty, departmentally, to look for avenues of expenditure.  I will hear any representations that are put forward by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, which has a duty in respect of destitution.  I will hear any representations that are put forward by any other Department, but I do not concede that it is my particular duty to look for ways of incurring expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that, on the advice of the Revenue Commissioners, the Customs authorities are attempting to collect import duty on motor fire engines and apparatus, and that public bodies interested in the installation of fire-fighting apparatus are hindered in procuring the necessary apparatus, as the importers cannot demonstrate their engines in various <Col N="393" /> parts of the country and be in a position to comply with the regulations governing the entry of dutiable goods under drawback.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Motor fire engines and accessories and parts thereof are liable to Customs duty under Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928.  In the event of the goods being subsequently exported drawback equal to the amount of duty charged on importation is payable under sub-section (1) of Section 12 of the same Act, provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that duty was duly paid on importation, that the goods were not used in Saorstát Eireann, and that they were exported in compliance with the laws governing the exportation of goods on which drawback is claimed.  The running of a motor fire engine or other motor vehicle on the road for purposes of demonstration or test for a total distance of not more than 100 miles under the general identification number of the firm by whom the work is carried out, would not be regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as &ldquo;use&rdquo; so as to prevent the payment of drawback on exportation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Act of 1926 repealed certain sections of the Finance Act of 1920 and the repealed sections exempted apparatus of that type specifically from duty? Is the Minister aware that there was no indication in the Finance Act of 1928 that that section of the 1926 Act was being repealed?  Is he further aware that apparatus of this kind is imported into this country only when the importers are satisfied they have a sufficent number of people to demonstrate it with?  I have here a list of 20 county councils interested in fire-fighting apparatus, and if the makers were to import the necessary fire engine and apparatus for demonstration purposes to those county councils it would mean that they would lose the drawback, as the distance between the county councils would far exceed the distance allowed under the drawback clause of the Act?  Will the Minister consider the formulation of some measure whereby fire-fighting apparatus of that type will be allowed in free?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a good deal of that is the subject for another question which the Deputy will have to put down.  As regards the limit of 100 miles, that is not statutory, but is a limit fixed by the Revenue Commissioners. If sufficient cause were shown which would lead them to believe that a greater distance than 100 miles was necessary in order to have demonstrations carried out, they could extend the limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter of the 27th April from the Commissioners of Public Works to the Mayo County Council did not contain any conditions relative to drainage schemes in that county.  It presented merely a rough general idea of the financial aspect of the proposals for the drainage of the rivers Robe and Moy, with their tributaries, and stated that until further inspections and surveys were carried out exact estimates could not be made.  As the Council are prepared to contribute towards the cost of a drainage scheme for the River Robe, it will be necessary for them and the Galway County Council to forward to the Commissioners petitions in respect of that part of the scheme included in the existing Lough Mask and River Robe Drainage District, and for which a petition has not yet been received from either County Council.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that much dissatisfaction prevails amongst the people generally in the Cahirciveen Rural District, Co. Kerry, because of the deterioration in the quality of the store cattle raised there for the past two years, resulting in a very serious loss to the farmers in this area; that this deterioration in the quality of the store cattle is attributed solely to the fact that, by the regulations framed under the Live Stock Breeding Act, 1925, no bulls other than those of the Kerry breed, with one or two exceptions, are permitted to be kept in this district; and whether he will hold an inquiry in Cahirciveen and so give the farmers concerned an opportunity of expressing their opinions on this matter before a representative from his Department; and of discussing the <Col N="409" /> question of bulls generally with the view to relaxing these regulations where a demand is made for another class of bull, and to permitting farmers in this area to keep bulls other than Kerry bulls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The information at the Department's disposal goes to show that there has not been any deterioration in the quality of the store cattle in the Cahirciveen Rural District during the past two years, but that, on the contrary, a distinct improvement has taken place in the type of young stock being produced as a result of the operations of the Live Stock Breeding Act, and also from the location of high-class Kerry bulls under the Department's Improvement Scheme.</P>
      <P>With the exception of two small compact areas&mdash;Ballymacarbery and St. Finans&mdash;in which cattle of Shorthorn type are kept, all the breeding stock in the district mentioned are of the Kerry type, and it is the Department's policy to maintain and improve that breed, which is a most valuable one for the conditions existing in the Kerry cattle area.  In the two areas mentioned in which cows of Shorthorn type are kept, bulls of this breed are licensed and are available.  I do not propose to hold a local inquiry, as suggested in the concluding portion of the question, or to alter the Department's policy for the maintenance of the purity of the Kerry breed in their native district.</P>

Is he aware, also, that there are very many farmers in that district who were able to sell their yearlings there, but that they cannot sell them now because of the poor quality of these cattle?</P>

      <P>The estate of Thomas St. John Grant, which is situate partly in County Cork and partly in County Waterford, and is pending for sale under the Land Act, 1923, has been surveyed, and the Commissioners expect to be in a position within a week or so to publish the Provisional List of the Lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, will vest in the Land Commission.  The property will then be visited by an inspector, who will report on the various matters requiring attention thereon, including the liability of the lands to periodic flooding.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The order of business will be as it is on the Paper.  Before entering on the business, I think it desirable to make a brief statement on the taking of Divisions. After I had announced from the Chair the numbers returned to me by the Tellers at the last Division taken on Friday, a number of points were put to me.  Of these the only point of order was, it seemed to me, whether a Teller had a right to vote Tá, although he had accepted nomination as Teller for the Níls.  I stated at the time that as the point had never arisen before, I had not had an opportunity of considering it, but gave it as my opinion that a Deputy who had acted as a Teller for a particular side should be taken as voting for that side, as the normal practice.  The present system of taking Divisions has been in operation since February, 1925. The practice has been to add the Tellers to the numbers passing through the Lobbies on the respective sides, and that practice is based on a minute of a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges held on the 12th February, 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Friday I have given further consideration to the questions raised, and I see no reason to alter the opinion I have expressed already.  To allow a Teller to vote for a side other than that for which he acted as Teller would, in my judgment, if the action were challenged, result in rendering the Division abortive, and would mean that another Division would have to be taken.  The responsibility for conducting the count in the Lobbies rests entirely with the Tellers, who perform that duty on behalf of the House.  The Clerks are responsible only for the records of the names of the Deputies voting, but the Tellers are responsible for the correctness of the numbers.  The Chair is concerned only with the record of the numbers as presented to the Chair on the sheet signed by the Tellers.  When, therefore, the Tellers have agreed on <Col N="421" /> the numbers and have signed the Tellers' Sheet, the Chair must, unless a point of order is raised before the figures have been announced to the House, declare the result to be as found by the Tellers, and announce the decision of the House accordingly.  A point of order as to any alleged irregularity in the taking of a Division must be made before the figures have been announced by the Chair, and if any such point should be upheld, the only power possessed by the Chair is to order a fresh Division.  I might add that it has been already ruled that if a Deputy votes inadvertently in the wrong Lobby, there is no power in the Chair to remedy the error.  Once the figures have been announced the Division is complete, and the decision of the House must be declared accordingly.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Cooney puts any point to me, I should say that I made this statement so that the position regarding the taking of Divisions would be clear on future occasions.

      <P>A point of order is a point upon which the Chair can give a decision.  The Chair is not concerned with what Deputies say to one another or to the Clerk. A Teller is entitled to know before he signs the Tellers' sheet, and he must know, what the figures are.  Nobody, I presume, would dream of withholding from a Teller what the figures are.  The Deputy is confusing the question of a Deputy who is voting in the ordinary way with that of a Teller.  The normal procedure is that the Teller should vote on the side for which he has opted to tell.  Then the other question would not arise.</P>

      <P>Then I cannot see what the purpose is in talking about an amendment not being there.  The amendment is there, and it is put down in order that the House will have an opportunity of expressing itself on this question as to the length of term of office for Senators.  The object of the amendments is to reduce the term from the proposed period of nine years in the Bill to six years.  The rest is merely consequential.  If the first amendment goes, then there is no use in bringing forward the remaining amendments. When we were talking about it on the Committee Stage, I said that no case whatever had been made out by the proposers of the Bill for giving such a lengthy period as nine years, and no attempt was made, so far as I could see, to defend their action in that respect. It was passed over in just the same way as a related question, namely, the size of the Seanad.  I expected to find amongst the series of Bills brought forward a Bill to reduce it from the unnecessarily large number of 60 to reasonable dimensions.  During the Second Reading debate, Indicated that our view was that, if there was to be a Seanad at all, a Seanad of 36 would more effectively carry out the intention of those who were in favour of a Seanad than a large Seanad of 60, I <Col N="426" /> gave numbers from other countries to show the practice elsewhere.  I mentioned, for example, that in Australia they had a number like 36, and in a number of other places you had Senates of much smaller dimensions for much larger countries and much larger populations. We cannot, unfortunately, at this stage deal with the question of the number of the Seanad, and I see from the Bill, which makes provision to change the period from twelve to nine years, that the number of Senators is to remain as it is.  I had hoped that the whole of the series of Bills might be supplemented by a Bill reducing the number from 60 to some reasonable dimension.  If we ask ourselves what would be the number that would be natural we ought to say what would be the effective number of those who would be present.  I mean what would be the average number of those who would attend.  We ought to leave a margin for those unavoidably absent and leave a number behind which would be considered as a proper deliberative body.  The Minister for Local Government thinks that 15 are sufficient, and if you increase the number you do damage.  I wonder why he would not use towards his colleagues in the Executive Council the same arguments as he used for the reduction in the number of representatives in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of confusion.  There is a far better case to be made for larger numbers in the case of Cork, when you are putting executive powers into the hands of a single individual, than can possibly be made for a large Seanad, considering the functions it has to perform.  The number of 36, such as in Australia, would be a reasonable figure to aim at. Any figure in that neighbourhood would satisfy us, if there is to be a Seanad at all.  As I have said, that whole matter was passed over, and the House got no opportunity of expressing its opinion by a vote on the question as to what the numbers in the Seanad should be.  Though it was quite obvious from remarks made on the Committee Stage that a large number of Deputies objected to such a long period of office <Col N="427" /> as nine years, no attempt has been made on the other side to justify that long period.  On the contrary, arguments have been put forward from our side to show that the period of nine years is harmful, because during the greater part of that period you will have a condition which resulted in the figures quoted by Deputy Davin from the records of attendance.  In Committee I gave some figures with regard to other places, and it is no harm to repeat them.  The period of office in the case of the United States is six years, in Belgium it is four, in CzechoSlovakia and Denmark it is eight in each case, in the Netherlands it is six years, in New Zealand seven years, and in Australia six years.  When you go over the list of the Senates of the States of the world you find that the period of office of Senators here is one of the longest.  There are only one or two others longer.  There is no reason for it, so far as we can see, and consequently we put forward this amendment in the hope that the majority of Deputies will express their views to the effect that this period ought to be reduced from nine to six years.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera's arguments fell into two portions&mdash;in the first place, that the Seanad was too large, and, in the second place, that the term of office was too long.  He quoted various precedents in each case.  From the point of view of size he took Australia as a model.  The Australian Senate and the Senate of the United States cannot fairly be compared with our Seanad, because Australia and the United States are countries with a Federal Constitution, and their Senates are framed expressly for the purpose of giving exaggerated representation to the smaller States.  They are given an excessive representation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to my conclusion, but surely I may be allowed to make my arguments before stating my conclusion.  I heard Deputy de Valera's conclusion, but I did not hear <Col N="428" /> much of his argument.  My argument is that you cannot compare institutions formed for a different purpose, formed to serve the specific purpose of giving representation to small States.  We are not a Federal power, and we have no States.  The provinces have no legal existence.  They have a traditional or historical existence.  If you had a Seanad representative of Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connaught, then there would be something to be said for Deputy de Valera's parallel and for his amendment.  As it is, there is nothing. On the other hand, one of the purposes for which the Seanad has been created, as defined in the Constitution, is to give representation to various interests and aspects of national life&mdash;I can quote it verbatim if Deputy de Valera wants me &mdash;which might not otherwise find representation, and for that purpose a large Seanad is almost a necessity.  Now we come&mdash;I have been out of order, following Deputy de Valera&mdash;to the purpose of the amendment reducing the term of office.  Deputy de Valera quoted Australia and Belgium.  He did not quote Canada.  Why did he ignore the Canadian precedent?  In Canada, Senators are appointed for life.  I do not think myself that it is a perfect precedent, because such a Senate tends to become extraordinarily old, but we might just as well follow the Canadian precedent as the Australian one&mdash;every bit as well.  Deputy de Valera naturally sees that the Canadian precedent does not suit his argument but the Australian precedent does.</P>

      <P>It does not suit Deputy O'Connell either! The Seanad does not meet very frequently.  Possibly it should meet more frequently, but it does not.  If you had a very short term of office, particularly for Senators who are not accustomed to Parliamentary debate, you would find that the Senators were retiring just as they were beginning to be most useful and just as they had learned their work.  That seems to me to be a practical reason.  Of course, the Dáil understands the purpose behind Deputy de Valera's amendment.  He wishes the <Col N="429" /> term of Senators to be as brief as possible in order that they may be as indecisive as possible, and he wishes to make the Seanad as small a body as possible in order that he can abolish it without being observed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera told us on the Second Stage of the Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Bill that practically his policy in regard to the Seanad, seeing that he was not going to get his own way at once, was to make things worse in order to make things better.  He states that his reason for bringing forward these amendments was that he was challenged to bring them forward in order to have them discussed.  He suggests that he had hoped all along to have an opportunity of saying whether the number in the Seanad should be 60 or not.  The Executive Council made it perfectly clear, in dealing with the matter of the Seanad and with constitutional amendments connected with it, that they were giving effect to the report of the Joint Committee which considered the constitution of the Seanad early this year.  That report recommended that the period of office for a Senator should be reduced from 12 years to 9 years.</P>

    <P>Only on the Report Stage of the last Bill that in any way affects the Seanad election do we come up against this amendment by Deputy de Valera that a reduction should take place from nine years to six years.  We can only assume that it is brought in for the purposes of further obstruction and, if possible, destroying the legislation we have been passing here dealing with the Seanad.  Before the Summer Recess there was a very considerable amount of obstruction in dealing with these Bills.  Now we are asked, at the last moment, to discuss this question in this particular way of nine years against six years.  If we examine the amendment that Deputy de Valera has put down to Section 3, we can see his process of making things very much worse in order to make things better.  For instance, if the Seanad elections were carried out in accordance with his amendments, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 to Section 3, we would get, after that election, a Seanad that would consist of <Col N="430" /> five members due to go out in 1930&mdash;in two years; fifteen members due to go out in 1931&mdash;in three years; eight members due to go out in 1932; eighteen members due to go out in 1934; fourteen due to go out in 1937, at a time when we had the Constitution amended to say that one-third of the Senators should go out every two years.  I do not know who would be expected to remedy the legislative state of affairs that would be brought about by the passing of these amendments.  So that dealing with these particular amendments, we can only deal with them as matters of obstruction.  The recommendation that the Senatorial life should be nine years is the recommendation of the Joint Committee.  That one-third of the Seanad should be elected every three years is involved in that.  Under the Constitution, the life of the Dáil may be six years.  According to the legislation passed, it may be five.  To reduce the period of office of a Senator to nine years, and to have an election once every three years, brings the period of office of a Senator practically on parallel lines with the life of the Dáil.  So much so that, taking it that this Dáil assembled for the first time on the 11th October, 1928, and that it will run its full five years; that another Dáil will assemble, say, on 1st September, 1932, and run for its five years, and assemble again on the 1st September, 1937, the Dáil that would assemble on the 1st September, 1932, would deal with three Seanad elections. That is, that the whole personnel of the Seanad would be completely changed by the three elections inside the life-time of one Dáil.  We suggest that that is not desirable.  The period that has been carefully thought over and examined by the Joint Committee, and that the Executive Council puts before the Dáil after full consideration of the matter, is nine years, and in that spirit we very definitely oppose the amendments in Deputy de Valera's name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">

      <P>I have listened very carefully to the speech of the Minister for Local Government and to the speech of Deputy Cooper in the hope that I would receive some indication as to what argument induced the Executive Council to decide upon a <Col N="431" /> nine years' tenure of office for Senators. Not merely have I listened to those speeches, but I took the trouble of going back over the official records and read the speeches made on the Second Reading of this Bill both by the Minister and the President, and by the Minister on the Committee Stage.  On no single occasion since this Bill was introduced has any single reason been advanced in support of a nine years' tenure of office.  We have been told that the Executive Council considered it very carefully and decided upon nine years; that the Select Committee set up to consider the Constitution of the Seanad recommended the period of nine years; but not one single argument in favour of that period has yet been advanced.  Have they any argument? Is there any reason whatever in support of this Bill except the fact that the Select Committee reported in favour of nine years&mdash;a Select Committee half of whom were Senators, and by far the greater proportion of the other half friends of Senators.  They recommended nine years in preference to six, and it is on their recommendation alone that this Bill was introduced. If the Executive Council had any argument that they thought would convince Deputies in favour of that period of office they would produce it, but they have not.  On the Second Reading, the President went back to 1922 and talked about the things that happened then, and the circumstances which then existed, until the Ceann Comhairle closed him down.</P>

      <P>Yes, to my displeasure. I would have much preferred that the President had been allowed to go on.  If I recollect rightly, he was giving the whole game away on his Party, having directly contradicted the speech made a few minutes before by Deputy Tierney.  If he cannot recollect that, I would advise him to read the official report.  The President carefully avoided any reference to the Bill, just as the Minister for Local Government to-day, instead of dealing with the particular amendments we are discussing, <Col N="432" /> selected four or five others which will come up for discussion later, and just as Deputy Cooper, instead of producing any argument in favour of the Bill, trots out the one solitary example of Canada, and tells us that because Canada elects Senators for life, we should do likewise.  Deputy de Valera was able to produce a number of examples in other States where the period of office of Senators is much less than that suggested here, and Deputy O'Connell, who has just returned from Canada, in an interruption, informed us that the particular system in Canada does not seem to suit the natives there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper tells us that the situation in Australia is different from the situation here, and therefore no proper comparison can be made between the Australian Senate and our Seanad.  He said that it was necessary to give an exaggerated representation in the Senate to the various States of the Federation.  In order to give an exaggerated representation to the various States in the Australian Senate, they have constituted a Senate which is very slightly over half the size of ours&mdash;a Senate which consists of 36 members, while our Seanad consists of 60.  It was also thought desirable that we should give exaggerated representation to certain interests, and Deputy Cooper blandly told us that the reason the Seanad was brought into existence was to give representation to various interests in our national life which would not get representation otherwise.  I hope I am quoting the Deputy correctly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact, in any case, is that the only argument produced in favour of a Seanad of sixty is that it is <Col N="433" /> necessary to give exaggerated representation to various interests in our national life which would not get representation otherwise&mdash;I draw attention to the latter part of that phrase particularly, &ldquo;which would not get representation otherwise&rdquo;&mdash;who, if they had to go before the people and seek the people's votes, would not get them. That section, that interest, in our national life, which is incapable of being elected by the people, is placed in a position of authority in this State by this device of a Seanad.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a Seanad constituted for that purpose, surely it is in the national interest and in the interest of democratic government that the necessary steps should be taken to ensure that this Dáil will be able to exercise some degree of effective control over it.  It is not advisable, for various reasons, that the Seanad thus constituted should exceed, in duration, the life-time of the Dáil, that the period of office of an ordinary Senator should be the period of two successive Dála.  That is not advisable.  I do not know what the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was driving at when he was criticising the other amendments on the Paper in Deputy de Valera's name.  He pointed out that if these amendments were passed, a scheme having elections for the Seanad every three years could not be put in operation, and in the next breath he tells us that in the five years between 1932 and 1937 there are going to be three elections for the Seanad.  If Deputy de Valera's scheme destroys triennial elections for the Seanad the Minister's does the same, on his own admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, we believe, if we are to have a Seanad at all, it should be one over which the representatives of the people would exercise effective control and that will not be empowered to interfere in any serious and decisive manner with the will of the majority of this House.  Our views, of course, with regard to the existence of a Seanad at all are well known.  We do not believe a Seanad, under present circumstances, should exist in this State.  We do not believe it serves any useful purpose or that it can possibly <Col N="434" /> serve any useful purpose.  We think the machinery of government would act much more smoothly if that House did not exist.  The majority in this House decided to keep it in existence. We want if possible, therefore, to try to persuade that majority not to overdo it, not to give the Seanad too much power or to leave them in existence under conditions which would make it impossible for them or some other majority properly to control them in a crisis.  The argument in favour of a six-year period of office appears to me very much stronger than any argument that could be advanced in favour of any longer period. I say deliberately &ldquo;any argument that could be advanced&rdquo; but that has not yet been advanced.  I hope, before this debate concludes, that some member of the Government will give us the exact reasons that influenced the Executive Council to introduce this.</P>
    <P>The point raised by the Minister for Local Government that the moving of these amendments on this side of the House is designed for obstructive purposes is nonsense&mdash;and he knows it. This is not the last Bill, unfortunately, dealing with the Seanad, but this is the particular Bill that deals with the period of the office of Senators.  It is on this Bill and this Bill only that amendments of that kind can be moved.  An amendment could not be moved on the Second Reading, and an amendment was not moved on the Committee Stage for various reasons stated at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, if the President looks at the official report he will find that Deputy Flinn and he debated the reasons for over an hour.  But the fact remains that the amendments are being moved here now on the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, in his description of the history of this particular case, has scarcely dealt fairly with the Joint Committee.  There was a Joint Committee, which consisted of certain members of the Dáil and certain members of the Seanad.  I find, on looking up the membership of the Joint Committee, that of the Senators on that Committee, three were elected at the election in 1925, one was elected by the Dáil, and two had been nominated members. They, in their wisdom, brought in a recommendation to the Committee that the term of office for Senators should be nine years.  Now, mark, the initiative lies with this body.  Then Deputy de Valera suggested the number should be made six.  Fortunately, we are saved from having to read the speeches of the representatives of the Joint Committee, as the mere fact that the amendment was defeated is recorded. We introduced, in accordance with the wise recommendation of that Committee, proposals that the term of office should be reduced from twelve to nine years.  In a fit of rather abysmal innocence on the part of Deputies opposite, the Bill was, for some time, opposed by them.  They were going to vote against it only I warned them of the danger of recording their votes against the reduction of the term of office from twelve to nine years&mdash;I think my recollection is right&mdash;and seeing at once the danger into which they were falling they withdrew their opposition and let the Bill go through without a division on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we came along to the Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage we heard that the term of office of Senators should not be longer than six years.  I pointed out there was a method by which an attempt might be made to effect that purpose even on this measure.  They made many excuses and explanations.  Deputy Lemass said that arguments were brought forward by Deputy Flinn.  I would not dignify them by such a term.  I think they were very poor explanations of lack of attention to this matter during the Recess.  Now we find we have <Col N="436" /> a long list of recommendations that the term should be reduced from nine years to six years.  As usual, the principal argument in favour of that is suspicion.  You should not trust anybody for nine years.  I think Deputy de Valera himself holds a position for a longer term than nine years.  It is not a good argument.  Experience is of immense value in connection with public matters, and in the case of membership of important institutions in the country.  One learns in this way, and Deputies opposite will admit the amount they have learned during their short period of service here.  Just imagine how much more able and competent they will be in nine years time as compared with to-day.  And so with the Seanad.  They increase in age and wisdom, in accordance with what we have heard from the Scriptures.  Deputy de Valera has come in on this with his sledge-hammer.  His proposal is to reduce the term of office from nine to six years.  He will admit, as a person having some knowledge of figures, that it is a barbarous method he has adopted to effect his purpose.  I suggest his purpose would be much more easily effected without these extraordinary jolts he is preparing to inflict upon the national institutions of this country. It would be possible to reduce the term of office in three years time from nine years to six years without this sort of thing, because then a situation would arise much the same as now.  The Deputy will admit at once the wisdom of the majority of the Joint Committee when they recommended the reduction from twelve to nine years.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the figures lend themselves to it.  The terms of office and the recommendations which are made in Section 3 point how clear-cut a decision of that sort may be, how easily it may be accomplished, and how there will be no such extraordinary irregularities in the numbers of persons to be elected, and in the various dates on which they would be elected in order to effect the purpose he has.  I submit that the Joint Committee showed wisdom in the first instance in recommending a reduction of the term of office of Senators from twelve to nine years.  The Deputy was unable to <Col N="437" /> convince a single member of the Joint Committee on which, I think, there were three persons returned by the electorate.  Some of them are members of Deputy O'Connell's Party, to whom, I suppose, when they have a meeting of the Party, he will have to render an account for any vote he casts here which would be against their wishes. Secondly, there was an opportunity during the course of the Third Stage of this measure of arranging that the term of office, three years from now, <Col N="438" /> could have been six years without precipitating those extraordinary jolts the Deputy has perpetrated, or is attempting to perpetrate in the series of amendments he has down.  If the Deputy came and asked me how to do this, with advantage to himself and credit to his Party, I would have told him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of replying to some of the statements which were made by the President in connection with the amendment. First of all, we were told that this whole thing was carefully thought out, that this whole period was carefully thought out in the Committee.  Well, most of the members of the Committee, as was already pointed out by Deputy Lemass, had vested interests, so to speak, in this particular decision, and I would have preferred by far in connection with the question of the period of office, that an independent committee had been set up.  So I do not think we can say that a Committee composed one-half of those directly interested and of a portion representing the majority here, whose policy has been very definite in respect to that Seanad, was desirable.  It is quite clear from the legislation that the majority here have regarded that Seanad as a definite addition to their own forces. Therefore, when we say it was carefully thought out, I think anyone who examines the situation will doubt it very much.  The Minister for Local Government, speaking of a shorter period, made a statement which I cannot understand.  He said we were going to have three Seanad elections within the lifetime of a single Dáil.  I do not see how that is going to come off.  I was listening, of course, to Deputy Cooper.  He wanted to say that there was no analogy.  I was not pushing any analogy beyond the point that countries with larger populations and with larger territories have been content to work with very much smaller Senates in numbers, and a shorter period of office, than ours.  He brought up the one example of Canada.  That was a notoriously bad example, because, as was pointed out by Deputy O'Connell, in Canada it has been the cause of agitation for a long number of years, and it is probably going to be ended.  Then he made a very curious contribution, in the way of argument, by saying that there was a peculiar condition in the case of federal States that necessitated giving exaggerated representation to States.  It seems to me that if that meant anything it meant that in these cases you ought to have a much larger Senate than we have here in a unitary State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera did not quite get my point&mdash;exaggerrated representation to one or two small States, such as Tasmania in Australia.  The principle in federal States, as Deputy de Valera knows, is equal representation of States.  Therefore, Tasmania, having large representation in proportion to population, larger States such as Victoria and New South Wales have very much less representation than they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a bad attempt, a Chinn Comhairle, to explain the conclusion which Deputy Cooper wished to have drawn from his statement, but I think the obvious conclusion was that if you have to give exaggerated representation to States you <Col N="441" /> are exaggerating the size of the Senate and, consequently, we would expect here not to have a larger but a smaller one.  If the idea had occurred to me I certainly would have used it, and believe fairly soundly used it, for the purpose of showing that we do not need here as large a Senate as they would need in the case of a federal State.  For example, in the United States it is obvious that they could hardly have a Senate less than they have, of 96, because nobody likes to see a State represented by a single individual. They would like, at least, to have some balance.  Therefore you reduce it to the smallest possible number, in equal representation, and they are compelled practically to have a Senate of 96.  They could not have the whole idea worked out with a smaller number.</P>
      <P>The President taunts us with the impossible position that would follow if we were to reduce the period.  If we had the management of this whole affair we would have been able to get a much easier solution even than the one proposed here.  Because we would have changed not merely the period of office but we would have changed the number of seats.  We could very easily bring about a situation in which my amendment and the consequential amendments would be very simple.  We would have brought it down to a very simple number.  The President says: &ldquo;Give us another three years before you change it.&rdquo;  Well, possibly it will be changed altogether before that period.</P>

      <P>I should have imagined, listening to the speech of Deputy de Valera, who was a member of the Joint Committee, that he would have gone to the Joint Committee with a regular series of proposals embodying what his ideal of a Seanad would be.  Looking through the various decisions and proposals which were put forward, I find that the Deputy was always in the second place, and that when a recommendation was put up he either supported it or opposed it or proposed an amendment. But he had no definite plan of his own.</P>

      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle knows, that is not a fact. The Ceann Comhairle was Chairman, and he is aware that I had a very definite series of amendments.  In view of the situation of the various amendments, the Ceann Comhairle naturally arranged a certain order in which the business would be taken.  He arranged matters so that business would be got through expeditiously.  That was why my amendments came up in the manner suggested by the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There would have been quite a number of differences. May I suggest that the original intention was that they would bring in recommendations?  It was pointed out to us there were two bodies concerned, the Dáil and the Seanad, and that a Committee from those two bodies ought to be asked to consider the question and make recommendations.  Even with the addition of the Leader of the Opposition, the recommendations have not come up to the standard of excellence that the members of the Party opposite expect.  I would have approached the matter from an entirely different angle.</P>

      <P>The whole question should have been: What would be the best for the country?  It should not be a matter of whether or not it would be possible to get something which might score off one's opponents.  I am in the fortunate position, no matter what subject I take up, that I have such poor material in the country to attack me that victory is inevitable, as they would say.  Why should Deputy de Valera say that on this question of the numbers of the Seanad the country would give a decision in his favour? That is not a big enough question to go to the country.  That is purely a parochial view; that is the view that I would expect Deputy Cooney to take, but not Deputy de Valera; I would expect a much wider outlook from Deputy de Valera.  When a general election takes place, it takes place on a whole series of proposals.  I do not see any great improvement made or attempted to be made in connection with the Seanad.  I say that we might reasonably have anticipated some better support for the recommendations the Deputy did make.  The Deputy even opposed his own child, the recommendation that the age should be reduced from 35 to 30 years.  I stood for his child and got it passed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> The Dáil went into Committee and resumed consideration of the Cork City Management Bill, 1928 (Section 9).</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 35:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add after sub-section (2) two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The manager shall exercise the powers, functions and duties conferred upon him by sub-section (1) above, after consultation with a board (in this Act referred to as the board of aldermen) which shall consist of the lord mayor and aldermen of the Corporation, and of which the lord mayor shall be chairman.</P>
      <P>(4)  Any officer or servant of the Corporation removed by order of the manager may appeal to the board of aldermen, which may, after inquiry into all the facts of the case, affirm the order of the manager, or with the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of the council present and voting at an ordinary meeting rescind such order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give to the manager a consultative body of reasonable size and to provide some function for the aldermen, who would otherwise be ornaments.  According to the Bill, the executive powers of the council are to be vested in a single individual.  There are, of course, dangers in giving uncontrolled power to any individual, and if control is to be exercised effectively, the actions of the individual will need to be surveyed fairly closely.  There is no provision in the Bill that I can see for anything like continuous close examination of the actions of the manager.  By close examination I do not mean interference in any sense, because I believe that if we are going to have a manager he ought to be free to act in all executive matters on his own judgement and take responsibility.  But it would be advisable, both from the point of view of the manager himself and from the other point of view, that I have been stressing&mdash;a close examination of his acts&mdash; that you should have a small body of this kind.  Such a body would really <Col N="448" /> correspond to a general purposes committee of the council, except that the general purposes committee would be, in relation to the manager almost entirely in a consultative capacity.  If you are going to have an arrangement of that kind, it is, of course, advisable that they should act with authority derived directly from the council itself, and that would imply election by the council.  Consequently, the whole idea in the scheme is that the aldermen should be elected yearly by the council at the same time as the Lord Mayor, and that their number should be such as would provide a small body that could meet frequently for the purpose of examining the acts of the manager and keeping in close touch with him.</P>
    <P>The first portion of the amendment simply says that the manager shall exercise the powers, etc., conferred upon him, and that the board shall consist of the lord mayor and aldermen of the Corporation, and that the lord mayor shall be chairman.  The second portion of the amendment says: &ldquo;Any officer or servant of the Corporation removed by order of the manager may appeal to the board of aldermen, which may, after inquiry into all the facts of the case, confirm the order of the manager, or with the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of the council present and voting at an ordinary meeting rescind such order.&rdquo;  You can see that that is one of the special functions proposed to be given to the board, apart from that of generally keeping in touch with the manager.  But the idea is to provide a board of appeal against arbitrary action by the manager in dismissing servants of the Corporation. You can see that the intention is not to encourage appeals of that kind, but to meet a case where there was obvious injustice.  The appeal could not succeed unless it were confirmed by a majority of two-thirds of the members of the council.  If the board of aldermen, in the first instance, confirmed the action of the manager there would be nothing more about it.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I put it to the Deputy that there is a danger.

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>What is proposed by this amendment is that if a servant of the Corporation has been removed by the manager, and that servant feels that he has been wrongfully dismissed, he can bring an appeal to the board of aldermen.  The board of aldermen will either confirm the action of the manager, in which case there is no further appeal, or they will uphold the appeal; they will say that in their opinion the dismissal was wrongful. Then the matter is referred to the council as a whole, which, in order to reverse the order of the manager, must do so by a two-thirds majority.  Unless there is a two-thirds majority upholding the appeal and condemning the action of the manager, the manager's action is held to be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We will suppose that there are five aldermen, three being against the manager and two for him.  Then, of course, it goes to the council, and the council has not got a two-thirds majority to rescind the order, but nevertheless it has a majority against the manager.  I think that is bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case it simply means that the manager has direct responsibility and that the Council is not going to interfere in that detail, that the decision of the manager in that case would be held to be upheld, because the principle on which the <Col N="450" /> manager would be appointed would be that he was not to be interfered with unnecessarily by the Council in the details of his work, and the idea of the necessity for a big majority like two-thirds was to see that he was not going to be interfered with except there was an obvious case of arbitrary and unfair action on his part.  The whole idea running right through these amendments is that there should be a manager in whom the executive authority of the council would be vested, that he is not to be interfered with in detail, but that he should have representatives of the council in association with him, men with whom, if he were wise, in my opinion, he would confer with very frequently on some of the larger questions with which he would have to deal.  You have machinery for conference provided there, and you have also provided a thing that I think is necessary when you are giving very large powers to an individual, a very simple court of first instance to judge as between the dismissed servant and the manager.  Then if the case is such that this representative board thinks that the manager is acting unfairly the matter is referred to the court of final authority&mdash;the whole council.  The idea in making it difficult is that nobody wishes to encourage appeals of that kind, and nobody wishes to weaken the manager through unnecessary interference by the council.  As I say, all these amendments hang together.  Of course, I can see that there is a vast difference between the way in which the Minister is approaching this whole question and the way in which I am approaching it. At first I thought that we were probably much nearer than I saw was the case afterwards when his point of view was made clear.  To me, in any case, it is a valuable thing to have a single executive officer, but the council must have effective control, and to have effective control they must be able to dismiss the manager when he grows difficult. For instance, they must not have a manager foisted on them by the Minister for Local Government against their will.  They must not have a manager retained in office if they, by a substantial majority, say that they do not want such an officer.  They must <Col N="451" /> also have continuous touch with the acts of the manager in order to be able effectively to criticise them, and if you have a council such as I have in mind &mdash;the difference was that I had in mind a fairly large council that would be representative of all bodies&mdash;you cannot expect them to be constantly in touch with the various acts of the manager and consequently in a position either to understand the reasons for his actions in a number of cases or to criticise them effectively and check, by means of such control as the council would have, tendencies which they would notice by close contact.  I do not know that anything will be gained by speaking further to the amendment. There are not very many Deputies in the House, and I do not know that argument is going to settle the matter in the end.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera says truly that we approach the matter from very different standpoints.  Let me say that in the case of this amendment we are dealing with the position of a board of aldermen, and then we are dealing with one particular matter with which the board of aldermen might be concerned.  For instance, paragraph (4) in the amendment, about the dismissal of officers, might be more satisfactorily dealt with when consideration has been given, as I promised, to amendment No. 26.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, it would be of a size that would come to a decision after the fullest discussion, and not too long-drawn-out discussion such as you would have in a large council.  I submit that Deputy de Valera practically subscribes to my outlook on the matter when he considers that a council of thirty, which he proposes, cannot satisfactorily do the work without setting up a small body of aldermen to keep in close touch with things.  I do not understand what is meant by a body of aldermen meeting frequently, keeping in close touch with the manager, and supervising his work.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, &ldquo;keeping in contact with.&rdquo;  The position is that we recognise that there are definite spheres of control that ought to be completely in the hands of the council as the government of the city, and we enshrine these in the reserved functions, and further say that, if the council, in certain circumstances, considers that their reserved functions are to be added to they can be added to, but outside these reserved functions you make the manager be held responsible for dealing with all other matters and carrying on the administrative work of the city.  In the carrying on of the executive work of the city it is worth while to refer to Section 14, which says that every act or thing done, and every decision taken by the manager in the exercise of his duties, which in other circumstances would require a resolution of the Corporation, will be done by the manager signing an order, and that signed order will be kept registered, and the register will be kept by the town clerk keeping copies.  All the signed orders will come up before the council at every meeting of the council, so that no action will be taken by the manager that, in ordinary circumstances, would require a resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Just for information. They are orders dealing with actions taken by the manager in the exercise of the control and responsibility that has been definitely put on him, and they are for the information of the council.  If there is anything continuing in the issue of the order, any line of policy, or any action of the manager as a whole objected to, the council can make that the basis of a resolution by two-thirds of their number to express their want of confidence in him.  I do not know what other class of actions of the manager a board of aldermen needs to keep in touch with.  If you are going definitely to divide the administrative responsibility from the governing responsibility I do not know what interference in administration, what particular day to day inquiry the information in connection with which would not crystallise at the meetings of the council, would be necessary.  I oppose the idea of the council setting up a sub-body inside itself to interfere in the manager's work.  Given a small council of a handy size it could take decisions clearly, and with a touch of finality about them, that leaves the subject in such a position for decision, that it is handed straight over to the manager, and he takes administrative responsibility.  His administrative responsibility is unimpeded by any such body as a board of aldermen.  If the manager is to shoulder administrative responsibility in the way that he should, he should be able to do it without interference from outside, and if he is going to be in such a position that the council can judge him fairly and squarely, then he must not be interfered with.  I oppose the board of aldermen.  It is part of the thirty-member council scheme and, while intending no doubt to bring about a clear situation where you have the council doing governing work and the manager doing administrative work, this would put a kind of nebulous area in between, and no one could tell whether the aldermen were going to <Col N="454" /> do administrative work or going to do the governmental work.  No question of safeguarding the rights of the employees or anything of that kind need necessarily be drawn into the discussion on a board of aldermen.  Any safeguarding of the rights of employees of the Corporation can be dealt with when we come to consider amendment 26 in Deputy de Valera's name that has been put aside.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendment, but, at the same time, to say that I feel a certain amount of sympathy with what the Minister has suggested in relation to the council, when he singles out the board of aldermen for particular attention.  I would rather give the amendment my wholehearted support if Deputy de Valera could see his way to withdraw the words &ldquo;board of aldermen&rdquo; and substitute them by the words &ldquo;the council.&rdquo; I agree with the Minister that you are about to set up by this amendment, if it is passed, a sort of Seanad within the Corporation of Cork that I do not want to see set up.  I do not want to see any second chamber in Cork.  The council would be good enough for me, but, as I said, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister when he suggests that this board of aldermen is not to be constituted a body of supermen.  The portion of the amendment beginning with the words &ldquo;any officer, servant or corporation, etc.,&rdquo; should, I think, commend itself to many members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, because, after all, it is only fair to any official who might incur the hostility of the city manager that he should have the right of appeal to the borough council. The managership to be set up will, after all, only be a human institution, and the manager for the time being will not be a superman.  I suppose we can take that for granted at any rate.  I am quite confident that the amendment moved by Deputy de Valera is one that will appeal to the citizens of Cork of all classes.</P>

      <P>I think I said at the beginning, when I came to deal with this Bill, that my sole concern was good democratic government and sound administration in Cork, and I propose dealing with this amendment in the same spirit.  Frankly, I find it rather difficult to keep that particular philosophic attitude of mind in face of what seems to me&mdash;I do not want to be unkind about it&mdash;a certain amount of woodenness on the part of those who have drafted this Bill.  There does not seem to me to be a desire to reach out for the co-operation of broad-minded men prepared to co-operate in getting a proper Bill through, and I suggest that, in any further discussions on this whole Bill, we should recognise that more.  It is a fact, and a fact which has to be taken into account, that the majority for this Bill is ridiculously small.  It is a fact, too, that has to be taken into account that in that majority, as made up, there is a section representing a considerable voting power in this Dáil which does not represent voting power outside. You have a nominal majority here in favour of this Bill up to the present. What I am saying now is towards the line of asking that there should be consideration of the fact that there is very definite and strong opposition, and that it ought to be taken as sincere opposition, to a good deal that is in this Bill. The Government ought to recognise that, and ought not to attempt to force it through by factitious methods.  Take, for instance, the whole representation of one of the universities.</P>

At the moment, what I am suggesting is that we should recognise that a Bill of this kind, which is going, unfortunately, to be the basis of local government for the country, should not be treated as a matter to be decided simply by little majorities of that kind.  A small council of fifteen&mdash;that is what is behind it.  There are 152 members in this House, and 20 of us are here discussing this Bill.  Remember the others are in the building.  If we demand of our local representatives no more sense of responsibility as to the duties which they ought to perform, then we have to ask ourselves, what sort of a quorum are you going to have if you have fifteen members.  I suggest two, or less than two.  I think you ought to face that fact.  I am in favour of a small council unhesitatingly.  I am not putting a tooth on it, and never did, but I am in favour of a council large enough to provide something approaching a quorum, and I do not think you will get it with fifteen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As far as I understand the board of aldermen, it is going to be a sort of general purposes committee. I am in favour of a general purposes committee, whether you call it by the name of aldermen or not, though I do not like the name of aldermen.  I am in favour of a general purposes committee which might meet considerably oftener than could the council.  I see a good deal in the council not choosing&mdash;I do not think Deputy Anthony meant it in any strong sense &mdash;not necessarily supermen, but five of the best men whom they could choose, and who would be more continuously in touch with the details of what happened in all these cases.  Deputy Anthony is as familiar as I am with these boards&mdash;harbour boards, etc. They form sub-committees, because fifteen or twenty men would not discuss the various questions that would come up for consideration.  This board of aldermen, as I understand, would be a responsible and continuous sub-committee. Deputy Anthony may object to the word &ldquo;aldermen,&rdquo; and I do not love it, but I think that he would be in <Col N="459" /> favour, and I think that most people who think this thing out fairly would be in favour, of some sort of a general purposes committee being set up.</P>

      <P>I think there would be common agreement, if we had a talk around a table about the desirability of having a general purposes committee, and we could square out any difficulties as regards names and functions which might arise.  I suggest that the Minister should accept as a principle that there shall be this general purposes committee, specially qualified men selected by the council.  Once that is accepted in principle the details can be very easily settled between Deputy Anthony, the Minister, Deputy de Valera, myself and others interested in the matter.  If the Minister wants to concentrate on that clause I will leave it at that, and go back to Clause 4 afterwards.  I suggest that the general principle of that should be accepted as a principle which unites instead of divides the House on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly am not prepared at this Stage to admit in <Col N="460" /> any way the necessity for enshrining in legislation a provision for a general purposes committee, with a definition of its duties.  I am not prepared to admit at this stage at all that the thing is necessary.  There is nothing to prevent the council setting up any committee it wants to set up, but I do not want to introduce in this particular scheme as between the council with full responsibility, and a manager who has clearly defined responsibilities, any other kind of a body that will blur the position of one or the other.  That is the position as far as the board of aldermen is concerned.  With regard to the suggestion that the second part of this particular amendment is being accepted in one way or another by people making any representations from Cork, the only representation I have had made in any way that would appear to be representations that Deputy Flinn suggests is the following short statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We, the undersigned ratepayers of Cork, beg to express our approval of the Cork City Management Bill, 1928, and to record our concurrence in the following resolution unanimously adopted by the joint Councils of the Cork Chamber of Commerce and the Cork Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping, and confirmed by a general meeting of the members of the two Cork Chambers of Commerce held on July 9th, 1928:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;That this meeting of the members of the Cork Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping and the Cork Chamber of Commerce, approve of the Cork City Management Bill, 1928, but consider that the officials appointed by the Local Appointments Commission should have the right of appeal to the Minister in case of suspension or removal from office.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that there is nothing, as far as I know, in the statement that representations were made to me from Cork that a board of aldermen is wanted for the purpose of protecting the officials there.  The Deputy apparently has made some mistake in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a meeting of that very <Col N="461" /> august body, or a meeting of the two august bodies to which he referred, was held before the date mentioned in that letter, or petition, and that the council dissolved without coming to any decision, and that it was only after a special whip had been made of every reactionary in Cork that they were able to pass that resolution &mdash;a special whip of all the people who were inimical all along the line to the national aspirations of the people of Cork and the Saorstát, and that it was only after a strenuous whip they were able to pass that resolution.  I would like the Minister to examine the signatures to that resolution and the personnel of the two chambers, and he would see then who are the people behind this Bill and who are backing it up in Cork.  They never did a day's work for this country, and they never will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>As we go on, the real motive behind this Bill is becoming more evident.  We have it from the Minister that he wants no sub-committee and no board of aldermen.  As has been pointed out, at meetings of the council you will find only two or three members turning up, for they have practically no powers and can only endorse what the manager says. The Minister has simply shown us his mind and the mind of the Cabinet.  The whole idea is that municipal government is to be completely revolutionised. The work that had been done by committees in Dublin and Cork is now to be done by managers.  All that is asked for in this amendment is that there shall be one sub-committee which shall supervise the manager's work, be in close touch with him, and know exactly what he is doing.  I think that that is the very least that could be given towards local control. I do not like the word &ldquo;aldermen,&rdquo; but we think that the sub-committee should be elected by the council, which we think should be larger.  Provision should be made for that sub-committee in the Bill, and, if it is not, the manager will be able to do what he likes.  Nobody will take much interest in things, as nobody will have much power, and you will have a civil servant doing all the work.  The Minister mentioned that this was going to be a representative body, but I have shown him that it is not as representative as it might be.  He knows that now.  Anyhow, we were beaten on that, and you are going to elect them in three instalments.  The Minister made no case against the amendment.  He wiped out every sub-committee that was formerly in Cork, and it will be the same in Dublin.  The reactionary people who induced him to do this are the very people, as the President could tell us, who got Dublin a bad name thirty years ago.  The list of people which the Minister read out here contains the same type of people, as Deputy de Valera pointed out last week, who paid more attention to their own business <Col N="463" /> than to that of the city, with the result that Dublin bacame a by-word.  It is at the dictates of these people that we are going to put the principle of local government under foot, and it is just a foretaste of what we will get later in the case of Dublin.  I submit that no case has been made against the amendment.</P>

      <P>Unless I am misinterpreting the amendment I do not see the necessity for the inclusion of the first portion.  The manager is not prohibited from consultation with the members of the corporation or any number of them, much less with a restricted number, such as a board of aldermen.  He is entitled to do that. If there were no amendment such as No. 35 there would be nothing to prevent the manager from taking the members of the corporation into his confidence and consulting them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That right is there already.  He is not bound by any decision if they come to a decision. There is no indication that they are entitled to come to any decision, but he is simply to consult them.  I do not know if Deputies opposite have read the sub-section, but that is how I see it. There is no prohibition on the new council to set up any committee, much less a sub-committee.  Deputy Flinn called it a responsible and continuous sub-committee.  I would not call it a sub-committee.  The council in Cork has power to set up a general purposes committee, if that body, when set up, constituted a smaller number of its representatives. That would be a sub-committee, but to call this a sub-committee is wrong.  I do not know whether the Deputy meant anything particular about it, but there is no prohibition on the council to set up a committee. From my experience I would not confine membership to the aldermen of the <Col N="464" /> council.  There were committees of the Dublin Corporation, when I was a member, which were necessarily manned according to statute by aldermen. I do not know the reason of that, but I think it had some connection with the old mediaeval idea that boards of aldermen were a very responsible part of such institutions.  This is really something which existed in the pre-1849 period of municipal bodies in this country, and I do not think that it is a good idea to resurrect it according to statute.  As I say, there is no prohibition on them from doing this as the Bill stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the amendment, I find myself in this position. It is more than likely that the principal business of the council, if this is allowed to stand, will be to review all those cases in which the manager is of opinion that a person should be dismissed. That will not be in the interests of efficiency, of efficiencies of service, and, certainly not, of the good name of the Corporation.  If we are talking so much about democracy, why have you got two-thirds majority?  I understand that the main purpose of the Bill is to take away from the council questions of detail in connection with municipal management which form the basis of discussion in most councils, certainly in many of the councils that I read about.  It is by no means a good system.  I believe that there is general agreement here, and even outside, that there must be efficiency and capable service on the part of servants of municipal bodies.  I ask anyone who has experience of public bodies to say whether, from their own recollection or from what they heard, there have been cases of victimisation by public bodies.  Is it not quite the other way, that the weaknesses, the imperfections, the inattentions to duty have been the causes of canvassing with a view to exercising charitable instincts, as we are told? &ldquo;Why do this hardship to this poor fellow?&rdquo; The result of all these acts of weakness on the part of the municipal bodies is a lessening of the morale of the whole body of municipal servants. I ask, having regard to that experience, which I think anyone with a <Col N="465" /> knowledge of public affairs will admit, is this going to improve the municipal service in the City of Cork?  Is there really in this House a suspicion that the term of office of any officials of the Corporation will be prejudicially affected by this manager?  I see that Deputy Corry nods his head.  He is the only one.</P>

He is a consumptive with a hacking cough and the morning was very cold.  It was sleeting and raining.  The man had never <Col N="466" /> a charge against him during his service in the Corporation.  He is a man of high character and he gave efficient and useful service for 25 or 27 years. I am not going to confine myself to 25 or 27 years, because I like to be accurate in these matters.  I am cutting out his good service.  He was sacked because he was seven minutes late.  He is now dying of consumption.  Deputy Barry Egan knows the facts as well as I do.

      <P>That is the case. Deputy Anthony has made a good case, but during my time as a member of the Dublin Corporation I heard a much better case made in respect of worse instances.  Taking it that the facts are as the Deputy has said, it is a charitable act on the Deputy's part. The man was paid to be there at 7 o'clock.  I admit that if he were in my employment I would not dismiss him for being seven minutes late, but there is another question involved when he is an employee of a public body.  I am not at all saying that I would dismiss him if I were a member of a public body, but we should recollect that in the public service attendance at a specific hour is demanded.</P>

The point we have got to consider is the principle involved, the principle of responsibility of a particular person.  Deputy de Valera's amendment seeks to review a decision of that sort.  A review might mean, after inquiring into all the facts of the case, affirming the order, but not affirming the justness or the correctness of a decision.  I will not go so far <Col N="468" /> as to say that it is plain from the amendment that it is really within the competence of this body to judge on the merits.  The Deputy would not answer if I were to put him the problem that if a man were half an hour late and if two-thirds of the council considered that he should be reinstated, whether that would be right or wrong. It is not clear according to this.  That might occur in every case.  What I see wrong about this amendment is that it opens the door to canvassing again of two-thirds of the council.  I would venture to say that it should be a majority of the council, if it is to be in the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>The whole case is being made for reducing the thing to one on the principle that there may be fewer people to be corrupted.  The President made a speech which was purely and simply a series of debating points.  He has made no attempt fairly to envisage what is, in principle, behind this thing. He says that you are going to have canvassing of the board, of which two-thirds have got to vote.  He says human nature is responsible.  Behind that, if it means anything, is this meaning, that in no public board can you get one-third of your elected men honest.  That is the plain issue.  The official who has to be supported by the to-be-canvassed Minister for Local Government is the only man who is honest.  We predicate, that is our basis and premises in our whole argument, that in local administration you cannot get one-third of the whole representation, by any system of election, which <Col N="469" /> will be honest.  Human nature is to apply to all the elected members, but not to the to-be-canvassed manager appointed and holding office at the will and the pleasure of the to-be-canvassed Minister for Local Government, dependent upon four votes in this House, capable of being thrown out if he refuses to be canvassed, apparently at the present moment, by any two members of this House.  Human nature! They have found some extraordinary system by which they can find for the government of local administration the honest men that they cannot find to put on their own front bench.  They have found some patent system by which they can distribute all over the country men whom they cannot prevent strategising down the country in relation to roads and bogs.  Human nature is to operate for every one of us, but not for the to-be-nominated servants of the to-be-canvassed Ministers opposite.</P>

      <P>Pending a proposal as to numbers by the Minister. When you are getting rid of the one argument that there is for a small council, namely, that it has executive functions&mdash;that is the only substantial argument that there is for a small council of fifteen&mdash;once you get rid of that as you are, by the Bill itself, by vesting executive functions in a single individual, I hope that the majority of Deputies will stand for a council big enough to be representative of all sections and interests in Cork.  I indicated roughly what I thought would be a reasonably-sized council, and I gave thirty as the number which I was prepared to work on as a basis.  I indicated on Second Reading that any number, say, from twenty-five to thirty would satisfy me. Sometimes it is convenient in matters of this kind to have a certain amount of latitude, when you are drawing up amendments, as to the precise number. For example, if you are dividing Cork into three areas, it might be found that to give more accurate proportional representation a number like twenty-seven or twenty-eight or twenty-five would be better.  I would certainly be prepared to meet the difficulty of any situation of that kind by taking a number between thirty and say twenty-five. Roughly, from twenty-five to thirty would be the range which I think we ought to have before us when we are picturing the size of the council.  A smaller council would not be sufficiently representative of the interests in Cork to allow a proper decision to be taken on some of the matters that will come before the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that when you have a body of fifteen, four or five will be unavoidably absent.  Four or five will roughly be the number out of thirty or twenty-five, just as out of fifteen.  It may not work out absolutely like that, but generally you find that there is a <Col N="471" /> certain number absent, and that it is not proportional always to the whole size of the council.  Allowing for the unavoidable absence of four or five in a council of fifteen, you have practically a working council taking decisions with, say, ten present.  Six will be a majority, and their decision may very well not be a decision which will be as representative of the position as you will get if you have a fuller council more thoroughly representative of the interests involved.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is mainly because I have in mind a council of that size that I am anxious to have a smaller body that will be able to keep in touch with the manager.  What is the necessity for keeping in touch with the manager?  First of all, with a man who has such power as is going to be given to this manager, it is good for him to know that there are people examining the particular details of his administration.  They may not have power to interfere, but they will have, at a certain time, the power to criticise, and their criticism will be effective because it will be informed criticism. They will know the details.  We have very often to criticise matters of administration here, and I wish there was an arrangement by which it would be possible to get in closer touch with the details than it is at present for those in opposition, even though those keeping in touch were only able to keep in touch from the point of view of collecting information as to exactly what was being done.</P>
    <P>There is another function proposed here for this small body.  We know very well that when a manager takes action in any particular case it becomes very difficult for him, if he is going to maintain his authority, to reverse engines and do something else.  It is very much better that members of the council, representative of those ultimately affected, should have an opportunity of making representations before the final action is taken.  If a manager proposes to take a certain action&mdash;suppose it is a question even of dismissing a certain official&mdash;it is a very useful thing that certain representations could be made.  I have given the <Col N="472" /> example of an official, but that actually is not the case in which it would apply; but we have no other definite case coming before us where representation should be made.  I am not able to give at the moment a satisfactory example of the type of action which was in contemplation about which representation would be made, but we can easily see in the case of a manager having all the functions he will have, that occasions will arise in which the representatives of the people should have an opportunity before he takes action of making representations of a certain kind to him.  They cannot make representations if they do not know that a certain thing is to be done, and the value of having this board as a consultative board will be to provide machinery by which representations might be made if the manager said that he proposed to do so-and-so.  That is the idea of consultation.  They might make representations to him which might very well make him change his mind on the matter.  I believe that there is very often an advantage in a multiplicity of counsels of this particular kind, provided that finally the man has the responsibility of taking the action, having heard such representations as are made.</P>
    <P>That is not going to weaken him in the slightest in his executive authority.  It is not going to weaken him in his determination to act in the way he thinks right.  In fact, a man who has heard representations, and has weighed the pros and cons that have been put forward, and who, after having heard these, is still satisfied, is really in a stronger position than if these representations had not been made because he feels, if there is a definite body bound to make representations of that kind, that the objections will be formally put forward and that he will not lose sight of them.  If he is satisfied that he should not act in accordance with them, then he is really stronger, because he has satisfied himself that the objections to the line of action which he proposes cannot be sustained.  There is no weakness in that at all.  It is not going to weaken the manager; it is going to strengthen the manager.  I hope, at <Col N="473" /> any rate, that it will be provided somewhere in the Bill that the manager will be ultimately responsible to the Council.  I do not expect the Minister wants to remove the manager from being ultimately responsible. Therefore, if there is a question of his having to account for his actions he is in the strong position that some representatives on the council already know the details of the case and that they are going to judge it with information and not pass judgment in the manner in which judgments sometimes are passed in matters of that kind&mdash;more or less on hearsay and on some general statement made and not substantiated.  So that, in fact, the position of the manager would be strengthened, and at the same time he would be prevented many times from doing harm.  It is a good thing for a man to know that he is being watched.  I do not use the word &ldquo;supervise&rdquo; because it might be given a different meaning from what I would like to give it if I used it here.  If a man's actions are under observation, it is a good thing for him, and even keeps a man straight where he would be inclined to be weak if he felt his authority was altogether arbitrary. Accordingly, I hold you should have, for proper representation, a council much bigger than fifteen, and if you want to keep constant contact with the manager to help him and to strengthen him as well as to prevent him from doing wrong you ought to have a body of this kind.</P>
    <P>With reference to the name &ldquo;alderman,&rdquo; I do not mind about the name at all.  The name occurred in the Bill and I simply took it.  The aldermen in the Bill have no functions at all.  If, on the other hand, you make them a body to be elected by the council, you give them very special functions over and above those of the ordinary councillors.  You associate them in a certain consultative capacity with the executive government of the city.  But as that name comes to hand.  I do not see any particular reason for rejecting it.  I do not mind what name this body goes by.  It was the definite name to hand and I put it down.  I hope the Minister will not adhere as rigidly as he appears to be determined <Col N="474" /> to do to the proposal that the body shall be of the small number of fifteen.  I hope he will make the council sufficiently large to be really representative. What is his reason for small numbers?  Length of debates, is it? The only arguments for reducing the numbers to small dimensions is that there may be lengthy debates.  Very well.  You can get four or five sitting around a table&mdash;that is my experience &mdash;that will cause as lengthy debates as the members of a council of thirty. They have to act in a more formal manner than persons sitting round a table. You introduce a certain amount of formality when you have a large number. It helps to get through the work.  Particularly as they will have to make decisions only on big matters, I do not see any reason why the council ought not to be fairly large.  If it is large you will want a small body to keep in touch with the executive work, and you can give them a number of other functions. That one that was indicated about dismissal simply fitted in, and that is the only reason for associating it with the setting up of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony, who says he supports this amendment, shows quite clearly that he appreciates my point of view in not wanting to have a board of aldermen or anything like that to come in between the council and their responsibility and the manager.  There is nothing to prevent the council setting up any committee they want to set up. I am not prepared to legislate in such a way that they will have to set up a general purposes committee or a board of aldermen or anything like that.  In the first place, it would be providing in a statutory way that a certain body, which I am not convinced is required, should be formed.  It would be putting a statutory obligation on the council to set up a body that they might think was not wanted.  If they want a body to carry out any particular class of work, they can set it up.  On the other hand, from some of the remarks of Deputy de Valera, one would think that the manager was going to live in Belfast or somewhere like that, and to make his moves and issue his orders as to what should be done in carrying out <Col N="475" /> the work in Cork, without any possibility of touch with the council, the Lord Mayor or anybody else.</P>
      <P>The constant co-operation and the constant touch between the council and the manager is essential for success in the proper running of the city.  And the council must and ought to be able to take steps to provide for that.  So that, so far from the council being blind as to what exactly are the main things the manager is doing, and the main business he is pushing ahead at any particular moment, the council ought not to be in the dark in regard to them. But I can imagine the council being in the dark if you interpose between the council and the manager a smaller body.  I can easily imagine the smaller body going beyond its region and interfering with the manager in his own responsibility.  In so far as the Deputy suggested that a small council will give you a very small quorum, I am not prepared to accept that right away, because when you hear analogies drawn between this House and the attendance in the House, and a municipal council and the attendance at a municipal council, you have immediately to realise that the comparison is being strained. The class of work from the point of view of each of the individual Deputies here is very different from the class of work which would be going on in a municipal council from the point of view of each of the individual representatives there.  I do not think there is any point in the smallness of the quorum, and if there is, it is all the more reason for seeing that the council as a whole attended to matters that should be attended to in that particular way rather than that a smaller body should do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That this House is of opinion, having regard to the inadequacy of the provision at present made for widows and for orphans bereft of their breadwinners, and to the desirability of removing all stigma of pauperism in such cases, that the establishment of a scheme of insurance to provide pensions and allowances for widows and orphans would be desirable, and accordingly requests the Executive Council to prepare and present to the House a report upon such schemes of insurance and estimates of the cost.</P>
      <P>I know of no subject with which the time of the Dáil could be better occupied. This subject is one which has been considered and dealt with in many countries, and I think it would be desirable that the House should have an opportunity of hearing some of the history of schemes of this kind in many other countries where they have been the subject of consideration and where legislation in their favour has been enacted for a number of years. As long ago as 1919 forty of the United States had schemes of this kind passed into law.  The State of Missouri led the way in that work by establishing a committee to control the boarding out of children with their own mothers, and this is true of many other countries also.  During the last four or five years we have had, very often, comparisons made between Denmark and this country.  Denmark is a small country, largely agricultural, and has been very often compared with Ireland in the matter of necessity for legislation.  Denmark has had a scheme of this kind since 1914, showing that a small country can be very often a pioneer in schemes of great national importance.  In Denmark a woman with four children, even having property to the value of £350, comes within the terms of the State scheme that has been prepared for dealing with such cases.  They have aimed in that country at preventing destitution rather than tackling destitution when it has occurred, as is shown by the provision that people with a certain amount of property are entitled to benefit under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that country, the cost of the <Col N="481" /> scheme is shared between the State and the local authority equally.  Similar schemes have been prepared and carried into law in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  These countries have the great benefit of such schemes for many years.  The same thing applies to many other countries such as British Columbia, New Zealand and Hungary. In one country, Western Australia, no direct legislation has been enacted for this purpose but the matter is provided for in another fashion.  This extract from a report by the officers in charge of the Children's Department will show that: &ldquo;It is considered by the officers of the State Children's Department that the system that they have provided as an alternative has a beneficial effect on social conditions in Western Australia and, as a consequence, there are few delinquent children in industrial schools.&rdquo;  In England, and the northern portion of this country, a similar scheme was enacted in 1926 and since that time provision has been made for the payment of ten shillings per week for the widow, five shillings for the eldest child, and three shillings for each younger child.  For some years a number of people in this city, and in other portions of the country, have been seeking to attract attention to the need for a scheme of this kind and, though they have not got very far in the matter of attracting general support, with a view to having the issue raised in an assembly like this, up to the present, they have had practical sympathy with their proposals demonstrated in various directions all over the country.  As long ago as 1919 the following resolution was passed by several public bodies in this country:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the time has arrived when the burden imposed by the poor law system should be lightened by the establishment of adequate State pensions for widows and orphans and calls for immediate action to this effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The provincial press, at that time, favourably commented on the proposals and a meeting in Limerick city presided over by the Mayor endorsed the proposal as well as a similar meeting in Cork.  Some years ago the matter was discussed at the international Labour <Col N="482" /> conference at Berne and the Irish Labour representatives were prominent in putting forward demands in this direction at that assembly.</P>
    <P>The idea of this motion is to bring up this matter for consideration by the responsible national authority.  There are very many reasons that could be advanced why this matter was not attended to up to the present, but there is, in my opinion, a very clear case for asking the Executive Council to go into this matter very fully and examine the whole question with a view to seeing what suitable schemes could be adopted for the benefit of the most deserving section of the people of this country. When the motion was originally tabled the press suggested that it was a matter on which the party which I belong to should take the initiative, that it was our duty to prepare a scheme of this kind and to submit it to the House.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have not the opportunity of getting the details and the information that would be necessary for submitting a scheme and, as is well known, no private member of this House has any right to submit a Bill involving financial considerations.  The whole matter would be ruled out on the grounds that no provision was made for power of that kind being exercised by private Deputies.  This, then, is the alternative, and it suggests that the whole question should be examined with a view to seeing what could be done in that direction.</P>
    <P>We have some information as to how many people the scheme would affect. In August, 1919, we had 3,233 widows with two or more children getting outdoor relief.  The poor law administration in 1916 cost £1,400,000, and widows and orphans were responsible for a big proportion of that expenditure.  We had at that time 4,000 children in Irish work houses and 2,500 boarded out; we had 1,000 in poor law schools.  Industrial schools cost £176,000 and reformatories £19,000.  The figures are altered somewhat, and recently we had information conveyed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, in answer to a question by Deputy Byrne.  That question was put last week, and the Minister said that from the returns supplied by the local authorities <Col N="483" /> concerned the answer to the first part of the question was 6,973, and the total amount paid during the year ended 31st March, 1928, was £118,600. I mention these figures in order to show that there are very large numbers in the country who would be affected by this scheme.  It is most desirable that everything possible should be done by the national authority to remove the taint of pauperism and give dignity and decency to unfortunate people bereft of their breadwinners as a result of the visitation of death to the home.</P>
    <P>Some little provision has been made under the Workmen's Compensation Act for widows and orphans whose breadwinners have been taken away, but that Act affects only a small number of people.  The number of breadwinners killed in the course of their duties is small in comparison with the number who die in their homes and who leave large numbers of women and children dependents quartered on the local funds.  I speak with some knowledge on this subject because, as a member of a local authority, I know of no more unhappy position than that of the unfortunate women and children who have to seek assistance from a local authority.  I know of no more degrading or demoralising system, and I would like very much if some alternative could be found.  I desire to direct attention to the large number of people who have put up with poverty in its worst form rather than look for outdoor relief or charity in other forms. We have made provision for dealing with the welfare of the people in many respects; we have considered many matters that will tend to improve the position of the people in one direction or another.  Now the time has come when the biggest blot that we have upon our social system ought to be removed.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned certain figures in order to show that this proposition is not as alarming as some people would imagine.  I realise that the financial aspect of the question, the provision of funds, will present some difficulty, but I submit that when the present charges in the matter of home assistance, the maintenance of large numbers in <Col N="484" /> county homes, maintenance in industrial schools, and the amount paid out by charitable organisations are considered, you will have a very big set-off against any charges that this proposed scheme will entail.  You will have in addition a position created in which you will have lifted a great number of respectable people out of the rut of pauperism, and you will have given them a dignified status that another House many years ago conferred on our old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>I have had experience for some years of the hopelessness of doing anything useful for children who are reared in institutions like county homes.  Occasionally people go out of such institutions and do well, but generally the environment in institutions like that is calculated, in my opinion, to injure the future of a child.  The children are kept in an atmosphere that is not at all good for them, and very often they become the failures that we see in different walks of life in this country.  I agree that often industrial schools do very good work, but we have an alarming number of failures amongst the children turned out by industrial schools.  I suggest that this whole scheme would show its good effects in every phase of the life of this country if it were tackled by responsible authorities.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 1919-20 very prominent members of this House gave their support to a similar demand.  The democratic programme of the First Dáil has special application to this whole question.  The principle article of that programme has been often quoted in this House in support of arguments advanced for the benefit of the poor.  It has particular application to this motion, because it says that it shall be the duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical and mental and spiritual well being of the children.  This is really a matter affecting the children, because it is the future generation of this country that will have to be looked to if the progress and development that are hoped for, and that are indicated along the lines of our recent legislation, are going to materialise.  At the 1918 General Election forty-five candidates holding different political views <Col N="485" /> accorded their support to the demand, and a large number of public bodies also supported the case.</P>
    <P>We have recently had an endorsement of this proposal from the Poor Law Commission.  The Poor Law Commission went into the whole question of poor law reform in this country and they said in their report that the information that was made available to them in connection with the people who were concerned caused them to stand definitely for it and that they were entirely in favour of a scheme of this kind.  I feel that there is an unanswerable case for this motion and that a preliminary to the establishment of a scheme of this kind is to get an examination into the costs and that the fit and proper authority to make that examination with the information at its disposal is the Executive Council of the Saorstát.  The sympathy for the proposal has come from various quarters and that sympathy has been shown time and again. It can be demonstrated properly by a full discussion of this motion and by the desire to hammer out a scheme as a result of this motion.</P>
    <P>We have provided for the improvement of livestock in this country.  We have provided for the development of industrial power in the country.  We have provided for better educational facilities but we have forgotten entirely up to the present the large number of people who are victims of the unhappy poor law system that obtains in the country at the moment.  Nothing that we can do in any direction will be more deserving than the work that this motion deals with.  It is laying the foundations of a population that will be self-respecting, dignified and decent, in so far as this State can make them so&mdash;providing for the health of the people as well as their welfare generally. We have, at the present time, the unhappy position that as a result of poverty in the homes, as a result of the natural reluctance of the people to avail themselves of the charity that the local public bodies very often grudgingly give them, we have a large number of people whose health and well-being suffer considerably.</P>
    <P>I would submit that this country would be capable of bearing the cost of <Col N="486" /> the scheme.  I submit that the set off that will be provided by a reduction in what is paid in other directions will largely make up the expense of a scheme of this kind.  I hope that the Dáil will agree to the principle that the time has arrived when the five or six thousand people who are now in receipt of home assistance can be taken out of that position and be given the status that the old age pensioners have enjoyed for a number of years.  I do not want to discuss the merits of a particular scheme.  In most countries, the central authority is the tax-bearing authority in a scheme of this kind.  In England and in the North of Ireland, the scheme provided for under the Act of 1926 has been a contributory one.</P>
    <P>While I am not anxious to discuss the merits or demerits of a particular scheme, I am anxious that this matter should be dealt with practically, and that we should have consideration from the responsible authority for some scheme tending to bring about the tremendous improvement that can be brought about as a result of it. After all, we are concerned altogether with the people of this country, and nothing that we can do towards enacting laws for the regulation of affairs in this country will go as far as the laws that will be calculated to bring a certain measure of comfort into the homes of the people.  A measure of this kind will bring a certain measure of self-reliance and a certain amount of contentment as a result of the fact that the people are regarded as the care of the State, and that the State is concerning itself with improving the lot of each person who is in the position of being dependent on some other avenue&mdash; some undesirable avenue&mdash;at the present moment for her maintenance.  The Dáil, in my opinion, can do no bigger work, and no more important work than giving their careful consideration to this matter.  If the result of it will be that this matter becomes one of practical politics, then it will have advanced tremendously, and the results that will follow from it will be demonstrated very clearly in a short time.</P>
    <P>It is very fortunate, I think, that we have here now representatives of all the parties who were concerned in the <Col N="487" /> democratic programme of the first Dáil.  This matter will have a particular interest for them all.  Certain expressions of opinion that prominent members of this House gave voice to a few years ago will, I think, ensure that this motion will be very fully considered by this House.  I submit the case for this motion, conscious of the fact that it is one of tremendous importance, if not of tremendous urgency. A huge number of people in the State are looking forward to this matter with considerable interest.  I am satisfied that the Dáil can do no better work than consider the matter carefully.  I feel sure that if this motion leads to the establishment of a scheme of this kind it will be a monument to the work of the Dáil and will live long after this Dáil and the memory of it have passed away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I have to express the hope that this motion will meet with the general acceptance of the House. It seems impossible to deny that the provision made at the present time for widows and orphans is inadequate.  I am sure that no one who concedes that will question that it is the duty of the State to redress that inadequacy, and in doing so not to do violence to the self-respect and the feelings of those whose necessity or poverty compels them to have recourse to public relief. We support this motion because it merely asks, in the first place, to have an investigation made into one of the principal recommendations of the Commission on the relief of the destitute and sick poor.  That Commission was set up under the aegis of this House by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in March, 1925.  In their report on this matter, the Commission said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have received a considerable amount of evidence in favour of removing <Col N="488" /> destitute widows and children from the purview of the poor law.  It is urged that the present system of poor relief for widows, even when administered sympathetically, is altogether inadequate, that the assistance allowed varies considerably, and that, except in Dublin, there does not seem to be a regular scale, that it is hurtful to the self-respect of these women who have been reduced to destitution through the deaths of their husbands to be compelled to parade their poverty every week at the office of the home assistance officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, on page 126, the report again refers to this matter as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are satisfied that the boards of health, whilst acting with more liberality than their predecessors, still fall short of discharging their full obligations in regard to persons eligible for relief who cannot be sent to institutions, and this applies particularly to the cases of widows with children and able-bodied men with dependent families.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are in favour,&rdquo; the Commission goes on to say, &ldquo;of the scheme of mothers' pensions payable by the State.&rdquo;  One thing that is noteworthy in connection with this motion is that the principle of it was accepted, I think, so far back as 1847, when the Poor Law Relief Act of that year imposed on guardians of the poor the duty of relieving destitute widows with two or more legitimate children.  The operation of the principle was extended further by the Act of 1923, which laid it down that no person eligible for relief shall be relieved in any institution provided and maintained under the scheme unless he can be relieved effectively in such institution at less cost than in any other lawful way.  It is obvious, therefore, that the principle of the motion has been accepted by the Government, and that the only question that remains for us to consider is whether the relief afforded in the Act of 1923 has been adequate and whether it is given in the best way.  As to the adequacy of the relief, I do not think it is possible for us to reject the specific findings of the Commission to which I <Col N="489" /> have referred.  On page 56 of the report the Commission says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are satisfied from the statistics placed before us, and from the evidence that boards of health, while perhaps acting with more liberality than their predecessors, still fall short of discharging their full obligations in regard to persons eligible for relief who cannot be sent to institutions and this applies particularly to the cases of widows with children and able bodied males with dependent families.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In paragraph 174 the Commission gives figures abstracted from the home assistance and outdoor relief registers of the weekly sums awarded by the different boards of health and boards of guardians to widows.  These figures deal with widows in varying circumstances, some of them without children, the slight majority of them with children varying up to the number of five, and the amounts allowed varied from 2/6 in very few cases up to between 5/- and 10/- in the majority, with above 10/- in a small number.  As Deputy Murphy has informed the House, the Commission shows that something like 6,924 such widows were relieved in one week in 1926, and that the number of cases of home assistance in that year was 20,153.  With regard to the amount of relief afforded to all the cases in general, the Commission states&mdash;and I would like this expression of opinion to be considered in relation to the question of adequacy&mdash;&ldquo;An analysis of the amount allowed shows that the assistance granted can only be looked on&rdquo;&mdash; and these are very significant words&mdash;&ldquo;as a supplement to other means, or to what can be got by begging and from charitable sources.&rdquo;  The implication clearly is this, that the State, so far, has not sufficiently recognised its duty to these widows.  If they are entitled to such relief, I submit that they are entitled to such relief as will save them from the humiliation of having to beg their bread, and the mere fact that, in the opinion of this Commission, the allowance made to them is insufficient and has to be eked out in that manner is a proof that hitherto the provision made for cases of this kind has <Col N="490" /> not been commensurate with their necessities.</P>
    <P>The Commission, however, I think, only touched the fringe of the problem. I should not like the House to be misled by the figures which were given by the Minister in reply to Deputy Byrne.  I should not like the House to believe that in the Saorstát at the present moment there are only something like 7,000 widows requiring assistance.  I think the problem is a very much wider one than that. It is true that in dealing with the matter the Commission considered conditions prevailing in 1925 and compared them with the conditions which prevailed in 1913.  The only thing that emerges from that comparison is not a measure and not an estimate of the extent to which poverty does prevail here, but is a conclusion that at least poverty was as prevalent in 1925, if not more so, as it was in 1913.  The question we have to deal with three years later is, I submit, upon the basis that poverty is as general in 1928 as it was in 1913, and in saying that I do not want to be taken as speaking in any partisan way.  This is a motion to which, as Deputy Murphy has already pointed out, most of us on both sides of the House and on the Labour Benches are already committed by public declarations, which we made over eight years ago&mdash;public declarations which I hope we all regard as binding and which we will take at least the first step to honour.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties which Deputies on this side had in considering this question was to form some adequate idea of the problem.  When they made preliminary investigations they found it impossible to obtain statistics.  Strange to say, they could not even obtain statistics as to the exact number of widows and orphans in An Saorstát.  We know that these figures happen to be at the present moment in one of the Government offices, but I believe, for the reason that they have not yet been officially published, they have not been made available, even to serious investigators. As I said, in dealing with the problem, one of the difficulties was to get reliable statistics.  So far as I <Col N="491" /> know, no independent investigator has carried out in Ireland investigations into the existence of poverty in the same way as Booth, Roantree or Boley carried out investigations in England, but an examination of the results of the researches made by those investigators leads one to the conclusion that almost twenty per cent. of the population of An Saorstát is living either on the poverty line or below it, because, as I said, we have, first of all, the opinion of the Commission that poverty and destitution were as prevalent here in 1925 as they were in 1913.  We have had the opinion of the investigators to whom I have referred that in England, in the large towns at any rate, at least 16 per cent. of the population were living in conditions of primary poverty, and I think that as 1913 was a year of industrial prosperity in England, we will be entitled to say that poverty was more generally prevalent in Ireland in 1913 than it was in England in 1913 and that, therefore, the figure of 16 per cent. which was applied to industrial conditions in England might be extended, and extended by at least 20 per cent., if we are going to apply that figure to the Free State.  As I said, we were unable to obtain official statistics as to the number of widows in An Saorstát, but some of us at any rate&mdash;and we are not like Sam Weller&mdash;have come to the conclusion that 135,000 might be a fair figure at which to put the number of widows.</P>
    <P>If we take twenty per cent. of that number we have a fair idea of the number of people, naturally to a varying extent, who require to be dealt with under a scheme of this kind In the same way, if you examine that figure, you will find that, though the boards of public assistance dealt with approximately 7,000 widows, and afforded very inadequate relief to 7,000 widows, there are still left outside the scope of their activities something like 26,000 persons. Therefore the present poor law only touches the fringe of the problem, and therefore, because of the fact that there are 33,000 people living on the poverty line, or below the poverty line, living in such a condition that they are unable <Col N="492" /> to provide themselves with the means to maintain themselves physically fit, living in such a condition that they are obviously unable to bring up their families in decency, the case which has been made for an inquiry into the question and a report is, I submit, unanswerable.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said that our failure to deal with it by means of local relief has been in any way compensated for by an increased national expenditure upon social assistance.  The amount expended by the Dáil in the year 1924-5 upon social services was £4,129,513. The amount estimated for those same services in the year 1928-9 is only £3,431,000.  That is not very creditable. I do not think it is justifiable, and it is not a thing that we can possibly contemplate with equanimity.  It is a position that is almost unique.  Austria, France, Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden&mdash; practically every important country in Europe&mdash;have increased their national expenditure upon social services within the past three or four years.  I am sure that nobody in this House will advocate that we should have less care for our citizens than those States have.  No one will state that our citizens are less deserving. The standard of living in this State must equal&mdash;and it should be our pride and our first duty, if we can, to make it surpass&mdash;the standard of living reached by the commonalty in other States.  For reasons of the highest policy social conditions here should not be permitted to compare unfavourably with social conditions in the North of Ireland, and for that reason, as already a scheme for widows' and mothers' pensions has been introduced into Northern Ireland, I hope this House will endorse the terms of this motion, and that the Government will concede the inquiry asked for.</P>

      <P>It would be easy for me to say that I was prepared to accept this motion but that, according to the best of the information that I had, it would not prove on examination feasible at the present time to adopt a scheme of the kind suggested.  I do not propose, however, to do that, because I do not <Col N="493" /> think that the House should begin by practically voting in favour of a scheme of insurance, and that it should afterwards consider whether or not such a scheme was practicable.  As presumably, from the speeches we have heard, a large number of Deputies wish to have the matter investigated and to have it thoroughly discussed, I think it would be a good thing for the Executive Council to examine the matter, to get out such figures as could be got out, to prepare the best estimates that could be prepared of the cost of applying to the Saorstát the scheme which is in operation in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland, and to examine what modifications, if any, would be necessary to make that scheme properly applicable here, having regard to the fact, for instance, that the proportion of people in health insurance is less here than in the north.  I think it would be, as I say, quite proper that the Executive Council should conduct that examination and should lay the results of it before the House so that a motion or a Bill dealing with this matter could be more satisfactorily discussed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that a Private Member's Bill cannot go beyond the Second Stage unless it is adopted by the Government, but it would be possible for a Private Member's Bill on this question, involving expenditure, to be introduced and to have its principle accepted by the House.  Consequently, if the information the Government could obtain were before the House one of the most satisfactory ways perhaps of discussing this would be for some private Deputy to prepare a Bill embodying a definite scheme, and to allow the House to vote on that definite scheme one way or another.  As I say I would have no objection to having the matter examined by the appropriate civil servants, and such information as was available obtained and set out in proper form, having estimates prepared and explained and the whole matter laid before the House in a White Paper.  But I would have to oppose, before the House had this information and before it could give the sort of examination to this scheme that it requires, adopting a motion which goes <Col N="494" /> very close at any rate to accepting the idea of such a scheme.  Deputy MacEntee, I think, made a suggestion that there would be something like 26,000 widows who would require the type of assistance that this scheme contemplates. I think that figure is somewhat too high.</P>
    <P>Since this motion was put down a little consideration was given to the matter in my Department and in other departments.  A very rough figure was suggested to me of the annual cost of adopting the British scheme for widows' and children's pensions in the Saorstát.  The figure given indicated that the amount annually required would be about £750,000.  I have not had time to examine it, but I am inclined to think that even this sum of £750,000 is somewhat higher than the amount would actually be.  If the numbers were to be as great as Deputy MacEntee suggests I think the amount would be about £1,000,000 per annum; but I do not think it would be as costly as Deputy MacEntee anticipates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that 26,000 would be affected in varying degrees. Some would receive the maximum pension and others the minimum.  The average pension, I think, would not work out at more than 7/6 per person.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the cost of benefit only and that is a very rough figure.  From the cursory examination that I have been able to give it, I think that perhaps £650,000 would be nearer to it.  I do not think that even those who prepared the figures, with the amount of time that was available, would give it as more than a very rough approximation.  I only want to put it in that way to the House for the purpose of indicating that before the House commits itself to the adoption of this system of insurance, even to the extent that it would by passing Deputy O Murchadha's motion, we ought to have some figures placed before the House which Deputies could use as the basis for further examination <Col N="495" /> on their own part, and which Deputies could proceed to criticise and test in such ways as might be available to them.  Deputies who could not, perhaps, prepare an estimate and who would not have the data for making and setting down a figure themselves would be able to find some ways of checking roughly any estimate that might be prepared, and the House therefore could discuss the scheme in a much more precise and real way.</P>
      <P>I take the very rough figure that I have got of £750,000.  As regards doubling National Health stamps, in the year 1927 the 7d. contributed in National Health stamps by employers and employees jointly amounted to about £503,000.  Doubling the stamps, therefore, would only give an additional £503,000, and that, on the estimate I have, would not be nearly sufficient to provide benefit for widows and children on the British scale, let alone do anything towards providing old age pensions at 65.  I do not think that for the purpose of enabling those widows' and children's benefit to be paid it would be a practicable thing to double the present National Health contributions.  I think that would be felt to be very severe, and in consequence I cannot see how we could avoid a very big sum being required from the Exchequer.  It seems to me that it is quite likely that, say, half a million pounds per annum would be required from the Exchequer in order to enable us to give benefits to widows and children in the Saorstát on the scale at present being paid in Great Britain.  I think that if we bound the scheme up with the National Health Insurance system that it would leave out great numbers of widows and orphans in this country whose claim to assistance would be as great as that of those enveloped in the National Health system. Consequently, it is quite probable that in order to make the scheme for widows and children acceptable here, it would have to be extended in some way and made to bring in classes that are not brought in in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The giving of additional social services is, of course, a thing that anybody can say is desirable.  It really all comes <Col N="496" /> to the consequences.  When a country is in a particular economic state necessitating the imposition of the taxation required to provide the benefits. I think that it is quite possible to so postpone any sort of economic growth by giving new social services before the country is able to support them as to do to the whole bulk of the population more harm than good.  If a substantial new burden is imposed for social services it will help people who deserve help, but it will also inevitably, in economic conditions like the present, injure people who cannot afford any new burden.  It is likely to cause some increase in the existing measure of unemployment, and generally it is a thing that needs to be looked at from every possible angle before any decision is taken.  Some Deputy said that the system of affording relief by way of home assistance was degrading and demoralising. I do not see why it need necessarily be a degrading and a demoralising system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why, among other things, we should not consider whether the method of paying relief in a particular class of cases should not be reconsidered and altered. The question of giving relief to widows and children is on a somewhat different footing.  From the mere administrative point of view, it is on a different footing from other classes of home assistance, for it is possible to ascertain that the need will exist for a very considerable period, and it should not be too hard to devise a method of dealing with that problem that would make it very much less objectionable than it is said to be at present. At any rate, all that should be looked into.  Deputies will remember that whatever may be the case with regard to the collection of the estimated revenue for the present year there are elements in this year's revenue which will not be available next year, and consequently before we commit ourselves to any extent to a scheme that conceivably might cost the Exchequer £500,000 a year&mdash;and I would say that very likely it would cost £400,000 a year&mdash;we should first try to get some <Col N="497" /> figures.  When we have got such figures as can be obtained&mdash;a good deal of information can be obtained&mdash;and when the House has seen these figures, then it will know better than it can now know whether it should nail its flag to this particular mast at present, or whether instead of deciding that the system of pensions was the way to deal with it, it should not seek some other method of mending the present position.</P>
      <P>There is, undoubtedly, this to be said in favour of home assistance in a country which is poor, that there can be some measure of discrimination, and if one could only arrange to have that discrimination sympathetically exercised and remove objectionable features which are not necessary in the case of the sort of assistance which must be permanent, at any rate which must continue for a period of years, we might be able to do a great deal of good along those lines, and we might continue to have the benefits.  In the matter of actual expenditure we cannot afford to ignore what is done in other countries, and we must try, as far as our resources permit, to march along with other countries.  I am not in favour of simply being satisfied to say that we cannot afford these things, or to say that another country is richer and there is no use in our considering their methods.  I think we must look at what other people are doing, and we must try, as far as possible, either to do for our people what they are doing, or, if we cannot do that quite, to see whether we can bring improvements about which are within our means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, on the other hand, it is not a sufficient argument to say that this, that or the other country has adopted a particular scheme and we should adopt it, as the advantages to the whole community in certain cases might lie in postponing heavier expenditure.  I have said several times to the House I thought that in our present circumstances, having regard to everything I have said about the need for keeping march with other countries in the matter of social services, the first consideration in the circumstances existing here was to find some means of increasing production, some means of <Col N="498" /> extending industry.  If we could do that, we would produce good results in other spheres equal to the good results we could get by an immediate increase in social services, and we would also provide the community with the means of giving increased social services later on.  I think, therefore, the motion that has been put to us by Deputy O Murchadha ought not to be accepted by the Dáil, at any rate in the form in which it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first thing I ought to do is to congratulate the Minister for Finance in preserving carefully the secret of the attitude of the Executive Council on this particular matter.  He has dealt with the question so far, I consider, on fictitious figures.  He says the Dáil should not consider this matter unless it had been examined from the financial point of view by the Executive Council, or by civil servants in some of his departments. I do not think that should be the answer of the Minister for Finance to this.  The motion has been on the Order Paper for practically twelve months, and I think and Executive Council composed of men like the Minister for Finance and the President, who were members of the First Dáil Eireann who made a proclamation in January, 1919, that their first duty was to look after the widows and orphans of this country, should be able in this year 1928 to say to the House that they had made up their minds as to what their policy is as regards the starving women and children of the country.  It is all very well to talk of the burden of taxation.  It is all very well for the Minister for Finance to talk about this putting a substantial new burden on the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the people who would have to pay this substantial new burden, as the Minister might call it, are in a better position to bear it than these unfortunate people who have had to bear the burden of demoralisation, degradation and hunger for a number of years in this country.  How often do we see a position in which the breadwinner is snatched from his family? Before he is taken by Almighty God he is in a comparatively good position and <Col N="499" /> is earning sufficient money to keep his wife and children in comfort.  He is snatched away suddenly, and two or three weeks afterwards we see his wife outside the relieving officer's door with a young baby in her arms looking for relief.  The Minister says that he does not see any degradation or demoralisation so far as outdoor relief is concerned, but he knows very little about it, or about the conditions in many parts of Ireland, where you see queues of women and children every Saturday waiting at the doors of the relieving officers' houses for relief.  I do not think that it is too much to ask that the Executive Council should make up their minds quickly in regard to this matter and to say that this kind of thing should cease.  In moving this motion Deputy Murphy has, I think, shown that a system of pensions for widows and orphans has been adopted by practically every civilised country. In Northern Ireland, at our very door, such a system prevails, and it is very poor compensation for some widows and orphans in the Free State to know that though they have a kind of freedom they are in an infinitely worse position than people who are still under English control.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace to any government which claims to rule this part of Ireland. It should be one of the first duties of the present Government to devote their attention to trying to remedy this very sad state of affairs. The Minister states that he considers, from an examination made by his Department along with the Local Government Department, that this scheme, if adopted, would cost three quarters of a million.  He estimated that if the National Health Insurance contributions were doubled it would mean an increased revenue from that source of £503,000, and he states that that is not nearly enough.  I suggest that if he were to add the amount of outdoor relief paid to widows and orphans to that amount he would not be very far short of what is required to put this scheme into operation.  If he did that he would remove the stigma of pauperism which prevails.  As I said, I cannot understand the attitude of the <Col N="500" /> Minister for Finance in saying that the Executive Council have not considered this problem.  To be candid, it is very hard to believe that in regard to a motion which has been on the Order Paper long before last Christmas the Executive Council have not made up their minds.  If that is so I do not hesitate to say that their minds have become callous and that they are paying very little attention to the downtrodden poor of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that, so far as the statement and speech made by the Minister for Finance in regard to this motion are concerned, I was somewhat surprised at the attitude he has adopted here.  He seemed to imply by his remarks that if this motion were passed pensions for widows and orphans would automatically become an accomplished fact in the Saorstát. I would point out, however, that so far as the motion is concerned, it only requests the Executive Council to prepare and present to the House a report in regard to such a scheme of insurance and the estimate of the cost.  The Minister stated that he had no objection to having the matter inquired into by civil servants and to lay their report before the House in the form of a White Paper.  If that is so, I am surprised that he should put forward any opposition to this motion.  He has suggested that it might be desirable or advisable if a private member introduced a Bill to give effect to such legislation in regard to widows' and orphans' pensions, but at the same <Col N="501" /> time, he pointed out that a Bill, being a Private Member's Bill, could not get beyond Second Stage.  Surely the Minister is not trying to throw the onus and responsibility on to Deputies who have not got the same access to statistics and to figures and information which government departments have.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance further stated that it might be all right to say that ultimately we will adopt the scheme, but he suggested that we had better postpone it.  It seems to me that the Minister is endeavouring to deal with this situation in the same way that the Minister for Lands and Fisheries is dealing with the Gaeltacht Commission, namely, &ldquo;dilly-dally; leave it over; something will crop up, but we are not going to tackle it at present.&rdquo;  The Minister further states that so far as this country is concerned the question would have to arise whether a contributory or non-contributory scheme should be adopted.  I quite agree in regard to that.  I realise that if you are going to have a contributory scheme, based on the National Health Insurance Act, there are a large number of widows of small farmers and fishermen who would not come under this scheme and who should be entitled to come under it, because the Gaeltacht is one of the worst parts of the country as regards poverty amongst widows and orphans. As the mover of the motion pointed out, the present poor law system is inadequate to deal with this situation and, as Deputy MacEntee mentioned, it only touches the fringe of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated at a meeting in Dublin last night, Dublin is a city of charity.  I realise that.  We have charitable institutions like the Vincent de Paul and other bodies doing work which the State should do, because we of the Labour Party believe that the first duty of any Government in any country is to look after the welfare of the people. We believe that as long as the present system obtains widows and children will remain in starvation and if they are not able to provide for their daily wants they have to go and beg.  We here have passed laws by which women <Col N="502" /> and children are summoned for begging, but, at the same time, we are not prepared to pass legislation in regard to this particular problem.  Deputy Murphy referred to the democratic programme of the First Dáil in which it was stated&mdash;the Minister for Finance agreed with it but apparently he has changed his mind since&mdash;that the first call on the resources of the nation should be the women and children. Deputy Murphy referred to Northern Ireland but &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; is a misnomer to me.  I happen to represent the most northern constituency in Ireland.  I should say that Deputy Murphy mentioned that in the Six Counties a widow was entitled to 10/- a week with 5/- for the eldest child and 3/-for each of her other children. Picture a widow with a family in Donegal living on the border of the Six Counties but not entitled to any pension as there is no such scheme in operation in the Saorstát.  She and her children are in a state of starvation.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that she is provided for under the poor law system; but, as I say, that system touches only the fringe of the situation. If she and her children were living 100 yards across the Border she would be entitled to a pension.  We hear a lot of talk about unity.  We, of the Labour Party, want to bring about unity and believe that one of the ways of doing so is to improve our social services.  Do you expect that you can bring about unity by having those services in the Free State on a lower level than those in the Six Counties? Deputy Murphy pointed out that we have passed legislation to improve livestock, to endeavour to improve local administration, to improve the supplies of electricity, but up to the present we have not tackled this important problem. I agree with the mover of the motion when he says that that is a blot on our social system.  We have failed to deal with this problem.  I was surprised that the only voice we heard from the Government Benches was that of the Minister for Finance who, according to his own statement, was against the provision of pensions for widows and orphans.  No other voice has been heard from the Government <Col N="503" /> Benches and I take it that so far as they are concerned they are against this scheme.  If, however, I misinterpret their thoughts it is up to them to express their opinion and, when it comes to a division, to vote in favour of this motion which we hope will be passed by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I really cannot understand the statement of the Minister for Finance on this question.  Apparently, he wishes to suggest to the House that he personally regards it as desirable that pensions should be paid to widows and orphans, and that they should be paid under a scheme somewhat on the lines, perhaps, of the British scheme. If he does not suggest that, I do not know what he meant by his speech.  I cannot understand what his opposition to the resolution is.  He suggests that there is pending an inquiry by the Executive Council.  All this motion does is to ask definitely for such an inquiry, a full inquiry into all the statistics concerned, and yet he will not accept the motion.  So far as I can see, what he objects to is accepting in principle what is in the motion, namely that the establishment of a scheme of this kind would be desirable.  He apparently is against that.  He regards it as not being desirable, and this House is going to vote on that issue, on that principle whether it is desirable or whether it is not.  Otherwise, if his words are to be taken in the ordinary course of understanding, the Executive Council are at present inquiring into it or are going to inquire into it.  Therefore, it must be on the principle involved in the motion that the House is going to divide, unless the Government changes its mind before the end of the debate and decides to accept this particular principle and allow an inquiry to proceed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little is too innocent for anything.  There is no use in trying to state a false issue.  The question whether pensions for widows and orphans are desirable means nothing, as Labour Deputies know, and even, as I suspect, Deputy Little knows.  The position of the Minister for Finance is <Col N="504" /> clear.  He wants to know, not whether it is desirable, but whether it is practicable. We do not all live in the clouds. We must consider the question of not only whether it is desirable, but whether it is practicable.  If the Deputy were considering any business proposition he would consider it in that light. If Deputy Corish were considering any business proposition he would consider it in that light.  I would like to make an arrangement, say, for my grandfather by which I could give him £200 a year instead of £100, but can I afford it?  I think as much about him&mdash;of course, I am taking a suppositious case&mdash;as anybody, but can I afford to do that?  That is the question.  Can the taxpayer afford it?  We are all exuding charity, every one of us, at the taxpayer's expense.  I would like if all this charity were really sincere.  Deputies should not get up and present us with the false dilemma: &ldquo;Are you in favour of pensions for widows, double wages for every workman, of making better provision for the children of working men, or of making provision for the neighbour's children, which is better still?&rdquo; Of course we are, so far as we can afford it.  But in an assembly like this we ought not to discuss a question like that, as some Deputies here have discussed it.  I do not say they all discussed it like that, but Deputy Little was a notorious example, and to a lesser extent Deputy Cassidy. They got up and discussed this as if we had unlimited facilities and unlimited money to do everything we wanted to do, and that you had sitting opposite you a hard-hearted, malevolent Executive Council who were insisting on hoarding all the money and who would not spend it.  That is not the position, and Deputies know that quite well.</P>

It is a fact that not all the people whom the Deputy calls poor are deserving poor. I know that there are deserving poor, but there are plenty of people who are called poor who are not deserving poor. I put that point of view in an extreme way because the other point of view has been put in an extreme way.  It is a fact that it is the people who will pay for all this vicarious benevolence, the small farmer and the small shopkeeper, who find it hard to make provision for their own children.  That has to be remembered, and we cannot talk in the air about pensions for widows and orphans without any reference to economic conditions.  It is simply hypocrisy for Deputies in the opposite benches constantly to exude charity without any reference to the person who has to find the money for all the charity.  I do not know, of course, as much about foreign affairs as Deputy MacEntee, but I suspect that his information is just a little bit inaccurate.

      <P>About twenty per cent., I think Deputy MacEntee said, are living in poverty.  What about the other eighty per cent.?  Who are they? Mainly small farmers and shopkeepers, as I said.  Who are the producers of the country?  Is it not out of production that this £500,000 or £600,000 will have to come?  Deputy Corish said that we could double the National Health Insurance payments, and add the present outdoor relief, and that we could find the money that way.  He suggested that as one way of finding the money. He quoted something that the Minister for Finance said about doubling the National Health Insurance payments that would find £500,000, and said: &ldquo;Add to that the present outdoor relief and you will get the money.&rdquo;  Does the Deputy advocate the doubling of the National Health Insurance?  Are the workers in favour of it, and are the employers?  Can they afford it?  Is not that a very relevant question?  Must it not be taken into account?  I think these are the real questions to be discussed, not any question of whether we would like or would not like to give pensions to widows.  Of course we would all like to see widows and orphans comfortable, but we must consider how far we could afford to make them comfortable.</P>

      <P>When listening to the debate the following experience occurred to me.  It will be misunderstood and misquoted of course, but I will give it for what it worth.  In a certain county in Ireland I met a man whom I know very well who has two brothers.  They were born in very poor circumstances in the smallest holding in the district.  The brothers went to America and returned after five years. One of them bought a farm and another bought a shop in the town. Between them they bought a bit of extra land for their father and mother. In that district I happen to know officially that there was a huge estate divided and not one of them got a perch.  Why?  Because they had earned money and bought land.  In that district practically all the other tenants' fathers and mothers have the old age pension and have the benefit of the social services of the State. Their father and mother could not get the old age pension.  Why?  Because these men had earned money and bought a holding for them. Yet they were the poorest people in the district; their father had the smallest holding, worked on that holding very hard, and made a good bit of money out of it.  They went away for some years, came back and bought a holding.  They are now in a good holding and they are probably better off to-day than the people who have the benefit of these social services. They might have been lucky but what was their position?  They could not get any of the benefits of the social services that the State provides because <Col N="508" /> they had been more enterprising and hardworking than their neighbours.  I do not want for a moment to extend that argument to absurdity, but I do say that there is a moral there.  I say it is a moral that Deputies must take into account.  If it is put to me that I am going to be saved from poverty by a pension, why should I work myself for it?  That is a consideration which must be taken into account.  When I look around in counties that I know well and see the people who are getting the benefit of social services and the people who are not getting the benefit of them, because they have been more enterprising, have worked harder, and happen to be, entirely at their own expense, and as a result of their hard work, better off, I think you can press that point of view of public charity and social services too far.  Deputies know well that it is being pressed too far.</P>

Moreover, you ought to think not only of the people who are getting the money, but of the people who are paying for it and, perhaps, are earning it hard, and who are as deserving in their own way, and even more deserving, than others on whom there is so much sympathy wasted.</P>

      <P>Amendments 36 and 37 raise certain questions such as the appointment of the named first manager, the question of the machinery of the appointment of the manager and, the further question of the tenure of office of the manager. I propose, in order to leave room for Deputy Anthony's amendment, No. 37, to take Deputy de Valera's amendment 36, in the form of deleting subsections (1), (2), (3), saving sub-section (4), and substituting the proposed new sub-section on the amendment paper.  In that way, the question of the first manager and the question of the appointment of the manager will come under discussion, and I shall put the question that subsections (1), (2), (3) stand part of the section.  Then we will take Deputy Anthony's amendment, No. 37, in the form, that sub-section (4) stand part, thus giving debate upon the matters that arise in Deputy Anthony's proposed new sub-section.  I think that meets the case of the two Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with a question that has already been discussed as a side issue on other amendments, that is, the question of the appointment of the manager.  It is proposed in Deputy de Valera's amendment that the first manager should be appointed for the period of one year; secondly, that subsequent managers shall be appointed for periods of five years, and eligible for re-appointment at the expiration of that period; thirdly, that the manager shall be appointed in the manner set out in paragraph 2 of the amendment and not in the manner suggested in the Bill, by the Local Appointments Commission.  Dealing with the three points in order, I will take first the question of the appointment of the first manager.  The proposal in the Bill is that the existing Commissioner in Cork City, Mr. Philip Monahan, should be appointed as the first manager for life, and that only when he has died, resigned, or been removed by a vote of the council shall the question of any other manager arise.  We think the question of the appointment of the manager, and who that manager should be, is primarily a question for the Cork City Council and not for this House.  The proposal in the Bill is that this House should decide who the manager should be and not the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think a case could be made out for the appointment of the existing Commissioner, as manager, for a limited period, in order to help the new council over the transitional stage, but the proposal to appoint the existing manager as manager for life is one, we think, that could not be defended on any reasonable grounds. The Minister has said that this is a Bill to restore to the citizens of Cork the power to control their municipal affairs.  If it is such, then undoubtedly the power to make the appointment of the manager from the first should be given to the people of Cork. The personality of Mr. Philip Monahan should not properly come into this discussion.  The question is the one I have put to the House: whether or not it is the council or this House that is going to make the appointment.  After the question of the appointment of the <Col N="511" /> first manager is decided, the period for which he would hold office and the period for which subsequent managers would hold office would next come up for consideration.</P>
    <P>We have endeavoured to present to the House the idea that the relations which should exist between the city manager and the Council should be similar, in general detail, to the relations which would exist between a general manager of a business firm and the board of directors of that firm.  The Minister has contested that idea.  In his speech on a previous amendment, he endeavoured to establish that the position of the manager in relation to the Council is altogether different from that of a manager of a business firm to its board of directors.  But he supported that contention, not from the point of view of the council, but from the point of view of the manager.  It is, undoubtedly, better for the manager that he should be appointed on terms different from those on which the manager of a business concern is appointed; that he should be appointed for life, with a pension when he resigns or leaves his office.  The question that this House has got to decide is the question whether it is more important that every provision should be made to ensure that a really expert and efficient man should be appointed manager, or that satisfactory terms of appointment should be secured for whomsoever is appointed.  It appears to us that the Minister is more concerned to ensure for the manager, and particularly for the first manager, who is the present City Commissioner, satisfactory terms of appointment than to ensure that there should be a really first-class man appointed to the city who will have the sympathetic co-operation of the members of the council.</P>
    <P>We have, during the course of the discussion on this Bill, repeatedly emphasised the fact that this is a very important experiment in city government, and we cannot possibly jeopardise that experiment out of sentimental consideration for any individual by endeavouring to be too generous to the person who may be the manager of the city for the time being.  There appears <Col N="512" /> to be real danger that the success of the scheme will be jeopardised by such considerations. The manager of a city like Cork, or any other city, exercising the powers conferred by this Bill, will be able to exercise very considerable influence upon the life of that city.  He will be able to affect its prosperity and well-being to a very remarkable extent, and we cannot take the risk of a person being appointed to that position who will not be the very best available and who will not give the very best results possible.</P>
    <P>The question, therefore, of the period for which the manager will be appointed arises.  If the manager is appointed for life, I repeat what I have said, and it has not been seriously contradicted that there is considerable danger that the council will be slow to remove him unless he does something of a rather serious nature which would make it impossible for them to retain him.  There is always a considerable difficulty in getting public boards to remove from office any official who manages to muddle through his work fairly successfully but against whom no specific charge can be laid.  We wish to see in the important position of city manager the best man available at any time, and therefore we think that some provision by which the appointment of the manager would come up periodically for consideration is the better one. We suggest a five-year period here.  We think that every five years the council should be asked to consider the work done by the manager during that period and if they consider him satisfactory they can re-appoint him but if they consider him unsatisfactory they can dispense with his services and in consequence of that fact can if they wish give a gratuity or allowance, compensating him for the interruption in his livelihood.  I would like to emphasise the danger which will exist if that periodical revision of the manager appointed is not made, that a man may be appointed who may, as I say, be fairly successful but who may not be the best available or produce the best results possible.  But at the same time will not, by any gross carelessness or inefficiency, merit a vote of no confidence on the part of the council.  In the Bill the arrangements made for the <Col N="513" /> removal of the manager are very severe.  There must be a two-thirds majority of the council and subsequent to that there must be the approval of the Minister before the manager can be removed.  I submit the manager must have done something very wrong, muddled up the affairs of the city to a great extent, before that machinery can be brought into operation.  That is not the right principle to work on.  The right principle should be the welfare of the city.  That should be the right consideration and not the welfare of the manager.  If it is necessary that individuals should suffer to ensure the welfare of the city let that individual suffer to preserve the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>The other section in Deputy de Valera's amendment concerns the method of the appointment of the manager.  The provision in the Bill is that the first manager should be appointed by the Dáil, but that subsequent managers will be appointed by the Appointments Commission.  The alternative suggestion in this amendment is on the lines laid down in the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Bill, which we introduced here some time ago and which was defeated in the House.  We think, in relation to such an important position as that of the manager of a city, suggestions such as are contained in that Bill are very applicable and would ensure better results than those which the Minister suggests.  The power of the council is really determined by the fact that it can, or should be able to appoint and remove the manager itself.  In the Bill it has neither the power to do one or the other thing.  It has not power to appoint a manager and can only remove him with the approval of the Minister.  We think the council should have power to appoint and remove, and in that way you will leave the ultimate control of the destiny of the City of Cork in the hands of the citizens. These are the main points which can be advanced in support of the amendment and I would be pleased to hear what reply the Minister has to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little difference between the amendments in <Col N="514" /> the name of Deputy de Valera, spoken to now by Deputy Lemass, and the one &mdash;number 37&mdash;which I have on the paper.  In fact there are many points of similarity between my amendment and those of Deputy de Valera.  In this amendment, I seek to fix the limit to the manager's term of office.  A life appointment under this new system, which is acknowledged to be an experiment, I suggest, is absurd under these circumstances.  I do not care whether you increase the period or reduce it, but I suggest to the House that there should be a limit fixed to the tenure of office, at least for the first ten years, which I suggest in this amendment, or five, as is suggested by Deputy de Valera.  So far as the section as a whole is concerned, I take exception, and so do very many others even in this House amongst the Deputies who have not voted with us, to this Bill as a whole.  We take exception to the mention in the Bill of any man's name as the forthcoming city manager. I believe if the gentleman mentioned in the Bill had been consulted beforehand he himself would have objected.  I say that in all fairness to the present occupant of the commissionership in Cork. I have read many Acts, and I have never yet seen in a Bill of this character the name of any individual mentioned in a capacity corresponding to that of city manager or of any other official for that matter.  To show that I do not contemplate any injury to one who may occupy the position for the first five or ten years while this Bill is is an experimental stage, I provide that before the manager's services may be dispensed with, if he is found incompetent or in any other way unacceptable to the citizens of Cork, that can only be done after calling a meeting, due notice of which will be given and two-thirds of the council will be found to favour dismissal or removal from office of the city manager.  I do not know why it is that that should prove itself unacceptable to any member of this House, particularly to the business members of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of what occurs in some of our large commercial undertakings and institutions.  Is it not a fact that from year to year the activities <Col N="515" /> of the banks are brought under review?  Is it not a fact also, coincident with that, that the acts or activities of the various managers of branches and head offices of these banking institutions and such other commercial undertakings are brought under review?  Is it not a fact also that in large and small commercial establishments if a manager is found to be incompetent or in any other way unacceptable his services are dispensed with?  I would be the very last in this House to suggest that anything should be done to make the position of the Cork city manager unstable.  I submit, as an ordinary business proposition, you are going to experiment on Cork; as I said some time ago, you are going to try it on the dog.  You are going to experiment in Cork with a view to extending your operations to the other cities and towns in Ireland.  I hope sincerely if any Cork delegates are listening to me that they will take particular note, and pay particular attention to the discussions in this House in connection with this Bill, because what is the story of Cork city to-day will be the story of Cork County Council, and other institutions of that kind.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that the whole Bill as at present constituted is repugnant to me and to any other Cork citizen with a sense of civic duty and civic pride.  As I have suggested in this amendment, I think the persons, whoever they may be, who will be elected to the new corporation of Cork, that is to say, when it is made more acceptable than it is at present, because as I have already stated, you will get no one but jelly-fish to go up under the Bill as it is constituted&mdash;I have this confidence in my fellow-citizens at any rate &mdash;may be trusted to deal generously as they have always done, with their officials, and they will not perpetrate an injustice against any city manager unless he is found incompetent or in other ways unacceptable to the people. This is, to my mind, a section which, as it stands, will prove in the long run as unworkable as it is unacceptable.  Assuming for the moment, and it is not a very difficult thing to assume, that the system which is acknowledged to be experimental <Col N="516" /> may be found unsatisfactory, if this system is found unsatisfactory before the city manager dies, where are we then?  That is the position I would ask the Minister to consider. I want it to be clearly understood, so far as my amendment is concerned, and I want to put it very seriously to any Deputy from Cork city or county listening to me that the Bill in its present form has been condemned by all and sundry, with the exception of very few, in the city of Cork. I have endeavoured by means of these amendments to make that Bill, as I have already stated, less unacceptable to the people and I would ask the Minister, unless he wants to create a state of turbulence in our city affairs, to consider very seriously the amendments suggested&mdash;either Deputy de Valera's amendment or mine, or, as I suggested on a former occasion, he might be able to do something as between the two.  He might be able to evolve something which would be acceptable to Deputy de Valera and me, and would meet with all-round acceptance.  As I have indicated, I want to make this Bill as acceptable as possible to the citizens of Cork.</P>
    <P>I am not opposing this through any spirit of cussedness, not because I am in the Opposition, but because I have a genuine desire to see that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, gets a fair show.  I want to be quite clear on that point.  I want to see the Act put into operation in a more acceptable form than it is in at present; otherwise I am going to continue to fight it even when it is in operation.  I would not be true to what I said in Cork unless I continued in that attitude.  I want the Minister and those associated with him in the framing of the Bill to make it workable and acceptable to the ordinary people of Cork.  I would suggest that you would get as much good out of the amendment suggested by Deputy de Valera as you would out of that suggested by myself.  I am not quite concerned as to the tenure of office of the first manager.  What I am very much concerned about is that a limit should be fixed.  I do not care whether you make it five or ten years.  I have suggested ten.  Perhaps I was more generously inclined than Deputy de Valera. <Col N="517" /> wanted to give a longer term of experimental work, if you like.  Again, I would draw the Minister's attention to what he must have observed in a long connection with local government work both before and after the establishment of the Free State.  We are turning out from our universities day after day a large number of very clever young men, so far as academic degrees are concerned, at any rate.  The education system for which Professor O'Sullivan is partly responsible has flooded the country with B.A.'s and M.A.'s.  Although I am not a graduate of his university&mdash;I am an old R.U.I. boy&mdash;I want to say that it may happen, as it has happened in Government Departments, that you would get one with academic degrees who may be chosen because of these things and because there would be a prejudice in favour of this particular university.  You may have one of these graduates chosen to take on the position of city manager in one of our cities or towns.  I want to provide that even that class of candidate would get a fair show, and that this House should fix a limit of practical experience.  This may appeal to Professor O'Sullivan and those who are so largely interested in turning out these B.A.'s and M.A.'s, so that some of the products of this university might get a fair chance.  What I want to ask the House seriously to consider is that this will be an experiment, and, being an experiment, we are asking you not to make it a job for life.  Let us experiment with the new city manager.  Let us put him on his trial for ten years or five years, as is suggested by Deputy de Valera.  I only want to fix a limit. I believe if that is done it will make the Bill a little more acceptable.  There are a few points in the Bill which I would ask the Minister and this House seriously to consider, with a view, as I have already said, to making the Bill somewhat less unacceptable to the citizens of Cork.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Deputy Anthony's amendment first, that the manager shall hold office for ten years and then shall be subject to a vote of confidence and that in the meantime he may be removed from office.  I suggest that sub-section (5) of Section 10, which states that the <Col N="518" /> manager shall not be suspended or removed by the council, save by resolution of the council, gives the council full powers to make such representations as they consider are proper to be made by a two-thirds majority to have the manager removed.  Not even the new Cork council will want to be persuaded by Deputies that this is a very important experiment, as it is called&mdash; the introduction of the city manager as part of the city government machinery. There is no one in Cork, whether on the council or otherwise, but will realise that if the manager is not giving the return in the better administration of the city that is expected from him they are at full liberty, and have a responsibility on them, to move for his removal.  I want to suggest to Deputy Anthony that the putting in of this provision of his, holding office for ten years, is a kind of invitation to the Council to say, &ldquo;Let him stay for ten years, to see how he gets on, until the time for a vote of confidence comes.&rdquo; The Bill, as it stands at present, enables the Council, at the earliest possible moment, to move for the removal of the manager if he is not giving satisfaction.  In so far as the Minister for Local Government's responsibility in the matter goes, we did put in a commissioner there for the purpose of the better looking after of the affairs of Cork, and if under a council and city manager things are not going to be better, but are going to go back into the old kind of rut, the Minister for Local Government for 1935, no more than the Minister for Local Government for 1924, is not going to lie down. He is likely to take action if the council itself does not take action.</P>

      <P>That is the general position.  With regard to the position mentioned by Deputy Lemass, a Commissioner was appointed in Cork, and that Commissioner has acted for four years.  We have now come to the time at which it is ripe to restore the council and there is a question of appointing a city manager to act with the council.  Deputies on the far side want a manager to be appointed by the Civil Service Commission.  They want him to be appointed in a way that, as Deputy Lemass admitted, was turned down by the Dáil when a proposal was brought up along those lines generally for the making of local appointments. I submit that machinery for appointments that was not considered by the Dáil suitable for a county medical officer of health, a county surveyor or any position like that is not going to be suitable for the appointment of a city manager.  There is no use in bringing in the Civil Service Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the appointment of a city manager for Cork in continuance of the system under which the Minister for Local Government set up a Commissioner there.  This is a continuing experiment. We are handing back the democratic control into the hands of a <Col N="521" /> council, and we are setting up a city manager.  It was a particular responsibility lying on him that made the Minister in 1924 put in a commissioner. To-day the Minister for Local Government has not that responsibility as to whether the affairs of the city of Cork will be properly administered or not.  I consider, in the first place, that it would be invidious to ask the Local Appointments Commissioners to invite applications from people in a country where there are not very many people with experience in city management. We have seen the work of a commissioner here.  We have seen how acceptable his work is to the citizens of Cork fairly generally.  As Minister I take upon myself the responsibility of asking the Dáil to appoint this man as our first manager.  Deputies have suggested that it is not right to embody that in legislation.  I could, if it were so desired, bring in an amendment on the Report Stage asking that the first manager should be appointed by the Minister.  I consider it better that we should be frank with ourselves as to the type of continuity we are proposing in Cork, and that we should face the passing of legislation like this knowing that the person who was to be first manager was the person who has been acting as a commissioner for the last four years.</P>
      <P>It is a question of simple frankness and facing facts.  It is much more satisfactory to appoint the present Commissioner as first manager than to ask the Local Appointments Commissioners to find a manager.  I have not the slightest doubt they would select the man who is at present Commissioner, and it would be invidious to put the Appointments Commissioners into that position.  I do not, as Deputies have suggested, approach this matter of the period of office of the manager from the point of view of what would be most acceptable to the manager, or what would be better for him as against the interests of the council or the city. Mainly, I approach it from the point of view of my own responsibility in the matter, and I consider I am best standing over that responsibility by proposing to the House that the first manager be appointed as stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> Deputy de Valera's amendment would mean that we would ask the Local Appointments Commissioners to find a man.  The Civil Service Commission would send down three names to the new council and they would select one and after all this trouble they would appoint him for a year. Then it would be continued from five years to five years if necessary without any provision of any kind about his being regarded as a pensionable officer. The provisions in the Bill in the circumstances obtaining and the circumstances that have obtained in Cork contain the best approach to the problem that is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke so often on these amendments that I feel I shall have to repeat myself with respect to each one.  I pointed out already that my idea was that this amendment for five years was due to the fact that I thought of the manager as an expert and not as an ordinary official&mdash;an expert who would be employed by the council to manage the affairs of the city during a restricted period.  If you do not approach him from the point of view of an expert then it seems to me the Bill has no real foundation, and it seems to me it would be more like giving certain powers to a town clerk.  If you are going to appoint a manager at all it is on the grounds that the administrative business of the Corporation can be managed better by a single individual with special knowledge and personal abilities and qualities than by Committees.  If you do not have an appointment for a short period of this kind you are not going to get the type of man who will be most suitable for the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if the manager is appointed at all, that he should be appointed in the same way that a business firm would appoint its managing director&mdash; for a short period.  The Minister says: what is the difference?  There is no difference, he says, in the Bill.  The council can bring in a vote of no confidence or they can pass a motion to suspend him.  Now, we all know that that is not the same thing as having the matter of his re-appointment coming up at the end of a period of five years. It is not the same thing at all, as if it <Col N="523" /> were known that the period of an appointment would be for five years. That is so to speak in the terms of contract with the manager.  He knows it from the start.  Everybody knows it and the attitude of the council towards dismissal or change or appointing another man in his place is bound to be different from that in which a man is supposed to be appointed and can only be removed from office for inefficiency or bad conduct.  We ought to look for more for the council than the power simply to remove him from his post because of his inefficiency.  The matter of inefficiency or bad conduct should not be the test with the council.  We ought to look for the best possible man the country can give.  You are going to have the best possible man the country can give if you are going to have repeated periods of revision of appointment in which you can judge a man on his merits.  You can re-appoint that man or get a new man as seems best to the council.  I do not think that the two positions are the same at all.  They are altogether different and in practice you will find that they will have quite a different effect.</P>
    <P>Now, the next question is with reference to the mode of appointment. It is true that the Bill which we brought in here regulating local appointments was defeated in the Dáil. Now, the Local Appointments Commissioners are here and if there was any disposition on the part of the Ministry to accept the principle that the body that examines into the qualifications of the candidates should send down three names, I would be prepared to accept the Local Appointments Commissioners for this particular purpose. That is, for examining the candidates and sending down three names.  If the Local Appointments Commissioners be the examining body so as to examine the qualifications and see that the men proposed are suitable men, then I would be satisfied with the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Let them examine the candidates and send down possibly the names of three men and allow the council to select the city manager out of the three.</P>
    <P>The case for the appointment by the <Col N="524" /> council is this, that you ought not to put the manager into the position that he can snap his fingers at the council. That is what you are doing by this Bill.  The effect of mentioning the name of the present Commissioner in Cork in this Bill is that he will feel that he is the nominee of the final authority in the matter.  He is the man who was sanctioned, and he cannot be dismissed no matter how the council may feel about it.  If you are appointing the present Commissioner, he knows that as long as the present Ministry is in office he cannot be dismissed, and he knows also that if the present Ministry was to be succeeded by another Ministry that his removal then would, in fact, look like political victimisation. It is altogether wrong to give an individual such powers in the executive line and make him, by legislation, practically independent of the council which he is supposed to serve.</P>
    <P>If this man is giving satisfaction in Cork, he&mdash;the man who is actually doing the work&mdash;will in all probability be reappointed.  He has been dealing with the affairs of the city for some years past, and you should leave it to the council to appoint him if they want to do so, and not put him in the position in which he feels he is really independent of the council, and that he is continuing on as a Commissioner and not simply as city manager, who is to be responsible directly to the council and who can be removed by them.  I would say that, no matter who the present Commissioner may be, he should not be independent of the council.  He has been mentioned here in this Bill by name, but I am not thinking of him as an individual.  As a matter of fact, I have made inquiries myself about the particular Commissioner who was mentioned, and except in one particular case I have not heard very great complaints about his actions.  I am not a citizen of Cork and I do not know, but I am speaking in this matter without any particular enmity about this man or his nomination.  I think it is a wrong principle to say that the Minister or the Executive Council who are going ultimately to be the people who will have a voice in saying whether he is to be removed or not should appoint him in the first instance.  The House is acting <Col N="525" /> against the whole principle of leaving responsibility to the council. Nominally, the manager is responsible to the council, but in reality he is not. I, therefore, say that you ought, first of all, to make it possible for the council to change their manager.  Do not put unnecessary difficulties in their way.</P>
    <P>In a previous case, the President was saying how difficult it is to deal with employees and the rest of it.  All these considerations will have play when there is a question of removing a person from a responsible office like that, as well as the difficulties of finding another to take his place.  The House will admit that at present we have not very many trained men who would be capable of taking over the position of city manager and doing it really well. Consequently, there will be always the difficulty of whether the council is going to get a person who will be able to do the work.  All these considerations will have influence upon the council and will help to prevent them bringing forward resolutions which the Minister says can easily be brought forward. I hold that the terms of contract with the manager of this kind, if he is appointed to a pensionable office, will imply that he is not going to be removed except for grave dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>Then, about the appointment.  The appointment should be left finally in the hands of the council itself.  If he is to be responsible to them, the only way in which he can be made to feel he is responsible is by the council having the final word to say in his appointment&mdash;not simply ratifying the appointment of the man who is sent down by the Appointments Commissioners&mdash; handing over to him the council, who will be compelled to do with him during the term of his natural life or until he is so old that he is incapable of performing his services.  His appointment and dismissal should be in the hands of the council in order that he might clearly understand that he is responsible to them.</P>
    <P>Then, in respect of the first manager, I think that the proposal of the Minister should not be tolerated at all.  The present Commissioner is in office.  His work is there for the council to judge, <Col N="526" /> and the Minister ought allow him to be judged on his merits.  Does he think that he is going to be ignored altogether in the matter?  I do not see how he could be ignored.  Then there is the other point, that the first manager should be appointed for one year.  I admit that a certain amount of criticism is to be levelled against that. There is a slight confusion, due to the fact that what I had in mind there was that the appointment in the first place might be made by the council.</P>

      <P>I admit that.  I would be ready to change that particular part&mdash;that the appointment, in the first instance, should be for one year.  I take it that the council would hardly have a choice except to appoint the present Commissioner for the first year.</P>
      <P>They cannot very well throw out the man who has had immediate control, and who has had all the details of administration for the last four or five years in his hands.  They can hardly dispense with him during a period of transition.  What was in my mind was that during this period of transition the present Commissioner might be retained, but that the period should be one year, to enable the council to get back again the whole of the details of administration which they have lost during the period in which the Commissioner has been acting, to enable them to get in close contact with the details of administration, to put them in a position of independence, so that if they did think that the present Commissioner, after he had become manager, was not as good as they could get they would then be at liberty to make a change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment.  I regret that in this experiment we should have any individual's name mentioned, and I regret it all the more because, having, as a member of a committee, to disagree with the proposed city manager in one respect, I do not think that the individual named is competent to fill the position of manager for Cork City. The more I look over this Bill, the more I see on it, not the stamp of the Minister for Local Government, or of the secretary to the Minister for Local Government, but the stamp of the Secretary to the Department of Local Government.  During the year and a half in which there was a commissioner in charge of the North Cork Board of Assistance the salaries of the officials were raised by between £1,800 and £2,000 per annum.  The proposed manager for Cork City was also very proficient in raising salaries, and as for his business capabilities, when the South Cork Board of Assistance took over control, after six months they were able to reduce the estimate £18,500. equivalent to about ninepence in the pound reduction in the rates, and there is every prospect at present of a further reduction next year, despite the manner in which this superman was able to carry out his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is personally aware of the difficulty of getting even a bare majority to dismiss an official.  I have had a good deal of experience of it, as has every member of the County <Col N="528" /> Council from time to time, and I can say that it is practically impossible, no matter how badly an official has discharged his duties, to get a majority to dismiss him.  Take the case of a rate collector, for instance: no matter how badly he collects the rates you cannot get even a bare majority of the council to agree to his dismissal or suspension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to give an official the power that you propose to give the city manager, there is no doubt that he will control the jellyfish you will get to go in under him. There can be no manner of doubt about that.  And when you see here that in order to suspend this gentleman you must have a two-thirds majority of the new Corporation, it means that he is going to be there absolutely independent of any Corporation, that the Corporation are going to be there merely as a cloak for his dictatorship.  I am glad that the necessity has arisen to compel the Government to get even a cloak for the dictator.  But the fact that so many puppets are going to be set up in Cork to act as a smoke screen for the dictatorship of the city manager is, to my mind, a pitiable state of affairs.  I think that since we are to have a manager for Cork that manager should come in without having any of the bickerings or the jealousy that would occur in handing over the position to the present Commissioner for Cork City.  I think the fact that it has been decided in this Bill to appoint a special individual and to name him as city manager is adding insult to injury for the citizens of Cork, that the citizens of Cork are now going, with the benevolence of the Government, to be presented with a new Corporation without any powers, without any control whatsoever, and the Corporation will not even have the power of appointing their own manager or of selecting him out of a list of three names selected by the Appointments Commission, that they are to have a cut and dried city manager shoved down their throats, and they are to be told: &ldquo;Here is your boss.  You are going to act under him.  He is to pull the strings <Col N="529" /> and he will hold the purse.  He is going to be an absolute dictator; you are going to be the gentlemen invested with an empty honour and an empty cloak, and you are going to have no power.&rdquo; It would remind you of some kind of nigger king who would be set up in some part of South Africa.</P>
      <P>You are setting up fifteen puppets in Cork who will be absolutely under the control of the city manager, and the city manager will pull the strings.  I think that setting up an official, and handing over the control of the purse-strings of the city to that official, is going to mean only one thing, that the ratepayers are going to be bled through the nose for it and the citizens of Cork are going to pay for the bleeding.  It is provided in the Bill that this individual cannot be removed except by a two-thirds majority, and even if you were to get backbone into the new Corporation sufficient to have a two-thirds majority to decide to remove him, the Minister will say: &ldquo;He shall not go. He is there, and he is our man.&rdquo; He will probably act as he did in 1924 and say: &ldquo;It is far easier to shift the Corporation than to shift the manager, and therefore we will shift the Corporation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have not spoken on this Bill before but I have the feeling, which is practically general, that very wide powers are being given to the present Commissioner of Cork.  I also think that it is very undesirable that his name should be mentioned in the Bill.  I would like to avoid making any reference to the Commissioner in Cork at the present time, but I would like to say that I am in violent disagreement with his administration in other spheres in many respects.  I have not a very intimate knowledge of his work as City Commissioner, but I have a knowledge of his work in another sphere in South Cork.  I violently disagree with his administration in connection with home assistance.  I disagree with his administration so far as the dietary scale in Cork Workhouse is concerned.  Unlike Deputy de Valera, I have heard many complaints with regard to the administration of the City Commissioner.  I think it is very <Col N="530" /> desirable that this official should not have a vested interest in this position and I think it is a very reasonable demand that the Corporation should be in a position to review the work from time to time.  If the Corporation is to have any reality, to be given any life, they ought to be given some power in connection with this matter, and not be put in the position of being mere echoes of any administration devised by the city manager.  It may be, perhaps, said that the proposed city manager, who has been Commissioner for three or four years, has carried out his work satisfactorily in some respects, but I am perfectly satisfied that there is in Cork a big body of the citizens who would not subscribe to the claim that he has been an ideal Commissioner, and in that respect alone I think it would be very advisable that the whole question should be one for the Local Appointments Commissioners to decide, and that the Corporation would have a voice afterwards.  I was surprised to hear the Minister make a statement which amounted to the fact that there was no one else to be found in the country except the City Commissioner for this position.  I do not agree with that statement.  I strongly support the amendment that the Corporation should have a veto in the matter at the end of a certain time and be enabled to review the work of the manager in the meantime with a view to considering whether or not he should be retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera explained one or two matters in connection with the amendment which attracted my attention.  That could be remedied on the Report Stage, although it is rather vital, and it is not clear at the moment.  I think there is considerable weakness in his amendment and in his statement.  He stated that it would be almost inevitable that the Corporation would appoint the present Commissioner.  I would be inclined to agree with him in that.  I think the Minister had that view when he put down the section worded the way it is, naming a person as city manager.  Why the manager <Col N="531" /> should be appointed every twelve months at first I do not quite understand. The normal term, according to the amendment, is five years.  I think the Deputy is also willing to settle the second portion with regard to the Local Appointments Commissioners having the appointment, rather than the Civil Service Commissioners.  But I violently disagree, as I did before, in having three names submitted to the local authority.  I think you can only reach final success in the matter of public appointments by having persons with the highest qualifications appointed. This is a subject upon which there may be different views.  We are presented with a case in which a person, even allowing for all the criticisms uttered, has done comparatively well.  He has had four years' experience, four years of a start on most applicants, if there were such for the position, and I can imagine the difficulty of the Local Appointments Commissioners, being likened to that of the council, in being, almost, constrained to put his name first, if the circumstances are as I have described&mdash;a person with four years' experience of the work having done more than comparatively well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other points as to review after a period are open to quite a number of different criticisms.  The person holding this office has a pretty secure term, with this limitation, that he must carry out the duties with considerable efficiency.  It is idle to say that the council has no power.  The new council has in respect of policy exactly the same power as the old council.  The new council will be in a position to appraise the value of the services rendered by this official in a way in which the old council never had.  They had to judge their own work. Now they will be judging another person's work, and they will be at any time in a position, if they are satisfied that a case lies, to ask the Minister for a sworn inquiry into his work, and can make whatever case they can in regard to the administration of his office.  It appears to me that the person occupying this or any other similar office in the country would <Col N="532" /> have to give a remarkable exhibition of public administration in order to retain his office.  The amendment has so many legs that it is not easy to compare it with the recommendation in the measure.  The recommendation, at any rate, is based on the experience of a person having been in office for some years, and I think Deputy Corry need not have any particular nervous symptoms of any great increase in the rates, having regard to what has actually happened during the last four years.  The citizens of Cork are perfectly entitled to get the best person in the State appointed to this office.  The Minister for Local Government having reviewed all the circumstances, and with the responsibility of his office, nominates a person to the position.  If there is one weakness in connection with this proposal it is that, for the next few years, the council can review the position of the manager, and the representatives of Cork can question the Minister here regarding the administrations of the office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FRENCH</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support the amendment, I would like to view it from a different point of view from that expressed in the debate up to the present.  Would this House assume that Mr. Monahan will of a certainty be appointed manager for Cork?  I ask the House one question.  Are you treating him fairly by mentioning his name in the Bill?  To my mind, you are not. Whether we like it or not, it was a certain political situation that created the position of Commissioner in the city of Cork.  I am saying that without any feeling behind it.  There is no individual who understood the situation existing in the city of Cork but must admit that the actual appointment had a political flavour, since every member supporting the Government Party was asked to establish a case against the public representatives in their own city. That undoubtedly is the situation that surrounds Mr. Monahan, and that is his only weakness, in my opinion, at the present day in Cork.  Instead of trying to get him out of that weak position, and put him into a strong position, the Government is allowing him to start off on a measure that is supposed to be <Col N="533" /> tried on Cork, and that is going to be applied to the rest of Ireland as a model of local government, if successful there.  You cannot do that unless you give the manager at least a fair start and a good foundation to work upon, and you are not going to give him that by mentioning him in the Bill.  As to whether the appointment of a manager is to be made by the Appointments Commissioners or not, I am not particularly interested, but this I will say: If the people of Cork are to have the opportunity of electing their representatives, surely sufficient confidence ought to be placed in those representatives to allow them to select the best individuals they can get to manage the city.</P>
      <P>The President said that Cork was entitled to get the best man in the State as its future manager.  Mentioning Mr. Monahan in the Bill is not allowing the people of Cork to do that.  As a result of the experience he has had, Mr. Monahan possibly has advantages that would make him the best qualified person for the position, but the point that I am making is that the Bill, as it stands, does not give the representatives of Cork the right even to look beyond a particular individual for the position.  This question is a serious one. It is certainly serious for Cork, where we want local government properly and efficiently carried out.  The Bill does not give the people of the city a reasonable opportunity of doing that.  In my opinion, it would not take much to change the Bill and make it a reasonably good measure from what it is&mdash;a bickering little measure.  About the Bill as it stands there is an air of absolute distrust, an air that this House and those who are standing on this Bill are not prepared to trust wholeheartedly the people of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately or unfortunately for yourselves, you have named in this Bill a man who has definitely been the representative of the Minister's Party since he was first appointed Commissioner in the City of Cork.  No matter how he is described in this Bill, he will continue under it as a definite political nominee unless you give the citizens of Cork an opportunity of appointing Mr. <Col N="534" /> Monahan and removing the stigma from him of being the nominee of a political Party.  You are denying to the people of Cork the opportunity of even making Mr. Monahan's position more secure and advantageous to himself, and of giving him a better opportunity of shaking off the old shackles and old hankerings associated with the dissolution of the old Corporation.  I say that you are not giving him a reasonable chance of managing the affairs of Cork in the future.  If you persist with the Bill as it stands, there is no doubt whatever but that large sections of the people in Cork will always have that feeling about the appointment of the city manager.</P>
    <P>It is within the memory of the President that as regards the last appointment of one of the senior officials under the Borough Council of Cork&mdash;I refer to the present city engineer&mdash;that we ourselves in Cork set up a Board of Examiners.  At that time the Corporation had the right to advertise the appointment in the ordinary way and vote for a man in the usual manner for that office.  I would remind the Government that we did not avail ourselves of that right, but asked the Local Government Department to nominate a representative. What happened was: the ex-city engineer was asked to nominate a chairman for the Board of Examiners. That Board was set up, and under it we got the present city engineer in Cork.  That appointment shows that there is no anxiety on the part of the people of Cork as regards the making of hole-and-corner jobs.  There is a rooted belief amongst the people of Cork that this Bill is intended more or less to foster and make permanent the state of affairs that at present exists in Cork.  I am not going to enter into a controversy on the merits of the individual mentioned in the Bill.  Perhaps if I did I would have more to say in his favour than I could say against him. I will be very frank on that, but I am not going to be drawn into a discussion on it.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that I would warn the Government about, and it this, that they are lending themselves whether willingly or not to fostering a measure that has been recommended to them by a particular class in <Col N="535" /> Cork.  On a previous amendment, moved in connection with this Bill, Deputies heard a certain gentleman's name mentioned.  He published a letter in the Press giving the Bill the blessing of the people of Cork.  Anyone who knows anything at all about the City of Cork is quite well aware that that particular gentleman never got the smallest position in the gift of any section of the citizens.  Any position that he holds in Cork is a privileged position given to him because he was a representative of a certain class. Any honours that he has got he got them from that class.  But, from any section of the people of Cork he has never got any honorary position, and he never deserved it.  At the present time, in the City of Cork, you have the paid Secretary of the Employers' Federation going around the city and begging every second merchant to sign his name that he is in favour of this Bill, and that it represents the will of the people of Cork.  Anyone who knows anything about the history of Ireland knows quite well that the Employers' Federation in Cork never did, and never will, represent the City of Cork.  If the Government allow themselves to be pulled into that position, they are simply pulling an oar which is going to row against their own will, if that will is intended to be for better local government in Cork.  I say that under this Bill you are not giving the individual mentioned in it a fair chance.  You are not giving him the opportunity of shaking off the shackles that unfortunately were put on him by your own administration.</P>
    <P>I am prepared at any time to debate in this House the question that Mr. Monahan could not have progressed in Cork if the borough council that was in existence at the time of the dissolution had not left him in a strong financial position.  At the time that he took over control the public debt of the Borough of Cork was less than that of any other borough council in Ireland. But to-day the public debt of the borough has been increased.  I am not using that argument as a kind of criticism against Mr. Monahan, because I think the increase has been well invested. There is no question about it <Col N="536" /> but that in certain ways he has made certain progress in Cork.</P>
    <P>I believe even he himself, if he were allowed to speak his heart, would tell you that he would work better under a certain amount of reasonable control, and that he would prefer to have a body to look to for advice.  If this is a reasonable Bill, there will be people elected in Cork with sufficient authority who will have respect for their office and respect for representative people, and he would be very pleased to have such a body to advise him, for there are peculiarities about Cork City he could not and certainly does not know.  There are points of policy, some perhaps trifling, to be considered. There is, for instance, the development of the city.  It is a wrong and retrograde step to develop Cork on the south bank of the river.  Anyone who knows anything about the matter knows that development on the southern side of the Lee is absolutely wrong.  That might be done by a man with a particular point of view, but it would not be done by Cork men who know the requirements of the city.</P>
    <P>I say it is fundamentally wrong in principle to mention any individual in any Bill for a particular position or for a particular right in anything.  Even for his own sake, if he is to be the future manager of Cork, his name should be removed as soon as possible from this Bill, and the stigma taken off him which you are putting on by asking this House to hall-mark a job.  Take the stigma off him that you are trying to continue a political position in Cork.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to by Deputy French was not at that time a member of the Executive Council, and he might have made certain statements to his constituents of one kind or another.  The dissolution of the Cork Corporation did not arise out of political causes.  It arose out of certain circumstances, so that the overhauling of the machinery of local government there was necessary.  As to the appointment being regarded as a political one, all I can say is that, so far as we are concerned, I am perfectly prepared to leave my nominee for first manager in Cork to live down any difficulty he may be up against because people may say his is a political appointment. In 1924 people were divided, and there were political divisions about things from which political questions should not necessarily arise at all.  If the question arises that the person appointed as city manager of Cork is going to be a political appointment, it certainly justifies me in putting it down in this measure rather than leaving it that the appointment shall be made by the Minister for the time being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the amendment moved by the Leader of the Party in connection with making the appointment for a number of years, <Col N="538" /> I would like to call the attention of the Minister to the constitution of the Electricity Supply Board.  In the Electricity Supply Act you have somewhat similar circumstances arising, as you will have the appointment of managers for the Shannon undertaking.  You want to give them absolute executive control similar to what is being suggested as regards Cork.  Part 1, Section 2, sub-section 4 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members of the Board shall be appointed by the Executive Council, and every person so appointed to be a member of the Board shall hold office for such period, not exceeding five years, as shall be fixed by the Executive Council when appointing him, and every such person shall on the expiration of his term of office be eligible for re-appointment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I see no difference in the appointment of a manager to the Shannon Scheme Board and a manager for Cork City, and I believe the management of the Shannon undertaking requires management by personnel that would be absolutely free from interference by any outsiders.  If that is considered good in the case of the Electricity Supply Board, we contend that Cork City should be put on the same basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, and I am very pleased to find that the chief opposition party during this discussion has shown a keen desire to help to make the Bill a success.  I think it would be well if the Minister admitted that fact and endeavoured to meet the opposition and to allow the council that will be elected for Cork City to appoint the manager.  Certainly, it is most unusual to name in a Bill the person who will become the manager of the city.  I am quite convinced from the record of the present manager that the new council will elect him.  What fear then has the Minister, or why should he feel constrained to name in this Bill Philip Monahan?  I am quite convinced the Minister would be doing well if he endeavoured to meet the opposition and accepted the amendment.  I quite agree with Deputy French that no matter <Col N="539" /> what the Minister may say to the contrary, the people of Cork will look upon this appointment as a political one because of the fact of the name being mentioned in the Bill.  For the success of the council that will be entrusted with the management of affairs of the City of Cork I think it would be well if politics were kept out of the arena altogether.  I am delighted, and it augurs very well for the future, to find the different parties in this House discussing the amendments in a calm atmosphere and showing willingness to help to make this Bill, which is going to be the headline for similar Bills in the future for all the councils in the Free State, a good one.  There is very little separating the parties in their views as to what should be introduced into the Bill.</P>
      <P>For that reason I sincerely hope that the Minister will try and find some way out of the present position, and avoid dividing the House on what is, after all, only a very minor detail.</P>

      <P>I am rather unwilling to rise, because I would rather that some members of the most distinguished category of the living species who have been silent during the whole of this debate should speak.  It is very extraordinary that we should have reached this stage in the discussion of this Bill, which has never been subjected, we are told, to any party meetings of Cumann na nGaedheal, in which no single member, no single back bench member of Cumann na nGaedheal has opened his lips, in which the vast majority of Cumann na nGaedheal members during the whole of the discussion have been absent, but yet in which, the whole of the Cumann na nGaedheal members came when the bell for milking rang, and when the cattle were called home, found themselves automatically going into the old byre to be milked for party purposes.  That ought not to be so. That blight of silence which has fallen on Cumann na nGaedheal should be broken.  Some members of Cumann na nGaedheal who have some knowledge of local government, which the President courteously tells us we have not, should have had some ideas upon a Bill of this kind which, we are told, is to be <Col N="540" /> a headline for local government in this country.  Are we to take it that they are absolutely barren of ideas, that there is no single reforming amendment or improvement they can make in this Bill, and that on this Bill, which has never been submitted to a party meeting, which has come from the head of the Minister for Local Government so perfect in every word and in every line, they have got nothing to say&mdash;nothing to do, but automatically when the bell sounds for prayer, to marshal themselves as arguments into the Division Lobby in favour of it?</P>

Cork has got to live with it.  It is not merely that.  If Cork does come together by two-thirds majority and say that it does not like this husband any more, the Minister for <Col N="541" /> Local Government can say that we must have him.

      <P>Where is the liberty? I said that the difference was between marriage and forced concubinage, a sort of white slave traffic run by the Minister for Local Government.  The council is to appraise a value.  The wife is to appraise the value of the husband whom she cannot choose or get rid of. The Minister has not said a straightforward, honest word in this discussion up to the present.  The position is that of a man who was found dressed in newspapers in the public street and, when he was asked why he wore them, said, &ldquo;Decency compels me.&rdquo; Decency compels the Minister to put in some sort of camouflaged democracy, to cover the fact that he is going to continue the Commissioner system in Cork, whether we like it or not, on the strength of a majority of three or four.  This is pure and simple camouflage.  He cannot stand over openly what he is doing. They say, &ldquo;Oh! we are going to associate a manager with the council.&rdquo; They are going to associate the council with a manager who is there but whom we cannot dismiss, and they threaten us with very severe penalties if we like him well enough to keep him though they want to get rid of him.  As to the man himself, I have nothing whatever to say against Mr. Monahan.  If I <Col N="543" /> were a member of a council appointing a man I should require that the man was distinctly better than Mr. Monahan before I would prefer him to him.  He has shown a certain amount of human nature, but he has not shown as much human nature as I would have expected an ordinary human being, under the circumstances and under the force of pressure, to show.  In taking his name out of the Bill we do not say a single word against him.  The name should not be there.  The appointment should not be made by the Minister.  He should not be permanently imposed on us by the Minister.  He is there for life.  A young man goes into one of these jobs full of enthusiasm and new plans, and grows conservative with the growing years, grows through a process of ossification to senility.  It is all a steady process.  There is no period at which we automatically are able to interrupt his progress.  Would the Executive Council have taken the responsibility of sacking the late Governor-General? There came a very convenient moment for his disappearance. It would have been a very different position if, when the Chamber of Commerce for Dublin after a couple of hundred years of not eating, decided to eat together, and that man went there and committed a blazing indiscretion, a blazing political indiscretion.</P>

Of course we cannot be expected to treat the President as a responsible man.  The fictitious importance given to him by his position as temporary representative of Cork does, perhaps, <Col N="544" /> tend to make people think that you ought to regard him as responsible, but look at what he said about this matter. He was dealing with this Bill and he said that what would happen, if we were capable, if the council was capable of dealing with officials, was that the whole time would be taken up in discussing dismissed officials and the merits of their case.  If he likes to withdraw that I should be very happy, because it is a libel on Philip Monahan. Is it suggested that, under the new powers which Philip Monahan has, he is going, in the security for life which is now given him under this Bill&mdash; under a guarantee of security&mdash;the amazingly weak security I think of the permanence in his present position of the Minister for Local Government&mdash;to dismiss other people whom he could not have dismissed up to the present, or people whom he should have dismissed up to the present and has not done so, because he had not always the security which he now has?  Where are we going to get all the dismissed employees whose cases the President said were going to occupy all our time under this amendment?  I think the President makes some very reckless statements about people who are not here to answer.  To sum up, I am in favour of a definite period for review of appointment.  I am in favour of taking out of the Bill this particular name.  I am in favour, in general, of the amendment proposed by Deputy de Valera and I am hungrily anxious to hear some of the dumb-driven cattle of the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal moo.</P>

      <P>I think the House might have been amused by Deputy Flinn's perverted attempts to stampede or to dictate to this side of the House.  So far, such attempts have been practically a failure.  We have refused either to be dictated to or stampeded by the Deputy in question.  Speaking to the amendment, to come back from all the vilification and vociferation to solid ground on the question of appointing a manager from year to year or from five years to five years, Deputy de Valera said that this is what a business house would do with its manager, that this is what a board of directors would do <Col N="545" /> with their manager.  I have never heard of a business house making an appointment of a manager for five years.  So long as a manager gives satisfaction and makes good, he is retained in office.  These are the terms of his appointment, and I take it that so long as the manager of Cork makes good, so long will his appointment continue. Deputy Flinn said that the back benchers on this side had no additions to make to this Bill and that it had sprung perfectly from the brain of the Minister.  I take it that the brain of the Minister has not been the sole source of the Bill, and I think the Deputy in question knows that very well.  It has been the good fortune of this country that we have been able to look to the experience of other cities and other countries where the people started off without the advantage that we have to-day.  We have the advantage of modelling on other systems that have been worked out for years, and the advantage of adapting these systems to our own particular circumstances. That is one of the reasons why there has been so little amendment from this side of the House, and why so little time has been wasted by this side of the House.  I think if our opponents took a leaf out of our books, got their feet on solid ground, cut out the nonsense, the piffle and all the rhetoric, all the misstatements, and all the misrepresentations to which we have been listening for hours and days here, this Cork Bill would have been out of the way long before now.</P>

      <P>One complaint was that the present City Commissioner's name being included in the Bill means that it is a definite political appointment and that the City Commissioner will start under all the disabilities attached to having his name included in the Bill. The City Commissioner started under very much more severe difficulties when he came to Cork and with a far bigger handicap, and he has out-lived that and earned the respect of all but very small sections who very often arrogate to <Col N="546" /> themselves more importance than the people of Cork would give them.  I have no fear but that the City Commissioner, working with the new Corporation, will set a headline for local government all over the country that will revolutionise it, not merely in Cork but elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Deputy on the Second Stage of the Bill, if my recollection is correct, said it was necessary that the Bill should be an efficient Bill to secure safeguards for the citizens of Cork and to make for good government.  The Bill is one of a great many clauses, and the House has had before it for a long time a good number of amendments.  The Deputy, who has such very strong views, did not put down a single amendment to the Bill&mdash; not one.  I have looked through the list of amendments and I do not find his name to a single one of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing that the Deputy's heat and excitement and the enthusiasm which he has brought to bear upon this are assumed &mdash;that he is pretending to the citizens of Cork that he is taking an enormous interest in this.  I suggest that his interest is negligible; that he has none; that he did not bother himself about the Bill or what it meant and that he wants to sit upon two stools: one, <Col N="547" /> friendship with the proposed manager, and the other, one, in which he can talk to the manager over people's heads through this Dáil.  Every single speech that has been made from the Benches opposite, with the exception, I should say, of Deputy French's, has been that this name should be in the Bill; that each of them would vote for this person being appointed.  That, we are told, is public honesty.  Deputy Flinn would take the line that that is public honesty.  The Minister does the really honest thing by putting the name in the Bill, being prepared to stand over it, to be responsible for it, and to answer to this House subsequently for the acts of the city manager, if and when these acts are criticised here, if the administration should, during the years that are to come, form the subject of any criticism.  If the Deputy were really in earnest about making this Bill perfect, if he had what he pretends to portray to the Dáil and the country, sufficient intelligence to qualify him for membership of the House, he would have seen the defects in Deputy de Valera's amendment &mdash; they would have been apparent to him.  But he is more concerned with criticising members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party than with endeavouring to make this Bill a success.  I make the Deputy a present of the abuse he can pour upon me in Cork city or anywhere else, and of the statements which have been made concerning him by members of his Party as being the greatest orator since O'Connell.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> The Deputy may, perhaps, think that dramatic outbursts here are going to make a name for him in politics, but they never do.  Really honest, hard work, some attempt to improve legislation, is what the Deputy is here for. Some interest in the city of Cork, some method of proving that there is a way of bettering this measure, should be his object.  Let him get out of his mind the danger of Cumann na nGaedheal.  That is not the point.  The point is this measure and its use to the citizens of Cork.  The Deputy is standing over an amendment to this Bill which proposes that the names of the three persons of the highest qualifications should be sent down to the Cork Council.  In the same breath he states that he has a high opinion of the manager who is nominated in the Bill by the Minister.</P>
