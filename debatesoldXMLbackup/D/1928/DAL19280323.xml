      <P>As I was endeavouring to point out before the adjournment last night, something will have to be done for the people in this country if they are to exist.  I suggested, in the first place, that something should be done to reduce taxation, and in order to put us on an equal footing with our competitors, that that taxation ought to be reduced by about half.  That may seem a tall order, but if the Government want to prove to us that they are putting this country economically&mdash;we will leave out politically for the present&mdash;in as good a position as the other countries in the British Empire, which we have been told we are definitely a part of, they will need to reduce taxation by some £10,000,000 or £11,000,000. Perhaps that is impossible.  If so, we will have to face that matter in some other way.  Perhaps we could come to some arrangement by which the £5,000,000 that is going yearly to the British Government could be stopped. If not, we could at least, balance our Budget and see that the normal income is sufficient to defray current expenses. We could endeavour to bring the standard of living in this country up to what it should be, in order to <Col N="1767" /> give people at least the ordinary comforts of life.  Not only the farmers and agricultural labourers, but every class is on the verge of starvation at the present time.  I do not know if they are satisfied to go on with the present arrangement, keeping a Government in power which is admittedly not leaving them economically in as good a position as they were&mdash;if, on top of that, they are to be told that no political advantage is to be reached by this arrangement. If Ireland were a self-contained country, and if we were not exporting or importing, it would not matter so much about the cost of Government, because the producer would be in a position to charge whatever he liked to the consumer&mdash;to the civil servant, and anybody else that bought his stuff. He could charge what he liked, and whatever salaries we pay our higher officials, they would, in turn, have to pay the producer for what they bought. But, as we are not a self-contained country, the matter is quite different.  If it is impossible, we ought to be told that economically this country cannot expect to be in as good a position as, say, England or other countries that we can compare ourselves with.  If we are a bankrupt country, we had better realise that and cut our coat according to our cloth.  There would be something to be said for suffering privation economically if we thought we were going to gain something politically sometime.  When we are told definitely that the policy of the Government is that we should remain as we are, part of the British Empire; when we are told that there is to be no end of partition except by consent&mdash;that we must wait until the people of the North-East consent to come into this State, and that, further, we must wait until Great Britain consents also to that union&mdash; very little hope is held out to the people in their present state of starvation.</P>
      <P>The President told us yesterday that their policy is the same as it was for the past five years.  Perhaps that is far enough to go back.  On August 5th, 1923, the President said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have appointed the ablest and best member of the Executive Council as our Boundary Commissioner. <Col N="1768" /> and in his hands it will be safe. When we are returned we will take the matter up and see it carried through to what we hope and believe will be a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>The ablest and best member of the Executive Council on the very same date&mdash;August 5th, 1923&mdash;said:</P>
    <P>The North-East-Counties will be glad and proud to throw in their lot with the rest of Ireland.  I know the North-East as well as any man, and I say that by making the most and the best of the power that is given into your hands you will take the surest way.  It won't be rectifying the Boundary.  There will be no Boundary.  The Boundary will be the sea, and no other.</P>
    <P>That is within the last five years.</P>

      <P>The Vote on Account was debated for two days.  It was concluded by agreement on Wednesday evening before the time allotted to private Deputies' business on the understanding that the Minister for Finance, in opening the debate on the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill, would reply to what had been said on the Vote on Account.  The two matters were rather similar, of course.  I understood that the Minister for Finance was replying to a question addressed to him by Deputy Lemass and that, while replying to it, he was not endeavouring to open a debate upon it.  The President yesterday made a further declaration on the matter.  I have allowed Deputy Ryan to proceed as far as he has proceeded, but we can hardly go into the Boundary question now.</P>

      <P>An important declaration of policy was made yesterday by the President, and a similarly important declaration, though of a different nature, was made by the Minister for Finance.  They know, or they ought to know, the rules of order fairly well by this time, and surely when they make such declarations they do not expect that everybody else in the House is to remain silent while they are allowed to make these declarations, perhaps out of order&mdash;that is for you to decide&mdash; but they have been allowed to make them, at any rate.  They made them under certain headings.  The same debate is still in progress.  I respectfully submit that it cannot be held we are out of order in commenting upon the important declarations made by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position in which the Minister for Finance was.  In consequence of the agreement to terminate the debate on the Vote on Account by 7 o'clock on Wednesday the Minister did not get an opportunity of replying, and he made a brief statement in reply to the questions put by me during the debate on the Vote on Account, on the debate on this Bill.  The President, however, intervened later on in the debate to make a statement of a similar nature. Of course I can understand his position also.  He was anxious, no doubt, to repair the damage which the Minister for Finance had done.  Having given the President that facility, I think that we should also be given facilities to criticise the remarks made by the President, even if we do not deal with the remarks made by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>May I intervene for one moment?  I do not know whether Deputies quite appreciate what the position is, but the old age pensioners and many other persons cannot get paid unless this Bill passes.  This Bill must pass the Seanad after being discussed here, and it is by no means a Party matter.  There will be no money for Post Office officials, for teachers, and for other charges of that sort if it is not passed, and I certainly invite sober reflection upon the question of unnecessary delay in allowing the Bill to be passed.</P>

      <P>It is not precisely a question of order; it is a question of agreement.  The debate on the Central Fund Bill should not be concerned with details.  As a matter of fact, this debate is very largely a repetition of that on the Vote on Account. What I suggested to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was a particular matter of policy on the Vote on Account and on the Central Fund Bill. The statement made by the Minister for Finance was a brief statement as Deputy Lemass said, in reply to certain questions of his.  Deputy Lemass asked, in the course of the debate on the Vote on Account, if the President had a declaration of policy to make.  I think it was simply a statement of policy, and I do not think, at this stage of the debate on the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill, that we could proceed to debate the whole question of Government policy, particularly of Government national policy, and go back to the Boundary.  I allowed Deputy Ryan to go a certain distance, but I do not know whether the Deputy himself really desires to do what would be tantamount now to initiating a debate upon the Boundary position.  It would be very difficult to do it.  The Central Fund Bill is a matter which could not remedy that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I would have raised this matter at all except that it seems to be bound up with the economic position.  The point I wanted to make is this, that if we are, as it appears we are, overtaxed in this country as compared with Great Britain, and if we are going to remain a part of the British Empire, why would the Party opposite not go back to Westminster again?  They would have the same facilities there for discussing British Empire matters.  There would be the same, or practically the same, facilities there for discussing the affairs of this country; they would have the advantage of sitting there in the same <Col N="1772" /> House with the members from Northern Ireland, and economically the country would be better off.  There would be some reason for continuing this Parliament if our ultimate aim was to become an absolutely independent State.  But if our ultimate aim is not that, there is no justification whatsoever for carrying on a Partition Parliament. That is the only point I wished to make in the matter of the statements made by the Minister for Finance and the President.  I do not wish to hold up this matter further.  I suppose it is true that the money is wanted, as the President said, to pay old age pensions and other things.  These are the little things that are always pointed out to us as requiring to be paid&mdash;the old age pensions, unemployment, the agricultural grant, the beet subsidy, and a list of that sort.  But what we object to in this Bill is that it gives power to pay the Governor-General and the others on the list that we have so often enumerated here, and that is the reason why we oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the time of the House yesterday was taken up in an effort by Fianna Fáil to elicit from the Government what their political policy was in so far as this State is concerned, and a great deal of time was also taken up by the Government Party in dealing with the matters raised.  To my mind, on a Vote of this kind the time of the House ought to be spent on material matters.  There is a time and a place for discussing the political aspirations of this country, and I believe that the people themselves will eventually settle that question.  What I and the members of my Party are concerned with is to see that sufficient money is included in the Estimates to secure better social services for this country, and the one thing that stands out in our minds as needing to be dealt with most of all is the housing question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good many questions have been put to the Government and to the President as to what their intentions are as far as housing is concerned, especially with reference to the ability or inclination of the Government to secure that long term loans would be available for the different local authorities in the State. I know I will be told by the President, <Col N="1773" /> as I have often been told, that the Government have done and are doing a great deal for housing.  I am prepared to admit that, but though the efforts made by the Government are good, they only touch the fringe of the situation. It has been repeatedly pointed out by members of this Party that the efforts are not sufficient to deal with the real housing problem.  The subsidies given are good as far as they go, but with the limited borrowing power of the local authorities and the state of the money market, it is absolutely impossible for the local authorities to provide houses for what is generally described as the unskilled artisan.  Surely, the President and the Minister for Finance ought to have stated yesterday what their policy is going to be for the present year, in so far as the representations made for long term loans are concerned. The President yesterday; when Deputy Derrig said a lesser amount was made available for housing this year than last, brought forth his usual stock answer that money is there, but no application has been made for it.  We have repeatedly pointed out that the position in the money market and the attitude of banks are such as to prevent local authorities from taking advantage of the offer.  If the Government had reverted to the old system in existence when the British Government was here, of giving loans for sixty years, the housing problem could be solved, but until something like that is done there is no hope that the congestion in the slum areas all over the country will be relieved.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is this: a bungalow type of house is being built in a great number of towns in Ireland for something like £290.  When you approach the bank to borrow to build that house the period for which you will get the money is ten years.  Up to two years ago you could get it for fifteen.  On that house you will get a subsidy of £80, and therefore you will have to borrow £210.  On the annuity system it will cost you £12 10s. per year, and the economic value of that house works out at 10s. 4d. per week. To that have to be added rates, expenses of collection and other small things, bringing it practically up to <Col N="1774" /> 12s. per week.  I ask this House do they think it possible that a working man in a provincial town in Ireland to-day, where the rate of wages is from 30s. to £2, can possibly pay such a rent. On the other hand, if the Government were to release money from the Local Loans Account for sixty years, the local authorities could build that same house at £290, and still give the subsidy of £80, it would work out at 5s. 2d. per week.  This would be getting nearer to what the workman would be able to pay, and in a short time would solve the housing problem that we are all confronted with.  I seriously suggest to the Government, if it has the intention, that this is the only means by which the housing problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions are being made at the moment by the Unemployment Committee and the Engineers' Association. I have not examined them.  I do not know what they mean at rock bottom, but I suggest what I have already outlined would in itself solve the housing problem.  I would ask the Minister for Finance, when replying, to let the House know if it is his intention during this year, as he tentatively promised last year, that long-term loans will be made available.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the question of road-making in connection with the Local Government Department. Early in March Deputy Broderick put down a question asking the Minister for Local Government what amount of money would be available during the year for the construction of roads and road-making generally, and the figures given by the Minister for Local Government show plainly that the amount of money available this year, in my own constituency at least, was only about one-fifth of what was made available last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>From the figures supplied by Deputy Broderick, so far as my constituency is concerned, only one-fifth of the amount available last year is available this year.  The fact that this answer was given rather late and that notice was given rather late to the various County Councils in the Saorstát, will, to my mind, lead to a great deal more unemployment this year in the rural areas than prevailed for the last three or four years.  It was taken for granted in the county councils in the Saorstát that a certain amount of money equivalent, a great many of them thought, to that given during the last two or three years would be available during the present financial year for road-making, and a great many struck their estimates in accordance with what they believed would be forthcoming from the Department of Local Government.  The attitude taken up by the present Minister for Local Government has been certainly taken very badly by the different county councils.  I hope he is not optimistic enough to think that the roads in the Saorstát are yet anything like what they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give this Department credit for making a large amount of money <Col N="1776" /> available for the last few years in the effort to give us proper roads in the country, but a great deal yet remains to be done.  Coupled with the fact of the roads being neglected is the fact that the menace of unemployment is going to be increased during the present year to a greater extent than it was last year. Again there is a very small amount available in the estimates for the relief of unemployment.  As a matter of fact, I think I would be right in saying that there is no money at all available for the relief of unemployment, because a great deal, if not all, of the amount that now appears in the estimates will have been spent by the 31st March.  So much of it has already been taken up by the various local authorities that there is no hope of anything being available in the near future for the relief of unemployment.  I hope again that the Government are not optimistic enough to think that unemployment is being relieved to such an extent by the £150,000 which they made available before Christmas that unemployment has been removed altogether.  I would seriously suggest to the Government to reconsider their whole policy of road-making for the present year, and that they should at least make the same amount available during the present year as they did last year.  They have certainly led the county councils astray by the attitude the Minister for Local Government took up on the 31st March.  I hope that on that and on the housing question we may have a clear statement of policy from the Minister for Finance when he is winding up.  I do hope that we will hear something very definite from the President or the Minister for Finance on these important matters.</P>

      <P>The President announced to-day, after Public Business, that he was going to move that private members' time would be taken up this afternoon.  I call the President's attention to the fact that there is a Standing Order in existence prohibiting him from doing that after Public Business commences.  We all know that the President does not know his own Standing Orders.  I would refer him to Standing Order No. 78.</P>

      <P>Like many other things the President has read, he has not got it into his head.  It is not a bit of wonder that the Ministers are anxious to closure a debate on their policy. Ministers have been coming here for the last five or six years asking the Irish people's representatives to vote them money, and they did not want to account for the expenditure of that money in a proper way to the people's representatives.  We questioned them regarding their national policy.  Mr. Lemass asked Mr. Blythe, and also asked Mr. Cosgrave, and Mr. Cosgrave refused to allow anybody to refer to the national policy he stood for before 1921.  He was a great braggart calling for proof, calling for quotations, until a member rose up to give him some quotations.  Mr. Cosgrave&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;said at Kilkenny on the 31st August, 1927, when he was asking the people to support his policy, &ldquo;I want you to strike a blow for religion, liberty, honour and public morality.&rdquo;  We are pleased to see here before us the strikers of blows for honour, religion and public morality. We want to examine the question as to whether their policy does in fact enable them to claim that they are strikers of blows for honour, religion and public morality.  Deputy Seán Brady was going to examine that question at the invitation of President Cosgrave, and President Cosgrave ran away from the speech and would not give him time to intervene to give him some quotations to show whether President Cosgrave was in fact a striker of blows for honour, religion and public morality.  President Cosgrave the other day taunted us and wanted to know whether we stood for constitutionalism. I suppose he thought we were going to reply, like the colleague sitting beside him.  Mr. Blythe, the Minister for Finance of the Irish Free State, once said: &ldquo;The road to freedom is by cutting a sword track through our enemies.&rdquo;  On another occasion, and on many occasions, Mr. Blythe, who is a striker of blows for liberty, religion, honour and public morality, used to say: &ldquo;The rifle and the machine-gun are the weapons of the tyrant, the dagger and the revolver the weapons of the people.&rdquo;  A lot of blab from these strikers of blows for liberty, religion, honour and public morality used to come out in order that they would get support from the people for what they alleged was their policy. Deputy Tierney was here the other day and, referring to something Deputy Lemass said, stated that we had one foot in an armed camp and the other in the constitutional camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tierney, the great striker of blows for liberty, morality, freedom and honour, once had his foot in an armed camp before 1916.  1916 came along and he took his foot out of the armed camp, and like a valiant striker of blows for religion, honour, morality and freedom, he put down his mighty feet one after the other as quickly as he could far away from the armed <Col N="1779" /> camp.  President Cosgrave yesterday, when I asked him was he in fact a Nationalist, or did he in fact claim he was a Nationalist, in view of what his colleague, the Minister for Finance said, did not condescend to give a reply. I submit that a question so very pertinent as that should have a reply here before Deputies vote the Government any money.  The Front Bench opposite got support from the people of the country and from men who are obviously honest, like Deputy Timothy Sheehy, in the belief that they were going to do something to bring this country to freedom.  Before 1921 these people asked young men to die in order that the right of the Irish people to go forward for freedom might be retained to them.  Now, some years after the Minister for Finance got young men to shed their blood for the rights of the Irish people to bring a Republic to this country, he comes along, and in order to keep the friendship of people like Deputy Cooper, a few Irish banks and Guinness's, and his friends, Winston Churchill and Baldwin, and a few more of that ilk, he says that he is quite content to remain within the British Empire. It is time that the Irish people saw through these strikers of blows for religion, honour and public morality, and the time is coming when the people will give proof that they are seeing through them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tierney yesterday was horrified that poor people should be asked to live on a mere pittance of £1,000 per year.  He is like President Cosgrave, I suppose, who thinks that some fairy money comes into the Free State Exchequer. It does not come from the farmers; where does it come from?  It comes from his fairy godmother.  I never heard Deputy Tierney express his horror at the fact that poor people have to live on 10s., 9s. and 7s. 6d. per week. But he is horrified that a servant of the Irish people, a man who is being paid out of the reduction of the old age pensioners, should get a mere pittance of £1,000 per year.  Deputy de Valera did say, and we of this party to a man, stand behind him in saying, and every honest far-seeing citizen stands behind <Col N="1780" /> him when he said that while this country is in its present economic position no public servant should get more than £1,000 per year.  Deputy Tierney sneered at Deputy de Valera because Deputy de Valera gave proof that he meant what he said.  Five or six years ago he said that Ministers and other servants of the Dáil should not receive more than £500 per year.  Deputy de Valera was then President of Dáil Eireann, and was in a position to put his words into effect, and he put them into effect regarding himself.</P>
    <P>President Cosgrave, I am sorry to say, has now left the House, because I wanted to refer to the ten per cent. that was given to the Nationalists of this country, which President Cosgrave says he embodied in the London Pact without being asked by anybody to do so.  Perhaps we shall get another day for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence is present. One reason why the House should not vote any money to the present Executive is the fact that that Executive contains the Minister for Defence, with the Minister for Defence's tongue.  The Minister for Defence has consistently tried to create bitterness amongst our people since six months before Winston Churchill sent these people their instructions to attack the Four Courts. Ever since Mr. Churchill sent those instructions to the Free State Executive, and since they carried them out, the Minister for Defence has been carrying on the fell work started amongst our people by the foreign enemies of our people.  He has been widening the breach day after day&mdash;the breach started here amongst our unfortunate, helpless people by a powerful foreign enemy.  We stand, and we have always stood, and with the help of goodness always shall stand, for uniting the best elements of our people to stand by their rights and enable the ordinary average citizen who is willing to work to live at home here.  Sneering tongues like that possessed by the Minister for Defence simply prevent any unity coming about amongst our sundered people.  We did all in our power to stave off the civil war.  The Minister for Defence not alone took the orders of the British to start that civil war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he is in fact carrying on that policy to-day.  No later than last night a case was discussed here, and the Minister for Defence could have done something to cover over the bitterness created by the carrying out of Churchill's order on 28th June, 1922.  Instead of trying to do something to placate the embittered feeling, the Minister for Defence stood over and justified what, from the facts produced here, was obviously a foul and deliberate murder.  We want not to punish anybody for what he did in the civil war.  We want to get away from the bitterness created by the carrying out of Churchill's orders, and one way that that can be done is not by sneering at the poverty of people who lost their relatives in the civil war, not by denying that the Government is in duty bound to support the people whose relatives they murdered, but is by accepting the fact that we are now five years after the civil war, that people were killed and maimed on both sides, and that it is up to all right-thinking citizens to try as far as they can to overcome the ill-effects of the carrying out of Churchill's orders, and maintain the maimed, no matter on which side they were fighting, and the dependents of the people who were killed, no matter on which side the people who were killed were fighting.</P>
      <P>When speaking on Army pensions I said that we did not stand for the granting of pensions to able-bodied men. I just want to make that remark because it was, I think, rather unintentionally commented on in one of the papers, and one would think that we stood for the granting of pensions to people who served during the Black-and-Tan war.  We do not stand for the granting of pensions to able-bodied men who were not promised pensions when they started to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin asks a question, and the reply to that question <Col N="1782" /> is that there were a certain number of R.I.C. men that resigned in the Black-and-Tan war because they would not obey the British instructions to carry out war on their own people.  These men resigned and when they resigned they were given a promise by Michael Collins that they would not be let down. Michael Collins was speaking then authoritatively on behalf of the then Government of the Irish people and we mean to see, whenever we have the power to put that promise into effect, that it will be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

We want to see that they are not penalised for standing for the Irish people rather than for the British Government.</P>
      <P>I want again to appeal to this House not to pass this Bill until they receive some assurance from the Government Benches that they are going to try their utmost to go forward from the disastrous divisions created in this country by the British Government when they sent over their orders to attack the Four Courts and when the Four Courts were attacked.  I want the House not to give one penny to the Government until they give a promise that they are going to stand by the rights of the Irish people to freedom and independence, and that they are not going to degrade our nation by carrying out the wishes of the British in this country, every time the British express a wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate continues I would like to say Deputy Aiken got a patient hearing for a particular speech on Government policy, and he worked a considerable number of statements in in regard, for example, to the attack on the Four Courts in 1922.  Now I propose that, except for the speech of the Minister for Finance in concluding this debate, this matter of Government policy should not be further discussed.  Perhaps it is no harm to set out how it was raised.  It was raised, on Tuesday last, by Deputy Lemass in asking a series <Col N="1783" /> of questions, and the acting Ceann Comhairle said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have allowed the Deputy to go a considerable length in the hope that he would connect this matter to the question under discussion.  The Treaty is not under consideration, and unless the Deputy directs his argument to connect it with this Vote he must curtail that line.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the Deputy did curtail his argument, subsequently, and the Minister for Finance made a statement of policy in reply which was afterwards followed by the President.  I think a good deal of what we have just listened to would have been more relevant to a debate, for example, on the nomination of members of the Executive Council by the President than on the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill.  I want to put it to the House whether this particular Central Fund Bill is the time for going into such an extremely wide field of debate as that now raised. I have never in the course of debate here since the Fianna Fáil Party came into the House applied the technical rules of Parliamentary debate at all, and the result is often that when Deputies get a certain amount of liberty they want to go on and on.  In this case we have had a statement from the President, from the Minister for Finance, and from Deputy Ryan, and now a statement from Deputy Aiken. I think clearly the Minister for Finance in replying must be allowed to make some reference to those statements. But before the debate continues I think the House should decide whether the Central Fund Bill is the occasion on which it wants to debate these particular matters.  It appears to me from my particular position in the matter that if the Minister in replying was allowed to deal with some matters raised by Deputy Aiken, that would be reasonable, but that the debate should range now at this stage, the Bill having been debated a whole day, over all these matters of Government national policy, which might be raised at another time and otherwise, seems to me to be an extraordinary procedure. I would like the House to be clear before we enter upon that procedure.</P>

      <P>There is a consistent theory on the other side, on the Fianna Fáil Benches, that for some unknown reason they have a right to say all they want to say about any person; that they have the right to hit out.  I suggest that if this procedure under which a Deputy like poor Deputy Aiken is allowed to make silly speeches on any subject he chooses, that other Deputies should be permitted to answer him in kind.  If that sort of thing is allowed to go on, so far from bringing back the debate to the position in which you would like to see it, when Deputies would be speaking to a definite point, certain Deputies in my opinion will trade on it, and will take advantage of the protection they are getting, and the debate will travel far from the sphere to which it should be confined.  As far as I am personally concerned, I wanted to follow Deputy Aiken and it was my intention to give my opinion of him just as freely as he gave his opinion of members of the Executive Council.  If I cannot do that, if it is not in order, then I think other Deputies should not be permitted such liberty.</P>

We deliberately appeal that the Minister should have the opportunity which we had upon these Benches.  I shall probably be following him, and so that this Bill may not be hampered in any way I am prepared to debar myself from answering the Minister, from extending the liberty which we ask you to extend to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would like to have the Central Fund Bill passed to-day. <Col N="1785" /> It is necessary to have it passed because no payments can be made after the 31st March unless this Bill becomes law and a considerable number of people may suffer inconvenience and hardship by the delay.  It is still time to move that the House should continue to sit until 6 o'clock, if that course would be agreeable to Deputies, in order that Deputies may have plenty of liberty for discussion.  If that is desired, I would be prepared to move it and we could resume this particular debate when the Central Fund Bill is passed. For that purpose the debate could be interrupted for a short period at, say, 12 o'clock, and resumed at 2 o'clock. I do not want to prevent any particular matter that Deputies are anxious to discuss from being discussed.  I do, however, think that we ought to arrange to pass this Bill to-day.</P>

I think the debate we have entered upon might very usefully be continued over several days, perhaps not on this particular Bill.  I believe that some day or another we must arrange to start a discussion of that nature with full knowledge of the fact that we will go into all the matters that have been mentioned.  I, for one, would like a discussion of that sort, and I know there are many Deputies on my side of the House who would be quite keen if Minister after Minister got up to answer points we wish to make against them.  We are keen to have that.  We know this much&mdash;I do, at least&mdash;that for years these same Ministers have had opportunities that I have not had of telling the public from a platform like this what their side of the question was and of misrepresenting the position.  They have made misstatements about the whole position from 1921 onwards, and until now they have never been faced by people who know as much about the history of that time as we do.  That is so.  They have not been faced on a ground such as this by people who know the facts as we know them.  For the first time these matters have been gone into as closely <Col N="1786" /> as they have recently been gone into, and Ministers have had people with knowledge facing them.  When that stage was arrived at we had the squeals and the appeals that we heard during the last week from the President and others to let bygones be bygones, and to forget the past.  I am prepared, as one, to forget the past if I can, although it is not a very easy thing to do it.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up any length of time in replying because the debate has been so discursive that to reply even to a quarter of the points raised would be impossible in the time at my disposal.  One point that has been raised this morning I will refer to, and that is the question of long-term loans for housing.  The Committee on Unemployment have presented a report which we regard as a very useful and valuable report.  That report makes certain recommendations. We are considering that report and trying to see what action can be taken to put into operation a long-term programme of housing which will in the course, say, of ten years or thereabouts, solve the housing problem for us.  In connection with that we are considering this question of opening the Local Loans Fund and we are favourably considering that.  While a definite decision has not yet been come to, I have to say that we hope to make an announcement on that and other matters connected with housing at an early date.  Deputies, in the course of the debate, have pointed out that there was less money in the Estimates for drainage this year than there was last year, and in the matter of housing a similar complaint has been made.  In regard to housing, undoubtedly fresh proposals will have to be laid before the Dáil in the coming year.  With regard to drainage, the position is this, that it has been extremely hard to get ahead with drainage. A great many of the schemes under examination have proved to be very far from economic schemes.  They are schemes that have been found not to be economic to the owners of the land even with the help of a thirty-three and one-third per cent.  Government grant.  As the Deputies are aware, the Government would be prepared to increase their grant from thirty-three and one-third per cent. to fifty per cent. provided that for every pound over thirty-three and one-third per cent, the county councils will contribute another pound.  In most cases, <Col N="1790" /> the county councils have absolutely refused to make any contribution. In some cases there have been agreements to contribute.  Because of this difficulty in finding schemes that are really economic with the help that can be given it has not been possible to get ahead rapidly with drainage.  The money provided in the Estimates for the coming year is the amount which this year's experience shows would be likely to be required. We are very anxious to get on with drainage, but we do not feel that drainage is a work that should be done irrespective of cost and irrespective of economic results, but there is certainly no slowing down.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties of county councils in this matter, but I do think that a somewhat more progressive policy might be pursued by the county councils, and they might be more willing to put up contributions to enable the work to be carried out in the areas under their jurisdiction.  I do hope that Deputies who have pressed here for additional assistance for drainage will press the county councils in their local areas to contribute something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If the county council would contribute five or six per cent. of the cost of this scheme, then there would be an additional five or six per cent. contribution by the Government, and these, added to the thirty-three and one-third per cent. which the Government are giving in every case, would suffice to make the scheme economic.  I would hope, if that matter is pressed on the county councils, that we would make more progress.  But when we are preparing the Estimates we cannot put in more money than our actual experience up to date leads us to believe to be necessary.  I agree with you, A Chinn Comhairle, that it is unfortunate that we did not succeed in arranging before the commencement of this debate on the Bill that some one or two subjects would be discussed.  It is quite possible that if we had at the beginning arranged to discuss the subject which Deputy O'Kelly was referring to, and had begun with that, <Col N="1791" /> and had continued it right through this Bill, we might have been able to conclude it.  On the other hand, if we had taken a subject like drainage, we should have had a very thorough discussion on that subject.  If we had taken a subject like housing or a subject like the agricultural policy of the Government which Deputy Ryan raised, and if we had taken that at the beginning of the debate and carried it on to the Central Fund Bill, we could have a very thorough discussion, whereas in actual fact we were ranging very widely and discursively over all Government policy, and it has been impossible, I think, to discuss any matter satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I should reply any further at this stage to the question that was raised in connection with the military service pensions.  But the reason why the documents which the Auditor-General asked for were not given to him, was simply this, that you could not give the documents to the Comptroller and Auditor-General without the right to have these documents inspected by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think that would be of no value, and would place the Comptroller and Auditor-General in a very invidious position.  He would be in an invidious position if he were to comment on certain documents and was not to be in a position to produce these documents here for the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the documents are produced to the Committee of Public Accounts, undoubtedly they could not remain confidential documents.</P>
      <P>If there were details, shall I say, of a sensational or interesting character in any of the documents, I think, without casting any aspersion on any members of the Public Accounts Committee, it would be impossible to secure that secrecy be observed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The documents that relate to military service pensions do contain details in regard to which, in fairness to individuals and in the public interest, the utmost <Col N="1792" /> secrecy should be observed.  Nobody has had the opportunity of seeing those documents except the members of the Board of Assessors and one or two officials connected with the Board.  A very limited group of people have seen them.  Under the Military Service Pensions Act, in order to qualify for a pension, it is necessary to have had pre-Truce service, not merely service in <i>Oglaigh na hEireann,</i> but active service, and in order to establish active service as distinct from mere membership of the Volunteers, the individual applicant for a pension has to give details of actions done.  At the present stage, and in view of the fact that their neighbours with whom they are now living in amity might have been involved in some way or other in these actions, it is quite contrary, I think, to the public interest that the details should become known or come into the possession of anybody who might be tempted to give publicity to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. The Minister for Finance should be aware of the fact that there was a general understanding come to that this question should be left over for discussion on another and more appropriate occasion.  The Minister himself said that he had only part of the documents in connection with the Report of the Public Accounts Committee in his possession for two days.  I think it is unfair at this stage, in view of the agreement come to last night in this House, that the Minister should attempt to reply to a case that has not yet been made here on behalf of the Public Accounts Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on another point.  I was replying to the point that no reason at all existed on the Government side for taking up the attitude that has been taken up except a corrupt one.  I was pointing out that there were reasons, but not reasons of the sort that had been insinuated or suggested from the Fianna Fáil Benches. I do not want to go any further into the matter.  I was just coming to that conclusion when Deputy Davin interrupted me.  With regard to the debate that Deputy O'Kelly has referred to, I think that a motion could be put down by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am inclined <Col N="1793" /> to the view that it would be a desirable thing, in the interests of the expeditious transaction of business here, that time should be given for that motion, because as far as I can see, until the discussion has taken place, we are going to have it taking place in a piecemeal and unsatisfactory fashion, in almost all debates when anything of a general character arises.  If the Deputy will put down such a motion, I will consult with the President and see what arrangement can be made to give plenty of time to have the whole thing discussed.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That a Select Committee to be nominated by the Committee of Selection be set up forthwith with power to review the cases of all prisoners who claim that their cases arise out of the civil war or apart from strictly legal considerations have a political aspect and to recommend to the Executive Council the release of such prisoners&rdquo; (Patrick J.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussion on this motion on Wednesday last, the speech by the Minister for Justice made it clear that there are three classes of prisoners under consideration. In the first class, there are prisoners who have not been released under what is called the amnesty of 1924.  I have knowledge of only one such case&mdash;there may be others&mdash;and that is the case of the man McPeake. No argument has been put forward for the continued detention of McPeake. The statement was made by the Minister for Justice that he was detained because he was a deserter.  We could prove that hundreds of others who had been in prison as deserters from the Army were released.  It is, I think, more than obvious that the amnesty was introduced not so much to enable the Government to release the prisoners which it held from the Republican side in the civil war, as to to enable it to avoid having to put into prison a very considerable number of the National Army.  But the amnesty was introduced, and as the Government takes credit for it on every conceivable occasion, we think it should apply its terms consistently when a case is brought to <Col N="1797" /> its notice of one who is undoubtedly covered by it and who is still in jail. That case should be given special consideration and an immediate release ordered.</P>
      <P>There is in the second category the class of prisoners who escaped from Mountjoy Prison in 1925, and we submit that there can be no question in anyone's mind that these men are not criminals in the ordinary sense.  Their imprisonment is an indication of a certain political situation in this country, and we suggest that the welfare of the country, its stability, its order and progress depend very largely on our being able to remove such causes of bitterness as exist, and one of the gravest causes of bitterness and strife that exists is the continued detention of these men and the savage and vindictive sentences which have been imposed upon such of them as have recently been re-arrested. The Minister read us a long list of prisoners and the crimes, as he described them, for which they were sentenced. He asked us if we maintained that these men were political prisoners and should be released as such.  As I pointed out to the Minister, we have not asked that these prisoners should be released.  We asked that &ldquo;A Select Committee, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be set up forthwith to review the cases of all prisoners who claim that their cases arise out of the civil war or apart from strictly legal considerations have a political aspect.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>With power to recommend to the Executive Council.  If you like we will amend the motion.  What we want to have considered by this House is the advisability of setting up a committee to review all these cases and to recommend to the Dáil and the Executive Council the release of such of them as can be clearly proved to be political prisoners.  We do not want <Col N="1798" /> the release of any others.  If the Minister thinks he can convince that committee that the prisoners whose names he read out are not political prisoners, very well.  On that committee there would be a majority holding the same views as he holds, and he would have no difficulty whatever in convincing them.  If the Government are anxious that the causes of friction should be removed, the setting up of this committee would be one step in that direction. We are not coming here with a demand for the release of any prisoners whom we care to name, or anything of that kind, but to set up a committee to examine the situation, and we ask you to release definitely the men whose imprisonment arose directly out of the civil war and who for some reason were not released under the amnesty.  We ask you to consider the advisability of forgetting the events that arose in the year 1925, and to release the men now being punished for having escaped from prison on that occasion.  As we pointed out, there is a different situation now existing, and if you persist in ignoring that fact you will succeed undoubtedly in bringing the country back to the situation that then existed.  If that is what you want, well and good.  There is also the case of the third class of prisoners, about whom there is considerable doubt.  Many of the names the Minister read out did not at first sight appear to me to be political prisoners. Deputy Ruttledge pointed out that he did not mention half of them, and the Minister drew on a general list and pretended that we were claiming their release.  We were not.</P>

Whatever view the majority of the Committee take we will be quite satisfied to abide by in this particular instance.  We consider that a debate of this nature is not one that should be made an opportunity for raising or venting party passions or anything of that kind.  We are all anxious, I hope, to ensure that some general basis for co-operation, some line along which there can be unity of effort on the part of all the people of Ireland can be found, so that however we may disagree as to the ultimate goal at which we should arrive, or however we may disagree as to the names we shall call ourselves or matters of that kind, we can at least work together in the things we have in common.  If we want to get that co-operation and that sense of unity of effort we have got, even at the sacrifice of a little pride, to cut out everything that is likely to militate against it.  Undoubtedly, the one thing that is militating against it is the continued detention of these prisoners, particularly those who have been held since the civil war, and those now in prison for having escaped in 1925.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion.  My main reason for doing so is that I believe it is in the interests of this country that this House should do all it can to wipe out the bitter memories of the last three years. I am satisfied from what I have been told, in my own constituency at any rate, that the majority of the people who were opposed very strongly to the men who are now in prison believe that they should be released if their only crime was a political crime.  I am not asking and would not ask for the release of any ordinary criminal simply because he was pleased to say he belonged to a certain political organisation. I doubt if the Fianna Fáil Party would even ask that, but I say there is not going to be a spirit of peace in this country or in this House unless we are prepared to wipe out so far as we can everything that happened during the last five or six years.  We have had to <Col N="1800" /> sit here and listen to terrible accusations hurled across the House by members of the two large Parties.  That is, perhaps, not to be wondered at.  There are members on the Fianna Fáil and Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who have reason to feel sore over certain things that happened during the last five or six years.  There are many members on both sides of the House who have had to endure great personal losses and endure great personal sorrows, and it is perhaps too much to ask even now that they should forget these things.  But I think it is not too much to ask that they should forgive what has happened.  That is what we ask.  I must say that a better headline should be set from the front Benches on both sides.  I would appeal to members of the Government Party to follow the line taken by President Cosgrave rather than the line taken by the Minister for Defence last evening.  On the other hand, I would ask the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to follow the line set by Deputy Boland and Deputy Lemass in the concluding part of his speech to-day, rather than follow the line of those who shout &ldquo;murder&rdquo; across the House, and so on.  That will not get us anywhere, and whether we are aiming to keep the Free State or whether we are aiming for full and complete independence, neither will be achieved by calling each other murderers. If anything at all will happen arising out of that it will be that the country will suffer, and that the poor people will suffer.  When we get up to make our contributions to a debate we ought not to speak as if no person other than ourselves was concerned or would be affected by what we say.  We ought to have in mind that these accusations, true or false, will not help to secure greater production, more peace and more prosperity.  I hope for the sake of the country and for the sake of those on both sides who laid down their lives for the country that a different attitude will be adopted.  Great Irishmen on both sides were shot down.  You had Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha, great Irishmen unquestionably, each of them in his heart, I am satisfied, believing that he was doing his best for Ireland in the best possible way, and we ought to admit that.  I am quite satisfied <Col N="1801" /> that there are as good Irishmen on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches as on the Fianna Fáil Benches, and that there are as good Irishmen on the Fianna Fáil Benches as on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches.</P>

I suggest to the Government that it would be a good thing for the peace of the country and for the good government of the country if they were magnanimous in this matter.  The Government can afford to be magnanimous, and the Government ought to consider before anything else the peace of the country, because unless we are to have peace, unless, as Deputy Lemass said, we can agree to come here and agree to differ and to fight, each from his own point of view, for the welfare and the destinies of this nation, the sooner this House is scrapped the better.</P>
      <P>For that reason, and for no other reason, for the sake of the country, because we desire above anything else to see peace in this country, because turmoil in this country will lean more heavily on the poor and the workers than on any other section, we support this motion.  We hope that the Government will agree to set up the tribunal asked for, or some similar tribunal, so that these cases may be investigated. If it is found that the statements made on behalf of those prisoners are true they should be released; if it is proved, on the other hand, to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the statements made on their behalf are not true, then certainly they should be kept in prison.  I would appeal very strongly to Deputies to see that they are prepared to do what they can to make the passage to complete unity and complete peace as smooth as they possibly can, and that they will vote for the motion.</P>

      <P>As we are on this question of unity, a lot of nonsense is talked about unity&mdash;utter meaningless drivel.  Unity is not an ideal in any civilised country.  The ideal of unity seems to be completely misunderstood. The healthiest things in the world are honest differences.  There is, though, a fundamental unity in all countries.  I am afraid that there is not a fundamental unity here.  And the reason why there is not a fundamental unity here is because all democratic forms are denied.  I will tell you how you can have unity, on one basis and on one basis only.  There is no use in talking about forgive and forget.  If you were serious you would not talk about that. Men who have quarrelled do not kiss, and fall on each other's necks and make it up; they respect each other and they say nothing; they carry on.  But if you want unity I will tell you how you can get it, and you will get it on no other lines from this Government.  You will get it on the basis of obeying the laws made by the people.  You can have unity on no other basis.  No cajolery, no appeals, no trickery, no fine phrases will get over that fact.  As long as we have the authority of the people of this country, that is to say, as long as we remain a majority, you <Col N="1803" /> can have unity on no other basis than one, that the people's law is to be obeyed.</P>

The only people who are trying to give a right to the English are the Deputies sitting opposite because they deny the right of the people to rule in this country.  Release the prisoners!  There was an amnesty in 1923 and practically all the prisoners, except one or two, were released.  They were guilty of, will I call them, political crimes?  Deputies across the way are running away from that definition now. There were about £150,000 taken out of the banks.  They were guilty of all those crimes and were released in 1923. There was an act of grace.  The Minister responsible had a perfect right to use his discretion.  He used it in one case, that of McPeake.  McPeake was a gunner in the Army.  He was in the armoured car when Michael Collins was shot.  His gun went wrong a few times. He is a traitor.  He is lucky that he did not suffer the extreme penalty. The Minister is justified in refusing to exercise his discretion and let him out.</P>

First of all, you had that incident, the release of these prisoners who were guilty of offences committed after the Amnesty, which the Minister for Defence, Deputy Lemass, and the Commander-in-Chief, Deputy Field-Marshal Aiken are so proud of.

      <P>I want to suggest to Deputy Morrissey that that is what it comes down to.  It is in the interests of peace and order.  I want to put this to him.  Remember the attitude Deputy Lemass took up when asking this question. He was asked by Deputy Davin what was his policy.  Of course, he could not resist starting it by a great flourish of trumpets, telling us that he was a Republican first and last and a Constitutionalist afterwards.  That is the purest drivel, if you analyse it.  In any event, the Deputies for the present are going to adopt constitutional methods and afterwards, when the time is ripe, they are to go on to other methods.  I would ask Deputy Aiken and Deputy Lemass not to frighten us&mdash;people like myself, timid people, and, like Deputy Gorey, a married man with a family; they ought not to frighten us but to give us a chance. We cannot be all soldiers and patriots. Give up this nonsense, once and for all. Deputy Aiken is going to adopt other methods when the time is ripe.  What other methods?  The methods, I suppose, that would be employed by the prisoners.  Is murder to be one of them?  Is bank robbery to be one of them?  What are these methods, and against whom are they to be employed &mdash;the representatives of the people, the Government elected by the representatives of the people, the order established by the people?  It is in that atmosphere, it is in that state of affairs, we are to be asked to come along and to add to the moral confusion that is in the country, and that is mainly because of the sort of nonsense that is heard from the opposite benches, by letting out these men.  We would be unworthy of the trust reposed in us by the people if we did it.  These men have had lenient sentences, and these men will have to obey the law.  There is no man in this country so big but that we will see that he obeys the law, and we are not going to be deterred from doing that by any nonsense, any threat, or false pretences of any kind.</P>

It was entirely with that aim in view and not to reply to the little spiteful things the Minister for Agriculture has said that I started off by saying, or intended to start off by saying, that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture comes here and asks us to accept as a basis for unity in this country, a basis which he <Col N="1810" /> himself does not accept.  That is that the law made by the people in this country must be obeyed by the people of this country.  We want to find a basis.  We are perfectly willing to obey the law made by the people of this country.  If that law is challenged by any man in this country or outside it we are prepared to give our lives in defence of that law if we think that is the best way to defend it.  The civil war started, as I say, in spite of us.  I do not think there is a man on those Benches who would not give the last drop of his blood by any form of torture that could be devised to prevent that civil war.  We appealed, actually cried in appealing, to members of the opposite Benches to obey the law made by the people in this country and not by the law imposed by Churchill and the orders given us by Churchill.  The civil war did not start on the 28th June, 1922.  The civil war had actually commenced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a suggestion made that if we did want to go into the whole question we should do it in a particular way.  I do not think we should go now into the whole question.  It is because I know that the civil war did not start on the 28th June, 1922, that I did not want the Deputy to begin in May, 1922.  Any talk of what this Parliament is for is all very well, but the difficulty is we must proceed in some kind of way.  I can see no conclusion to this debate if &mdash;a remark has been made sotto voce that I was making a speech.  I would like to hear that remark repeated.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest intention of discussing the start of the civil war.  I simply intended to point out that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and his colleagues have appealed to the people publicly to support them for things and on principles which they are not prepared to carry and never have carried into practice. As a matter of fact when they ask us to obey the law made by the people they are simply trying to humbug the people, because they themselves are not and never have been willing to obey the law made by the people of this country.  Perhaps I overstated that. They were once willing to obey the law made by the people, a large number of them.  I give them that credit.  The thing I am sorry for is that unfortunately these men at one time slipped away from the position in which they were willing to obey the law made by the people of this country into the position that not only were they willing to obey the law made by the foreigner, <Col N="1812" /> but they were going to enforce it here at an economy of British lives.  They accuse us of not being willing to obey the law of the people of this country. Fortunately we have documentary evidence to support the fact, which I now state, that we have been at all times not only willing to obey the law made by the people of the country, but to defend that law against all enemies, foreign and domestic.</P>
      <P>There was a proclamation issued by Deputy de Valera stating upon what terms we were willing to compose the differences and to settle the civil war started in this country on the orders of Mr. Churchill.  In his proclamation Mr. de Valera said:</P>
      <P>The Government of the Republic anxious to contribute its share to the movement for peace, and to found it on principles that will give governmental stability and otherwise prove of value to the nation, hereby proclaims its readiness to negotiate an immediate cessation of hostilities on the basis of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That the sovereign rights of this nation are indefeasible and inalienable.</P>
      <P>(2)  That all legitimate governmental authority in Ireland, legislative, executive and judicial, is derived exclusively from the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>(3)  That the ultimate court of appeal for deciding disputed questions of national expediency and policy is the people of Ireland&mdash;the judgment being by majority vote of the adult citizenry, and the decision to be submitted to, and resistance by violence excluded, not because the decision is necessarily right and just or permanent, but because acceptance of this rule makes for peace, order and unity in national action, and is the democratic alternative to arbitrament by force.  Adequate opportunities and facilities must, of course, be afforded for a full and proper presentation to the court of all the facts and issues involved, and it must be understood that (1) and (2) are fundamental and non-judicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  That no individual, or class of individuals, who subscribe to these principles of national right, order and <Col N="1813" /> good citizenship can be justly excluded by any political oath, test, or other device, from their proper share and influence in determining national policy or from the councils and Parliament of the nation.</P>
    <P>(5)  That freedom to express political or economic opinions or to advocate political or economic programmes, freedom to assemble in public meeting, and freedom of the Press, are rights of citizenship and of the community which must not be abrogated.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the military forces of the nation are the servants of the nation, and, subject to the foregoing, amenable to the National Assembly when freely elected by the people.</P>
    <P>We are informed that many in the ranks of our opponents will accept these principles, as we accept them. If that be so, peace can be arranged forthwith.</P>
    <P>We hope that this advance will be met in the spirit in which we make it, and that it will be supported by all who love our country and who desire a speedy and just ending to the present national troubles.</P>
    <P>As evidence of our good-will, the Army Command is issuing herewith an order to all units to suspend aggressive action&mdash;the order to take effect as soon as may be, but not later than noon, Monday, April 30th.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Eamon de Valera, President,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Dublin, April 27th, 1923.</P>
    <P>We would like to know if the Government and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were willing to accept those principles as a basis for unity and for national action whereby the representatives of the people can come together and arrange an economic and national policy that would bring us out of the terrible economic distress we are in and cure the wounds that have been caused principally by the civil war started under the command&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those principles enunciated by Deputy de Valera as a basis for peace were approved of by Mr. Johnson on behalf of the Labour Party when he said at Kilkenny, on April 29th, 1923:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I consider that as a point in the programme of a political party they are all acceptable to me.  They stand in a certain degree for what we of the Labour Party have stood for inside and outside the Dáil....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Did somebody object to that?  Somebody objected to these principles being made the basis for unity amongst the people of Ireland.  The &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; for one gave voice to that objection on May 10, 1923, when it stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The only real obstacle which remains is Mr. de Valera's attitude to the Oath of Allegiance.  On this point the Government will not and cannot make any compromise.  The Oath is an inseparable part of the Treaty and Constitution.  Repudiation of it would be a repudiation of the Treaty and of the national verdict which ratified the Treaty.  In all the other matters of negotiation Mr. de Valera was knocking at an open door.  This door, however, has been locked by the people themselves and he must beat upon it in vain until they choose to turn the key.</P>
      <P>We want the people and their representatives to turn the key and open the door that is blocking the road of our nation to freedom and prosperity, that is blocking a peaceful settlement of the divisions created here by the foreigner. Ministers may sneer at us and say, &ldquo;You have taken the oath.&rdquo;  I say it is far from being a proud boast by Irishmen that they have insisted that the representatives of the Irish people should even pretend for an instant to have taken an oath of allegiance to a foreign king.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuing the appeal that I made here this morning.  I ask Deputies to bring all the pressure they can to bear upon the Government to do something to do away with the bitterness created by the civil war, and to bring all the <Col N="1815" /> representatives of the people together in a national assembly to consider the economic and national position of the nation in all its aspects, and arrive at a decision as to how best to cure the economic, political and social ills from which the country is suffering.  This assembly, as this debate on the prisoners brings very forcibly before us, is not a representative assembly even of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Men are debarred from it who will not even pretend for an instant, for any reason whatsoever, to bow the knee to a foreign king.  We here have done so. There are others who will not.  There are men such as Seán Russell, Mick Price, Mickie Carolan and others, for instance, in Mountjoy Jail at this moment and they are representatives of a class of men in this country for whom I had the highest admiration, and for whom I have the highest admiration, who will not, in any circumstances, admit the right of the British King, or the British King's representatives, to rule here.  We say these are representatives of the best class of the young men who are willing to give voluntarily whole-time service to this country whenever it requires it.  They will not ask any price or any pension, and I say it must be our duty, as representatives of the people, to consider how we can bring representatives of men of this type into the national assembly, and how we can direct all the energies of the nation on to the political and economic problems which we should be discussing. While these men are outside the national assembly the people's energies will be wasted, and we say that the way to do it is to examine the problem as it stands and to agree to those principles which were enunciated by Deputy de Valera, and which have been the fundamental principles upon which Irish Nationalists and Irish Republicans have always based their action.</P>
    <P>We ask the Ministers, if they want to do something useful for the nation, and useful to the Irish people, to release all political prisoners&mdash;Seán Russell, Mick Price, Mickie Carolan, and George Gilmore, and all the men arrested <Col N="1816" /> under treason charges.  Ministers can enforce the Treason Act.  They have enough military forces at their disposal, at the present time, to enforce it, but I say it is not wise, in the national interest, to enforce that Act. We say that in the national interest the thing to do is to release these men who have been imprisoned under the Treason Act; to do away with any impediment that will prevent all the representatives of the people in this country coming into this Assembly without, first of all, having to take an oath of allegiance or pretend to take it, to a foreign King.  That is the basis for unity, and that is the way to solve our problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if he had any proof against any Deputy upon these benches, such as he had against the men in jail, they would also be in jail. I know that the Department of the Minister for Justice has as much information about me&mdash;documents and other evidence that would convict me under the Treason Act&mdash;as they have against Carolan or any of the others who are now in jail under the Treason Act.</P>

      <P>What I want to say to Ministers is why on earth do they not try the same experiment on the men now in jail, under the Treason Act, as they tried on me?  Why do they not forget the past in regard to Mick Carolan, George Gilmore and others, now in jail, because they escaped from Mountjoy? Why not allow them to go free as they allowed me to go free, although they have as much evidence against me as they have against many of those men.  I hope to goodness that better counsels will prevail on the Government benches than was offered by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture. Small points can be made against releasing these men, but looking at the matter in a broad national way, the interests of the nation demand that these men be released, and that they be released immediately, and that, if possible, the Government be not forced to release them, but that they release them of their own free will, having seen the justice of the case.  I hope I may appeal to the Government, even now, in the interests of the nation, to make this gesture, to make this appeal for national unity.  Wipe the slate clean regarding these men.  I do not appeal in any way for mercy for them. I know that Seán Russell or George Gilmore will not retract one iota or go back one step.  They do not ask for mercy or look for mercy, from anybody they consider the enemy of their country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion.  In doing so, I want to say, <Col N="1818" /> at the outset, that I deprecate very much the provocative speeches which have emanated both from the Fianna Fáil Benches and from the Government Benches.  In that connection I regret very much the speech of the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think that he has approached the matter in the proper spirit.  I suggest that if Fianna Fáil are sincere in their protestations and if the Government spokesmen are sincere in their protestations of a desire for peace that they should refrain from making those provocative speeches. Some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies appear to forget, when harping back on some of the tragic events of the civil war period, that we have advanced a little since then; that history has been made very quickly in this country within the last dozen years, and, by their presence in the Dáil, the Fianna Fáil Deputies have acquiesced in that particular change.  I want to know, are we ever to get away from that tragic period of the civil war and from the Four Courts and all the rest of it? I was about seriously to suggest to this House, during the present week, that we should set apart one day, two days, or any number of days that the House would decide upon, for the discussion of this question of the civil war and the Four Courts, and let us be done with it and then let us forget and forgive and set our faces to the future.  The setting up of a Committee such as was suggested in the motion would allay suspicions in many minds in this country.  And let me say that those suspicions are largely shared by members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the country that there may be, and I have no doubt there are, people behind prison bars to-day in this country because of their affiliations at one period with the Republican Party. That appears to be a bold thing to say. I am a supporter of this Constitution and of the Treaty, and I believe in my heart and soul because of things that have occurred, because of the fact that there are many in the Government and in the Fianna Fáil Benches to-day who cannot detach themselves from those tragedies of the past, because of that and because as I know all history has taught us that vengeful things will be done and that people in the heat of <Col N="1819" /> conflict cannot forget the episodes and incidents in that conflict.  For that reason I would like to stress the passage in the speech of Deputy Gerald Boland whom I believe to be a very sincere and honourable man.</P>
      <P>The Deputy struck me from the moment of his entry in to the Dáil to be a very sincere and good Irishman.  He suggested in the course of his speech a day or two ago, an alternative to this motion.  He suggested that if the House could not see its way to set up this Select Committee, that the Government should initiate an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the cases of those men who are now in prison.  Deputy Aiken has mentioned a number of names of men who, I understand, are imprisoned for political offences.  I want to say here very definitely and specifically that I do not want to see a bank robber or a murderer or an assassin let out of prison, but I do want to see a fair trial in the calmer atmosphere that we have here at present.  We&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;&mdash;I mean the elected representatives of the people, and I couple myself and the members of the Labour Party with the upholders of the Constitution at the moment&mdash;at this stage have nothing to fear from a broad, generous and spacious gesture if you like, which would be indicated by the setting up of an inquiry. I urge that that inquiry should partake of the nature suggested in this motion, or that it should partake of the nature suggested by Deputy Gerald Boland.  I believe it would be one of the most magnificent gestures that this Government has ever made or ever contemplated, if they initiated an inquiry on their own which, I suggest, is the way of least resistance in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government are not prepared at the moment, because of the quarter from which the suggestion comes&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Benches&mdash;to entertain it&mdash; and I do not suggest they are so small-minded as that, but at the same time that feeling might be there and it might be well to do something which would remove that feeling&mdash;if they are not prepared to accept the motion they should be generous enough to move on their own.  They can afford to be generous <Col N="1820" /> enough, because, as I have already stated, the constitutional movement is too strong in this country, having behind it the best men in the country, and the Government are strong enough, and they can afford to make a generous gesture of this kind.  I would not be found here advocating an inquiry or anything of that kind if I had the least suspicion that it would let loose in this country once again the bank robber or the murderer or the assassin.  I am hopeful that the Government or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or rather all parties in the House, should combine in this movement towards an inquiry. Again, I ask both sides to let the dead past bury its dead.  I would appeal very strongly to Deputy Aiken and such others of the Fianna Fáil Party who have made rather bellicose speeches in the Dáil to remember that we have changed, and are changing. Whilst appealing that old sores should be allowed to heal up, let us not on the other hand be like Lazarus, constantly exposing our sores.  Deputy Morrissey has made an appeal to-day from the Labour benches.  I join with him in that appeal, and I sincerely ask the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance and others, who stand high in the Executive Council, to give an appreciative and attentive ear to the appeals made to them from these benches, and particularly from Deputy Gerald Boland.  As I have already said, this gesture would not indicate any semblance of a climb down, and it would not be a climb down, and it would not show any weakness or vacillation on the part of the Government to make this gesture.  I say, in the name of God, let us get done once and for all with the civil war and the tragedy of the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be easier to listen sympathetically to appeals such as those put forward by Deputy Anthony and Deputy Morrissey if we did not hear speeches, or some speeches, from the Fianna Fáil Benches on this particular motion.  It seems to me that there was a good deal of veiled threat behind some of those speeches.  We were told all the time, &ldquo;Do this or the alternative is a renewal of civil war.&rdquo; If that is the spirit that is behind the <Col N="1821" /> motion, of course there is certainly no alternative for any people who are charged with the responsibility for the maintenance of order and public peace but to refuse to agree to the motion. There is no suggestion of vindictiveness. I do not regard this thing as being anything in which one must hold strong views, or in which we must take any sort of personal stand.  When Deputy Anthony said we need not be afraid of loss of prestige or anything like that or of being accused of vacillation, I can only assure him that these remarks were unnecessary.  All that we are concerned with when considering matters such as this is to secure public peace and to take the line that we think will prevent any return to violence. As has been already stated by the Minister for Agriculture, there was an amnesty and a very generous and sweeping amnesty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. GERALD BOLAND Mr. GERALD BOLAND">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It really affected all sides, and it allowed great numbers of people who did commit crimes of violence to escape the results of these crimes.  But we cannot be having amnesty after amnesty.  That amnesty did not end crimes of violence, and what is more dangerous still to the people and to the public peace than individual crimes of violence, it did not end the maintenance and building up of an illegal military organisation.  I want to say this, without saying anything at all against the motives of people who are maintaining, trying to organise, trying to keep active, a military organisation in this country, that they and their work constitute the greatest possible menace to the public peace.  If such an organisation were to be allowed to go on, if it were allowed to collect its arms and continue drilling, then perhaps what seemed to me to be veiled threats would become open threats, and we would hear it said that if the Parliament did not do so-and-so then war was going to follow, and if the people did not do so-and-so, then war was going to follow.  We conceive our duty to be to let the people of the country decide what they want done through the ballot boxes, to return the <Col N="1822" /> representatives who will pursue the policy they want pursued, and let these representatives elect a Government. When the people want a particular thing done and they return a majority of representatives to do it, then they will have all the resources of the State with which to do it; they will have all the armed forces of the State with which to do that, and I say there can be no excuse or justification for the maintenance or building up of any illegal secret or semi-secret military organisation here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is only beside the question.  A Government is bound to take steps to prevent the existence and to stop the activities of any military organisation.  There is, as we know, an illegal military organisation in existence, and if we could be assured that by releasing prisoners who, most of them, had been concerned in carrying on that organisation, that it would stop, a very strong case would be made out for the generous gesture; but there has been nothing said to indicate that; in fact, I think the whole thing indicates the opposite, that if the men were released that organisation would flourish and be more active.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the cases of individual prisoners, but one of them mentioned was certainly extremely active in carrying on that organisation, and we have been given to understand by Deputy Aiken that if he were let abroad he would proceed to carry on the same activity.  I am referring to Mr. Carolan.  Mr. Carolan had been very active in carrying on the I.R.A shall we call it, and very large masses of documents and all that were found in his possession, which showed clearly that he had been active.  If we were to judge by what Deputy Aiken said, the thing Mr. Carolan would do if he were out is to continue his activity.  He would not change his course in the slightest.  That is clearly an argument against letting him out.  There is no sort of vindictiveness involved, but we feel that the law should be allowed to run its course.  Men were arrested in the ordinary way when there was a crime committed.  The acts for which they were convicted were crimes, crimes very dangerous to the public peace.  Those men were put on trial and sentences were given and they serve them in the ordinary way.  If we had reason to believe that some of those who are serving sentences would conduct themselves peaceably, we would take a very lenient view of the matter of reducing or remitting sentences. We do not want to keep them in unnecessarily, and where the offence was <Col N="1824" /> not done for any personal motive or personal gain, where it was purely for possessing arms or organising military organisations, if there was any indication that the person who had been convicted would change his ways, would really accept the democratic principle of majority rule, and would be content when he came out to persuade other people to his point of view by ordinary methods of persuasion and propaganda we would be very glad to review that case and let the individual out.</P>
    <P>With regard to the men who escaped from prison, undoubtedly those men have, perhaps, suffered more during the period they have been on the run than if they had served their term.  But that rescue from prison took place long after the cease fire order, long after the end of the civil war, and it seems to me it is not a thing that could be condoned or overlooked, and the people who were responsible for carrying out that rescue so long after the cessation of open hostilities and the amnesty should bear the punishment that comes to them unless there is some indication that they have altered their point of view and that they are no longer going to rely on violence against their fellow-countrymen here to promote their views.  They should bear that punishment. That applies, for instance, to Gilmore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the people who escaped, I think the Minister for Justice said that if these men returned and gave themselves up that, while no bargain is being made, a generous view would be taken of the whole situation.  I think that is what they ought to do, because, as the Minister for Justice said, the thing that is necessary here for the peace and advancement of the country&mdash;it does not matter from what political point of view one looks at it&mdash;in the future is, that we have the rule of law, an acceptance of the ordinary democratic principle of majority rule, and that we have an abandonment of attempts to bring about political changes by any resort to arms or violence. These men, because they escaped, cannot expect that the law will not take its course.  If they come back, then a <Col N="1825" /> generous view could be taken.  I think Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches should have discussed this whole thing in a spirit different to that in which they did, and I think if they had any desire to bring about peace and the release of the prisoners they would have done that.  If the question were put up in the right way, it would, as I have said before, be a different matter altogether. What we are concerned with is the maintenance of the law and the protection of the ordinary private citizen.  We do not take any more interest, as it were, in the cases of those prisoners who are to be arrested or who are before the courts than we do in cases of ordinary crime.  It is simply that the law takes its course and the person is arrested.</P>
      <P>I do not think that Deputies should ask for the setting aside of the law unless there are going to be some assurances of a change of heart and attitude, and a definite condemnation of the idea of violence.  It is all very well to talk about this Imperial British Government, about his Majesty's Ministers, and to resort to all the words and phrases that have been used so frequently by Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches.  This Parliament, representing the Free State, is freely elected on a democratic franchise.  A Government must, if it is to remain in office, have the confidence of the majority of the Dáil.  There is no use in talking as if the position of this Government was the same as that of the British Government in the old days.  As the Minister for Agriculture said, the British authorities had no right here because they had no authority from the people of the country, but this Government has been elected by the people on a democratic franchise.  Attacks on this Government are attacks on the ordinary people of the country.  Attacks on the laws passed by this Parliament, that is, violent attacks, are attacks on the ordinary people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to get ahead here there must be some definite recognition of the principle of majority rule.  If we can agree to accept that we can get somewhere, but if not we can get nowhere. If Deputies on the other side do accept that, then I do not know on what <Col N="1826" /> grounds they are pleading for the release of men who do not accept it, and who are engaged in the organisation of a machine which would apparently over-rule, by force, majority rule here. If any of the prisoners have actually changed their mind&mdash;we do not know that they have&mdash;we ought to hear of it. It is a simple matter, one that can be discussed quite calmly and usefully, but I think we must get down to fundamentals. As some Deputies have said, rather in criticism of the speeches from the Labour Benches, there is not much use in talking about forgive and forget, stop persecution, and so on.  What we want to know is what we are aiming at, what we hope to get, and how a particular proposal that is made or put forward is going to be received. To put the matter in a balder form, we would like to know how the release of the prisoners is going to add to peace. Is it put up to us that the release of the prisoners is going to cause them and others to abandon any preparations that they have been making for resorting to arms against the forces of the State as organised here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. BOLAND Mr. G. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing is not quite so simple as that.  A statement like that might have been very satisfactory at one time, if we had been discussing a similar matter immediately after the civil war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, we were not making a plea.  If anything were going to be done, to have the thing discussed on a different basis, there is no doubt whatever but that a committee such as that proposed would be perhaps the worst possible machinery that could be devised for a discussion of the matter The committee would be bound to <Col N="1827" /> wrangle over the matter, as we have been wrangling in the Dáil.  So far as individuals are concerned, I think there were quite a number of people mentioned whose cases could not be considered.  There may be other cases that could be considered.  If the thing were put up to the Government in the spirit and from the point of view that I have indicated, there would be a great deal to be said for the Government looking again into the whole matter, just as it looked into matters some time after the ending of the civil war.  The tendency of the speeches and of the arguments to which we have listened to-day would rather be to harden us and to indicate to us that the intention was simply to get men out.  I think Deputy Lemass perhaps made the worst speech to-day.  His speech could really have had no effect on us, having regard to what we feel to be our duty, but to harden us, to make us feel that he was a man who might even encourage these men not to abandon their methods.</P>
      <P>If we heard some definite discouragement of these methods from the Fianna Fáil Benches and a statement as to their position for the future, with a full acceptance from them of the principle that there is no need and no excuse to resort to arms against this State; that they would discourage the continuance of a military organisation of any sort and accept the legal Army set up under the laws of this State as controlled by this Dáil, we would have a different atmosphere here.  I think that we ought hear these things from them before they plead for the release of the prisoners.  If there is going to be any release or review of the cases of these prisoners, it ought to come because there is a definite change in attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>I do not think so. <Col N="1828" /> What I am talking of at the present moment are the views that have been expressed here and elsewhere on this point by Fianna Fáil Deputies.

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly a great deal of activity was stopped, but the military machine was kept going. <Col N="1829" /> There was no abandonment of the idea of fighting.  I think Deputy Boland will agree with me that keeping the military machine going involves the gravest dangers.  Men connected with it, and who had to be kept to the point of maintaining that military machine in existence, could not be kept from indulging in activities especially in view of the history&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if it is admitted that the military machine was kept going, what kept it going?  Was it not the pressure, the hunting after these people, and the refusal to allow them home and let the fighting stop?  If that had been done at any time, even at present, the thing would have dropped long ago.  I am convinced that it is the continual hunting of these men that has kept the organisation going, and is still giving reason for carrying on.  There was never at any period, although it is alleged there was, at which there was a ceasing of the hunt after these men. If that had been ever stopped there would have been peace long ago, and, mind, the hunt is still on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think perhaps we are getting somewhat nearer.  There is no hunt on against anybody except people who are maintaining the military organisation.  Apparently what Deputy Boland is saying is that if we say &ldquo;You may continue your military organisation; we won't bother,&rdquo; then they would not bother continuing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it amounts to that.  If we could bring about a cessation of the military organisation, if a dispersal of that organisation could be brought about, none of these things would arise at all.  There would be no prosecutions of people for being in possession of arms, and no prosecution of people for the incidental things connected with the maintenance of that organisation.  I do not want to doubt the good faith of Deputy Boland, or of any Deputy, on that matter, but there are various points of view.  There are people with the point of view that they would not come into this House, people with the point of view that they <Col N="1830" /> would, and there are people like Deputy Boland who, I assume, is willing to accept the principle of majority rule.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there are other people who do not.  Documents and things have been found which show that there are people of an irreconcilable type.  There are undoubtedly people outside who have more than once made attempts to keep an active campaign of some sort going.  Again, there are the people who assassinated the late Minister for Justice.  There are the people who did the shooting that has been referred to just recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister accepts it or not, but I distinctly read a communication in the press from those in authority, from the heads of the Republican Army, disclaiming any responsibility for the shooting of the late Minister for Justice, and being honourable men, as I know them, and you ought to know them, to be, they should be taken at their word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On information the Government has been able to get we do not, could not, take their word for it.  It may be they were not directly responsible or did not directly order it. It may be that some of them knew about it and some did not, but on such information as we have been able to get we could not accept that denial as closing the matter, or leaving us in any doubt that it was the people of the organisation of which they were head were responsible for that.  I am only indicating that there are people in the country who are prepared to resort to violence against the State.  The existence of these people, of this organisation, does mean that we have to go very carefully in these matters.  There are people who, perhaps, would be inclined because Fianna Fáil has come into the Dáil to abandon their policy of arms.  There are perhaps people who, if they saw the coming in of Fianna Fáil followed by a relaxation would think now their time was come and that there would be no obstacles in their way in the future.  There are <Col N="1831" /> all sorts of people to be dealt with, and we have to proceed very carefully.</P>
      <P>If any sort of appeal is made for an individual case that appeal will be most carefully considered.  If any facts can be brought before us in regard to individual cases, these facts will be investigated, and everything that can be done will be done to see that no man who has changed his attitude of mind, or whose release would be any help to public order, will be kept in prison, but my fear, having regard to the future, is that the passage of this motion or anything of that sort would have quite another effect.  I do not want simply just to slam the door.  Deputies have talked about men who escaped from Mountjoy.  They are available and can be consulted.  If they are willing to come back and surrender themselves, we then have a very clear indication that a change has taken place, and that we would not be simply releasing men to continue a type of activity that was most highly dangerous to the State. These men could be consulted.  A plea has been made on their behalf.  Let these men, instead of evading arrest, submit to arrest.</P>

      <P>Perhaps there may have been a misunderstanding in the matter, but if there was and it could be made clear, that could be rectified. But I certainly think I can claim we are pursuing a policy of fair readiness to release people whom we feel could be safely released.  I believe that at any rate there should be some gesture showing that there is a change and that we would not have the old position of letting out a prisoner to be more active than he was before he went in.  It really is time to have an end to the sort of activity that is going on.  There may be excuses for individuals, but here we have, I suppose five years after the end of the civil war, men collecting and buying guns, drilling and carrying on with all the paraphernalia of a military organisation which is a threat to the ordinary people of the country.  We want to get an end to that, and while we will not refuse to take any risks to bring that about, still the lapse of such a long time is a very grave factor in the situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice can report the cases brought before him to the other members of the Cabinet, and as far as I can understand &mdash;I have not dealt much with the cases of individual prisoners&mdash;we have had these facts before us.  But what we really have not had, except in so far as it has been very slightly indicated in the Dáil, and indicated, I think, almost solely by Deputy Boland, is the very definite change in outlook and the very definite suggestion of the entire abandonment of the whole policy of building up a military force other than the military force legally authorised by the Dáil.  That is a suggestion that, as far as I know, has not been made up to this. If we could hear anything more in that respect, as I have said, there would be a case for looking into the whole matter. I really would like to make progress in this matter, and I would suggest that Deputies should consider and consult with those escaped prisoners, and if those escaped prisoners will submit to arrest we will then have a real earnest of a change of policy for the future.  We have not got it, and I would venture to say that scarcely anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party, and scarcely the <Col N="1834" /> whole Party together, could speak for an organisation that has been carried on.  But if some overt thing is done that would give us grounds for looking into it, it might be different.  Of course there were escaped prisoners who, I believe, were convicted of absolutely ordinary crimes.  Their crimes had no connection with any political matter.</P>

      <P>Then, of course, it would be a question as to whether they were small offences or untried individuals. But is it not really a question of pleading?  The Government has a responsibility for public order, and it is no concern of ours, and it is for no satisfaction of our own that we are keeping the prisoners.  On the other hand&mdash;whether the Fianna Fáil Deputies will accept my word for it or not&mdash; we are really concerned only with the public interest.  There is no question of punishment or feeling of any kind. Of course there were murders.  But where the thing was in the nature of connection with an organisation there is no question of punishment.  It is really a question of safety and security.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister define the term &ldquo;submit to arrest&rdquo;?  In a couple of cases men submitted to arrest in so far as they went openly to their homes, and they were promptly arrested.

      <P>I think this Committee would be the worst possible way.  As I said, I do not want to humiliate men.  For instance, if it could be made known that the men would be openly at their homes henceforth, instead of simply staying out and trying it on, it might lead to some understanding.  I do not want men necessarily to go and knock at the door of the local police barracks, but if it was known that from Monday next, <Col N="1835" /> from a particular date, the men would be openly about their homes so that they would be available it would be different.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the occupiers of the lands flooded by the River Robe, South Mayo, lodged the necessary maps and petitions for the drainage of that river with the Mayo County Council over two years ago; that the County Surveyor reported the urgent necessity of having the drainage carried out and that the County Council passed the necessary statutory resolutions requesting the Commissioners for Public Works to prepare a drainage scheme; and if he will state what steps have been taken by the Commissioners to prepare such drainage scheme and make the necessary preliminary arrangements to proceed with the drainage of that river.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works received from the Mayo County Council petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, with maps and the statutory resolutions in respect of tributaries to and the upper reaches of the Robe River, and decided to investigate the possibility of devising a comprehensive scheme to include all of these with the large existing Lough Mask and River Robe Drainage District. With this object in view they have had preliminary inspections carried out by an engineer and a valuer, and have their reports under consideration at present.  The matter is a large and complicated one and its consideration has necessarily taken a long time. The Commissioners hope, however, to <Col N="1764" /> be in a position to lay the financial aspect of the proposals before the county council at an early date.</P>
