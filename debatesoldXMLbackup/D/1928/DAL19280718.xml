      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY (for Pádraig O hOgáin) (An Clár)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether his attention has been drawn to a Bill now before the British Parliament for the purpose of extending the powers of the Parliament of Northern Ireland by the removal of restrictions and reservations contained in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920; whether there was any consultation and agreement between the British Government and the Executive Council before the introduction of this Bill; and, if not, whether it is intended to enter a protest against the enlargement of the powers of the Government of Northern Ireland, without consulting, and without the consent of, the Government of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>I have seen the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which, I presume, is the Bill referred to.  In as far as its provisions relate to reservations contained in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, they are of an explanatory nature and deal with matters which are of no concern to the Irish Free State. No consultation or agreement has taken place on the subject, nor does any action appear to be called for.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is proposed to take any steps to empower the Agricultural Credit Corporation to grant loans to farmers who owe not more than two years' arrears of annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>At an extraordinary general meeting of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, held on the 4th instant, a special resolution to amend Section 90 of the Articles of Association was approved.  The object of the amendment is to give the Board of the Corporation power to make a loan, if it should so think fit, to any person who is in arrears to the extent of not more than four half-yearly instalments with payments due to the Irish Land Commission and the Commissioners of Public Works.  The resolution must be submitted for confirmation to a second extraordinary meeting of the Corporation which is to be held on the 20th instant.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance have informed the Corporation that we will be prepared to assent to the alteration in the articles if the resolution is confirmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, as no steps have been taken towards the repayment to persons in South Kerry who subscribed to the Dáil Loan and who have no receipts, he will set up a Court of Inquiry to consider the claims of such persons, with powers to compel witnesses to attend and give evidence where required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation for the implication contained in the first part of the Deputy's question. Repayment has been authorised to more than 200 subscribers in the South Kerry area, and of these it is estimated that at least 90 per cent. were not in a position <Col N="739" /> to produce receipts for their subscriptions.</P>
      <P>In respect of the subscriptions transmitted to the Dáil Department of Finance by certain authorised collectors in this area, the names and addresses of the subscribers were not furnished, and efforts which have been made by my Department to obtain such particulars have hitherto been unsuccessful. The lists which it has been possible to obtain are being examined in conjunction with all other available evidence, and where the evidence is satisfactory the subscribers will be repaid in due course.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my statement on this subject on the 22nd ultimo, I do not consider that it is at present necessary to establish a tribunal to deal with the claims in any particular category. The existing machinery appears to be sufficient, but if it should ultimately be found necessary to take any special steps I shall not hesitate to make such arrangements as the circumstances seem to require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. P.J. GORRY Mr. P.J. GORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. GORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that in the areas affected by the flooding of the River Barrow&mdash;Monasterevan, Portarlington, Garryhinch, Mountmellick and Rosenallis&mdash;grave dissatisfaction is prevalent amongst the people regarding the progress of the drainage work being carried out, and that they are seriously concerned as to whether sufficient work will be carried out this summer and autumn to reduce flooding to a minimum in the coming winter; whether the Minister will state how much money is available for expenditure on this river in the present year; and whether he will urge on the Commissioners of Public Works the necessity <Col N="740" /> of employing larger gangs on the river between Portarlington and Mountmellick and other places where large obstructions exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. P.J. GORRY Mr. P.J. GORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. GORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state (a) the amount of money expended on the Barrow drainage work in the half-year ended March 31st, 1928; (b) the quarter ended 30th June, 1928; (c) the number of men employed and the number of gangs at work during that period; (d) the approximate period which it will take to complete the work at the present rate of progress; and (e) whether he is aware that several farmers, whose lands are flooded for more than half the year, are unable to continue paying annuities and taxes on land which is rendered useless to them by flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Bourke) Seamus Aloysius Bourke">
      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer these two questions together.</P>
      <P>The expenditure for the half-year ended 31st March, 1928, was £37,061, and for the quarter ended 30th June, 1928, £9,580.</P>
      <P>About 250 men were at work during this latter period.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to indicate how long it will take to complete the scheme, as apart from anything else the successful carrying out of drainage works depends to so great an extent on the weather; but probably at least three years after 1928 will be required.</P>
      <P>£75,000 was estimated for the year 1928-29 to cover anticipated expenditure.</P>
      <P>As I have already pointed out in reply to previous questions it is an engineering necessity, in order to prevent loss and damage, that the work should proceed from the lower to the upper reaches of the river.  As has already been pointed out, the Barrow drainage is not a relief work, but an engineering scheme, the estimated cost of which is based upon the use of the most economic methods of execution, apart from any other consideration, in the interests of those occupiers of the flooded and injured lands who will ultimately be called upon to pay their proportion of the whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the reply to the question.  I live within a very short distance of an area that suffers great loss from the flooding of this river.  As it is a vexed national question, it should be considered by the House, and I propose, with your permission, to raise the matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <P>The frequency of delivery on the Derry and Benduff route was reduced from six to three days a week in 1923 owing to the loss at which the service was being carried on.  Even with the restricted delivery, the post is still unremunerative, and I regret, therefore, that an increase in the frequency of delivery cannot be granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the usual form.  This Estimate is presented about this time of the year, and I would have thought that no great explanation would be necessary to justify it.  The only explanation now is that the amount required this year has been reduced to £5,000, which is £1,000 more than the amount which the officials of the Department who investigated the working of the line in 1927 estimated as the amount that would be required.  To call this a subsidy is, I think, as I made clear before. wrongly to apply that term to the Vote.  It is to be noted that the moneys are granted for the working of three Government lines in Donegal, and when that fact is appreciated and the basis upon which it rests, I believe that the application of the word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; to this Vote will be realised to be a wrong application.  There was an old working agreement entered into with the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company pre-war. Under that agreement, a weekly rate was fixed at which the line was to be worked.  It is, of course, clear to anybody that a rate fixed pre-war, which was then a proper rate for the working of the railway, must be completely out of accord with the present working of any railway.  This so-called subsidy is brought forward year by year really to re-adjust the old working agreement to the changed conditions since 1914. As the Estimate states, this Vote is a maximum amount.  If the loss in the whole working of the system amounted to less than £5,000 in the year 1928, the difference would be credited in equal shares to the company and to the Government.  In other words, it is to meet what is regarded as a probable loss that the figure is set down as a maximum.  If the loss in the working of the line is more, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company have to find the remainder.  If the loss is less, then the difference between that and the amount voted is to be credited half to the Government and half to the <Col N="754" /> Railway Company.  This particular Vote has been made for some years past, and the amount has been reduced year by year.  In 1924, the Vote was £7,240; in 1925-6 it was £7,000; with a like amount contributed by the Northern Government.  In 1927 it was £6,000, with a similar amount contributed by the Northern Government. This year the amount is reduced to £5,000.  That reduction follows upon the result of an investigation made year by year and an estimate of the probable loss.  The sums voted have about met the loss that accrued from the working of these lines.  On the investigation of the accounts last year, a report was presented to me, and that report put up recommendations that the amount of the subsidy this year should be reduced from £6,000 to £4,000.  But after taking a variety of circumstances into consideration the conclusion was reached that it would be unfair to reduce it to £4,000, that it would be putting too much of a strain upon the Company to ask them to come down from £6,000 to £4,000.  But the Company has been given to understand that this sum will be decreased.  I do not think it will disappear, but some other arrangement will have to be come to.  Even if this arrangement were to be continued for a number of years, the amount of the figure would come down from the £5,000 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working of the Government lines is under supervision during the whole time; the accounts are open for inspection to officials of my Department and reports are presented from year to year, and it is upon the reports so presented that decisions are come to as to what is to be the amount of the subsidy. It is open to the Dáil to ask to have the old agreement changed.  The circumstances in the area served by these lines simply mean that the three Government-owned lines cannot be economically worked&mdash;that is, that the expenditure cannot be met at the moment out of the traffic receipts.  If the lines are to be kept alive at all the subsidy is necessary.  The amount of the present subsidy of £5,000 is all that is in question.  This year I am going beyond the report of the Committee that investigated in putting the figure at £5,000.  I am not this year cutting <Col N="755" /> down the subsidy, as recommended, from £6,000 to £4,000.  The conditions there are well known and, at any rate, the mere statement that this is in lieu of the old working agreement of pre-war days makes it unnecessary to go into the matter in any great detail on this particular Vote.  I move the Vote.</P>

      <P>This Vote, in my opinion, should be opposed by Deputies from all parts of this House until such time as the Minister for Industry and Commerce gives the House a guarantee that he will institute a proper and full inquiry into the management, control and policy of the Company, and until such time also as he gives a guarantee that he will issue instructions to the particular Company to retain in their service the nine stationmasters and clerks who are now under notice of dismissal by the Company and due to leave the Company's service to-morrow. I hope to show the House, by the instances I will give and the examples I will place before it, that it is not in the interests of the State, nor in the interests of the shareholders, nor in the interests of the workers, that this particular line should be subsidised or, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce likes to term it, that this Vote should be passed, except the Minister gives a guarantee that he will set up an inquiry into the finances of this Company and shows how the money that this House is called upon to vote is to be spent.  In former years, when this Vote was under consideration, it was not opposed by the Labour Party owing to the fact that they realised that poverty and suffering existed in Donegal.  Certain things have happened in the meantime, and Deputies on these Benches have learned about certain things in regard to the mismanagement of the Company which I hope to put before the House to-day.  When I have done so, I believe that Deputies will look at this Vote from an impartial standpoint and will agree that the time has arrivel when we should not vote any further subsidy to this Company until a full inquiry has been made in regard to its working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial position, as far as this <Col N="756" /> year is concerned, is as follows:&mdash;The passenger receipts from 1st January to a few days ago are down by £1,500; the receipts in respect of goods, minerals and live stock are up by £1,600.  That means that the net income is increased this year by £100 in comparison with last year.  At the same time, I would like to point out that if this Company were properly managed and run on the same principle as the Great Northern or Great Southern, we believe the receipts could be increased to a much greater extent, the passenger receipts principally.  I believe the Company, by the manner in which they are treating the public, are not attempting to compete properly with the bus traffic or to cope with the passenger traffic when there is a rush on.  I would like to quote a letter which appeared in the &ldquo;Derry Standard&rdquo; on the 6th June last in regard to the management of this railway.  The writer of the letter states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>I gather from your columns that the dismissal of many employees of the Lough Swilly Railway is due to a necessary and enforced &ldquo;economy&rdquo; campaign.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that much of the trouble is due to the thorough lack of organisation that characterises the company's methods?</P>
    <P>On Sunday last there was an advertised excursion service for 3 p.m. to Fahan, Buncrana, Ballyliffin, etc. At 2.45 p.m. the entrance to the station was congested with would-be trippers, and to approach either one of the two booking office windows involved almost a free fight.</P>
    <P>Two trains left the station about 3 p.m., and crowds who hadn't booked tickets by that time turned away, with expressions of disgust (some rather strong, I thought).</P>
    <P>About 400 to 500 people who had booked tickets, but who couldn't get on the trains, remained on the platform for varying lengths of time, many going to demand the return of their money.  The writer and family remained 1 hour and 12 minutes (4.12 p.m.) after advertised time of departure, <Col N="757" /> and still there was no trace of any likely conveyance.</P>
    <P>How much money, sir, did the L. and L.S. Railway Company throw away on Sunday?</P>
    <P>How much will they lose throughout the summer season by virtue of the bad impression so many people have gained?</P>
    <P>How long is this mismanagement to continue?  and, lastly,</P>
    <P>Are employees to suffer for this bungling?</P>
    <P>Another letter I would like to quote is one which appeared in the &ldquo;Derry Journal.&rdquo;  When I refer to &ldquo;Onlooker,&rdquo; I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce will probably smile.  The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sir,&mdash;&ldquo;Onlooker's&rdquo; comments on the Swilly Railway in Monday's issue of the &ldquo;Journal&rdquo; make amusing reading to those who, like myself, spent two sweltering hours in that company's palatial premises at Pennyburn last Sunday afternoon.</P>
    <P>A train was advertised to leave Derry on that day at 3 o'clock p.m., and the scenes around the ticket office immediately before that time baffle description.  This train was packed long before the time, and steamed out at 2.50, leaving at least two hundred people still fighting for tickets.</P>
    <P>Naturally thinking that another train would be backed in, I succeeded in getting a ticket after a rough-and-tumble struggle, and in due course we were all admitted to the &ldquo;platform.&rdquo; Half-past three came, and four o'clock, and it was just then we learned that the first and only train had to go to Buncrana, discharge its freight, and return to Derry for the people who expected to get away at three o'clock.  There were many family parties there, several women carrying children in their arms, and they had to wait over two hours.  I won't attempt to describe the scenes on the return journey.  Anyone who has travelled on the line on Sundays is familiar with them, but how any company could expect to survive bus competition and treat its patrons in such a fashion passes my comprehension. The sooner the Free State <Col N="758" /> and Northern Governments cease subsidising this company and thereby compel them to treat passengers as Christians, the better it will be for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Just at the time the Company were refusing to accept traffic in the shape of passengers, hundreds of them, Sunday after Sunday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>To Buncrana, Fahan and other stations.  I would like to quote another example which occurred on the occasion of the Letterkenny Feis on the 28th and 29th of June.  The Company was not able to provide enough rolling stock at Burtonport railway station for the large numbers of people who were anxious to travel. In the railway carriages, which were capable of accommodating 700 people, there were 1,300 people.  That was notwithstanding the fact that there were spare engines and rolling stock lying idle on other parts of the railway.  At the time all that was going on, when the management were refusing to accept passenger traffic, they were complaining about their financial resources and stating that they had not enough money to carry on.  I put it to any man here with any business ability: could any railway company expect to survive if they treated the travelling public in this particular manner?  This is the company we are asked to vote £5,000 to in order to subsidise them and bolster up the inefficiency of the management and the directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In or about the time when the Company were refusing to receive passenger traffic, largely because of incompetent management, they tell nine of their employees: &ldquo;We have no further need for your services owing to the financial conditions of the Company.&rdquo; Surely it is heartbreaking to find nine employees turned adrift on the roadside without any unemployment insurance and without any hope of getting work.  As the Minister is aware, this Company, a number of years ago, applied to his Department for exemption under the Unemployment Insurance Act, on the grounds that the employees were in what was permanent employment, <Col N="759" /> and, therefore, there was no necessity to pay unemployment insurance.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the financial follies, if I might describe them, of the directors of this Company.  The Company allege that they are not able to carry on with the present staff.  We in this House are asked to vote £5,000 of a subsidy to the Company.  The management of the Company a few years ago purchased land near their head offices in Pennyburn, Londonderry.  The price was £11,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. CASSIDY Mr. CASSIDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>They actually paid in or about £11,000, and, in addition to that, they had to pay upwards of £1,000 in order to complete the sales.  Those lands were bought with the idea, I suppose, of building new offices or stores or accommodation for engines, but the arrangements were never proceeded with, and if the Company attempted to sell the land now they would not get £200.  That is the way the finances are squandered, and why should we be called upon to vote £5,000?  That is one of the reasons why the Donegal employees are cast on to the roadside. That is not the only item of financial bungling that the directors have indulged in.  Not so very long ago the directors paid approximately £9,000 to one of their own railway directors for a couple of secondhand boats which were publicly declared to be half rotten.  When the people in Donegal and Derry saw that the Company were going to pay £9,000 for these boats, it was the laughing-stock of the whole area.  I believe the people were justified in laughing at this example of mismanagement, because only a short time has elapsed since they paid the £9,000 for the boats to ply on Lough Swilly, and we now find that they are both out of commission and they are not being used for coastal service owing to the fact that it would not be safe to travel in them.  I believe public funds should not be voted in order to bolster up incompetency on the part of either the management or the directors of that particular railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The length of railway altogether is <Col N="760" /> 99 miles, and in order to maintain that length of railway we find that there are a general manager, a locomotive superintendent, an assistant locomotive superintendent, an accountant, and a permanent way engineer.  Railway companies, like the Great Northern or the Southern Company, can find competent railway managers in Ireland, and they can find competent engineers who are Irishmen, but we find, so far as this particular Company is concerned, that two of the chief officials are Englishmen and one is a Scotchman. When, however, it comes to effecting economies on this line, we find that these gentlemen from England and Scotland must not be inconvenienced, but the mere Irish from County Donegal must be thrown on the roadside. I want to know from Donegal Deputies of all Parties whether they are going to stand for that, for the policy of the directors of the Company throwing Donegal men on the roadside while the Company is top-heavy, so far as managerial expenses are concerned?</P>
    <P>It has been alleged by the Company that some of these men with whose services they are dispensing are redundant, that there is no necessity for them as there is no work.  If there is no work, as the Company alleges, who is responsible for it?  The management, or rather the mismanagement, of the Company is responsible.  Last May dismissal notices were issued to nine employees, but as a result of negotiations between one of the railway trade unions and the management it was decided to suspend the notices for two months, and a promise was given that a cancellation would be favourably considered. Before any of the men were dismissed two men resigned and, consequently, one would have thought that if the Company were going to pursue their policy they would only dispense with the services of seven.  Instead of that we find that they are going ahead with these dismissals, and these nine men are going to be thrown on the roadside to-morrow.  Some of them have comparatively long service.  Some have families.  They will have to vacate the Company's houses, leave the railway, and look for employment elsewhere owing to the blundering tactics of a Company to whom we are asked to <Col N="761" /> vote £5,000 to bolster up incompetency on their part.  There is no getting away from the fact that there is wild extravagance on the part of the Company, and I have already quoted a few cases to prove their incompetency and unbusinesslike methods, which one would not expect from a board of directors.</P>
    <P>I would point out that we are asked to subsidise a Company controlled by five directors, the majority of whom reside outside the Free State.  The majority were no friends of the people who were looking for Irish freedom during the trouble.  Apart from that, we are asked to bolster up their inefficiency. What experience have they to control the policy of the Company? They have no particular railway knowledge. Their only knowledge in that respect is that they have a few hundred pounds invested in the Company. I put it to Deputies, if they take the case of a wholesale drapery firm in Dublin, into which four or five directors who know nothing about drapery work are put, it will only be a matter of time before that firm becomes bankrupt. It is the same with the Company. I have quoted cases, and other cases will be quoted by other Deputies, to show that those connected with the management are inefficient.  The Minister may say, when replying, that the services of some of these men can be dispensed with, as they are redundant, but has the Minister nothing to say to the extravagant salaries paid to men at the head of affairs, cross-Channel men? It is true that the Minister sent an inspector to the railway some time ago, but he did not report in regard to the expenditure of £11,000 or £12,000 in regard to waste ground, nor in regard to the loss incurred in the purchase of those two boats.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the House to insist on the Minister, before giving this subsidy, setting up a committee of inquiry to investigate the whole working of the line, and, in the meantime, those employees who are to be turned out on the road to-morrow should be retained in the company's service until the committee has reported.  The Minister may say that these men's services could be dispensed with.  I would point out to him that in 1920 there were employed <Col N="762" /> by this company 89 stationmasters and clerks, and that that figure will now be reduced to 49.  Although it has been pointed out to the Minister by certain directors and by the management that everything is right, so far as the Company is concerned, I know from inner knowledge of the Company that things are not right, and that this House would be ill-advised to vote money until a proper inquiry is made into the whole situation.  A few days ago there was a meeting held of employees from all parts of the line, and the following resolution was passed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This meeting deplores and condemns the brutal and unreasonable action of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company in its refusal to consider any proposals involving a mitigation of the terrible hardship being inflicted upon the stationmasters and clerks who are being dismissed, and on their families and dependents, because of follies and bungling for which they are not responsible.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The meeting realises that the only argument which the people responsible for these unnecessary dismissals recognise is the strike, but, being painfully cognisant of the fact that a strike at this stage may mean ruin to the line, and having a deeper interest in its welfare than its directors and management, feels reluctantly compelled to withhold action for the moment, but calls upon the Free State and Northern Governments to institute an immediate inquiry into the working of this company in the interests of equity and efficiency, and to give early and favourable consideration to the claims of our disemployed colleagues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Company are allowed to proceed along the line upon which they have been proceeding for some time past there is no getting away from the fact that a crisis will be reached and that a strike will occur.  There would be a strike to-morrow were it not for the fact that a strike at this particular juncture would probably mean the closing down of the line and it would probably not be reopened.  While the employees <Col N="763" /> are more concerned about the running of the line than the manager and directors, this House, with its eyes closed and blindfolded in regard to what is going on there, is asked to vote £5,000.  The employees are not afraid to strike, but if the Minister is adamant in his refusal to set up a committee of inquiry you will possibly see a strike, the line closed down, and neither this House nor the newspapers can blame the employees, but they can blame the Minister and Deputies here for not insisting on a committee being set up to inquire into the working of the whole concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. LAW Mr. LAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cassidy bases his opposition to this Vote on two grounds. He says that the money should not be voted by this House unless and until full inquiry is made into the working of the Company, and also until a dispute, which unfortunately obtains at present between the Company and some of its employees, has been satisfactorily settled.  So far as the first point is concerned, if the Minister does not find that he has sufficient information without an inquiry I, for my part, shall vote for such inquiry, but, offhand, it appears to me incredible that the Minister should have been asking the House for a number of years to allow a subsidy to be made to this Company without having all the facts and figures before him.  I feel perfectly certain that the Minister has before him all the facts which any inquiry could elicit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the second point which Deputy Cassidy made, I am aware of at least some of the facts.  I do think that while there are probably redundancies in the staffing of the line, the dismissal of these men will result in very great hardship.  I know personally that in one or two cases, at least, that hardship will be very grievous indeed.  I have in mind one admittedly very efficient man whose wife has been very ill for a considerable time.  He has certainly worked the station, about which I know a good deal, better than ever I have known it to be worked before, and yet he is one of the persons who, if this arrangement stands, will have to go.  I know that hard cases make bad law.  I know perfectly well that you <Col N="764" /> cannot run a railway company or any other business merely by having regard to a man with a long, weak family.  I am aware of that, but at the same time, when a company is in receipt of assistance from the State, it is not unreasonable to ask that the Department should bring sufficient pressure to bear on the company concerned, to see that it does, at any rate, exhaust all possibilities of amicable agreement in order to avoid discharging any of its employees.  The only other observation I want to make is that Deputy Cassidy seems to treat this whole matter as if it were a question between certain directors of the Lough Swilly Railway Company on the one hand and the Government or the Dáil on the other.  Really that is not the way to look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. CASSIDY Mr. CASSIDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. LAW Mr. LAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean to say that the Deputy alleged any criminal offence against them, but I will say that he spoke at considerable length, and more than once he referred to the origin, domicile, and so on, of these particular people, and he rather suggested that we were giving them presents of money.  As far as I am concerned, if it were a present, I owe them nothing, unless they could regard as a debt some very uncomfortable hours spent in the railway carriages. I have no sense of gratitude towards them at all, and if it were a question of doing a favour to the Board of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, I should not be at all inclined to support the Vote, but that is not really the issue at stake.  The issue at stake on the broad question is that the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company is a small line, which owns about twelve miles and operates nearly a hundred.  The greater part of the line runs through an exceedingly poor district.  The greater part of the line which it operates was built out of State money for the purpose of opening up certain portions of the congested districts.  I do not believe that it was ever successful, but I do not suppose that it was <Col N="765" /> ever expected that that line would really pay.  I mean to say that the portion of the line which was leased by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company was comparatively successful for a number of years as long as our fishing industry was more flourishing than it is now, but at best I do not suppose it could ever be a commercial proposition.  The real question is whether it is not a reasonable object of public policy to keep lines of communication open in a district which is sorely in need of them.  I do not think there will be any dispute that it is, and I submit to the House that that is the real question in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Law has put his fingers on the real point in this matter when he says that the question for the consideration of the Minister and the House is whether this Dáil is prepared to assist in maintaining the existing lines of communication so far as they affect Tirconaill.  The whole question, I admit, concerns our lines of communication as between the Free State portion, that is Tirconaill, and the Six-County area, which this railway partly serves, and the extent we are prepared to close down these lines of communication. I am personally quite satisfied that the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, under the existing management, cannot continue to carry on under the present state of affairs. Therefore, this House, some time in the immediate future, will be called upon to set up some inquiry which will determine the future working of the railway and the working conditions of the people who work on the railway. The question whether we vote £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 is not going to decide the matter.  I have a suspicion at the back of my mind that this undue haste in wiping out one-sixth of the clerical staff of the Company is in anticipation that we are drifting towards the absorption or the amalgamation of the line.  If we are going to allow this policy of the hidden hand which is going on between the directors and the management of the Company, behind the backs of the Dáil, this House will, in the future, be presented with amalgamation proposals which will seriously prejudice our lines of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I say the whole subject is very important from the national point of view, and unless this House and members of all Parties&mdash;and I do not think it is a Party matter&mdash;face the problem as we find it, it will be worse in twelve months' time when we come to discuss another subsidy than it is to-day.  I do not want, at this stage, to say anything which would prejudice the future working of the concern.  We are all anxious, even if an inquiry is going to be held, to continue working the line.  I have reason to believe that at least one of the directors of the line would welcome an inquiry.  I think an inquiry would be justified.  I would like to know from the Minister, in case he refuses to grant an inquiry, the grounds upon which he refuses to set it up.  If the Minister is satisfied&mdash;and I am&mdash;that economies must be effected in order to enable this line to carry on under the existing state of affairs on its own, let these economies be effected by reductions at the top as well as at the bottom.  Does any Deputy in the House, particularly from Tirconaill, Deputy Law or anybody else, suggest that this Company, with its small number of employees, in or about three hundred, requires the supervision of a general manager, glorified or otherwise.  He is a very able railway man, I will admit.  Then they have a locomotive superintendent, an assistant locomotive superintendent, a permanent way engineer, and an accountant, at an expense of £3,400 a year and their chances.</P>
    <P>From what I can gather, the expenses of these particular five supermen in a year would amount to about 50 per cent. of their total salaries.  In any case, the salaries of the five supermen responsible for the mismanagement of this particular line average £680 a year.  The clerical, administrative and supervisory staff contains 60 employees. The yearly salaries amount to £11,500, and the average for each employee is £191 13s. 4d. per year.  I am satisfied from the little I know of the negotiations which have been going on recently that a case can be made for the elimination of two or three of the men who have been served with notices of dismissal. I say no more than that, as far as I <Col N="767" /> know, but I have not been acting behind the seenes in this matter.  I have to act on information which I believe to be reliable.  I have received it from those who have gone into the matter much more closely than I have.  In any case this House would be confronted perhaps with the same position twelve months hence, if in the meantime we are not confronted with the absorption of this line by another railway company who will not serve Tirconaill as it should be served, and it will not have the same supervision of this Parliament as it has to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister whether he is prepared to set up this Committee of Inquiry.  He is not.  I hope he will give an opportunity to this House to allow the mismanagement of this Company to be exposed as it can be exposed, I think, in the light of day. If those who began the inquiry cannot justify the position they have taken up and the statements they have made, give the Company an opportunity of justifying or rebutting those statements. What has the Minister to hide? There is nothing to hide.  Therefore, let him have the whole matter exposed and have the whole matter of the railway inquired into from the administrative point of view or from that of the present policy of the Company.  I think the House should decline to allow a subsidy even of £5,000 to be voted to the directors of this concern, who have, in the manner Deputy Cassidy pointed out, mismanaged this Company, and who are not anxious to get more traffic and make the Company a paying concern. He quoted a case where excursions were advertised for Letterkenny Feis on the 28th and 29th of June.  I am not quite sure whether the management of that Company would not be anxious to make a failure of the Feis. It is quite evident that they were not prepared to cope with the traffic offered to them.  While engines, locomotives and other rolling stock were lying idle close by, they packed the train, which was capable of accommodating only 700 people, with 1,300 people.  There is something radically wrong in that.  I believe my statement is perfectly reliable. The power of the Minister's officials to inquire into the working of <Col N="768" /> the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway either in the past or the future merely goes to the extent of examining the expenditure or revenue.  They satisfied themselves that the manager was entitled to claim £30 or £40 in addition to his high salary.  The expenses were receipted, and that satisfied them.  I am not aware that they have power to inquire into and examine the policy of the Company in so far as it may be concerned in catering for the travelling public in Tirconaill.  These are matters which this House should in the existing circumstances inquire into. This House should set up a Committee of Inquiry at any rate to see if this Company can carry on under the existing methods of management, or whether the case made is one for the absorption of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway by a greater combine that will carry on and serve the travelling public of Tirconaill under the direction of another Parliament other than this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to us, from the information we have been able to get concerning the circumstances surrounding this Vote and the working of the railway line to which it refers, that a very reasonable case can be made out for the suggestion put forward by Deputy Cassidy for an inquiry into the working of these lines.  It is possible, I do not think it is likely, that the result of such an inquiry would be to establish definitely that there was a certain redundancy in staff and that reductions would have to take place, but there are serious grounds for believing that the management of the Company is not all that might be desired and that there is room for economy other than by a reduction of staff, and that consequently some useful purpose would be served by holding an inquiry such as has been suggested.  We have the figures, which have been already quoted in this House, concerning the receipts in respect of the passenger and goods traffic.  From the beginning of this year the receipts in respect to goods traffic are up by some £1,600, but the receipts in respect of passenger traffic are down by almost, though not quite, a similar amount.  The cause of the decline in <Col N="769" /> the passenger traffic receipts may be the increased intensity of bus competition with which the railway is contending. It is also very possible that the decline is directly due to the fact that the facilities which the Company are providing for the carrying of passengers are not suitable.</P>
      <P>Deputies who reside in Donegal and who have experience of travelling upon these lines may not immediately note the particular circumstances under which passengers are carried.  The manner in which the company does its business would be more apparent to any person who visited the county, never having been there before, and who had personal experience of the conditions under which passengers are conveyed.  Some time ago I had occasion to go to Donegal on business which necessitated my travelling all over the county.  I may say it is my usual practice to travel third class, but when I got into Donegal and saw what their third-class carriages were like, despite my slender resources I decided to travel first class.  It is doubtful, if I were prepared to travel third class, if I could have forced myself into some of the carriages in the train.  The people were crowded into these carriages like cattle in trucks.  They were sitting on top of one another and others were standing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I was the attraction.  The fact remains that any person with an alternative method provided for him by an omnibus company would not take the risk of going a long and tedious journey under the conditions which I saw those people travelling. The trains, in my experience, never started to time, and certainly never arrived to time, and there were always long and tedious waits in every station.  Certainly the impression left in my mind was that a considerable improvement in the management of the company could be effected, and if the company is to survive as a business concern such an improvement will have to take place or the omnibus is going to put the railway company out of business.  It is obvious from the figures <Col N="770" /> we have that the omnibus is putting the railway out of business as far as passenger traffic is concerned.  It is necessary for these lines to get trade.  The building of these lines was a great boon to the parts of the country which they serve and which are some of the most backward in Ireland.  If the facilities which the fish industry would require, and the ordinary facilities needed from time to time by the country, are to be provided in those areas, the railway lines must be preserved.  They cannot be preserved in this way unless we are prepared year after year to vote this subsidy, or some re-organisation of the line takes place that would enable an increase in passenger traffic receipts to be made and that will put the company on a paying basis.  The lines are State property.  They were built mainly, at any rate, with money provided by the taxpayers.  In many cases the taxpayers are being asked year after year to pay for the working of the line.  It is our duty to see that the amount which the taxpayer has to put up is reduced to the minimum possible. If there does appear to be a very serious case for a general inquiry into the management of the line it is our business to ensure that such an inquiry will take place before we can in a lighthearted manner vote money to make good the losses which unbusinesslike methods have resulted in.  The matter raised concerning the contemplated reduction in staff is another matter which this House should take into consideration. Yesterday, when leave to introduce this Estimate was given, the Minister, in reply to Deputy Cassidy, made some remark to the effect that Deputy Cassidy wanted the State to subsidise redundant employees of the railway.  But he has informed us to-day that he is proposing to vote £1,000 more than the officials who investigated the condition of the line recommended should be given.  He said it is due to a variety of circumstances which he had to take into consideration.  When this House is going to vote £1,000 more than the officials who carried out the investigation considered necessary we should know why precisely he recommends it. We should be told who the Minister is proposing to subsidise by giving this additional £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> Deputy Davin thinks there is a case for the dismissal of two or three officials, but not for the dismissal of the entire number it is proposed to get rid of.  Deputy Law said that individual cases will, no doubt, mean hardship, although he said it is not possible to make a general rule in consequence of the one hard case.  I would like to know if there is not a general rule operating in the case of the dismissal of these employees.  I heard of a case to which Deputy Law has referred.  It is the case of an employee of the railway company who happens to be an official of the Railways Employees' Union.  Is it a fact, as is suggested, that it is the key men of the Union who are being picked out for dismissal?  It appears to me, if there is a redundancy of staff and if a certain number have to be dismissed, that the rule which appears to be put into operation by the Great Southern Railways is the fairest; that is, that men having the shortest period of service should be the first to go, and not that a competent official&mdash; as Deputy Law said, a very efficient man&mdash;should be dismissed, while others with shorter service are retained. Taking these matters into consideration, it does appear to us that a useful case can be made for an inquiry. I hope the Minister, in his reply, will deal with this seriously and not in the frivolous debating manner in which he usually answers arguments of this kind. We are anxious to know what he has to say, if he has anything to say, with respect to what Deputy Cassidy said. Otherwise we are prepared to back Deputy Cassidy in his attitude by voting with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise not in any way as a partisan in this case, but merely to back the appeal for an inquiry.  A case has been put by Deputy Cassidy which, I think the House will agree, was one of the best-documented and one of the best-stated cases that they have heard in this House.  A prima facie case for an inquiry seems to have been made.  I am not going to prejudge the result of that inquiry.  I can see difficulties.  I want to be fair.  It is in a spirit of fairness I am asking for the inquiry.  For instance, I will put the case that I see <Col N="772" /> certain difficulties even in the cases stated by Deputy Cassidy.  I can see possible explanations, but the question is as to whether these explanations are correct.  The fact that there are possible explanations is a very good reason why, unless we do receive a satisfactory reason within the knowledge of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we should proceed to find out whether there are satisfactory explanations of what has happened.  For instance, Deputy Cassidy stated that a train which ought to carry 700 was carrying 1,300.  That is a point in favour of the company, because the company is out to make money, and it was not doing a thing of that kind without a particular reason.  You are dealing with peak loads.  Excursion loads are peak loads. There was so much a peak load on this particular occasion that the ordinary accommodation was strained from 700 to 1,300.  It does not follow at all that the taking of that particular traffic, even if paid for, would be profitable. Peak load traffic is very expensive traffic.  What I am suggesting now is that the company may have a case; they may be able to say that that extra traffic which they were asked to take on a particular occasion, the people whom they turned away from the booking offices, they would not have taken at any price as a commercial proposition. Anybody who has ever costed out a variable supply or a variable demand knows that peak load stuff is often apocryphal in costs.  I gave the House, some time ago, a case in relation to electric supply where part of the peak load sold at 4d. a unit cost nearly £5 to produce.  The company may be able to put up that case; it may be able to say that to deal with this exceptional traffic, at that particular moment, was not a thing that they could commercially do.  They may be able to say that the idle plant on that date was at a part of the line from which it was not economical to move it to the particular place; it would have to be used at any commercial price.  They may be able to say that the idle plant had duties for the following day and so on, which would have made it impossible to deal with that matter.  I am suggesting now deliberately the difficulties which might be there.  The fact <Col N="773" /> that those difficulties are there, and that that case could be put, is the best reason why, unless the Minister for Industry and Commerce has within his knowledge facts which will show that those were not the explanations&mdash;unless he has a satisfactory explanation in his possession&mdash;the very good prima facie case which has been put up by Deputy Cassidy is a case for inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other points Deputy Cassidy brought out.  He brought out the question of £11,000 and an extra £1,000 being paid for land which he says is worth now only £200.  That is an extraordinary difference and gives one furiously to think.  I find it very difficult to conceive a condition in which a piece of land could be bought for a railway company for £12,000 which in the temporary lack of use would come down to the value of £200. If there is such a case, and Deputy Cassidy has stated that after inquiry there is, and if we are asked to pay £5,000, then there is a strong case for inquiry. He gave us other cases.  There was the case of the two derelict boats.  Some people do palm off their property upon public affairs.  Deputy Cassidy, I do not suppose, is an expert in shipping. A boat could look very rusty and in very bad repair and yet be a very excellent piece of property, but here is a case where he says that he knows that £9,000 was paid for two boats that are now obviously derelict.  His information may be wrong.  If his information is right, and suppose it is a new piece of information, it is an insight into the condition of Government administration of that company which would explain a much larger loss than the £5,000 of subsidy which we are asked to put up.  As I say, I do not want to judge the case.  I will say again, that if Deputy Cassidy's facts are sound, he has put forward as good a prima facie case for inquiry as I have ever heard put before the House.  Unless the Minister is in possession of information, and I think that he thinks he is, in relation to at least one of the specific matters which he raised, and is in a position to tell the House that he is in possession actually of information which will enable him to rebut the prima facie case made by Deputy Cassidy, <Col N="774" /> then an inquiry should lie in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No prima facie case has been made for any inquiry. Deputy Cassidy pretended to give one: two days' excursion trains; an allegation about the times; £11,000 for a piece of ground; and an allegation about the purchase of two boats.  All that goes to lead the House to conclude that it was the present management bought the particular waste ground at Pennyburn.</P>

      <P>The present management&mdash;the management were giving the money.  The Company dates from the time the railway was started. The same thing applies to the purchase of the boats.  Then there were two days upon which excursion trains were run overloaded and possible passengers turned away.  Deputy Flinn says there was a prima facie case and destroys it by his statement about peak loads.  I do not believe there is any case whatever for an inquiry.  I think any attempt made to establish a case only founds itself upon a misconception that there is apparently, as to the difference between the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway and the Government lines which are being worked by them.  We vote money, not to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company for their own use and benefit, but for the working of Government lines.  I made the statement before that they were working upon an old basis, a pre-war arrangement, which is completely out of date, an arrangement which no layman, thinking of the times, could ever come to the conclusion was correct.  The mere statement that it is a pre-war fixture, and that they are operating on the basis of that at the moment, is sufficient case, I think, for some subsidy. You can vote a subsidy and let the lines be kept open, or refuse to vote it and let the lines be closed down, and let, not merely the present redundant employees, but all the people necessary for keeping the lines open get out of work and never come into work again as far as that is concerned.</P>

But Deputy Lemass does not like to apply that doctrine to railways working in Donegal.</P>

      <P>I think that is so, and that it is required.  I think the standard of travel is what the county can bear; in fact, it is more than the county can bear, because we have to vote £5,000 and the Northern Government £5,000.  It is not a sound argument if the traffic receipts will not meet expenditure.  We have been scrutinising the expenditure very closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I never can understand the point of view of people who say that railway managers do not want traffic.  The expenditure has been reduced since 1924 from £71,000 in that year to £70,000; 1925, to £67,000; and in 1926 to £63,831.  That is how expenditure has gone down.  The management laboured in bringing down their expenditure and have succeeded.</P>

      <P>That may be proof of his efficiency, but he is efficient as a railway manager, very efficient, and I think in his cooler moments Deputy Davin will admit that he has been a success.  With regard to how that line is worked, anyone coming from other parts of the country may go to Donegal and complain of the stuffy, over-crowded slow trains, and the long waits at railway stations.  But there never was the same volume of comic comment on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway as there has been about other railways in the South of Ireland.  They never approached anything near the West Clare and Ballybunion Railways.</P>

      <P>The standard has to be according to the particular county, and in these definitely closed-in railways it has to go according to the standard of the people round about. You will not get first-class railway accommodation such as you will get on the Great Southern or as good a permanent way, or you will not get Great Southern time or the accurate running to time on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly as you do on the Great Southern. The coat has to be cut definitely according to the cloth.  I do not know that there is anything more to be said except to say again that they are working under an old 1914 arrangement, which is completely out of date.  Everyone must recognise that a 1914 arrangement must be out of date.  There is talk of a 10 per cent. cut in the wages of the railway employees.  As a matter of fact we had to vote a subsidy and to vote this money to pay wages.</P>

According to what I may term Deputy Cassidy's threat, the House is asked to call a strike for the employees or a lock-out for the railway directors.  If you do not vote the subsidy everybody recognises the railways cannot last, and by the time you have voted the subsidy again the railways will have gone down to such a point that they will hardly ever be able to have a chance to stand up again.</P>

I shall take the blame for a certain number of these dismissals.  I actually pressed upon the directors of the Company, so far as our lines were concerned, that there were certain stations where the traffic receipts were so small that it was an outrage to have them continued as stations.  If the railway management are to be criticised for anything, it is that they have kept a <Col N="782" /> small number of men in employment for two years, where we did not think them necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not. I put it to the House that we are paying the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway this cost of working our lines that we think is reasonable. We check their statements and the results year by year, and we see nothing to complain of, either in the way they are cutting down their expenditure or in the attempt they are making to facilitate traffic.  Some of the things they did resulted in more passenger travelling, but less passenger receipts.  I claim responsibility for that.  But we have nothing to complain of in the way the management is working, either as to the matter of expenditure or receipts on the line.  I do not think that people ought to be asked to hold up the subsidy required because of the three statements made with regard to the piece of waste ground at Pennyburn, about which the facts have not been given.  At any rate if that sum of money was paid and wastefully expended, which I deny, it was not done by the present management; they had nothing to do with it. Similarly with regard to the purchase of the boats which are in commission; they were not purchased by the present management.</P>

With excursion fares on days that have been referred to, we have very little to do.  We look at the ordinary course of progress over the line.  Then there is the item of the boats.  The House is asked to hold up the payment of what we think is a reasonable amount of money in order to enable the Company to meet its working expenses, incurred over the three lines.  You can refuse to vote this money and the railways will close down.  The three Government lines will close down.  What will happen the other lines I do not know.  At any rate our portion of it drops.  We will take up the consideration of it in the autumn, and by that time a greater portion of the line will have been lifted by the people in the neighbourhood.</P>

      <P>Well, if it was, the Deputies will have it placed for a particular date and they will know over what period it accrued.  But it has nothing to do with what the Company has done since 1924, or with the revenue since then.  I think that is sound. I misunderstood the Deputy altogether if he was referring to any departmental inquiry.  There is a most searching departmental inquiry taken every year and everything is gone into and a report is presented.  If the Deputy means the policy of the line with regard to attracting more traffic over the line, certainly that is one of <Col N="785" /> the points most definitely looked into. It was one of the most important items.</P>

      <P>Notice of an amendment has been given by Deputy Lemass which seeks to extend the scope of the Principal Act.  It is not therefore, in order, but in any event, when a Money Resolution such as this on the Order Paper has been passed, an amendment of this kind cannot be moved.  I have suggested to Deputy Lemass that he should discuss the matter on this Resolution.  No other opportunity appears to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that some opportunity should be afforded to the House of discussing the advisability or otherwise of extending the scope of the Trade Loans Act.  For that purpose I tabled an amendment to the Bill in Committee in regard to which, however, in so far as it appears to exceed the scope of the continuing Bill, it can <Col N="791" /> be contended that it is out of order.  I am glad, therefore, to take the opportunity of raising this matter on the Money Resolution.  It has been discussed here before, though, I think, somewhat inadequately and without any definite suggestion being put before the Dáil.  The amendment which I proposed to insert in the Bill on the Committee Stage was to give the Minister power to guarantee loans, not merely for the purpose of acquiring fixed assets, but also towards, or in connection with, the development of any manufacturing concern in the Free State in such manner as to increase the amount of employment given by that concern.  Under the Act as it is at present, the Minister, strictly speaking, has power to guarantee loans used for the purpose of securing additional fixed assets and for that purpose only. We have had discussions in the past upon the precise interpretation of the Act, but I do not intend to deal with that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever may be the exact interpretation which the Minister or the Public Accounts Committee may put on it, we think that it should be definitely stated in the Act that power would be given for the purpose of enabling the Minister to guarantee a loan that will be used by an existing concern in a manner so as to provide that that concern will be able to increase the volume of employment it provides.  It is quite possible that the Minister may say that he has this power already.  Every time a debate on this subject takes place in this House we find that the Minister in the interval has discovered that the Act as at present drafted gives him some new powers, until those of us who are not lawyers have long since given up trying to ascertain what the Act really means and what powers it confers on the Minister.  The proposal in the amendment raises a serious matter which will have to be considered seriously.  In the discussion on the Second Reading of the Bill, Deputy Davin made a statement, of which I would like to remind Deputies.  He said: &ldquo;Deputies, when they come to consider either an amendment or an extension of this Act, will have to say how far they are prepared to go in <Col N="792" /> using the taxpayers' money for the purpose of preserving decaying industries or building up better ones.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that Deputies will also have to consider whether money should be provided for one or other of these purposes.  In that discussion we learned that the Minister has, or thinks he has, power to guarantee loans which will be used for the purpose of extinguishing existing liabilities.  I asked him that question and his reply was: &ldquo;I do not think it is entirely ruled out.&rdquo;  Further, he said: &ldquo;I have done what amounted to that in one case.&rdquo; It would, appear, therefore, that the Act, as at present worded, and as the Minister interpreted it, does confer on him power to preserve decaying industries, but it does not confer on him the power to build up better industries in place of those which exist.  That is the purpose behind this amendment.  I am not a draftsman and I do not contend that the amendment is fool-proof.  It is quite possible that some amendment could be devised that would convey the same idea while, at the same time, be less liable to be torn to pieces by lawyers.  It is not the words but the idea behind the amendment which I want to submit to the House.  I think that there should be imposed on the Minister power to guarantee loans required for the purpose of developing existing industries with the qualification provided for under the amendment that it would be done in such a manner as to ensure that the industry concerned would, as a result, give an increased amount of employment.</P>
    <P>On Second Reading I gave an example of what I meant.  It is conceivable that there would be an industry in this country that was not working at full capacity with sufficiently fixed assets and a sufficient amount of machinery to enable it to turn out its products in greater quantity than it does at present.  That industry might be protected by a tariff and the firm may be anxious to take advantage of the protection afforded it to spread out and capture trade in this country.  It does not require fixed assets, but requires money for the purpose of providing additional staff, for the purchase of additional raw material, for the sending out of additional travellers, and to <Col N="793" /> enable it to provide additional credit to its customers.  We think it should be possible for the Minister to guarantee a loan to an industry in that position. There are other examples which I could give, but the one I quote is quite enough to give a general indication as to what I mean.  The question of security, of course, arises and the Act gives the Minister power to advance loans on whatever security he regards as adequate in conjunction, I think, with the Minister for Finance, but there is no reason, so far as I can see, why loans given under such circumstances as I have indicated, and in accordance with the amendment I suggest, could not be as securely provided for as loans given for the purpose of fixed assets.</P>
    <P>There is no compulsion on the Minister to give a loan unless he is satisfied with the security that is offered.  When this matter was suggested before, the Minister gave me the impression that he was thinking of loans given in such a manner to firms which already got loans under the Act and which required additional money.  I was not thinking of it in that light, but of firms which have not availed of the Act up to the present because they do not want additional fixed assets or new buildings, but because they want money to develop and give additional employment to Irish workers.  I cannot see, therefore, how the question of security can constitute any difficulty in this matter, because security can be obtained just as good as that obtained in cases where the Act has been availed of.  The argument of the Minister when he replies will, no doubt, be similar to that which he advanced on Second Reading.  He said then that his view is that where originally or on reconstruction a firm finds itself unable to get working capital from shareholders or subscribers then there is a very bad case for that business.</P>
    <P>As the Minister himself said, that may be, from the point of view of good banking and the purest of pure finance, very admirable, but we have got to ask ourselves whether that view does fit the circumstances of the country at the moment. The Minister may have changed his attitude recently concerning the facilities which financial concerns are <Col N="794" /> prepared to give to Irish industries.  It is very probable that having got into close contact with the directors of these concerns, he is, as Deputy de Valera suggested, so close up to them that he cannot see the wood for the trees.  No doubt they are able to put forward very plausible arguments to justify their position, but I think those actually engaged in industry in this country realise, and painfully realise, that banking houses are not prepared to give to industry in Ireland facilities which banking houses in Germany, say, give to German industries.  Those engaged in a manufacturing concern and anxious to extend that concern might find very considerable difficulty in getting accommodation from their bankers.  We know there have been cases, quite recently, of what appeared to us to be very harsh actions by particular banks which is likely to result, and which in some cases did result, in the closing down of the firms concerned. If it was thought that the banking houses of the country were giving adequate facilities to Irish industries, then there was no need whatever for this Act, and there would be no need now for the Ministry to come forward with a proposal to continue the operations of the Act for another 12 months.  It is because the banking houses of the country are not giving the facilities which Irish industry requires that this Bill was introduced. The lack of facilities for which the banks are responsible applies just as strongly in the case of capital required for development purposes as it does in the case of capital for fixed assets.</P>
    <P>It is proposed also in the amendment to delete sub-section (4) of Section 1 of the Principal Act.  That is the section which relates to working capital. The deletion of that section, of course, does not give the Minister power to guarantee loans for working capital unless he is satisfied as to the actual circumstances under which it will be used, because while that sub-section remains in the Act loans can only be guaranteed under the terms of sub-section (1), which is the principal clause of the Act.  So far as Section 1 does limit the powers of the Minister in the giving of guarantees the deletion of sub-section (4), which concerns working <Col N="795" /> capital, has no effect.  The belief of Deputies on this side, at any rate, is that by an amendment of the Bill in the manner which I suggest its utility to Irish industrialists would be very considerably increased and it would be possible to realise some part of the hopes which were placed on the Act when it was first introduced in 1924. We know that the Act has not been as successful as was anticipated.  We know it has not had any real or substantial effect upon the volume of employment or the amount of industrial activity in this country.  In fact, I think I am correct in stating that the provisions of the Bill have not been very widely availed of at all since 1926, in the last year or so.  Unless its scope is widened and these additional powers given to the Minister, its utility has practically come to an end. If, however, the Bill is widened in this manner and power to give a loan under these conditions is given to the Minister it will be possible, as I suggested, to get something of real value to the industry of the country from the Bill. Therefore I hope the Minister will consider the matter fairly and will see his way to accept the suggested amendment. It could not be inserted now except by agreement because, strictly speaking, it is out of order.  I hope, however, that the Minister, in his reply, will be prepared to accept the suggestion contained in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Speaking to this Bill when it was last before the House, I took the liberty of stating that Deputies were entirely at one in hoping for the development of Irish industry, and that the point at issue between us was as to the proper method by which that could be accomplished.  In the Bill as it stands three things are aimed at.  The first is the creation and the development of Irish industry; the second is the promotion of employment, and the third is the reduction of retail prices for essential commodities.  There is no Deputy in the House but will think that it was an exceedingly useful and serviceable Bill as far as the national <Col N="796" /> interests are concerned.  By that Bill a sum of something like £720,000 is placed at the disposal of Irish manufacturers for the development of Irish industry. Under existing arrangements the method adopted, if I may use the term, is something like a fifty-fifty basis.  At present, under the Bill, capital has to be obtained by Irish industrialists for the purpose of plant and for the development of premises suitable for that plant, but on the other hand, while these advantages are to be got something is expected in return from industrialists who obtain the benefit of the Act.  It would be expected that while the State supplies the necessary capital for the purchase of machinery or for the proper erection of necessary premises required for the machinery, that an industrialist coming in to avail of the Act would on his own part put something into the enterprise. If I might put it in a rough form, I would suggest that the State would guarantee a sum of £20,000 for the purchase of plant and machinery or for the erection or improvement of premises, and that on the other hand the industrialist, on his part, would be able to do something in the way of providing the necessary working capital to run that industry.  It must be obvious to every Deputy that some kind of security must be forthcoming for the use of this capital by Irish industrialists.  Deputy Lemass, in speaking to his amendment, pointed out quite frankly that this Act takes the place of carrying out a transaction which Irish banks are unwilling to carry out.  The real reason for that, of course, would be that the security offered by the industrialist would not be of a nature that would appeal to the ordinary Irish banking institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The security that is given under that Bill to the State and to the taxpayer would be security in the shape of the new machinery installed.  I am sure Deputy Lemass and others on the Opposition Benches must recognise that that is not security that would appeal to the ordinary banking concern.  Anyone who is in business knows that valuable machinery when purchased deteriorates very rapidly in value after it has been installed.  I have known instances in this city where machinery <Col N="797" /> which cost originally £20,000 to £25,000 when sold after a short period in use realised only something between £3,000 and £4,000.  If, under this Bill, the necessary capital was found for the running of a particular Irish industry and that proved successful, the taxpayers' money would be certainly secured, but if, on the other hand, that particular industry failed, then the balance that would be left, say, in a £20,000 or £25,000 transaction would be something like the small sum of £3,000 or £4,000.  It surely must be obvious that some limit must be put to the use of the taxpayer's money in the financing of Irish industry.  It surely must be obvious to the House that something in the nature of security for that financing must be forthcoming to the taxpayers of the State.  Under this Bill to help Irish industry the taxpayers' money is being used in a way that certainly entails a very fair margin of risk. The difference between Deputy Lemass and myself, as far as this Bill is concerned, is how far are we both prepared to go in risking the spending of the ratepayers' money and on what security are we prepared to risk the investment of that money.  Deputy Lemass, when speaking to the amendment, pointed out that working capital is not very easily available under the Bill.  That is, no doubt, perfectly true, but Deputy Lemass knows as well as I do that certain industries have been already helped under the existing Bill owing to its elasticity and the powers of discretion which the Minister possesses.  That enables him to save a failing industry.  That particular instance came before the Committee of Public Accounts, and some adverse criticism was passed by the Committee on that particular transaction.  In dealing with that, the last time the Bill was before the House I said if any complaints could be made against the Minister it would be that he erred on the side of leniency and in the interests not alone of the taxpayers but in the national interests of the country.  I believe in that particular instance the sum advanced amounted to something like £28,000, but what result accrued to the State in return for that advance of £28,000?  I am informed that the wages <Col N="798" /> alone that accrued amounted to something approximating to £100,000.  No Deputy in the House will deny that the payment of £100,000 in wages for a loan of £28,000 guaranteed by the State is a transaction in the national interests.</P>
    <P>The one point I would like to press on the Opposition really to consider is: has any undue hardship arisen under the present working of the Act?  Has any deserving industry been prevented from starting?  Can it be shown that hardship arising under these two heads has accrued under the Bill as it is now constituted?  I will ask the Minister to say in his reply if I am not correct in stating that an examination of the Bill in actual practice has resulted in showing that there is scarcely a single instance of where a deserving industry has been prevented from starting for the want of finance under this Bill. Perhaps I might qualify that by saying that there might be one industry, but one industry is certainly no proof of undue hardship.  The amendment of Deputy Lemass, presupposes a state of affairs under this Act that does not exist.  It presupposes that if this money were to be forthcoming in the particular way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I turn for a moment to the amendment as now constituted I will ask the House what effect it will have on the Bill.  It will certainly have the effect to which Deputy Lemass referred, of providing working capital for industrial enterprise in this country.  The points Deputy Lemass touched upon, but did not labour, were the points that security and working capital would be forthcoming.  I have endeavoured to point out in dealing with the measure as it now stands that the security which the State receives under existing conditions for the granting of money is not at all what could be called gilt-edged security, but is of a very doubtful value.  But if the amendment now before the House were to be incorporated in this Bill I think it is up to the Opposition to tell us upon what security this money would be advanced. I have had a very striking instance of the need for the obtaining of this security.  People, as a rule, who come looking to the Government to start industrial enterprises are very full of brainy ideas, but very often are &ldquo;stony broke&rdquo; as far as capital is concerned.  I do not think it is in the interests of this State that individuals of that type should be encouraged at the taxpayers' expense.  I do not think it is in the interests of the State that people who have pledged every asset as far as their particular industry is concerned, and who do not want money for the extension of their premises or the incorporation of plant, should be put in a position to obtain actual working capital to run that business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking plainly as a business man, and knowing how difficult it is to obtain accommodation from banks upon ordinary commercial transactions, I could not possibly vote for this amendment as it now stands, because, summing it up in a few words, what does it mean?  It means we are going to give money on no security whatever to be invested in industrial enterprises that may turn out failures or a success, but upon what terms is the individual who is obtaining money coming in?  He is coming in confessedly with practically no capital, and taking no personal risks as far as the industry he is borrowing money for is concerned.  In a word, it <Col N="800" /> may be summed up in a very popular phrase we have in Dublin: &ldquo;Heads I win, tails you lose.&rdquo;  He stands to lose nothing whatever.  After all, we cannot give the money of the taxpayers of this State upon terms of that kind.  I suggest that I am sure the Opposition will agree with me there should be some spur on individual enterprise and in the lending of any money of the taxpayers of this State, some curb upon how that money is invested, to see that it is invested wisely and well.  If the amendment is carried, what spur is there on proper banking enterprise carried on here?  What curb is there on wasteful expenditure of that money?  If the money is handed to an inefficient man &mdash;and I am sure Deputy Lemass will admit, like every other country, we have inefficients among our industrialists; very often they are possessed of a wonderful amount of eloquence to the effect that their proposition is a regular Bonanza on paper, but when it is put into actual working practice perhaps the whole sum of money advanced by the State might be practically lost.</P>
    <P>I think if Deputy Lemass considers that particular position he will not persist in asking the Government to incorporate such an amendment in this Bill. I would ask him to consider, supposing he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, which perhaps some day we may have the pleasure of seeing, what would his position be if every Tom, Dick and Harry were to come along, and if he were legally authorised to meet their demands for money for industrial expansion, without any practical security?  I think the amendment, if you regard it really from a commercial and a national point of view, is practically unworkable.  Mind you, I am not going to contend for one instant that the measure which we are now discussing is the alpha and omega as far as industrial expansion in this country is concerned.  I am of opinion that something further is necessary for the development of this country.  I am as anxious for its development as any member on the opposite benches, but I consider that the amendment proposed by Deputy Lemass is not one that will lead to the industrial expansion that he thinks it will.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred here to the <Col N="801" /> differences between the banking houses that we have at home and those in other countries.  The one thing in my mind that retards true industrial expansion in this country is the want of real technical knowledge in the various industries that we propose to start.  I presume Deputy Lemass is aware, as I am aware, that the system of banking on the Continent is run on entirely different lines from the system of banking in this country.  Speaking upon this measure, which I look upon as only a measure to tide us over a period of transition, I would remind Deputy Lemass that the Banking Commission have already passed recommendations to the effect that this Act should at some future point be abolished and that a new system should be established.  Nobody will contend that this Act is a true solution of the industrial difficulties with which this country is confronted.  If we are to tackle that question in a real workmanlike way we will have to go a step further.  This Act will not carry us the necessary distance.  I do suggest that there is required in this country something similar to what they have in Continental countries.  That is, the establishment of an industrial system of credits.</P>
    <P>One has got to take into consideration, when making recommendations of that kind to the House, the difficulties that exist between the banking institutions on the Continent and the differences and difficulties with which our own banking institutions are confronted here.  Let me take, for example, a concrete instance of which I have some particular, knowledge, in the business with which I am concerned.  Let us take the manufacture of nails.  Suppose we want to start in this country making nails that are necessary for us.  Under the present system of banking there is nothing whatever to help us.  But supposing that proposition was advanced, say, in Belgium?  What would happen in that country?  The banking system there comes in to operate in a two-fold way. It comes in, first, to find the necessary capital.  If the undertaking is likely to be productive and to have good and true results for the country, the director of that particular bank would be <Col N="802" /> the directors of the particular industrial concern which would be set up for the manufacture of nails.</P>
    <P>The directors of that bank would hold at least 51 per cent. of the share capital of the new industrial company. I feel, as one with some little knowledge of banks in this country, that we have not got the requisite technical experts to deal with that problem as it really exists in this country to-day.  We do need expert technical knowledge to develop new industries in this country. We have to follow the examples of other countries.  The United States at one time was not a great industrial country.  What did they do?  They came to England and took the finest craftsmen England possessed to start industries in their own country.  I think the Germans adopted a similar line of action when dealing with the dyeing industry.  We have none of these experts here.  We have not a sufficient number of high-class business men to deal with industries in a technical way in which they will have to be dealt with if they are to be successfully established in this country.  If it were possible to set up such a system of banking in this country, helped by this body of experts with technical knowledge, the same as operates in Continental countries, and a system of industrial credits, I suggest, with all respect, that that would be a real solution of the industrial problems in the Saorstát to-day.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt about it that an absolute necessity exists for setting up such industries in this country, but I suggest, with the utmost respect to the members on the opposite benches, that under this amendment they are never going to get the expansion of industrial enterprise that they are looking for.  We will have, as I have already said, to go a step further than this Bill will take us, and to go a step further than this amendment will take us.  If we are prepared to deal with this problem as it has been dealt with in Continental countries a system of banking, of technical experts, and all those other factors will have to be brought into play and given a fair field.  In the meantime, in putting this view of a system of industrial credits <Col N="803" /> before the House, I do suggest, most respectfully, that this Act has operated very successfully.  As I have shown in one instance, for a loan of £28,000, wages amounting to £100,000 have been paid, and that particular industry is still running, and looks like being able very soon to be put on a proper financial basis.  I said, when speaking to this motion, that any amendment that would be suggested from the Benches opposite in the interests of industries expansion in this country, would have my whole-hearted and sympathetic support, but I do say that the amendment of Deputy Lemass carries us nowhere, and I very much regret to state that I shall have to vote against it if it is put before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this amendment cannot be accepted or brought before the House even by agreement, as it is entirely outside the scope of the legislation. Deputy Lemass has been given an opportunity of ventilating his point of view with regard to the further provision of credits for industry.  There may be a case hereafter made for further provision of credit facilities for industry, but I agree with Deputy Byrne that this is not the way to do it. If Deputy Lemass were really concerned with getting extra credits, knowing the history of this legislation and the way the Public Accounts Committee regarded it, he would not seek to join on to it any better provision by way of looser working or by another system for the granting of credits to industrial concerns.  The Public Accounts Committee have, unfortunately, I think, got into a groove in regard to the consideration of this legislation.  Even if this amendment were accepted and passed by the House, I feel quite certain that the Advisory Committee, on whom the whole thing still depends, would be driven, by what they know of the Public Accounts Committee's mind, and of the Comptroller and Auditor-General's mind on the legislation in years past, to take up a rigid, narrow, conservative attitude on the granting of money for working capital.  I asked, on Second Reading, if there was going <Col N="804" /> to be any amendment of this sort brought forward, that we should have some system of regulation, something, at least, suggested as to the conditions under which the Advisory Committee might guarantee.  I do say again that if the Advisory Committee got that, they would be disposed always to interpret it very narrowly and would not recommend very many cases to the two Ministers for approval, knowing what they do about the progress that has been made on this in the past.  It is only when we get this matter better considered, get some system of regulations made out for ourselves, as to how, when, and where, in the particular type of cases in which it is considered possible to have money given more freely, loosely and without security&mdash;until we get that there is no good going on with an amendment of this sort.  As to advances without security, there is a fundamental difference between the Trades Loan Guarantee Act as it stands and as it would be if this amendment were passed.  Obviously, one can think of exceptional cases where there might be some little security that could be got hold of.  Ordinarily speaking, such moneys are being lent when there is some plant or machinery or fixed assets, which one can have to set against the guarantee that is given to set against the possible State loss, the financial sacrifice that the State may have to make in order to keep an industry going, whereas in the case of working capital all one would have to rely upon is what the Committee would think of the business capacity of the people running the particular concern. Any body of men set to investigate an application made under those conditions will always feel, when they are up against individuals, that it is a very invidious task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think an outside committee would refuse any such task, and it would be left to the Government Department, and the Government Department would be in a great difficulty over the matter if it were simply thrown at them&mdash; whether they would take the fetters of always looking for the security of fixed assets.  I think, then, when we do possibly consider hereafter some better provision of credits for industry, that we will have to make up our minds just <Col N="805" /> to what point we are going to go in that matter to help industry.  One can help industry, of course, at a completely uneconomic rate.  Some people have criticised the expenditure on the Shannon scheme and said: &ldquo;If the money devoted to that had been spent on industry, look at the position we would be in.&rdquo;  I am not sure that we would be in any better position simply by lavishing five millions on industry by giving it by way of a grant.  It is not at all clear, even if by an expenditure of five million, whether we would have any better economic position than we have now.  There is the pressure of hard times.  There is the need to cut out what are extravagances, what are uneconomic sides of business, and to get the whole arrangements scaled down to what the prospects of the business show themselves to be.</P>
    <P>This amendment opens up a very big field, and it is not a particular area in which I am disposed to spend much time at the moment, because I think the time has not yet come for it.  Even when that matter does come to be discussed it cannot be discussed simply on the lines of providing money, and that industries will naturally follow.  Everybody will recognise that there is a limit, and that is why I am talking of the scale, of the arrangement of the schedules, of methods and classes and conditions that we will have to get before we advance on any lines of this sort.  The matter has been ventilated. It is a matter to which much attention has been given over a considerable period and which was approached with a view to solution from many angles. At first I thought the financial houses might have helped more than they did. I do not make any claims of that kind now.  I may be wrong in that judgment. Secondly, the Investment Corporation was set up, and one looked to getting a certain amount of help from them and from the various other types of holding companies which have been thought of and about which people have been approached, but nothing has materialised.  I want to get to the matter of the finance houses.  It was said that this Act was introduced because the finance houses would not act as we thought they should act.  It was not so much that; it was because when one <Col N="806" /> viewed the banking institutions in the country and the way in which they were organised, the purpose for which they were set up, one saw that this distinctly and clearly was a type of business that was almost entirely outside their scope.  It is not so much a complaint against the way in which the banks are being managed at present, and this Act was not introduced as a complaint against the way they are managed, but against banking institutions as they happen to be.  It is simply that banking institutions as they exist are not suited, as they are not in a great many countries, for the purpose of giving long-term loans, providing industrial credits over a long period. Banks have certain arrangements of their own; they are built up in a particular way, and one cannot change that overnight.</P>
    <P>The matter of insurance has been talked about here on many occasions. In more than two years consideration that has been given to the whole insurance question, one of the points operating with the Department and the Executive Council, as a whole, in trying to get a solution for the insurance problem as it presented itself, was that in most countries moneys at the disposal of insurance companies are generally used for the purpose of financing long-term loans to businesses, and the fact that these moneys were not being used for the purposes of financing business in a long-term way and were going outside the country was, I think, possibly the first, certainly the most important consideration, that came to us when we first started into considering the whole matter.  Possibly any change in the region of insurance will have a repercussion upon the provision of credit facilities.  The two things are bound up together to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>The amendment is not being pressed, and was only put down for the purpose of discussion.  I was rather sorry Deputy Lemass did not show a little more of his hand by adding something to it.  In fact, this is ex-Deputy Johnson's amendment of a couple of years ago which Deputy Lemass announced he was bringing forward.  If he had added to it some outline or given some outline in his speech of the advantages of the arrangements that he thought <Col N="807" /> it would be necessary to make incidental to the passing of this amendment, then I would be able to get a better impression of what was in his mind, or as to whether he has any scheme in his mind by which better provision could be made.  Everyone, I think, holds that better provision should be made, and if better provision were made there would be probably a very pronounced, and a very immediate increase in the volume of business.  The Deputy has not indicated any arrangement.  It may be that the matter has not been thought out fully, but that he wanted to get it discussed in a general way.  The matter will come up again&mdash;I cannot say exactly how it will come up&mdash;but it is bound to arise eventually and quite soon.  Again I stress, if there is anything of this sort to be done, it would be better that it should be divorced entirely from the Trades Loans Act, and let that Act run as long as it can. I believe, by reason of keeping strictly, as I assert I have done, within the four corners of the Act, but keeping a wide interpretation of the powers given to me under the Act and establishing these precedents to myself, I have now a scheme which can be worked and which can suit fully most of the purposes for which the Act was introduced, and that we had better leave that as a particular piece of legislation and let anything else come in as a separate matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this section is rather dangerous.  It proposes to allow pictures to be loaned outside this country.  This country is in a peculiar geographical position in view of the fact that we are the next door neighbours to the greatest picture-stealing nation in the world.  I do not know whether it is altogether right that we are to run the risk of lending some of our pictures to this nation of picture-stealers, because we may never see them again.  There is nothing in the section which enacts that the Governors should be obliged only to lend our pictures when we get the loan of other pictures in return.  There is a slight difficulty in the second sub-section of Section 4 which states that pictures shall not be lent to any country which cannot by law lend pictures to this country.  There is no obligation on the Governors to lend pictures only when they get others in return.  Perhaps the Minister would explain what countries are meant in that particular sub-section. I do not know if the nation of <Col N="809" /> picture-stealers have got by law facilities for lending their pictures outside, or whether it is continental countries are aimed at, but perhaps the Minister will explain.</P>
      <P>There is another matter affecting the Bill which I do not altogether understand, that is whether there will be any financial transactions involved in these matters; whether we can lend pictures we will get some money on the loan, on the hire system.  Certainly a certain amount of money will be spent on transport of the picture and in insurance and possibly in the organisation of the various exhibitions.  I do not know where that money is to come from or whether any substantial sum will be spent in that direction.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised at Deputy Esmonde raising a point of finance in connection with this; not exactly so much his last point, but the previous point, namely, whether we can get money for the loan of the picture.</P>
      <P>The situation is this: It is usual in the different civilised countries in Europe to hold exhibitions of pictures. For instance, I think there is, this year, an exhibition in Spain of Goya pictures. We were unable to send pictures there, even though the Spanish Government, or those organising the exhibitions, were quite willing to pay for the transport of the pictures to Spain and for their insurance.  Generally speaking, where there is an international exhibition&mdash;and that is the type meant to be dealt with&mdash; when such an exhibition of pictures is organised the organising Government or people acting for them generally undertake to pay the cost of the transport to and fro, and also full insurance on the pictures.  The pictures will be fully insured against any loss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I claim to have some knowledge on this subject.  We have had on occasion very successful exhibits, some of the old masters, in Cork, and we have a fairly decent collection.  Various schools of art are represented in that selection, and I am sorry to say that it is not what I would like to see it.  It would be some inspiration to our young sculptors if we had some sculpture as well as paintings.  I do not know that this Bill contemplates anything in the nature of sculpture.  I would suggest <Col N="811" /> to the Minister that he consider the advisability of entering into negotiations with other countries who have decent galleries and who would reciprocate&mdash;that we, having some decent works of art, lend them to those countries provided that they in turn lend us some of their best works.  I just want to put that to the Minister as a matter on which he might give us some information.</P>

      <P>It is really a matter of the precise importance attached to the particular exhibition that is being held.  If we had been able to lend pictures to some international exhibition during the past few years, the appearance of the pictures there and the notice they would have got would have actually increased the value of our pictures.  That is so.  In fact, before a flaw was discovered and before it was discovered that the National Gallery could not lend pictures to any exhibition, it had been their custom to lend pictures, and, as a rule, some of these pictures got very favourable notice, and thereby the prestige of the pictures in the Gallery and of the Gallery itself was increased.  This is a matter for the organisers of the exhibition. Take the case of the people in Cork.  If the people in Cork had an exhibition, it would not have been possible for us, without this Bill, to lend our own pictures to them.  Under this Bill it is possible to lend the pictures. Whether other countries would lend pictures to Cork would depend upon the value they would attach to their exhibition there.  In the same way, the Governors of the National Gallery would be guided by the importance of the exhibition as to whether they would lend any of their pictures elsewhere.</P>

The fact that travelling must be done by tram, charabanc, or other public conveyance must mean that the fare would not be such as would exceed first-class railway rates, and there is no danger at all in leaving that section as it stands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I circulated through the House an amendment which, I think, meets the points that I thought were agreed upon yesterday. The amendment I have circulated is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  In the proposed new section, sub-section (1), to insert after the word &ldquo;apply&rdquo; the words &ldquo;to the several persons named in the Third Schedule to this Act and also.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(b)  In sub-section (1) (b) of the proposed new section to delete the figures &ldquo;1921&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;1918,&rdquo; and in sub-section (1) (c) to delete the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;ten.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was agreement pretty definitely on every point of that, with the exception of the point raised by Deputy Briscoe.  If Deputy Briscoe's point was going to be given into, it would mean that we either reduce the 1918 year, or change it, or drop it altogether. Although I object to the case that Deputy Briscoe has in mind, and I do not think there should be any change made, I am not disposed to fight very hard for the inclusion of this or any age limit in the section.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Three amendments have been sent from the Seanad in connection with this Bill, and I am recommending the Committee to agree with all three.  The first amendment is a new section which should appear before Section 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 7 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;(1) A buyer of gas supplied by means of a meter installed on premises in an area in which the jurisdiction conferred by the Act of 1859 is for the time being not exercisable may, unless such meter has been stamped by a special inspector of meters under Section 6 (which relates to the stamping of meters in areas in which the Act of 1859 is not in force) of this Act, by notice in writing require the person by whom such gas is so supplied to remove <Col N="818" /> such meter from such premises and procure the same to be tested by an inspector of meters appointed by a local authority under the Act of 1859 and if found correct to be stamped under that Act as amended by this Act accordingly.</P>
    <P>(2)  If on the testing of a meter pursuant to a requisition under this section such meter is found to be correct the expenses of the removal, testing and stamping of such meter pursuant to such requisition shall be borne by the buyer by whom such requisition was made and in every other case such expenses shall be borne by the person on whom such requisition was made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This point, as a matter of fact, was raised in the Dáil, and it amounts to this: In the areas where the Act of 1859 is exercisable a consumer under that Act was always entitled to demand an inspection or re-verification of the meters.  If it turned out that the meter was correct the consumer paid, and, if wrong, the company paid.  The point here was whether areas not under the 1859 Act would have the same right.  I pointed out that the consumers in those areas had the same right as in the areas where the Act was exercisable.  It seems to be not entirely free from doubt, although I am advised that the matter is quite clear.  The Seanad, however, decided to insert this amendment, putting the matter beyond all doubt that the consumers in those particular areas have the same rights with regard to verification of meters. I move that we accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 10, sub-section (2).  Two new sub-sections inserted before the sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  An order under sub-section (1) of this section shall not be made by the Minister unless and until he is satisfied that the undertaker in respect of whom such order is proposed to be made is able to comply with the obligations <Col N="819" /> imposed by Section 2 of the Act of 1920 on an undertaker in respect of whom an order has been made under the Act of 1920.</P>
    <P>(3)  An order under sub-section (1) of this section may be revoked at any time by the Minister by order made under this sub-section, and thereupon any order made under Section 1 of the Act of 1920 consequential upon an order under the said sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be revoked also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The difficulty was first raised here and it was met to a certain extent, but the Seanad felt that it should be met to a further point.  Deputies who recollect the original section will remember that objection was taken to power being given to the Minister to impose a certain way of charging and supplying on a company.</P>
    <P>The company might have certain obligations imposed on them, and a local authority might refuse to allow the company to take up the streets for the purpose of laying mains.  An order could be made in that case.  To meet that objection I brought in an amendment under which I may by order declare certain things to be done, and such order would have to come before the Dáil.  In the Seanad they thought that that did not go far enough.  Two points were made, namely, first that an order might be made and laid on the table of the Dáil, and a local authority might express itself as being willing to the company getting the powers, but after the order was made it might turn recalcitrant and refuse to allow the company to take up the mains.  To meet that these two amendments were brought in.  It is really for the purpose of meeting reasonable fears, and I think these amendments should be accepted.</P>
    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the amendment,&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Seanad in the following amendment&rdquo;:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10, sub-section (2). After the word &ldquo;under&rdquo; in line <Col N="820" /> 59 the words and figure &ldquo;sub-section (1) of&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    <P>That is a drafting point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>That sub-section provides that an Order issued under sub-section (1) of Section 10 shall be laid before the Dáil, and the Dáil can disagree with it within 21 days.  The new sub-section provides that the Minister may revoke his original Order.  It is possible that some consumers may object to the Order being revoked by which the company agreed to supply gas of a particular value or strength. This provides that the Order revoking the original Order shall be laid before the Dáil to give it an opportunity of investigating the matter and, if necessary, disagreeing with the Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you need not pass the amendment.  I am not sure that there is not some point in that. There may be difficulties, inasmuch as the Order having been passed and the Minister, having found that the local authority would not allow the company to carry out the duties imposed on it, would have to wait 21 days before the revocation order would come into force. There might be annoying and expensive delay.  I assume that under that there would be power in the Minister to refrain from carrying out the Order. That would mean disagreeing with the Seanad in this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should read the section.  The areas mentioned in the section are areas the full drainage of which has been vested in a particular body, and so long as that body is charged with the responsibility it would not be reasonable for another authority to enter into that drainage area and carry out drainage which, while improving one particular area, might interfere with the drainage for which this particular body is responsible.  This provides that no existing drainage work will be interfered with by an outside body.  If there is a deadlock between a body charged with a particular drainage district now and a county council which wishes to carry out a new drainage scheme the deadlock would rest there. The body charged with the responsibility at present will not have that responsibility interfered with.</P>

      <P>If a deadlock of that kind occurs, it will not be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government to overcome it, because the Board of Works would be the body that would be responsible for the existing drainage bodies.  Where a dispute in that particular matter arose, it would be a matter for the Board of Works to deal with it, and not for the Minister for Local Government, who simply wants to stand outside these schemes entirely and leave them, in so far as they are minor schemes, to the responsibility of the local authority. When they become more than minor schemes, or when they become schemes which cannot be carried out without interference in these districts, the matter automatically becomes one for the Board of Works, and if a dispute arises it would be for the Board of Works to settle it.</P>

Under amendment No. 12 we propose to deal with the position of people who have turbary rights and the value of whose turbary rights is improved by the fact that drainage is carried out.  Where there are rated occupiers it is necessary to give them certain rights of notice and certain rights of appeal.  Throughout the Bill these people, in so far as the Bill is drafted at the moment, are styled &ldquo;rated occupiers.&rdquo;  It is proposed in certain of these amendments to delete the word &ldquo;rated&rdquo; so that the word &ldquo;occupiers&rdquo; alone will stand.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where a person assessed to a drainage rate under this Act in respect of land occupied by him is the occupier of other land forming part of or comprised in the same holding, farm, or tenement as the land in respect of which he is so assessed to such drainage rate, any sum so assessed on him in respect of such drainage rate may be collected and recovered from him in like manner as if such sum were assessed on and payable by him in respect of his occupation of the whole of such holding, farm or tenement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> This amendment proposes to deal with the case of a person who has, say, a holding of thirty acres, ten of which come in under the drainage assessment because of the ten acres having been improved as a result of carrying out the drainage scheme.  If a person does not in the ordinary way pay his drainage rates and if it is necessary to take the usual legal action for the recovery of the rates, this amendment prevents the occupier from clearing out his stock from the ten acres that have been improved on to the other twenty acres, thereby preventing a seizure, so that if a person has ten acres on a thirty acre holding, improved by drainage, the drainage rate is not assessable on the ten acres but on the total holding of which the ten acres is part.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is a section which is also included in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.

      <P>That is an important point, because I have in my mind a scheme under the 1925 Act under which lands were re-valued and a heavy charge put on the owners.  It is also useful to refer to this, that the people on whose land this valuation was made were not consulted at all about the drainage, and they have been heavily mulcted in consequence.  It is rather important to see that this does not happen and that land will not be unduly valued in this connection.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if there is any provision for dealing with the circumstances Deputy Goulding referred to.  Is there any check by which these supposed improvements will be re-valued in the interests of the occupier, and what right will the occupier have in the matter of the re-valuation?  Is it to be entirely arbitrary?  Can the situation arise that he will be told that a definite improvement has been made, whereas in reality it has not been made?  Is there any provision to deal with that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a drainage scheme has been carried out to improve particular lands it is carried out on the application of a certain number of the occupiers and must be a scheme that has not been opposed by those occupiers who own more than 50 per cent. of the aggregate value of those lands, so that generally speaking it can be taken that the occupiers are the prime movers in the matter of having those smaller schemes carried out. When we pass on to valuation, the Valuation Office has its own particular duties to discharge, and no one can come in and interfere with it in any way, so that the question of the valuation of lands is one that is entirely outside what we are dealing with here. For the purpose of assessing a drainage rate to the different people whose lands have been improved, the scheme originally makes a statement of the lands that are likely to be improved and a statement of the approximate amount of improvement.  When the scheme is carried out there is a definite report by the land valuer to the county council stating finally what lands have been improved, the extent to which they have been improved, and suggesting lines upon which the cost of the scheme ought to be allocated because of the improvements over the different lands.  That need not necessarily have anything to do with the ordinary valuation of the land for the purposes of discriminating between the amount of <Col N="828" /> improvement to the lands.  Valuers may take the ordinary land valuation or may take other standard of value for lands&mdash;for instance, what they call the ordinary values.  That is the technical work of the valuer, and, as I say, he may base his work on the ordinary valuation of the land or on some other standard of valuation.  Any possible increase in the purposes for which the land is given a valuation is a matter over which we have no control.  It is for the Valuation Office itself.</P>

      <P>Are those people whose lands would be affected by the drainage to receive written notification beforehand that they will be liable for the cost of improving that drainage district?  I have in mind the drainage of an area in County Limerick, Ballinacourty, and the occupiers stated they never heard anything about <Col N="829" /> that drainage scheme being undertaken. It was under the Drainage Act of 1923.  Some individual made an appeal to have the drainage district restored, but the occupiers were not notified by the Department who carried out the scheme.  Some of these who had only a valuation of sixpence in turbary found that the drainage rate put on them was 2s. 9d. for the half-year.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if it is maintained that these people are notified beforehand that they will be liable for the drainage carried out in the district in this particular area.  The restoration of the drainage district cost over £300. It was being done and done as well I was informed for £6 10s. a year by the occupiers themselves.  I would like to know if that is the case that these people are not involved that the county council would be informed and the county council would not inform those people that the drainage would go ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Deputy refers to is not affected by this Bill or the Act of 1925. He was correct in saying that it referred to the Act of 1924, the short title of which I think is The Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924.  That is the reason I was surprised that Deputy Goulding said there were schemes on which money was awarded and levied under the Drainage Act.  There have been schemes under which reconditioning has been undertaken.  That is a bold scheme.  Under the existing Acts as they were before and, say, after the year 1924, the Drainage Maintenance Acts, all the occupiers were liable if the Drainage Maintenance Schemes were neglected.  In fact most of the drainage schemes throughout the country had been grossly neglected and schemes on which many thousands of pounds had been spent had been allowed to go back, as far as drainage was concerned, to their original condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that particular case the Board of Works had a right to go in.  If there was evidence of gross neglect of that kind they could bring the work to a proper condition again and spend a certain amount of money on it.  They were very chary in doing so.  So far as I know they never did it unless <Col N="830" /> there was a very good case made, or their inspector was satisfied that there had been neglect of that kind.  I think in nearly every case of that kind all the money was not demanded from the occupiers in question.  There was generally a free grant given as well. The point the Deputy has raised does not arise at all in this particular case, because in the case of the Bill we are now discussing, as in the case of the Drainage Act of 1926, we are dealing with new schemes altogether and therefore the actual consent has to be got. The case referred to by the Deputy was the case of an old scheme where a legal obligation was already created by existing Acts.  I would be very much surprised if the case referred to by Deputy Goulding is not of that particular type.  Does he refer to the river which is near Dungarvan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so.  That was under the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924 and not under the Drainage Act of 1926.  In that case the occupiers need not be consulted if there was an obvious case where improvement could be effected.  That is altogether on a different footing from the Act we are now discussing.  In the case of the Act we are now discussing prior consent of the majority of the owners is necessary.  In the case of bringing back a river, which the Deputy referred to, such consultation was not necessary.  It would mean that work would not be done, or at least, that there would be considerable delay.  I know there were many cases in which rivers had been allowed to get back to their original state and the Board of Works had to interfere.</P>

There is nothing restricting the county council in any way to make contracts with anyone they like, to have maintenance properly carried out.</P>

      <P>The objection, in the first place, suggests a particular type of contract to the exclusion of all other suggestions, which is undesirable. Particularly it makes the making of such contracts subject to the approval of the Minister.  I have emphasised, all through the passage of this Bill, that there is one thing that is fundamental in the Bill and that is responsibility is being put completely into the hands of the county council to carry out their works and they are not threatened or will not have the delay or the interference that would arise out of getting consent.  I want the House to accept that the Bill as it stands at present gives the county council complete responsibility for the carrying out of the drainage maintenance.  It puts no restriction on them, in any way, as to whether they will have it carried out by direct labour of some nature, by their own workers or by entering into contract with people other than the occupiers or contracting with the occupiers or some of the occupiers.  I oppose very much the introduction of the Minister for Local Government in this way, requiring the approval of the Minister for any type of contract.</P>

      <P>No, it would not be acceptable to me, for this reason: the county council is entirely unrestricted under the Act to carry out this work in any way possible.  We do not want to make pure suggestions of any kind in legislation.  To a certain extent these suggestions would have the semblance of restriction about them.  I have no desire to point out to the county council in what kind of way they can make contracts or in what kind of ways they can carry out their responsibilities for drainage.  I want to leave it entirely to the county council to fit its method to its own machinery or its own absence of machinery to the particular type of drainage problem it has.  As it is, no purpose would be served by making any suggestion in this Bill as to how the responsibility should go.</P>

      <P>Regarding the question of responsibility for maintenance, does that mean that the county council will be obliged to maintain and will be responsible for any losses if they do not maintain drainage?  If that is so, I do not think you will be able to apply that in the case of drainage of turbary. If a county council undertakes to open up turbary by running a drain round it, after three or four years that drain will not be of any use, because the bog will be sinking and you will be cutting under it.  If the county council could be held responsible in law for the cleaning up of that drain, and if they had not done so, they might be sued for any loss of turf.</P>

Under Section 3 (5) a county council or any combination of county councils may, in lieu of referring such petition to the County Surveyor, refer such petition to some other qualified engineer.  They can refer the petition to the County Surveyor to have the beginnings of the scheme prepared, and can direct the County Surveyor to have the work carried on under him if they consider it proper, but the county council must be made responsible for maintenance.  The county council cannot expect to get a State grant towards the carrying out of the scheme if they do not undertake that it will be properly maintained, so that the benefits for which State money is being lent will be continued to the owners of property and so that we will not have the state of affairs that made it necessary to introduce the Drainage (Maintenance) Act of 1924 and to saddle the occupiers with arrears of neglected responsibility.</P>

A couple of hundred pounds worth of turf in a bog might be destroyed in a wet year, and that might easily be put down to the neglect of the county council, who may not be responsible at all.  If the law holds the county council responsible for the maintenance of a drain or a river, which is of no use, there should be some way out.

On the other hand, I do not want to bring the Office of Public Works into the matter to the extent even that the county council could refer a resolution like that to the Office of Public Works for sanction, but that the matter should be left so that the county council is responsible for maintenance, and that the Office of Public Works should judge as to whether maintenance was being properly carried out.</P>

      <P>We believe there is a lot to be said for the suggested Amendment 11, that there should be a definite recommendation to the council to have this work carried out in the most inexpensive way possible.  The Minister has said that he cannot see any reason <Col N="838" /> why there should be what seems to him a definite recommendation to have the maintenance work carried out by the occupiers in this way, through an arrangement with the county council. He has not suggested why that method might not be as good as the other method, of letting it out by contract, or having it done by the county council staff.  If we take it that the work will ultimately be supervised by the county surveyor and that he will be responsible for seeing it is properly done, the real question for the local ratepayers, to which they want us to pay particular attention, is to reduce the expenditure on maintenance as much as possible.  There is no doubt that other ways, while they will still be open to the council, will involve heavier rates.</P>
      <P>We are of opinion that this amendment should be allowed to stand.  It simply means, while it does not debar them from maintenance works in other ways, that the council can arrange with the occupiers to maintain them, and the whole argument in favour of it is that it will be less expensive in the long run.  The Minister has said that he does not want to make allowance in the Bill for exceptional cases. He takes it that every scheme is going to be a perfectly good scheme and perfectly successful.  He is going to make the county council responsible therefore. Under Section 16 he is making them responsible for the expenses.  If they are to be responsible for initiating a scheme and carrying it out, and paying the expenses afterwards, why should we not give them this permission, as it is stated here definitely?  So long as we are not debarring them from undertaking maintenance work in other ways, why should we prevent them from taking what seems to them the cheapest way?</P>

      <P>I foresee great practical objections to a county council entering into a contract with a number of occupiers of lands that have been drained&mdash;I foresee practical difficulties. I do not say that these difficulties may not be overcome, but I do not want to suggest, above all other ways, that the county council might carry out its drainage maintenance in this particular way.  I also would have very great fears that, in the average case in which a scheme like this was entered into, the drainage maintenance work would not be carried out.  There is, however, nothing in the Bill that will prevent the county council getting its work done in this way, but I do not want to father  the Bill this single suggestion, out of all the suggestions which might be made.  I do not believe that it would be either efficient or cheap to do it in this way.</P>

In a group of five or six, you may get a very ideal person to contract for keeping drainage, a very conscientious person, and, I am sure, no cheaper method could be found than to get a contract with such a person to have it done in that way.  I can imagine that there would be jealousy between different people affected by the scheme.  They do not always get on too well, and if there were two or three looking for such a contract, and if it were given to one, I can see the others putting difficulties in his way.  It is very hard to make up one's mind on the matter, but I think that the reasons the Minister first gave were rather academic.  No council would resent the suggestion, even in a Bill, because the idea contained in the suggestion might not occur to themselves. If in the average case it was the most efficient way of getting the work done, I think the Minister's objections should not weigh with us in allowing the amendment to stand.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;18.  Whenever the lands proposed in a drainage scheme to be drained or improved include any bog land from which turf is at the preparation of such scheme being or capable of being obtained or from which turf will as a result of the execution of such scheme be capable of being obtained the following provisions shall apply, that is to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  for the purposes of any statement contained in the scheme of the value of such bog land or of any increase of such value, the value of such bog land shall be taken exclusive of and subject to any rights (in this section referred to as turbary rights) of cutting and removing turf from such bog land whether generally or for <Col N="841" /> a particular purpose and whether in virtue of ownership of such bog land or of ownership of other lands or otherwise;</P>
    <P>(b)  the value of the several turbary rights over or in respect of such bog land shall be stated in the scheme and the increase in such value expected to arise from the carrying out of the scheme shall also be so stated;</P>
    <P>(c)  the like notices shall be served on all persons having turbary rights over or in respect of such bog land as are by this Act required to be served on occupiers of lands proposed in the scheme to be drained or improved and every person having such turbary rights shall have the like rights of making objections to and of expressing assent to or dissent from the scheme as are conferred on such occupiers by virtue of this Act;</P>
    <P>(d)  for the purpose of determining whether the number of dissents from the scheme is or is not sufficient to prevent the confirmation of the scheme, but for no other purpose, turbary rights shall be deemed to be lands proposed in the scheme to be drained or improved and to be in the occupation of the persons entitled thereto.</P>
    <P>(e)  the report to be made under this Act to the county council or joint committee charged with the carrying out of the scheme as to the amounts by which the respective annual values of lands have been increased by the carrying out of the scheme shall not include in such amounts any benefit to the owners of turbary rights in respect of such rights but shall contain particulars of the manner in and extent to which such owners have been benefited in respect of such turbary rights by the carrying out of the scheme and shall also contain recommendations as to the contributions (in this section referred to as the turbary assessments) towards the cost of the carrying out of the scheme and the maintenance of the drainage <Col N="842" /> works constructed pursuant thereto to be assessed on such owners in respect of such benefit;</P>
    <P>(f)  no person shall be assessed to a drainage rate in respect of a turbary right;</P>
    <P>(g)  the county council or joint committee charged under this Act with the carrying out of a drainage scheme shall, when fixing the drainage assessments in respect of such scheme, also fix the turbary assessments to be assessed on and paid by the respective owners of turbary rights benefited in respect of such rights by the carrying out of the scheme and shall fix such assessments in all respects as appears to them to be just and equitable having regard to the manner in and extent to which such owners are so benefited by the carrying out of the scheme and in particular may fix any such assessment as a lump sum payable in one instalment or in two or more instalments over a period of months or years or as an annual or a half-yearly sum of fixed or variable amount payable over a number of years:</P>
    <P>(h)  the certificate of such county council or joint committee certifying the respective amounts by which the respective annual values of lands have been increased by the carrying out of the scheme shall also certify the amounts of the several turbary assessments and the time and manner of payment thereof by the respective owners of turbary rights, and such assessment shall be payable by such owners to such county council or joint committee accordingly and shall be collected and recovered in the like manner and by the like persons and means in all respects as the drainage rate is collectable and recoverable and, for the purposes of such recovery, every turbary assessment shall be deemed to be assessed and leviable on all land which is in the occupation of the owner of the turbary rights to which the assessment relates and is either the land on which such rights are exercisable <Col N="843" /> or the land to which such rights are appendant or appurtenant.</P>
    <P>(i)  where a scheme has been carried out by a joint committee, every turbary assessment in respect thereof shall be collected by the county council in whose county is situate the land over which the turbary rights to which the turbary assessment relates are exercisable and every such turbary assessment when collected by such county council shall be paid to such joint committee.</P>
    <P>(j)  all moneys received on foot of turbary assessments in respect of a drainage scheme by the county council or joint committee charged under this Act with the carrying out of such scheme shall be applied by such county council or joint committee in reduction of the moneys to be raised by such council or for such committee by means of the drainage rate and shall be so applied either towards repayment of the expenses incurred in carrying out the scheme or towards the maintenance of the drainage works executed in pursuance of the scheme or partly in the one way and partly in the other way as such council or committee shall think fit and shall be so applied at the discretion of such council either as and when received or by accumulating and resorting to the accumulations or partly in the one way and partly in the other way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to deal with the matter raised here by Deputy Brennan on the Fifth Stage of this Bill before it left this House&mdash;that is, the position of turbary owners.  The position with regard to the rights of turbary owners up to the present is that they have not been leviable in any way for improvements that have affected them beneficially in their capacity as owners of turbary rights.  The owners of the bog land over which these turbary rights exist were made responsible for the drainage rates.  Now this amendment provides that where drainage is carried out and where the value of the turbary rights are improved as <Col N="844" /> a result of the drainage, those who have their rights improved should pay a suitable proportion of the cost of the carrying out of the work and a suitable proportion of the drainage maintenance cost.  It takes cognisance of the fact that, while the land can be permanently improved by drainage the increase in the value of the turbary rights as the result of the drainage is not permanent. It throws a certain amount of additional turf free for collection by the owner; and that is used, all that is collected in a certain limited number of years.  The amendment that is before us here proposes that a parallel system will be set up for turbary right owners in the same way as a system is set up through the Bill for ordinary landowners.  They will have the same rights of objecting to the carrying out of the scheme based on the value of their turbary rights that the owner of the land will have, so that without their voices being raised they cannot have a drainage rate thrown on them.  They will therefore get a like notice and will be able to make the same appeal that the occupiers of the land can make before a scheme can be carried out.  When the scheme is carried out and a report made by the land valuer shall show separately the extent to which the land has been improved and the extent to which there is an increase in the turbary right values created, so that the cost of the scheme may be allocated in reasonable proportions on the land that has been improved and on the turbary rights that have been improved.  It makes provision that the amount of money that is set aside and the cost of the scheme and the cost of maintenance against turbary rights shall not be included in the drainage rates; that there shall be a drainage assessment as a result of which a drainage rate is struck, based on the improvement of the land, and there shall be a turbary assessment based on the improvement that has been brought about in turbary rights. It makes provision that the turbary right owners can be assessed in respect of the turbary assessment by the amount, payable monthly or two-monthly or annually or six-monthly for a definite period of time, the period of time being based on the extent of time that it appears <Col N="845" /> likely that the increased value will have been collected by the turbary right owners.</P>
    <P>So that as far as possible the amount of money that will be paid in respect of drainage maintenance and the cost of carrying out the work will be paid by the owner of the turbary rights for that period that he is directly benefiting by the increased value of the turbary that is made available to him; and the amendment under section (3) opens an arrangement whereby the county council can use that money in whatever way it seems best to themselves in paying off the cost of the scheme and reducing the cost of the drainage rate in general.</P>

      <P>Because there is in fact bog land&mdash;land that would be available for reclamation when the turf is removed.  In considering your scheme you have to take into consideration, in the first place, the ordinary good land, and, in the second place, the turf which is there.  In the third you have to take into account the land underlying that turf.  We will say that there is only a small amount of turf there, and that only three or four feet of turf was being added as an improved turbary right to the owner, and then when you get down to the land there might be a certain amount of drainage rates properly leviable on the bogland that remains after the turf had been taken away.  But you cannot ignore when dealing with the turf the valuer may have in his scheme to take cognisance of the bog land that underlies that.</P>

      <P>If that exceeds half, the scheme cannot be gone on with.  If &ldquo;rated&rdquo; remained there the turbary right owner could not come in as one of the dissenting parties if he considered that the scheme was going prejudically to affect him, and consequently the word &ldquo;rated&rdquo; has been dropped in the first place because really it was not necessary. The occupier is the occupier. In the second case it was dropped because they left in a class of people we are proposing to deal with.  These would have no means of having their voices heard and being considered after the publication of the scheme or when the certificate was given that the scheme was fully carried out.

      <P>For the purposes of any statement contained in the scheme of the value of such bog land or of any increase of such value, the value of such bog land shall be taken exclusive of and subject to any rights (in this section referred to as turbary rights) of cutting and removing turf from such bog land whether generally or for a particular purpose and whether in virtue of ownership of such bog land or of ownership of other lands or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Let us say, you may have the case of a man A who owns bog land.  He owns the turf on the top of it.  He would be assessed to the turbary rate in respect of any improvement to his turbary rights.  But he would be assessed to his drainage rate in respect of his bog lands.  You might have it in the case of a man B, who had turbary rights on bog land of a man C, and who held these turbary rights appurtenant to some other farm that he held. That is why the phraseology is brought in here.  It shall be taken exclusively on turbary rights whether these turbary rights were by virtue of ownership of the bog land or because they were appurtenant to some other holding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If for any reason the bog land of B is to be mentioned in the scheme as likely to be improved, it shall be mentioned in <Col N="848" /> the scheme on its own merits, and there shall not be included in it any of the value of the turbary rights that C has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of this Bill. As the House will see, this is simply an enabling Bill to enable the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to prepare certain schemes.  This will, of course, involve the expenditure of public money, and, in the ordinary case of bringing forward a Bill that will involve a charge on the State, possibly in the present condition of affairs some justification would be necessary.  But the demand has been so universal, even from those who demand economy on all sides, for a pension scheme, especially for one class of teacher, I find it unnecessary to debate the wisdom of bringing in a Bill of this kind, even at the present moment, and even though it actually will involve some burden on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal agitation in connection with pensions for teachers, those teachers who do not at present enjoy pensions, has been in connection with <Col N="849" /> secondary teachers.  It would have been possible for us to have brought in a Bill specifically dealing with secondary teachers alone, but there are other cases in which it may be necessary or advisable if circumstances permitted to deal with pensions for other classes of teachers.  Hence, after a certain amount of consideration it was thought advisable to proceed in this particular way. That is, simply to introduce a Bill that would enable a scheme to be drawn up and, so far as the Oireachtas is concerned, instead of presenting it with a Bill in every individual case and every individual scheme, to provide that the scheme shall get the actual sanction of both Houses, not merely that it will lie upon the Table of the House, and, if not objected to, come into force, as the Deputies will see by reference to paragraph 4, but that it will lie on the Table and have to be actually confirmed by a resolution of each House.</P>
    <P>So far as the secondary teachers are concerned, I think I announced well over a year ago that the Minister for Finance and myself had agreed that the principle ought to be accepted that secondary teachers ought to get pensions. We felt it was necessary in the interests of education, leaving out any other consideration; that is, leaving out any consideration in which an appeal might be made on what might be loosely called humanitarian grounds. There was the other consideration, that at present, largely also on humanitarian grounds, teachers are being kept on by schools beyond the period in which they could give useful service simply because the heads of the schools do not care to dismiss them as there is no pension for them.</P>
    <P>Even from the strict economic interest of education alone the Minister for Finance and myself agreed that a pension scheme for secondary teachers should be introduced, but when it came to the discussion of the details there was considerable delay experienced. We thought first the obvious way to proceed would be to get an actuarial investigation into the case.  After that had gone a certain distance and we had more time to consider the various aspects of the case and accumulate the <Col N="850" /> information with regard to the numbers of teachers and the different types of schools and the great irregularity of the services of those teachers&mdash;teachers dropping out for a year or two and coming in again&mdash;we were convinced that an actuary in the strict sense could not give us much useful information on which to base a scheme. Therefore, we determined to frame a scheme as best we could.  The Bill makes provision for schemes of that kind, for the setting up of a fund for any teacher who wishes to enter a scheme by his paying a portion, as in the case of national teachers&mdash;a certain percentage of his salary&mdash;into the fund. There is the provision also that in the case of the schools any teacher who wishes to enter the scheme shall pay a certain contribution and also that there shall be paid in such moneys as the House may choose to vote for that particular purpose.  That is the main principle of this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, it will be a contributory scheme in which there will be three principal contributors, the teachers, the schools and the State.  As in the case of the national teachers, you have two principal contributors, the teachers themselves and the State. The position is somewhat different in the case of the secondary teachers. Strictly speaking, neither primary or secondary teachers are in the position of civil servants.  Neither class of teacher is a servant of the State; they are not direct employees of the State. Strictly speaking, they are private employees of the manager in the one case and the heads of the school in the other. Undoubtedly they are performing national work and, in the case of the secondary teachers, in some ways the secondary schools are more of a private concern than the national schools.  The State does actually make itself responsible for the payment of the increments.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons, therefore, why the State should undertake the setting up of a scheme of this particular kind.  They will have to make arrangements not merely for what I may call the normal working of the scheme&mdash;that is, when the scheme has become fully contributory&mdash;but also for the transition period.  We realise <Col N="851" /> that there are at present a number of people in the service who want to retire. Some of them are retiring, if they have not retired already, and contributions in their case will be out of the question. That has been met in various ways. Under the scheme in Northern Ireland there is practically a lump sum mentioned in the case of the maximum and so many years' service.  We have tried to adopt what we regard as a fairer plan&mdash;namely, a certain fraction of the years of service.  There are some details of the scheme which yet require to be settled between the Minister for Finance and myself.  The main outlines of the scheme are ready, and when this Bill becomes law the scheme will, I hope, be submitted to the House.  I do not pretend that the scheme is overgenerous, and I am far from pretending that it will satisfy everybody.  That is out of the question.  I think that any scheme that we adopt will be such as the resources of the country will permit. When speaking on this matter before, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I made the statement that in case of any retirements, with due notice and with the consent of the Minister after the date of the announcement referred to, the scheme could be made to date back to that retirement.  That is to say, if there was delay, there would be, as far as possible, no injustice to any person who wished to retire. We were delaying not because we were anxious to save any money by such a delay, but because of the complications which the scheme involved. and we were anxious that in the case of any teacher who wanted to retire after the date of that statement, made in 1927, the pensions could be dated back to that date.  By that statement the Minister for Finance and myself will stand.</P>

      <P>I am sure that most Deputies felt as I did when leave was asked a few days ago to bring in a Teachers Superannuation Bill.  I am sure we all thought that at last justice was about to be done to a section of public servants, if not in the strict sense of the term, at least to men and women who have devoted themselves to a most important social service and who <Col N="852" /> are doing public and national work. I felt also that my disappointment in opening this Bill was shared by everybody who had an interest in this particular subject and who was acquainted with the very proper agitation which has been going on for a superannuation scheme for secondary teachers. We have had that agitation for a quarter of a century.  When I looked at the Bill I found, to my amazement, that it was full of emptiness.  Instead of having a scheme which could be put into operation when this Bill became law at once, we have what appears to me to be a very empty Bill.  If we look through its paragraphs we find that the Minister may prepare a scheme, may do this, and may do that.  I am not aware that the Minister had not those powers already without bringing in this Bill.  A year ago he gave us to understand that he was preparing a scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have the scheme along with the Bill, so that we could go into details and examine it carefully?  My first impression on opening the Bill was that the Minister just wanted to calm the impatience of these people, who have been ill-treated by the nation all the time.  It seems to me that it was intended simply as a sop to them, to give the Minister another year, or any time he cares to take, to formulate the scheme.  No explanation has been given by the Minister as to why we should not have this scheme, if it is ripe.  A year ought to be sufficient to prepare it.  Why could we not have the scheme here now so that when we pass the Bill we should have the scheme ready to put into operation at once? As I say, I can imagine that it was prepared only as a sop to show that the Minister had not completely forgotten the matter.  Perhaps, however, there is another reason.  Perhaps when this scheme is presented we will have to take it <i>en bloc</i>, take it or leave it.  It seems to me that the ordinary procedure concerning Bills would have been more satisfactory in this case, and that we would have a scheme presented as a whole and be passed through the various stages necessary for legislation, so <Col N="853" /> that Deputies would have an opportunity of criticising it effectively.  Instead of that it is going to be put through by means of a simple Resolution. We are disappointed that this matter, which has dragged on so long, has not been even at this stage brought to a head.  Only one class of teacher has been mentioned.  There is no reason why the Minister should not have dealt with other classes in the Bill.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister that this Bill is not intended as a mere postponement of the question and that it is intended to bring in the scheme at once.</P>

      <P>What is in it that would take more than an hour to discuss? The Minister spoke of Northern Ireland, and I would like to ask him whether he intends, either in this Bill or at any other time, to do another act of justice.  During 1922 it was the policy of the Ministry to ask teachers in the Six Counties not to recognise the Belfast Government.  During that time a portion of their salary was deducted for pensions.  When they changed their policy they did not think it wise to do an act of justice even to those people and make good to them the money deducted from their salaries.  This Bill is really so empty that there is no reason why we should not pass it almost without discussion.  So far as I can see, it does not give the Minister any powers which he has not got already.  It is simply putting off this act of justice until after the Recess, and goodness knows how long after that, and it is something about which I think we all feel disappointed.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera as to the delay which has taken place in the introduction of this Bill.  I believe that that delay has been inexcusable.  No justification has been made for delaying in a matter on <Col N="854" /> which there was general agreement from all sections of the House on any occasion on which it was discussed here.  So far as the form of the measure now before us is concerned, I think it is usual to bring up a Bill of this kind enabling the Minister to formulate schemes, because any pension schemes or rules with which I am familiar are formulated by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education by virtue of the powers given them in a Bill of this kind.  So far as form is concerned, this is the right procedure.  I was not here for the Minister's opening remarks, but I note here the significance of the title.  It is generally understood that this is a Bill to provide pensions for secondary teachers.  That, I presume, is its first object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the point I want to have cleared up.  I want to know is the word &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; intentionally left out in order to enable the Minister to deal with other classes of teachers and to prepare schemes for them?  I am specially interested in these cases.  There are two classes of primary teachers who have not got any pensions.  It is an arguable question as to whether or not legislation would be necessary in order to formulate schemes for them.  I take it, and I would like to know if I am correct, that if this Bill is passed, then that question will be settled.  If they want to formulate schemes for convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses, this measure gives power to do that.  There are professors in the Training Colleges whose claim is a strong one, and there are other classes of teachers in industrial schools who will be putting in a claim for pensions. I am just anxious to know whether these classes of teachers can be dealt with under the Bill.  My reading of it is that they can, and I would like to have it confirmed by the Minister. There is one matter that I would like to put before the Minister which he should have power to attend to.  That is to deal with the case of ex-teachers which has been put forward in this House for a number of years, and which is undoubtedly worthy of the <Col N="855" /> attention of the State.  I got an answer from the Minister for Finance about a year ago, in which he stated that there were 629 ex-national teachers in receipt of pensions under £52 a year and whose average service is thirty years.  That is, that there are 629 teachers who have served an average of thirty years and who have pensions of less than £1 per week.  That is not a creditable thing for the State.  Under the Bill as drafted at present, I do not think the Minister will have power to deal with that particular class, or to treat them even as generously as they have been treated in Northern Ireland. Special concessions were given to them in Northern Ireland, but here we have neglected them. and I do not think it is right that we should continue to neglect them.  That is a point of view, I think, that will be supported in every part of the House.  I would urge on the Minister to consider this question and see if he could not insert a section enabling him to deal with this matter, as the whole question of teachers' pensions would then be covered in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly interested in Section 3 of the Bill.  It has my strong approval.  It is a matter which we have asked for on various occasions that when teachers are appointed to the inspectorate they should not lose their pensions.  I take it that that will apply not only to secondary teachers but to national teachers appointed to the inspectorate.  I know the case of national teachers who had served fifteen or twenty years as teachers and then became inspectors.  They lost all rights to pension which they had acquired by their previous service. That had one effect, in any case, that was rather bad for education, namely, that teachers of experience, men who had ten to fifteen years' service and who would make excellent inspectors. because of their experience and ability, refused to take up positions as inspectors as they would lose their pension rights.  I would like the Minister, to assure me that this section covers not only those men who are secondary teachers and who go into the Civil Service, but also covers primary teachers and that in cases where <Col N="856" /> primary teachers become professors in training colleges, their case will be covered also.  They are all different branches of the same profession, and I think the pension rights should be continuous.  Of course, we have to wait until we see the scheme to know what the terms are, but I would be inclined to support Deputy de Valera's view that if it were possible this Bill should get through this session.  I do not know whether it is possible, but if it were I would like that that would be done, so that there would be no delay in formulating a pensions scheme.  I have my doubts as to whether the Bill, having been introduced only two or three days before the end of the session, can be passed before the Recess.  It is regrettable if it cannot be passed, but if the Minister gives an assurance that nobody will suffer as a result of the delay that will go some distance to relieve the anxiety of those who have been waiting many years for the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the remarks of the last speaker first I desire to say that I have often asserted myself in urging the claims of what I might call the older teachers.  It does not seem, and never did seem to me, that the Minister required any further powers to deal with the matter, and I doubt if he gets them under the provisions of this Bill.  With the previous speaker, also, I take it as certain that other classes are included.  Those at least for whom Deputy O'Connell spoke, for example, professors in training colleges, should also be dealt with under a pensions scheme as soon as we are able to persuade the Minister that such a course is advisable, if he requires persuasion.  We would like to have a further assurance from the Minister when he comes to conclude the debate.  We all share Deputy de Valera's and Deputy O'Connell's disappointment that the delay in providing this scheme for secondary teachers and other classes of teachers has been so great.  I recognise that the subject is a big one and a very difficult one. Nevertheless the delay has disappointed many people and has been a great cause of difficulty to those in charge of secondary schools in their attempt to <Col N="857" /> carry out their work efficiently and well.  I would suggest to the Minister that even though we do not decide it now, we ought with the leave of the House to pass the Bill through all its stages this session, notwithstanding that there is not much to be gained by that if the Minister would go so far as to indicate to those in charge of secondary schools the kind of pension which older teachers, teachers say of sixty-five or seventy years of age, who have been serving for twenty, thirty or forty years as secondary teachers, may look forward to, when he proposes to bring before us this scheme about which he tells us that he and the Minister for Finance are agreed upon.</P>
      <P>The delay has been harmful and everything.  I think, ought to be done to make that harm as small as possible.  I think a good deal will be gained if, even to-day or to-morrow or before we break up the Minister gives an indication to those in charge of schools as to what kind of pension the State will be prepared to give to those teachers I have mentioned, so as to enable those in charge of schools to make their preparations even this month with reference to the coming session, because to continue many teachers in service for the next year, as many boards are forced to do, through the delay in this scheme, will undoubtedly damage the educational standards of these schools in the coming year.  With Deputy de Valera, I do not see any reason for our not being able to pass this Bill within an hour.  There is nothing in it except giving the Minister power to prepare schemes, and to ask for our consent and the consent of the Seanad to these schemes.  It seems to me that we can pass it quickly, but I do not think it would much expedite the Minister, provided the Bill gets its Second Reading.  It would be carried through in a day after the Recess.  The Minister, however, could help those in charge of schools very much by giving that indication as to the sort of thing he has in mind to provide for secondary teachers when they retire.</P>

I came across a good many of those cases in different parts and heard of others.  Their positions is very bad and they certainly ought to have their necessities looked into.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something in this Bill for this most deserving class.  Many of them gave the greater part of their lives in the service of national education and they are receiving pensions that are lower than the wages of labourers.  I hope the Minister will see his way to do something for them and I hope also that this Bill will be passed as quickly as possible.  It has been looked forward to so long that it will be a great disappointment if it is not law this session.</P>

I would like to know what would be the pensionable age?  Would it depend on age or on the years of service?  And what amount of pension such retiring secondary teachers would be likely to get.  It would affect the schools in many ways.  The teachers, of course, may not like to retire and the schools may not like to urge them to do so until they know what pensions they will get.  The Minister says this scheme is optional, that the schools may contribute.</P>

For instance, would teachers in trade and industrial schools come in?  There are only about sixty of them, I understand.  I think they should be considered, and also whether that might apply to any class of technical teacher?  I would like the Minister to tell us what arrangements have been made for this transitional period.  Would the pension be a hundred a year for those who would be retiring now, or in a year's time, and could not contribute anything?

      <P>I wish to join in the appeal for consideration of the old pensioned teachers.  I remember in another House, over ten years ago, raising this case for the old pensioned teachers.  We were always put off by those who received deputations with the reply: &ldquo;Wait, you will shortly have your own home government to deal with this matter, and they will remedy whatever grievances exist.&rdquo; We have our home Government now, and I can certainly say that the conditions of these old pensioned teachers are not a credit to any country.  I believe that there are at least a hundred of them with pensions of less than £32 a year.  They have had from thirty to forty years' service.  I believe there is a number of them with £25 a year, and I am informed that these pensions are taken into consideration by the old age pensions authorities when the apply for old age pensions.  A pensioned teacher with £32 a year gets no old age pension.  I would ask the Minister specially to give this matter the sympathetic consideration that we would expect the conditions of these people would receive from a home Government. With Deputy O'Connell, I raised this question in the House many times.  I asked many questions on it and submitted <Col N="860" /> many cases to the authorities.  I could get them a number of cases of pensioned teachers of practically seventy years of age who are existing at the moment on a miserable pension of £32 a year.  I join earnestly in the appeal for consideration for these people.</P>

I mean such cases as that of the secondary teacher who has perhaps retired already, or who is on the point of retiring and who cannot possibly contribute to the scheme. I hope the Minister will be able to indicate, and the hope has been expressed by the other speakers, some of the classes of teachers to whom his scheme will apply as well as the secondary teachers.  I hope the Minister will find some means of enlarging the scheme so as to include the staff of the training colleges.  I hope this Bill will be passed through all its stages before we part for the Recess.  It would be almost impossible to expect that the actual scheme could be laid before us immediately, but I do trust before the turn of the year the scheme will be perfected and operative.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is in order to discuss this Bill at all, because it seems to me there is nothing in it; but as the Minister may be glad to have the opinions of members before he produces his scheme it is no harm to let him know what we think of this Bill.  We have been told that the one thing you cannot economise in, and have no right to ask for economy in, is education, and when Deputy de Valera or somebody else on those benches stated there ought to be certain economies made there was laughter from the other benches.  And even from a representative of the university to-day there was a jibe about the hair shirt of economy which this party <Col N="861" /> wants to put on the shoulders of the Minister.  Now, I hope he will come along and defend the Minister for Education, because it seems to me if he were tackling this question in the bold, generous way which teachers expect there would be no necessity to deal with it in this hesitant manner.  We would have all the facts before us in this Bill and be able to come to certain conclusions.  For example, the Minister tells us the actuarial investigation which we were led to believe had gone on for a year and half&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In replying, not to members on this side of the House, but to Deputy Thrift or Deputy Alton, I think it was stated not long ago, at any rate during the past three months, that investigations were proceeding.  I think it was the opinions of members that the actuary had not completed his investigations. We now see that the actuary completed his investigations long ago, and that the whole matter was not held back by reason of that, but simply that officials had not made up their minds.  They have not yet made up their minds.  They want to come in with as mean a scheme as they can. They think they will be able to carry it through, and this thing is simply a kite to see what we have to say about it.  If, as Deputy O'Connell said, we will have ample time on the resolution to put in amendments and discuss the thing as an ordinary Bill well and good.  I hope that is so, a Chinn Comhairle.</P>

      <P>Very well.  You would not like to say that was so.  If we are to be placed in the position that we have to accept the scheme as it stands, without being in a position to make any changes in it, the situation will be a very serious one.  The Minister says the schools are to participate in it, and I quite agree that the schools ought to be rich enough and are being subsidised sufficiently to enable them to take part in this, if it is such a heavy burden as the Minister makes out.  He has not, <Col N="862" /> however, given us any figures to show exactly what the liability of the State would be in the matter.  He tells us it will be optional, so that the teacher in the school will be in the position that he may become a part of the scheme. It will be optional with him, even if it is and he becomes part of it, then, I suppose, it will be obligatory on the school.  I think that does not really solve the question, and that it ought to be obligatory on both teachers and schools, and that we ought not to put the teachers in the position of having the school on their flank as well as the State.  If the amount is a rather small one, I think no new complications, such as managers, school grants and all that kind of thing should be introduced into it.  If the amount is not terribly large then the scheme ought to be gone on with, and if the Ministry afterwards want to recompense themselves for a certain amount of the State contribution by taking something away from the school grants, let them do so.  The Minister has, in fact, indicated that the scheme will not be like what it is in Northern Ireland.  He stated, I think, that in Northern Ireland a lump sum was granted and a certain amount for each year's service.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Or&rdquo; a certain amount.  Well, the total number of years, I understand, is allowed for service in Northern Ireland, but the Minister definitely stated that he will only give a percentage of the number of years for the older teachers who want to go out.  I do not think that is quite fair for those teachers.  Are we going to have the same position that has been referred to in connection with old national teachers perpetuated again in regard to secondary teachers?  We are going to have a new pension scheme, but the teachers who happen to be old in their profession, who have spent a long time in it, have to go out in worse circumstances.  Surely to goodness, if there is any balance, it ought to be in favour of the older teachers going out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to add a word of support to Deputy Fahy's request that the industrial <Col N="863" /> school teachers should be dealt with.  There are only a small number of them, and there seems to be special difficulties in connection with them. The Minister ought to indicate what other kind of teachers he proposes this Bill should apply to, and ought definitely to tell us, so that we will not be in a false position in voting for the Second Reading of this Bill, exactly what he will do for the teachers who are now going out on pension, if that can be reasonably told.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply rise to make an appeal for the second time in this House on behalf of the old pensioned teachers.  For some reason, they seem to be nobody's children.  I do know I had the support here of some leading members of the House in making the appeal I made.  Many of the old teachers are in very indigent circumstances. Most of them are on the borderline of poverty, and they must now be very few indeed.  I will submit to the Minister that he should take it into his serious, if not sympathetic, consideration to introduce something into this measure, to make some provision for those old and valued servants of the State.  One of the Deputies referred to the question of the teachers who may go out on pension under this new scheme, and he has suggested that they may go out on pension and that they have paid very little towards the pension scheme.  I do not know what is in the mind of the Minister with regard to them, but I would respectfully submit to the Minister and the House that some attempt at relieving the old pensioned teachers should be made now.</P>
      <P>They are knocking at the door for a long time.  They have given very valuable services to the State.  I am sure that it will be acknowledged by every Deputy that the old national school teacher has turned out some of the very best talent that this country has ever produced, or is ever likely to produce under any system.  I do suggest for these reasons, apart altogether from the humanities of the case, that the Minister should take into consideration the cases of these old deserving pensioned teachers.</P>

      <P>I must confess that the speech I found most difficult to understand was Deputy Derrig's. I wonder whether other Deputies were in the same difficulty.  He referred to the actuarial investigation in connection with secondary teachers, and he referred to questions which were asked here, apparently unaware that these questions had to do with primary teachers.  When the Minister for Finance gave the answer that the actuarial investigations were still in progress, he gave an answer to two questions asked by Deputy O'Connell with regard to the junior assistant mistresses and the lay teachers in convent schools.  Still, Deputy Derrig finds an inconsistency between that and my statement about the secondary teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Several months ago, yes.  I indicated that we had proceeded a certain distance with the actuarial investigation.  Owing to the extraordinary complications of the situation&mdash;it was very often extremely difficult to get information from secondary teachers&mdash;we found that the material that we could put at the actuary's disposal was not such that an estimate from him would be much help to us.  We, therefore, determined <Col N="865" /> to go on with the scheme.  Another statement was made by Deputy Derrig about percentages that I confess I did not understand.  Deputy Derrig may not be aware that it is usual to base pensions on service.  Take the usual scheme of the national teachers: if a man has thirty years' service he gets 30/80ths, and if he has forty years he gets 40/80ths.  The Civil Service pension is calculated in the same way.  I suggested that as a difference from the Northern Ireland scheme this would be more favourable to the teachers. Whereas they get £120 in Northern Ireland, or £3 a year of non-contributory service&mdash;I am speaking of the transition scheme&mdash;whatever is the lesser.  I said that I thought a fairer scheme would be to get a percentage, to take so many years' service and to give them credit for a certain percentage of their salary per year's service.  As that question has been raised, I say that I think&mdash;I am speaking now of the transition scheme&mdash;that it will work out, so far as the teachers are concerned, not less favourably to them than the Northern Ireland scheme would.  Of course it will depend on the number of years' service.  I do not pretend that a person who has ten, twenty, or thirty years' service will get the same pension as a person who has forty years' service.  That is quite reasonable.  But a person who has given his life, as has often been said, to secondary education, I think on the whole he will get somewhat slightly better terms than in the case of the £120 in Northern Ireland.  That is so far as the transition scheme is concerned. It is quite easy to say that a person who has gone on and paid his contributions all along should get more. I think that was also said by Deputy Derrig.  Remember that the scheme is a contributory scheme.  We intend, even though there is no contribution whatsoever to a person's credit, to give him this particular transition scheme arrangement when he goes out, although he may not have contributed a single penny to the fund or he may have contributed very little.  The most he would have contributed is a year. Deputy de Valera complained that he was disappointed in the Bill.  I think, in answer to a question, the Minister <Col N="866" /> for Finance clearly indicated that the Bill would be an enabling Bill, and the discussion that has gone on shows the wisdom of making the Bill an enabling Bill.  Teachers in training colleges have been referred to.  It is often said that they are in the position of university teachers, but the universities provide their own pension schemes. They are in a sense more private employees than any of the other teachers to whom reference has been made.  I do not think it would be well to embark on a State scheme of pensions where they are concerned without an investigation and full consideration of the whole financing of the training colleges.  I think that would be a first essential.  If I were to put all these things into a Bill I would have to hold up the Secondary Teachers Bill until I had them all ready.</P>

      <P>This is an enabling Bill.  The Deputy has objected to this, and he says why not include them and introduce a Bill?  Nothing would be easier from the point of view of the Minister for Finance than to introduce one scheme and one Act and to have for every other scheme a new Act.  If I simply introduced a scheme of pensions for secondary teachers that was practically ready it would stop at that, and then, if there was a demand to deal with another class of teacher, a new Bill would have to be introduced, and so on, over and over. I know that the Deputy sees no difficulties in anything like that.</P>

      <P>So far as economies are concerned, I appreciate the fact that everybody in the House wants money spent.  I have always said that I did.  So should I like it, and in education there ought not to be economy.  I would remind Deputies that in the interrupted debate on the Estimate, so far as it had gone, suggestions were made to me that would involve the State in certainly well over £1,000,000 a year, expenditure that would probably improve conditions <Col N="867" /> and help education, though it would be an indirect improvement to education, so to speak.  What would be the cost in the case of direct improvement is another matter, but certainly the expenditure of money in various ways that, indirectly, would react on education would probably come to anything between a million and a million and a half pounds.  Unfortunately we are not in a position to plunge so easily into the expenditure of public money as that.  We have followed what I said we could do by introducing an enabling Bill.  I think the Minister for Finance made that quite clear.  We have followed the usual way in dealing with matters of this kind, and if there is disappointment we cannot be responsible. So far as the Bill is concerned, I say that when it becomes law after the Recess there will be no delay on our part in introducing our scheme. Once the Bill becomes law we will certainly be in a position to introduce the scheme.</P>
      <P>There are, as I say, some details that still need to be settled.  They are not details that need delay us very long. The one point upon which Deputies need to be quite clear, and it is the most pressing point, involves the future in connection with the schools and the employment of the older teachers.  I have tried to make that fairly clear, that they will not, on the whole, taking into account the number of years' service they have given, be worse off than their colleagues under the Northern Ireland scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Bill itself is concerned, any class of existing teachers can come within the scheme.  A scheme can be prepared for them under this Bill, but remember that all this demand for the expenditure of public money will have to be considered in every individual case.  I am quite aware that I could do nothing more easily, and nothing more popular, than to propose increased expenditure for any service, certainly for education, and get it through the Dáil. It would have the unanimous support of the Dáil.  I have not the slightest doubt about that.  Whether I would have the unanimous support of the Dáil or whether I would have the unanimous <Col N="868" /> support of the Minister for Finance in getting money to meet the obligations undertaken is, unfortunately, a different question.  So far as the scheme is concerned, there will be a State contribution. It is on that a debate might take place.  So far as a State contribution is concerned, the only persons I think that could move for an increased State contribution are the Executive. That is as far as the Bill is concerned, and quite as much so far as the scheme is concerned.  There were a number of points raised about the older teachers and the ex-teachers who do not come within this Bill.  I doubt if there is such a necessity.  I think the pensions were actually increased some years ago, that some fifty per cent. was added.</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with teachers alone.  Deputy O'Connell wanted to be quite clear that the omission of the word &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; was deliberate.  Of course, it was deliberate. And also as far as (3) is concerned, the word is omitted there for the same reason.  As to a primary teacher who becomes an inspector, that can be dealt with under that particular section, so that the bad effect on education that Deputy O'Connell says has resulted in the past from the slowness of national teachers to put themselves forward for the position of inspector can certainly be remedied in paragraph (3).  In the course of the debate I was asked whether, so to speak, the scheme would be retrospective.  Roughly, that is what it came to.  I said in my introductory statement that the Minister for Finance and myself stand by the promise already made, and that to any retirements that took place with my approval after the date upon which I made that statement, which I think was some time in the beginning of 1927&mdash; that holds.  This Bill is not intended as a sop.  It is intended for what it is the first necessary step in the provision of a scheme for pensions for different classes of teachers, in the first stage anyhow, so far as time is concerned, for the provision of a scheme of pensions for secondary teachers.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Constitution (Amendment No. 8) Bill, 1928.  The object of the Bill is to reduce the age of Senators from 35 years to 30 years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the only argument which the President has to advance in support of this Bill is one which was supplied by a speaker on this side of the House.  I thought that when the Government were introducing a Bill into the Dáil to reduce the qualifying age for election to the Seanad from 35 to 30 years that they would tell us exactly why they were doing so.  I am astonished to know that, apparently, they had no reason for doing it until they heard the speech of Deputy Ryan yesterday, although the Bill has been on the Order Paper for weeks.  I thought the President would tell us what advantage is going to accrue to the State or what advantage is going to accrue to the people by reducing the age for the Seanad from 35 to 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will any advantage accrue to the State because of it?  Is it going to ensure that we will get better laws? Is it going to ensure that the Seanad will cost less, or is it merely intended to provide that those elected will be likely to live through their entire period of office, and thus avoid unnecessary by-elections for the Seanad? I wonder if the Government really considered the question at all before introducing the Bill.  I wonder did they sit down and ask themselves first, if there should be a qualifying age for the Seanad at all.  If there is to be a qualifying age for Senators, there must be some reason for it.  If it is intended that only &ldquo;grave and reverend seigneurs&rdquo; shall occupy the Upper Chamber, that would be some argument to advance for fixing the age <Col N="871" /> limit under which a person would not be eligible for election.  But this Bill proposes to reduce the age limit and not to increase it.  It is proposing that persons over 30, instead of over 35 shall be eligible for election.  I wonder what is the average age of Deputies.  I would not like to make an investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will find that the average age amongst all parties is just over thirty.  In the Cumann na nGaedheal Party it is much higher, because, after all, that is the party that would naturally attract those suffering from senile decay, whereas young and vigorous men would be attracted by the policy of Fianna Fáil.  But the fact remains that if you fix a limit of 30 years in respect of the Seanad you are going to have in the Seanad exactly the same class of people that you have in the Dáil.  Do you want that?  Is it going to help in the government of the State that there should be a Second Chamber that will be merely a duplication of this one, elected in a different manner no doubt, but composed of people in no way different to those elected to the Dáil?  I am not one of those who consider that there should be no age limit fixed in respect of the Seanad.  I think there should.  But I am arguing that it would be better to have no age limit than to have an age limit of thirty.  My opinion is that if you wish to have a useful institution in your Second Chamber you should decide that only those should be elected as Senators who are under six or over sixty.</P>

      <P>I want to be clear whether the Deputy <Col N="872" /> is moving his own amendment.  Amendments 1, 2 and 3 are in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment 1 &mdash;To delete the word &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion &ldquo;this day twelve months.&rdquo;  I think that a Bill of this serious nature would require much longer deliberation than has been given to it, and that Deputies opposed to hasty legislation, to taking steps in the dark, and matters of that kind, should support this amendment.  After it has been deliberated upon for a period of twelve months throughout the country Deputies would be able to give much greater attention to the consequences of it, with much greater knowledge of what the consequences are likely to be. I was arguing, however, that it is a nonsensical procedure to fix the age limit at 30, because 30 is the average age.  It would mean that those elected to the Seanad would be in no way different to those elected to the Dáil.  Of course, I am prepared to admit that there are other qualifications for election to the Seanad which do not exist in respect to election to the Dáil.  As I pointed out yesterday, the Constitution provides that only those can be elected to the Senate who have done honour to the nation.  That does not apply to those elected to the Dáil.  Whether you have done honour or dishonour to the nation or not, you are eligible to be elected to the Dáil, but you must have done something that is definitely of honour to the nation before you are eligible for election to the Senate.  I indicated then that that section of the Constitution was capable of very wide interpretation; that a person who became a member of Fianna Fáil could be held to have done honour to the nation and would, in consequence, be eligible for election as a Senator, provided he is over 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should undoubtedly be an age limit for election to the Seanad, but if the age limit which I am suggesting is not adopted, the best alternative is that you have no age limit at all, and leave it a free scramble for everybody. The age limit I suggest quite seriously is under six or over sixty, and I am going to advance very strong arguments in favour of that suggestion. First of all, a person under six would <Col N="873" /> be unable to read the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo; It would be very useful if we had in the Second Chamber people who do not read the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  It would mean that there would be more variety in the debates.  It might mean that there would, even occasionally, be disagreement there, if there were in it some people who had not reached that age and whose political opinions were not formed by the leading article writers of that paper.  Some people thought I was joking yesterday when I mentioned about Senators walking in there with attache cases carrying back numbers of the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo; I was not joking.  As a matter of fact, I was informed of an incident that happened. I thought it was good enough for &ldquo;Dublin Opinion,&rdquo; and I told the editor of that paper about it.  A particular Senator who was going to board a train at Dundalk marched along the platform, looking very pompous, and carrying a large attache case.  Those who gazed upon him thought that the attache case contained all the concentrated wisdom of that man's labour for years past; all the documents with which he was going to astound the Seanad when some discussion or another took place.  Unfortunately, as he was stepping into the railway carriage the case fell open, and the only thing in it fell out&mdash;a copy of the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  The only paper he thought necessary to bring with him when going in to that Assembly for the purpose of deliberating on the nation's business was that day's issue of the &ldquo;Irish Times.&rdquo;  I notice some Senators bring back numbers as well.</P>
    <P>As I said, one considerable advantage about having young people in the Seanad would be, in the first place, that they would not be influenced by the &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; because they would not be able to read it.  Secondly, they would be able to bring fresh minds to bear upon the Bills before them.  They would, of course, be free from any of the bitterness which recent events might have created, and they would be able to judge every question as a fresh question, uninfluenced by considerations of anything that happened before, or precedents which had to be maintained. I think it would enliven the <Col N="874" /> proceedings very much, particularly if we also saw that the ushers would attend to those Senators under six by providing feeding bottles occasionally to keep them quiet when they squeal. But the other proposition is much more likely to secure support in this House&mdash; that instead of reducing the age limit from 35 to 30, we should advance it to 60.  I ask Deputies to consider what the Seanad would look like if every Senator was over 60.  The respect that everybody has for age might even act in such a manner as to produce respect for that Assembly&mdash;it is not likely, but it might.  People over 60 would have found the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; out by this. In any case they would not be stampeded into rash and impetuous action by the articles which one reads occasionally in that paper.  They would be likely to act more slowly when the Government loses its head, as it does periodically, and wants to take impetuous action that might have serious consequences. We could rely upon that House of grave and elderly seigneurs to apply the brake.  That is what the Seanad is for.  If the Seanad is not an institute for applying the brake to hasty legislation it is useless.  If it were composed of people over 60, it would be the most effective brake possible. In fact, a difficulty might be to get them to do anything.  It might be that we would have to reconsider the situation afterwards in order to get any Bill passed.</P>
    <P>The attitude of Deputies on these benches towards the Seanad is well known to the House or should be.  If there is to be a Seanad, we want it to be a harmless Seanad.  When I say harmless, I do not mean an absolutely powerless Seanad, but a Seanad so constituted that the amount of harm which it will be able to do to the interests of the Irish people will be reduced to a minimum, because we believe that any Seanad acting under this Constitution at present cannot be but harmful.  Is it likely that the Seanad will be made more or less harmless by a proposition such as is contained in this Bill?</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted, generally, that by reducing the age limit from thirty-five to thirty you are likely to get a Seanad that will be more anxious <Col N="875" /> to do things just for the sake of doing things than a body of older men would be.  After all it is the prerogative of youth, I suppose, to be always anxious to do something, to be impetuous, to be altogether of that type that inactivity does not agree with and to whom nothing is so objectionable because it is inactivity.  They are anxious to do something for the sake of doing something whether it is good or bad.  By reducing the age limit we increase the possibility of having a Seanad that will always be embarking on rash ventures. The Government may consider that a Seanad composed of younger men are likely to be less submissive to themselves and that on some outstanding occasion they might take the audacious course of opposing the Government. But that is not likely in view of the methods of election and the provisions made in the variety of Bills just passed, but it is more likely with a body of younger men than with a body of older men.  Therefore, from the point of view of the Cumann na nGaedheal this Bill is unwise and is a further example of hasty and ill-considered legislation. If the Government had given this matter five minutes' consideration they would not have introduced this Bill at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another example of the same kind.  The proposal to reduce the age limit from thirty-five to thirty was in respect of a very different Seanad altogether from what you are setting up, a Seanad constituted in a different manner and with different powers.  That Seanad might <Col N="876" /> be of some use, whereas your institution never can be of any use.  If the President is prepared to adopt the proposals of the leader of this Party in all matters concerned with the Seanad there might be some sense in his remark, but what he does is that he takes his proposal in respect of one matter and he tries to fix that on to his own proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  Again the President is trying to do the same thing.  There was only one child in the Report, and then you proceeded to amputate it, and then, when we refuse to accept a hand or a foot because you wanted to keep the rest of the body, I do not think that could be fairly objected to.  There was only one proposition we had in our minds.  We said there should be no Seanad; that it was wasteful and useless.  But we said if there is to be a Seanad it should be a Seanad subservient in every respect to this Dáil, and so clearly in the grip of the Dáil that it could not squeak without our permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not a word about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no motion about what?  If we could not get a Seanad absolutely subservient to this Dáil, we wanted to clip its wings on every occasion and to reduce its power. We have not been able to carry out our proposals.  That Committee was, of course, a reproduction in miniature of the Dáil, the Party with a majority here had a majority there, but it was worse in this Committee because we had representatives there that we have not here.  The Seanad was represented there, and the Seanad representatives composed half the Committee, with the result that our representatives were a very small minority.  The propositions carried in that Committee were carried by a majority vote.  If the President is prepared, as he has admitted that there is some wisdom in this proposition, to agree that there may be wisdom in any other proposition put <Col N="877" /> forward by us, and if he is willing to leave the thing in our hands to draft a Constitution for the Seanad, then I promise him that we will produce a body very different from that which now exists and much more likely to be of utility in the State.</P>
      <P>I maintain, therefore, that this Bill was not considered by the Government at all before they introduced it.  The President looked down the Reports of the Committee, and ordered the draftsman to draft the Bills on that basis. They were in a hurry to get them and they had to be flung into the Dáil so that the Dáil would be frightened at so many measures to be passed before the Recess and would put them through without being considered.  If they had considered this Bill and the consequences that were likely to flow from this Bill to their own party it would not have been introduced here.</P>

      <P>If we had thought about the number of speeches that would be made about it!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if he had thought about the number of speeches that would be made about it it would not be here, but the fact remains that not one single argument has been made in favour of it.  Not even the President, who can generally find an argument for everything, has been able to stand up and justify this Bill.  He has not attempted to tell us why there should be an age limit for election to the Seanad and if there should be an age limit why there should be this particular age limit.  He just drew upon the argument put forward by Deputy Ryan yesterday and relied upon that. His contention was that in insurance experience he discovered that the average life of an individual is forty-four years of age, and, as he pointed out, if the age limit remained at thirty-five it was unlikely that the average Senator would live for the entire period of his office.  Has the President considered the full implications of that argument and its relation to the proposals contained in this Bill?  A Senator of the minimum age, elected if this Bill is to become law, will hold office for nine years.  If he is anxious to seek re-election, at the end of the <Col N="878" /> nine years, he knows that on the average he is not likely to survive for the full period.  Therefore, he will be content with the nine years that he has got and not bother about re-election. And consequently even the slight inducement which exists to that Senator to keep up a pretence of looking after the work of the Seanad will be removed. Those elected will say: &ldquo;That is a status and allowance for the period of nine years and I need not worry any further.  At the end of nine years I shall go out of office and there is no use going forward again for I will not live for the following nine years.&rdquo;  The result of Deputy Ryan's argument is really to increase the strength of the argument I have advanced in favour of the under six and over sixty proposition, because if under six is decided upon we will know that Senators who do their duty can be elected again and again, and in that way can be rewarded, while if it is over sixty we will know that those who have got that far have got past the fence of forty-four and may live for the entire period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated yesterday that I was not satisfied with the answers I received from the Minister for Justice with reference to the questions I raised concerning the conditions in Clondalkin. He informed the House yesterday that no great disorder was discerned in Clondalkin and there was no general drunkenness.  That was the report of one of his officials who was sent specially to the district to see if there was justification for the complaints made.  In point of fact I was asked to visit the district by several people in the locality, including the clergymen there, and I paid a number of visits to the place.  I presume what I saw there could have been seen by the officers sent by the Minister's Department, if the Minister's Department was anxious to remedy the complaints.  I will tell the House briefly what I did see in this district, although I may state that it is a very disagreeable matter.  First of all, I would like to point out to the House and to the Minister that, in my opinion, the cause of these scenes complained of in Clondalkin and other districts is the extension of the hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Deputy is aware of the fact that I have nothing to do with the extension of the hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. BRADY Mr. BRADY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just mentioning the cause and at the end I will make a suggestion to you on that point. The publichouses in the Dublin district close at 5 o'clock and in Clondalkin <Col N="880" /> and in other places the licence has been extended to 9 o'clock.  Normally, according to the Act, these publichouses should close at 8 o'clock.  I understand one publichouse in this district actually applied for an extension of the licence and it was refused, and then, for some mysterious reason, in a week or fortnight the extension was granted.  What really happens is, people go to Clondalkin and those other districts already under the influence of drink.  They drink up to 5 o'clock in the Dublin area.  Then they get on a bus and continue their drinking up to 9 o'clock.</P>
      <P>The Minister may point out to me that the Guards have a very difficult task.  I admit it.  I saw them there trying to do their duty after 9 o'clock and I admit that their task is a most difficult one after that hour.  My complaint is that if the Department did its duty those conditions would not prevail at 9 o'clock.  It is because duty has been neglected prior to 9 o'clock that the Guards have a difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now relate briefly what I actually saw in this district and what was there for anybody else to see, whether they were Guards or ordinary civilians.  I went through the district first of all before the publichouses closed.  The conditions were quite normal.  I went right through the district and I did not see anything of an objectionable character.  At nine o'clock I came back into the village and I saw the publichouses there being closed and the people were literally reeling out of those publichouses.  I will say there were up to a couple of hundred people on the street.  I myself saw people coming out of those publichouses with drink in their possession.  I saw one woman coming out of a publichouse at 9 o'clock and she was badly under the influence of drink and she had half a dozen of stout in her arms. I went then through the laneways after the publichouses were closed and in the laneways I saw men and women lying in the ditches, drinking either bottles of stout or Baby Powers.  I saw the same thing in the village itself. Why the Minister's officials failed to see it, I do not know, because I was standing beside them.  In the village itself on Sunday week I saw one man <Col N="881" /> who was so much under the influence of drink that he was lying, or rather he had his head, against a wall.  This was directly opposite one of the publichouses, about fifteen or twenty yards away.  That man was making desperate efforts to get further drink out of a bottle of whiskey, and he found it hard to do so.  He was as drunk as a man could possibly be.  I saw another man falling twice on the road in an effort to cross the road.  At this time there was the usual bus traffic in the district.  The scenes were of the most disgraceful character.  Men and women were congregated there, and they were more like beasts than human beings.  They were dancing and singing and carrying on in the most disgraceful fashion.  The noise and scenes were so bad that on one Sunday I was told the Protestant clergyman had to suspend Church services, and both the Protestant clergyman and the Catholic curate patrolled the village and spoke to the Guards about the scenes.  In spite of all that, in reply to my question, the Minister for Justice told us on July 10, the report is in column 4: &ldquo;I do not know anything about the scenes in Clondalkin.&rdquo;  Now I admire the innocence of the Minister.  If he were dealing with other matters, such as Republican prisoners, he certainly would have been better informed.  But, candidly, I do not accept his statement, because although he made that statement upon the 10th July he had received a letter from the Protestant clergyman and the Catholic curate on 11th June.</P>

      <P>Well, I am quite convinced that when this question was raised the Minister's Department made inquiries, as they usually do, and I am quite convinced that they had knowledge of the fact on the 11th of June, the Superintendent of the Gárda had received a communication protesting <Col N="882" /> against the thing.  If he did not, it shows that the Department neglected its duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. BRADY Mr. BRADY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister had received it then.  That was in reply to a different letter.  However, the fact was that on the 11th June last these two clergymen there were so disgusted with the conditions in the district, so disgusted that in spite of various protests nothing had been done to remedy matters, they wrote to the Superintendent of the Gárda complaining of the deplorable conditions prevailing in the district.  As a result of the conditions, as a result of the abnormal drunkenness in the district, it is common knowledge that numerous prostitutes visit this particular place. Parents in the district have appealed to both the clergymen.  The scenes there are so bad and so open that the parents have frequently appealed to the clergymen to do something in order to enable them to bring up their children decently. I have seen things there myself right opposite the post office in Clondalkin of a most revolting nature.  One man said to me: &ldquo;Not only would you want to keep your children in the home, but you would want to pull down the blinds if you wanted to keep your children from seeing some sights.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only object I have in bringing forward this matter is, not to find fault with the Gárda, not to make their task more difficult, but to make the Minister realise that the conditions there are very bad and to urge upon him the necessity of remedying the matter.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister can recommend to his Department or to the Gárda when the case for a renewal comes up to refuse or to do their best to prevent the licence being extended. It is quite possible that the <Col N="883" /> Minister has been misled on this particular matter.  I am quite convinced that the Minister believed in the figures given to me for instance when I asked for them.  According to the information I got on the 10th June, there was one arrest in Clondalkin.  Well, I pointed out to the Minister although I believe that he gave these figures in good faith that these figures are absolutely wrong.  I know it myself.  On that particular day there were fourteen people arrested, or at least&mdash;I do not know whether there is a legal distinction between arrest and being brought to the barracks, there may be&mdash;but on that day there were fourteen people arrested.</P>

I certainly will be prepared to give the evidence that there were fourteen arrested on that particular day.  I myself spoke to the sergeant there on last Sunday and he told me that they had no accommodation there, that they are not supposed to have prisoners.  If he arrests two or three men he must put in a number of Guards to see that they do not get out through the window and that means that the Gárda could not possibly do their duty on the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>A drunken man could not get out through the window.  He might fall out.  I would like to say now that the conditions there are very bad. I have spoken to all classes there and even to the men in charge of the buses and they say that they hope to goodness that something will be done to remedy the conditions down there.  What really happens is that when the publichouses close the Gárda rush the bus as it comes into the village and they try to get the people out of the village. That is what the sergeant told me himself. He wants to get the people out of the village and that means handing on these drunken people or people under the influence of drink to the bus <Col N="884" /> driver.  The conductors of the buses find it not only impossible to collect the fares but it is quite a common thing to find that these people smash the glass and try to smash the seats as well.  I do not want to keep the House any longer but I would point out to the Minister as strongly as I possibly can that this situation exists in Clondalkin and I believe in other places and that it is a very serious matter.  The people of Clondalkin are a very law-abiding people.  I am satisfied that one Gárda would be quite sufficient for a place like Clondalkin or at most two.  In point of fact we have six Gárda there, I presume at somewhere about £3 a week each.  That extra expenditure is put on the people in order to accommodate two publicans. The people have to bear this extra expenditure for the services of the Guards there.</P>
      <P>I cannot get any explanation as to why certain publicans can do certain things, because I am sure that the majority of publicans would be against that kind of thing if they have any respect for their business or have any desire to get any protection from this House.  I am sure that even the publicans themselves, decent publicans, in their own interests would condemn this conduct as strongly as we do.  Whether it is that certain individuals in that trade have a certain influence or pull with some people in authority I do not know, but I failed to find any explanation for the continuance of these scenes of disorder.  I would appeal as strongly as I can to the Minister to consider this information which I have given him.  I have actually seen the incidents myself, and I am giving the facts in as unbiassed a way as possible.  I trust that the Minister will realise that the conditions there are not what they should be and that he will institute inquiries and see that matters are remedied.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brady has spoken not only with the force and eloquence which we who opposed him on platforms knew him to possess, but also at some length.  This is an evil&mdash;I agree with Deputy Brady that it is an evil&mdash; but it is not confined to Clondalkin.  It is a consequence of the present licensing law, which makes it possible for people <Col N="885" /> who wish to do so to make a pilgrimage on Sundays in search of drink.  The remedy cannot solely be found in prosecutions by the Guards, which prosecutions would probably be attended by only small fines, but in a revision of the licensing law which will give reasonable opening hours on Sundays and make them uniform in the cities and in all districts in the neighbourhood. Then you would get away from this rushing out to suburban districts to get drink.</P>

      <P>If I can anticipate the reply of the Minister, I desire to point out that there is a simpler remedy in his hands than that which Deputy Cooper suggested.  Apart from the desirability of having uniform opening and closing hours on Sundays throughout the whole of the Saorstát, or at least in the big cities and their immediate neighbourhood, a suggestion that I think is very desirable and which in my opinion would end the scenes and complaints of which we have heard, namely, that the Minister should instruct the Gárdaí to enforce the present law with normal vigilance and attention, and if he did so they would be able to cope with the situation.  As Deputy Brady pointed out, these people come reeling out of the publichouses through the effects of drink.  Some of them were so drunk that one person, at least, had to be removed to hospital. These people do not become intoxicated inside without drink being served to them there.  Surely, it is a crime to serve these people on licensed premises and allow them to remain there. Instead of visiting the crime on the unfortunate people who cannot control themselves as regards drink, thus becoming a disgrace to civilisation and humanity, it would be better to proceed against those who profit by their weakness and to compel certain publicans, who enjoy certain privileges over and above those possessed by their fellow-tradesmen, to conform with the law, thus making certain <Col N="886" /> that the privileges given to them will not be abused.</P>
      <P>I think much of the ground for complaint would be removed if the licence-holders themselves were careful not to serve people who are under the influence of drink.  This question of serving those who were formerly known as bona-fide travellers is a very vexed one. It is a traffic which is very difficult to handle.  It is a traffic with which most self-respecting publicans do not want to have anything to do.  I think that Deputy Brady was speaking from the book, speaking accurately, when he said that most self-respecting publicans view that traffic with great disfavour and are strongly opposed to its continuance. It can only be handled without abuse by publicans who are scrupulous not to serve persons under the influence of drink or permit such persons to remain on their premises.  If the fact were known that that would be the attitude adopted by publicans in places like Clondalkin, I am certain that most of the attraction which places like Clondalkin possess for the Sunday drunkard would be removed and people would not be tempted to go out there sober and come back drunk.  The real cause of the scandal is the fact that they are permitted to get drunk in these villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The residents in the district who have the misfortune to be subjected to these scenes are very strongly opposed to the continuance of these concessions to the local publicans.  Such people have responsibilities to themselves and their families, they have to live in these villages and they are entitled to be protected against such abuses, so that persons living in Clondalkin should be as immune from them as persons living, say, in Rathmines or Dun Laoghaire.  If there is no other way of protecting them then the special concessions which have been granted to publicans in such districts ought to be removed.  The Minister in his reply to Deputy Brady's question stated that the Superintendent of the Guards had received complaints from two clergymen in the district.  I am perfectly certain that complaints of that description were not lightly lodged by these two gentlemen and that there must <Col N="887" /> have been strong reasons that compelled them to lodge such complaints. If I understood the Minister aright, the fact that after the complaints were made the conditions improved is in my opinion a very telling indictment against the Guards.  If the conditions improved after the complaints were lodged then surely the conditions that prevailed prior to that were unjustified.</P>

He can also instruct officers of his Department to investigate the conditions in Clondalkin.  I would like the Minister, in his reply, to say whether he is prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Brady to a certain extent has done a good deal of useful service in bringing up this question, though I wish that the case which he and Deputy MacEntee have put had been put a little more moderately, with less inclination to find fault with persons they dislike, and with a little more effort to see what might be done to obviate what is undoubtedly a very trying state of affairs to the inhabitants, not only of Clondalkin, but, as Deputy Cooper pointed out, also to persons in Lucan and other places in County Dublin.  There can be no doubt that persons who live in some of these, what I might call semi-suburban villages, have on Sundays got to endure a very unpleasant state of affairs. These are quiet little villages, pleasant to live in, and on Sundays they are invaded by a pack of trippers who behave themselves in a very improper fashion, who are noisy and rowdy, who sing songs on the street and make the whole village extremely unpleasant. That is a very disagreeable state of affairs for the inhabitants of these villages, and if I were living in one of these villages I am perfectly certain that I would be seething with indignation against those persons who interfere with the ordinary amenities of my life for an hour or two on a Sunday evening.  If the Deputies had stopped there&mdash;and I am entirely with them so far&mdash;I think they probably would have helped their case a great deal more than they have now done, because, in my opinion, the way in which this evil can be checked, if not entirely crushed, is only by force of public opinion.  By concentrating public opinion on this, in a quiet fashion, I think it might do a great deal to stop it, but the Deputies, however, have gone further and have attacked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that it is not a question merely of the amenities of life being disturbed, but of scenes of positive indecency taking place in this village and immediate neighbourhood.  People who have to bring up families there are subject to these atrocious conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are any acts of public indecency, <Col N="889" /> acts of gross indecency in a public place, then it undoubtedly becomes the duty of the Guards to arrest the people who commit these acts of gross indecency. I have not evidence that any gross indecency is taking place there. There has been no such case made, nor did Deputy Brady make the case that acts of gross indecency were taking place in Clondalkin.  What Deputy Brady stated was that there were persons there who were very disorderly. He also said that there were women whose reputation&mdash;I might put it this way&mdash;is very shady who frequent Clondalkin.  I think that is highly probable, but they cannot be arrested, or they cannot be dealt with by the police, no matter what their reputation may be or no matter what conclusion you may draw from their appearance as to their profession.  The Guards cannot deal with these women.  They cannot arrest them unless they become drunk. There was one case of a woman there who certainly was very drunk on a particular occasion.  She was arrested and brought to the barracks and made a very great scene.  That was the case which occurred on the 11th June, which caused the letter written by those two clergymen.  The Guards did what they could on that occasion.  This woman was brought to the barracks, and on the next day she was convicted of window-breaking in the city.  She served a month's imprisonment, and the charge of being drunk in Clondalkin is still hanging over her head.  She will be prosecuted for that.  What else could the Guards do?  They found this woman misbehaving herself on the streets.  She was very drunk.  They brought her to the barracks and she created a considerable scene, which looked very bad. There are a number of people who go to Clondalkin who are undoubtedly under the influence of drink, who are what one, to use a colloquial term, might call &ldquo;tight,&rdquo; but unless they are drunk and incapable or drunk and disorderly the Guards cannot arrest them.  When the Guards find persons in that condition they do arrest them. I understand that last Sunday, the day on which Deputy Brady was in Clondalkin, four arrests were made of persons <Col N="890" /> who were drunk, and these were the only cases which the Guards saw.</P>

I can assure Deputies that the Guards have looked into the matter very carefully; they are doing everything which they can do to keep this down, not only in Clondalkin, but in various other villages in which the same class of complaint has been made.  They are doing everything they can to keep those places in order.  Lucan has not received the same advertisement that Clondalkin has received.  Possibly Deputy Brady spends his Sunday round Clondalkin and not around Lucan. From what I gather, because I received complaints from other quarters, if <Col N="891" /> Deputy Brady visited Lucan we possibly would have a question on the adjournment about Lucan.  However, the Guards are quite alive to the evil and they are doing whatever they can, but all the Guards can do is to arrest persons who are breaking the law, who are a nuisance, having sing-songs on the public streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>About visiting the premises.  As a matter of fact here the premises are very carefully visited and the hours that it is necessary to visit the premises in Clondalkin are between 8 and 9, because Clondalkin, like Lucan and other places, is one of those villages or townships in which the hour has been extended to nine o'clock.  I might just inform Deputy MacEntee, if the newspapers are correct in reporting him, that he made a slip of the tongue yesterday, because he was reported to have said &ldquo;Clondalkin publicans are entitled to open an hour earlier and remain open an hour later.&rdquo;  The law is that the publichouses on Sundays can remain open from 1 o'clock until 8 unless there is a special order made by the District Justice, in his discretion, which enables those publichouses to remain open from 2 o'clock until 9.  The two publichouses in Clondalkin remain open from 2 o'clock until 9.  They have that special arrangement.  They do not open at 1; they open at 2, and remain open from 2 o'clock until 9.  As a matter of fact when the first application was made for an extension from 2 to 9 the Guards opposed it, but when it was given to one of the licensed premises the Guards did not oppose it in the case of the other licensed premises, because <Col N="892" /> it was obviously better as there were only two publichouses in Clondalkin that one should not be open from 1 o'clock to 8 and one from 2 to 9.  They are both now open from 2 to 9.  That had the effect of bringing some persons who had been in the 8 o'clock closing area into the 9 o'clock area.</P>
      <P>That is a matter in which I have no jurisdiction.  It is difficult for the District Justice to decide the bona fide needs of travellers.  I have no reason to think that the District Justice did not decide what he really thought was best in this particular matter, but as far as the administration of the law is concerned I have gone into these reports very carefully and have satisfied myself that the Guards are doing what can be done to check breaches of the law, but to check unpleasant things which are not breaches of the law the Guards cannot do it, though I have a great deal of sympathy as I have stated with the persons who live in all those townships and I can quite understand Deputy Brady's attitude.  Deputy Brady sees things which are very annoying.  He does not think the thing completely out but says why does not the Government stop it.  There is nothing the Government can do or the Executive can do to stop unpleasant scenes which they are not doing, but a huge number of things take place that simply we are powerless to deal with.  The collection of a large number of people at a place, the tripper element and an objectionable class of tripper, the Sunday tripper going to a place, will always make the place very unpleasant for the persons who reside in it, but until they make active positive breaches of the law they cannot be interfered with.</P>
