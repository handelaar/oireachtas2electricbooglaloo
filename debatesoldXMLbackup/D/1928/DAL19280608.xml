      <P>I submit that this raises a very serious matter, for when the Minister was introducing the Bill and speaking on the Second Stage, he said that was the purpose of the Bill, and when he was introducing a matter of that kind the House should be prepared to take his word for it, and they did, apparently, take his word for it, that the purpose of the Bill was to enable changes in the rates of charges for telegrams to be given effect to.</P>

      <P>The debate on the Second Reading was on that basis. When the Bill was going through the Committee Stage there was an amendment down in the name of Deputy Cole to the effect that the number of words that could be sent for ? should be increased from twelve to eighteen.  That amendment was not moved.  I think it is very probable some other Deputy might have introduced a similar amendment if Deputy Cole had not tabled his. They were prevented from doing so by the fact that Deputy Cole had tabled his amendment and did not move it.  An Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled that no other Deputy could move the amendment at that stage, and the matter went by the default.  I hope that the Bill will be recommitted in order to give some Deputy the opportunity of reintroducing the amendment Deputy Cole did not move, to enable a discussion to take place upon it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to know if he can move to re-commit the Bill.  Standing Order 91 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the Order of the day being read for the consideration of a Bill on Report, the Dáil shall proceed to consider the same unless a motion is made to re-commit the Bill either wholly or in respect of certain sections: Provided. however, that a motion to re-commit may be made at any time during the consideration of a Bill on Report.</P>
      <P>Standing Order 92 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a motion to re-commit a Bill be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after <Col N="309" /> permitting an explanatory statement of the reasons for such re-committal from the Deputy who moves, and a statement from a Deputy who opposes any such motion, respectively, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note there &ldquo;the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement.&rdquo;  Will there be opposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in moving that the Bill be re-committed is because of the fact that an amendment which occurred to a number of Deputies on this side was tabled by Deputy Cole but was not moved by him.  We did not table a similar amendment because of the fact that Deputy Cole's amendment appeared on the Order Paper.  When he did not move that amendment we were not permitted to do so.  We would be anxious to have a discussion on the amendment in Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order appears to provide for what has actually happened&mdash;a motion to re-commit a Bill, an explanatory statement from the Deputy who moves for the re-committal, and a statement opposing.  The Ceann Comhairle may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon. There appears to be given a discretion to the Chair as to whether the Chair will or will not put the question thereon.  In this particular instance, the question is largely one of order. An amendment was put down on the Committee Stage of the Bill, but that amendment was not moved.  Deputy Lemass now desires to re-commit the Bill because he wishes to consider that amendment in Committee.  But it was, in fact, open to any Deputy who wished to put down an amendment in the exact terms of Deputy Cole's amendment. to do so on the Report Stage.  Since Deputy Cole's amendment had not been defeated, an identical amendment <Col N="310" /> would have been in order and could have been moved on the Report Stage. As no such amendment appeared on the Paper, and since no notice of such amendment has been given, I cannot see that it would be reasonable to put the motion for the re-committal of the Bill now.  The Ceann Comhairle, therefore, refuses to put the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason which the Minister for Finance gave in justification of this additional charge for telegrams was that the loss on the Post Office of £150,000 last year would be reduced by £69,000 this year. Deputies will remember that in the discussion upon the Second Reading of the Bill a number of Deputies expressed grave doubts as to whether or not any saving would result from the additional charge.  It was contended that the result of the increased charge would mean such a decrease in the use of the telegraphic service that the estimated saving would not materialise and that, in fact, it was possible a much greater loss would result than did, in fact, result last year.  The telegraph service is one that has shown, in respect of inland telegrams at any rate, a continuous decline during the last five years.  It is, however, to be remarked, as I pointed out on the <Col N="311" /> Second Reading of the Bill, that the rate of decline has gradually been slowing up.  Figures which have been made available for us by the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs indicate that was so.  In the case of foreign and Press telegrams the figures indicate that instead of a decline there has been a steady increase.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that in one respect, at any rate, the statement concerning this service which he submitted in reply to a question by Deputy Good on the 16th May last, was incorrect and that the figures given in relation to Press telegrams did not refer to telegrams at all but to the number of pages of telegrams which were handed in.</P>
      <P>In the year 1923-24, the number of inland telegrams handed in at the post offices in the Saorstát was 3,676,521.  The number of telegrams handed in for the year 1924-25 was 3,425,392, representing a decrease on the previous year of approximately 250,000 telegrams.  In the year 1925-26 the number of inland telegrams handed in amounted to 3,193,541, a decrease on the amount of the previous year almost equal to the amount by which the previous year had been less than 1923-24, but not quite as great a decrease.  In the year 1926-27, the number of telegrams handed in was 2,991,667, and in the year 1927-28 the number handed in was 2,904,980, which represented a decrease of only 87,000 in the previous year as compared with the decrease of 250,000 between the years 1924-25 and 1923-24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does appear from these figures that in respect of inland telegrams some possibility exists of the figures remaining stationary in the course of a couple of years if this additional charge is not imposed.  The graph representing the decrease would be a curve and not a straight line, and a curve which if it continued as at present would ultimately straighten out.  Also as against the decline in inland telegrams we have to put the fact that in respect of foreign telegrams and press telegrams there has been a continuous increase. <Col N="312" /> In 1923-24 the foreign telegrams handed in numbered 36,639.  In the year 1924-25 the number increased to 43,725, an increase of almost 7,000.  In the year 1925-26 the number of telegrams handed in for foreign parts was 48,519, an increase of about 5,000; in the year 1926-27 the number was 57,463, an increase of almost 9,000; and in the year 1927-28 the number of telegrams handed in for foreign places at the Post Offices in the Saorstát was 55,885.  The same applies to press telegrams, but I do not propose to quote the figures relating to press telegrams because to an extent the figures have been admitted to be inaccurate.  The total number of telegrams handed in at the Post Office show a steady decrease, a decrease amounting almost to 700,000 during the five years.  The figures are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For the year 1923-24 the total number of telegrams handed in was 3,759,709.  For the year 1924-25 the total number of telegrams handed in was 3,506,165.  For the year 1925-26 the total number of telegrams handed in was 3,223,128.  For the year 1926-27 the total number of telegrams handed in was 3,083,292.  For the year 1927-28 the total number of telegrams handed in was 3,002,217.</P>
    <P>It is contended by the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs that the losses on the telegraphic service are due to the fact that there has been a steady replacement of the service by the telephone, particularly in Dublin, and in similar districts, thus depriving the telegraphic service of the short-distance messages which are the most remunerative part of their business. It does, however, appear that the decrease in the number of telegrams handed in at the Post Office in Dublin for example, is only proportionate to the decrease throughout the rest of the country and that the explanation for the loss in the service, a loss which has been continuously reduced, is not that stated by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.  The number of telegrams handed in at post offices in Dublin, exclusive of Press telegrams&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the year 1926-27 the number of telegrams handed in at the post offices in Dublin only exclusive of Press telegrams was 742,694.  In the year 1927-28 that number had decreased to 710,897.  It will be seen from that that although there has been undoubtedly a decrease in the number of telegrams handed in at post offices in Dublin, the decrease was only proportionate to the decrease throughout the rest of the country.  I read for the benefit of Deputies the total figures in respect of the rest of the country.  If they have forgotten them I am prepared to read them again, but the fact does remain that while there has been a decrease between the year 1927-28 as compared with the year 1923-24 of slightly less than 200,000 in Dublin, the decrease in <Col N="314" /> respect of the rest of the country was 700,000 during these five years.  But in fact the volume of trade handed in in Dublin is just one-third of the volume of trade in the rest of the country.  It indicates that the decline in Dublin has not been at any greater rate than in the rest of the country.  That fact is also borne out by the figures in respect of the receipts of expenditure in connection with the service.  At least it is by the figures in connection with the receipts. It is not borne out by the figures in connection with the expenditure. When I come to these figures I hope to be able to indicate that the saving of £69,000 which the Minister hopes to get as a result of the increased charges can be secured if a saving on the service was effected in Dublin proportionate to the decline in the service.</P>
      <P>In the year 1923/24 the receipts from the telegraphic service in Dublin were £63,890; in the year 1924/25 the receipts were £62,360; in the year 1925/26 the receipts were £60,276 and in the year 1926/27 the receipts were £54,984. In the year 1927/28 the receipts were £53,256.  The figure for the year 1923/24 was £63,890 and for the year 1927/28 £53,256, representing a loss of some £10,600 in the City of Dublin &mdash;a decrease, not a loss.  In the rest of the country the receipts for the year 1923/24 were £202,317; for the year 1924/25 the receipts were £197,473; for the year 1925/26 the receipts were £190,875; for the year 1926/27 the receipts were £174,110 and for the year 1927/28 the receipts from the telegraphic service for the rest of the Saorstát outside Dublin were £168,644, representing a total decrease in the receipts of some £34,000 as between 1923/24 and 1927/28.</P>
      <P>Thus it will be seen that while the receipts from the service of the rest of the Saorstát decreased by a sum of £34,000 out of a total trade represented by the figure £168,000, the decrease in Dublin was only £10,000 out of a total trade represented by the figure £53,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I thought it extraordinary myself that it could have been left by any Standing Order to the discretion of the Chair to prevent a division on any question, and when I read this rule originally it seemed to me that it gave the Chair discretionary power simply as to the number of speakers.  That was the interpretation I had until the Chair ruled otherwise. On re-reading the paragraph in Standing Order 92 I thought that possibly the Chair was right in its interpretation, but on reading it a second time and comparing it with a similar power given under Article 82 in regard to the First Stage of a Bill, I am inclined, in fact, I am certain, so far as my own mind is concerned, that my first interpretation was correct.  You will notice that in Article 82 we have precisely the same words used in regard to the First Stage.  I had better read the whole of Article 82 and Article 92 in order to compare them.  Article 82 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When a Bill is to be initiated in the Dáil, the title of the Bill, and a short description of its purpose, prepared by the proposer, and accepted by the Ceann Comhairle, shall appear on the Order Paper.  The Deputy giving notice shall move for leave to introduce the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now this is the point:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If such a motion be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement from the Deputy who opposes the motion, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.  If leave to introduce the Bill be given, an Order shall be made for its Second Reading, and the Bill shall be printed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has it ever been suggested that the phrase, &ldquo;if he thinks fit,&rdquo; meant giving power to the Chair to prevent a <Col N="316" /> question being put, or to say that the procedure on the Fourth Stage is different from that on the First?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;If a motion to re-commit a Bill be opposed, the Ceann Comhairle, after permitting an explanatory statement of the reasons for such re-committal from the Deputy who moves, and a statement from the Deputy who opposes any such motion, respectively, may, if he thinks fit, put the question thereon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The words are precisely the same in both cases and we always had the interpretation, so far as I know, as regards the first part meaning that the discretion given to the Chair was simply that of permitting further speeches or not&mdash;that is, restricting the debate.  The Chair in Article 92 takes up an extraordinary position, that is, it is assumed that the occupant of the Chair could prevent the House from deciding by division on any question before it.  I hold that nobody drawing up Standing Orders would think for a moment of giving the Chair such power.  I hold that if we take these two Articles together the ruling of the Chair in respect to re-committal is contrary altogether to what has been the interpretation, by practice and common sense, of Article 92.</P>

      <P>A decision has already been given on the interpretation of Standing Order 92, <Col N="317" /> and there is no reason now why that decision should be altered.  The position in regard to re-committal on the Report Stage is altogether different to that on First Reading.  That particular point of order cannot be re-opened now.  It may arise again when a motion is made to re-commit a Bill under Standing Order 92.  The question which the Deputy is arguing now may then be put and an endeavour made to get the Chair to alter the decision given in this particular instance. The decision given in this particular instance must stand.</P>

      <P>I quite understand the position of the Chair.  I know it is awkward when one has to give a decision on the spur of the moment.  For instance, when I read the Standing Order rapidly at first I thought that the Chair was taking the natural interpretation of it.  I hold, however, that this is a very serious matter which affects the privileges of the House as a whole.  I suggest that the Chair should give the earliest opportunity of reconsidering that matter.</P>

I hold that the proper thing to do would be to admit that there was an interpretation which was more consistent with the practice under another Article, and <Col N="318" /> permit the question of re-committal to be discussed.</P>

      <P>There are two entirely different considerations arising under the two Standing Orders.  The position is now, a decision having been given, that that particular matter is closed.  If the Deputy considers that any consequences flow from that decision, as soon as the consequences actually arise that matter could be raised as a point of order. Nothing can happen until a decision of the Chair is again called for on Standing Order 92, and when that point arises it can be argued, but we cannot go back on the decision given already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Deputies have not lost the thread of the argument which I was making to show that the additional charge proposed by this Bill is not justified.  If any Deputy thinks that it will be necessary for me to go over all the figures again I am prepared to do so.  A couple of Deputies <Col N="319" /> here are anxious that I would do so.  If it is necessary I will.  I hope to be able to indicate that the charge is not justified on the strength of arguments other than those I have already advanced.  It has been shown that the loss on the telegraph service is not due to the main cause advanced by the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary.  As I stated, it was their contention that the loss on the telegraph service exists and will exist because in and around Dublin and the big towns the telephone is interfering with that service, and the telegraph service is losing the most remunerative part of its business.  I have shown on the figures supplied by the Parliamentary Secretary that the decrease in receipts from the service in Dublin is no greater than that for the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to admit that these figures as all the figures which we receive, in respect of the Post Office service are disputable.  Their accuracy can be impunged.  In fact some of the figures in respect of Press telegrams, which I read, are admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary to be inaccurate. Although we find that the decrease in the number of telegrams sent and the receipts from the service in Dublin are smaller in proportion to the decrease both in the number of the telegrams and the receipts from the rest of the country, the expenses of the service in Dublin have not decreased in proportion to the decrease in the expenses of the service throughout the rest of the country.  It is in this respect that I hope to be able to indicate that the £69,000, which the Minister optimistically hopes to get as a result of the increased charge, can be certainly obtained in another way and cannot be obtained in the way which it is sought. The expenses of the telegraph service during the five years ending the 31st March, 1928, were as follows: For Dublin city alone, the expenses of the service in 1923-24 were £152,600, in the year 1924-25 the expenses were £144,600; in the year 1925-26 the expenses were £136,800; in the year 1926-27 the expenses were £129,300; in the year 1927-28 the expenses were £124,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen therefore that the decrease <Col N="320" /> in the expenses in the service, in Dublin city, taking the year 1927-28 as compared with the year 1923-24, was only £26,000, taken in comparison with the figure of £124,000 which represents the total expenditure.  In the rest of the Saorstát however the expenses of the telegraph services in the year 1923-24 were £457,935.  That figure had decreased in the year 1924-25 to £293,740. It further decreased in the year 1925-26 to £277,794.  For the year 1926-27 the figure is £274,789 and for the year 1927-28 the figure is £277,100.  The decrease in the expense of the service for the rest of the Saorstát during these five years was almost £180,000.  We must take that figure in relation to the figure of £277,000, which represents the entire expenditure on the services throughout the rest of the Saorstát.  It will be seen therefore that the decrease in the number of telegrams handled and in the receipts of the service has proceeded in Dublin district proportionately to the rest of the country.  There has been no greater decrease in Dublin than in the rest of the country.  It will also be seen that while there has been practically no decrease in the expenditure on the service in Dublin, there has been nearly 50 per cent. of a decrease in the expenditure throughout the rest of the country.  The total expense of the telegraph services for the five years is as follows: For the year 1923-24 £610,535, for the year 1924-25 £438,370, for the year 1925-26 £414,594, for the year 1926-27 £404,089, for the year 1927-28 £401,600.  These figures as I said prove conclusively that the main excuse for opposing the increased charge, which was advanced during the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill and during the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, is not founded on fact.</P>
    <P>I have already stated that these figures must of course be taken very largely with a grain of salt because we have found that figures supplied in respect of the Post Office varied considerably and cannot be used as a reliable basis on which to calculate the position of the Post Office.  The Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs stated that the average cost per telegram was ? of which I think the <Col N="321" /> senders paid on the average 1/1½ and the State paid the balance, 1/3½.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, however, has been apparently supplied with different information because he stated on the Second Reading of the Bill that the average cost of a telegram handed in at a Saorstát post office was 2/7, a difference of 2d. and he stated that the average receipt per telegram was 1/3½.  His calculation of the loss per telegram was the same as that of the Parliamentary Secretary but as regards the actual receipts per telegram his calculation is 2d. more than the calculation of the Parliamentary Secretary. Now we propose to increase the minimum charge for telegrams to ?.  This Bill proposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The charges to be fixed under Section 2 of the Telegraph Act, 1885 for the transmission of ordinary written telegrams throughout Saorstát Eireann shall uniformly and without regard to distance be at a rate not exceeding one shilling and sixpence for the first twelve words of each ordinary written telegram or for each ordinary written telegram of less than twelve words (counting as part of such twelve words the names and addresses of the sender and addressee of the telegram) and not exceeding one penny for each additional word over twelve words, but the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, direct that an additional sum of sixpence shall be charged in respect of telegrams handed in for transmission on Christmas Day, Good Friday, or Sunday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of the passing of this Bill will be that the minimum charge for the sending of a telegram in Saorstát Eireann will be ?, whereas formerly it was 1/-.</P>

It immediately <Col N="322" /> becomes the maximum price and if we decide that the charge for telegrams must not exceed ?, is there any Deputy who believes that he will get it for ??  I do not think there is. I do not think so.  In fact the Minister stated when introducing the Bill&mdash;I will read what he said&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, this is an entirely new part.  He said: &ldquo;We feel that too much is being expended out of general taxation.  It is proposed, as I indicated, to increase the minimum charge from 1/- to ?.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Although the Bill only authorises the Minister to fix a charge not exceeding 1/6, he has already declared his intention to fix the minimum charge at 1/6.  We find that the State is faced with a loss of 1/3½ per telegram. On the calculation of the Minister for Finance, the average cost of sending a telegram is 2/7.  The average receipt per telegram is 1/3½. It is to be presumed, if there is no decrease in the number sent, that the average receipt per telegram after this Bill has become law will be, not 1/3½, or 1/6, but 1/9½.  Some Deputies appear to dissent from that calculation. I hope before the Bill passes the Report Stage they will indicate in what way that calculation is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>If the calculations of the Minister for Finance are correct, the average receipt for telegrams should be 1/9½ after the passing of this Bill.  If that is wrong, I should like to be shown where it is wrong.  I presume that there will be no increase in the average cost of sending a telegram, if the number sent remains stationary, and that the average cost will remain as at present, 2/7.  There will then be a loss of 9½. per telegram, and the State will have to subsidise the service by an amount which I calculate to approximate to £110,000.  Three million 9½ds. comes to about £110,000.  If the loss in the service was £150,000 last year, as stated by the Minister, and if the loss this year is to be £110,000, it is quite obvious that the gain to the Exchequer from the passing of this Bill will be £40,000 and not the £69,000, on which the Minister is reckoning.  From the figures I have read out, and which I am prepared to read out again if necessary, it will be seen that if the expenses of the service had been decreased <Col N="324" /> in Dublin, in proportion to the decrease in the expenses of the service throughout the rest of the country, that gain of £40,000 could have been already secured in great measure without any additional charge.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to do more than increase the maximum charge for telegrams from 1/- to 1/6.  It proposes that on Christmas Day, Good Friday and Sundays an additional sum of 6d. shall be charged in respect of telegrams handed in for transmission.  No argument was advanced as to why it is necessary to charge that additional sum, and no figures were given which would indicate that any increased saving would result, or that there would be any benefit to the Exchequer in consequence of the enactment of the measure in that respect.  Is it the intention of the Department to ensure that telegraph offices will remain open on Christmas Day, Good Friday and Sundays for the receipt of telegrams? If they are shut I do not see that any useful purpose is to be served by announcing that an increased charge will be imposed, when it will not be possible to send a telegram for love or money. It is possible that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to inform us that the post offices will remain open on these days and that the ordinary telegraph service will be conducted at the increased charge imposed.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) states that: &ldquo;In this section the expression &lsquo;written telegram&rsquo; includes a telegram received at a post office by telephone in order that it may be delivered as a written telegram.&rdquo; I should like to know if that sub-section is necessary.  Was it not fixed by the telegraph Act of 1885 that the expression &ldquo;written telegram&rdquo; did in fact include a telegram received at a post office by telephone in order that it might be delivered as a written telegram? Certainly there has been the usual charge imposed in respect of a telegram received in that manner in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) states that: &ldquo;Paragraph 1 of the proviso of Section 2 of the Telegraph Act of 1885, and subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Post Office and Telegraph Act of 1920 are hereby repealed.&rdquo;  I regret that we did not hear from the Minister, when <Col N="325" /> introducing the Bill, or from the Parliamentary Secretary, when apologising for it, to what these Acts relate.  I regret that I did not notice them in the Bill myself, or I might have produced a copy of the Acts referred to for the purpose of informing the House concerning them.  If, however, it is the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary or Minister to reply, I hope he will be able to inform the House what exactly the House is doing when it passes that sub-section.  I hope there are no Deputies who are going to vote for a sub-section in a Bill that they do not understand, and that, as elected representatives, they will know clearly what exactly is being done when that sub-section is being passed before they vote for it.  It is a very bad principle that Deputies should vote for a Bill or a section about which they know nothing. I myself intend to vote against the Bill because that sub-section is in it and I know nothing about it.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will realise that it is his duty to the House, to Deputies on the far side as much as to Deputies here, to inform them as to what that section means.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Telegraph Act, 1928.&rdquo;  I think that Section 2 is in need of alteration.  It says &ldquo;this Act may be cited.&rdquo;  I wonder if it could not be made mandatory. It says that it &ldquo;may&rdquo; be cited as &ldquo;the Telegraph Act of 1928.&rdquo; If Deputies had to read the long title on every occasion it would mean a waste of time.  I hope for the reasons I have given, and for other reasons, that will occur to other Deputies that this Bill will be rejected at this stage. First, because it increases the charge and is not going to benefit the Exchequer; second, because the increased charge by resulting in a decrease in the use of the telegraph service, may result in an increased loss to the Exchequer; and, thirdly, because no explanation is given in reference to an important section of the Bill and Deputies are in the dark concerning it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has taken great pains to try to point out to the House many of the reasons why we on this side object to the passing of <Col N="326" /> the Bill.  But there is one point that I would like to draw the attention of the Deputies to, and it is this: We had a discussion not so many weeks ago on the Dental Bill and Deputies tried to impress the House with the difficulties that might arise where certain arrangements made for citizens of Saorstát Eireann would not hold good outside and, particularly, in the Six-County Area.  Subsequently it was pointed out that to overcome that difficulty a reciprocal arrangement was made whereby our Dental Register would be recognised in the Six-County Area and in Great Britain and whereby we would in turn recognise the register of these outside areas. Here we have a position where the Minister for Finance, in order to try and make up portion of the loss on the Post Office, decides to change the minimum charge for certain telegrams from 1/- to 1/6.  But what is the position with those people who live on the border of the Six-County Area?  If they want to save an extra 6d., which is the difference in a telegram, all they need do is to go across the border into the Six-County Area and send a telegram, at the old rate of 1/-, into Saorstát Eireann, and we have no means of recoupment.  In fact, not only do we lose the chance of the extra 6d. but we, also, lose the initial amount handed in with the telegram.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has given figures pointing out the continual decrease in the number of telegrams in several areas in Saorstát Eireann.  I think that this change in the minimum price will not only mean less sending of messages by wire, but also because of the increased price the postal authorities in the Twenty-Six Counties will lose a certain amount of customers, if I may use the term, living on the Border who will then take advantage of the postal arrangements in the Six Counties.  I have not the figures as to the actual number of post offices or the number of telegrams handed in in any financial year in or near the Border. Nor have I information as to the number of post offices outside our own border-line, but I think it is a matter that should have been laboured a little more.  Personally, I believe if this <Col N="327" /> Bill is passed, and put into effect, the working of the Act at the end of the financial year will prove that not only will there be a further decrease in the number of telegrams handed in, but it will also be found that the amount realised from telegrams will be far short of the amount that the Minister for Finance expected to make by the change in the minimum charge from 1/- to 1/6.</P>
    <P>I have another objection and it is this: Deputy Jasper Wolfe it was,  think, that pointed out a case in the country which he knew where this change from a minimum of 1/- to 1/6 would result in serious loss.</P>

      <P>I may be mistaken with regard to the Deputy, but there was one Deputy who said he knew an individual in the country to whom this change in the minimum charge from 1/- to 1/6 would mean an extra expenditure of £50 per annum.  I have been making inquiries and I find that particularly those people interested in the export of eggs who have to send out daily a great number of telegrams, will be seriously affected where they have to wire to their agents outside the Twenty-Six-County area, particularly in England, stating the number of eggs they have for sale, the prices, and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know any furniture merchants selling furniture outside.  I feel that this change in the cost of telegrams, while it may not seriously affect those who send out wires of sporting events or congratulatory messages, will fall very heavily on the shoulders of the farming community who are continually in telegraphic communication with agents outside, particularly in connection with the export of cattle, poultry and eggs. Perhaps the Minister for Finance will reassure me on the points I mentioned. <Col N="328" /> He may have arrangements whereby in regard to telegrams handed in in the Six County area or in Great Britain, the extra charge of 6d. will be collected there for the Saorstát.</P>
      <P>I do know this, that where international arrangements are made with regard to postal arrangements, if telegraphic communication in any country is expensive the rates for telegrams from any other country are fixed so that the country receiving the telegram is recouped to a certain extent.  Possibly some arrangement may be made whereby telegrams handed in in England would be charged an extra sixpence there which would come to our Exchequer.  We could again go into the whole administration of the Postal Department, and we could point out that certain sections of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I want to bring in is this: The reason given by the Minister for Finance for this change is because there is a loss on that Department of the Post Office.  I contend that, on account of his having used that as a reason for making a change in the minimum rate, which used to be a shilling but which, if this Bill passes, will be 1/6. that is an argument that can be used again when people who oppose the <Col N="329" /> Bill are speaking on it.  That will be subject to the ruling of the Chair.  But I contend that the Department of the Post Office that is concerned with the telegrams could have been to a certain extent reorganised, and that certain areas which were not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  There is this that I would like to point out: We have already serious difficulties with regard to the telegraphic service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep away from that if it is out of order.  I would like to repeat that I consider quite seriously that this will not have the effect that the Minister anticipates. You are going to impose on people an extra burden of indirect taxation, particularly on people who are burdened enough already.  It will not have the desired effect, from the Minister's point of view, of making up a portion of the deficit that exists in that branch of the postal service.  We do know this, that people who will feel the effect of the extra 6d. will have to change to some other method, if there is another method available, which would be cheaper, and the result will be that we will have extra pressure on the telephones.  We do know that at present, with the increased demand on the telephone service, there is enough pressure on it already, and what will really happen, I believe, is that you will have a greater loss on the telegraph end and greater inconvenience on the telephone end.  If this Bill goes through I would ask Deputies to keep <Col N="330" /> in their minds at the end of the financial year the figures quoted by Deputy Lemass and to ask questions then, compare the results, and see if the Minister will really have done any good in making up the deficiency, or portion of the deficiency, as this Bill is supposed to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying when the <Col N="332" /> debate was adjourned, I am fully convinced of the value, and even of the necessity, of the principal Act.  I have never denied at any time that the principle which that gave effect to was first promulgated by the late Arthur Griffith.  Quite a presentable case might be made out against it, but it is not a case that I should expect to see getting much support from Deputies on the opposite side, any more than from Deputies on the Labour Benches. For that reason, I was rather surprised at some of the speeches that were delivered. It was not with feelings of great gratification and satisfaction that I was responsible for any curtailment of the powers of the best elements of our local bodies, and I might even go so far as to say that up to a certain point I do not regard the exercise of patronage by these local bodies as altogether an unmixed evil.  After all, it is not for nothing that people are elected to positions of influence and authority in their own counties, and, other things being equal, I am prepared to admit that those people who, for one reason or another&mdash;because of long residence in or long association with a district, because of the extent of their holdings, because of their ability as administrators, or even because of the number and the influence of their friends and supporters&mdash;are elected to posts of honour and responsibility, are entitled to special consideration.  I am even prepared to go further and to admit that the larger and more influential ratepayers, the men who are generally elected and who command considerable influence in their respective counties, the people who bear the brunt of local taxation, are entitled to consideration.  They might have an equitable claim to some quid pro quo, if you will, in the shape of patronage, particularly in these days when the whole trend of Government in most European countries is in the direction of piling service upon top of service. The main essential qualification for receiving the benefit is that you should contribute little or nothing towards their upkeep.  As I say, that is not a consideration I would expect to see getting very much support from the opposite Benches.  It was one that weighed heavily on me before I took <Col N="333" /> the responsibility of introducing the Principal Act.  Having weighed up the pros and cons, it seemed to me that this overwhelming argument stands out, that our concern here as public representatives primarily is not to consider what is in the interests of the rich man's son, or of the poor man's son, or of the scion of a long-tailed family, or the parvenu, but rather to concern ourselves in providing the best possible service for the general public, for the ratepayers, large and small.  Judged from that particular standpoint the original Act, in my opinion, left very little to be desired.</P>
      <P>It proved in practice and in theory to be sound.  There has been criticism of the Act; there have been objections made to the Act, and to the working of it, but I have never seen any of these objections substantiated.  I would be glad if any Deputies who know of such were able to bring forward cases to substantiate the objections.  Section 7 of the new Bill which is the kernel of it will, I am convinced, leave matters worse than they were before the present Act was passed.  There are exceptions in local authorities but, speaking generally and frankly, we have to admit that before the principal Act was passed we had a condition of affairs in the country, with regard to local appointments, which might broadly be described as nepotism, with occasional instances of corruption.  If this Bill becomes an Act I believe it will introduce a state of affairs which might more appropriately be described as corruption, with occasional instances of nepotism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no sympathy with the point of view that our local bodies are hot-beds of corruption.  In fact, my whole experience in local government is to the contrary, but most flocks have their black sheep, and it was the weakness of the old system that the good influence of the other members was nullified by the black sheep, even though it was only one black sheep.  Like the chain which is only as strong as its weakest link, the integrity of a council is only as reliable as that of the weakest member.  Section 7 of this Bill is, on first reading, somewhat obscure, but we should not allow ourselves to be deceived.  I do not say it was intentional but, at all events, I <Col N="334" /> may say that it was camouflage, as that section drives a coach-and-four through the principal Act.  It does not matter how it will look in theory.  In practice it will mean that in every case three names will have to be submitted to the local authority, because, on account of the prestige and &ldquo;amour propre&rdquo; of members of local bodies they will insist on getting their full pound of flesh under this Bill.  They will insist in every case of having three names sent down.  Undoubtedly under the Bill these three candidates must be qualified but whereas No. 1 may be 90 per cent. efficient, No. 2 70 per cent., and No. 3 30 per cent., if No. 3 happens to be a local man with local influence, No. 3 will, in the majority of cases be elected. We know that from experience under the old system.  That is not the worst side of it.  If on the other hand, none of the three men happens to be local, or to have local influence, we may take it that some influential or important councillors or representatives who, in the ordinary way, dominate these elections, will take very little interest in them.</P>
    <P>They will be apathetic.  In these circumstances, the pivotal man in the council is going to become the black sheep if there is such a man in that council, and we know that there are some of them left still&mdash;the man who is prepared to sell to the highest bidder, who knows how to pull the wires and get at other councillors.  If he knows his job, and a great many of them do know their job very well, he will, in the great majority of cases, get his candidate elected, because most of the other councillors will vote for the candidate on whose behalf they are canvassed first.  In those cases the highest bidder, generally, is not going to be the candidate with the highest qualifications. The candidate with the highest qualifications will stand on his record and refuse to stoop to the methods that the man with the weaker qualifications will resort to.  The latter is the man who, as a general rule, will be prepared to move heaven and earth to get elected by hook or by crook.  It is that sort of candidate that you will often have elected.  I believe that, if the system proposed under this Bill were to come <Col N="335" /> into operation, it would be thoroughly bad from every point of view.  It would be bad from the point of view of the local bodies because it would put a premium on the worst form of canvassing, on a waste of time and on corruption. It would be bad, too, from the point of view of the candidates themselves, because it would create a situation in the future, such as we had in the past, which would make it impossible, or at all events difficult, to get the best qualified candidates to go forward.  They would refuse to run the risk of being defeated by men with inferior qualifications. What would happen is that these highly qualified men would do what they did formerly, emigrate to foreign countries where their abilities would be likely to be better appreciated. The pity of the whole thing is that under this Bill you would revive the bad old tradition of the past of having inferior men coming forward and getting elected to local positions.  From the point of view of the long suffering general public, the effect of the passing of this Bill would be that the public, instead of getting the best possible service, will very often get the worst from men with mere theoretical and, often-times, only mere technical qualifications.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the principal Act when it was introduced was not altogether a popular measure.  I make bold to say that if I were asked which of the Acts passed during my term as Minister for Local Government and Public Health I was prepared to let my whole political career stand or fall by, I would unhesitatingly say the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.  I say that in spite of the fact that when it was going through the Dáil, owing to the urgency with which it was required and for other reasons, it was necessary to agree to the amendment of several sections of it which I might have preferred to have left as they were.  There were many minor points raised on this Bill before the House which I do not intend to go into because I think they have already been dealt with by some previous speakers. As well as that, I consider that the whole issue is bound up in this particular section.  If this section is carried, <Col N="336" /> then I say that the whole policy of having Appointments' Commissioners should be done away with and that we should revert again to the old system rather than have this half-baked measure which will please nobody and which, I am thoroughly convinced, will do more harm than good.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure that it is not meant to confuse the minds of the supporters of the Government Party both in this House and outside of it. One of the main features of this Bill is, that when a local authority desires more than one name to be sent down by the examining body, then more than one name will be sent down, but if the local authority desires only one name, then only one name will be sent.  The point appears to be lost sight of that no name will be sent down to the local authority if this Bill becomes law except the name of a person fully qualified to fill the position that is vacant. It is quite evident that if the local bodies, as we are asked to believe, are so anxious to avoid canvassing, then under this Bill public bodies anxious to avoid canvassing can do so by asking the examining body to send down only the name of one candidate for a particular position.  The position taken up by the Government Party is that members of public bodies are so corrupt that they cannot be trusted to make public appointments.  That is a rather extraordinary position to take when we consider the extremes to which Ministers and Deputies go at the time of a general election to secure the support of local representatives and to get them on their election platforms.  In view of that, it is rather difficult to come to the conclusion that they are really sincere and honest in all this talk about the corruption of public representatives. I know a fair share about public administration and about the public life of the country, and I say quite deliberately <Col N="337" /> that the corruption&mdash;there may be, and probably is, in isolated cases corruption in public bodies&mdash; practised by public bodies down the country is put in the shade by the corruption that is practised at headquarters. The big difference is that when there is a case of corruption down the country it is exposed and the public get to know about it, but the corruption that is practised at headquarters does not get the same light of publicity on it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has patience he will hear in due course all I have to say on this subject of the Appointments Commissioners.

When we hear Ministers talk about corruption, and that sort of thing, they must think we go around with our eyes closed.

      <P>Is it not a fact that Army pensions were distributed at the time of the election wholesale by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party?  If you want yourselves compared with the elected representatives of the people who carry on the local government of the country, if you challenge them, then you must be prepared to listen to a comparison and to hear the things that can be said about yourselves. When Deputies talk of methods that were adopted in certain districts to secure public appointments some considerable <Col N="340" /> number of years back, they appear to forget that local administration has undergone very considerable changes in recent years.  Formerly, we had boards of guardians in every union area and rural district councils. Judged by the speech made by Deputy Hennessy in this House, the boards of guardians appear to have been the chief culprits in this matter of corruption.</P>
      <P>These boards of guardians, these large unwieldy bodies, have disappeared.  The rural councils have disappeared and the administration of the public health services is almost entirely carried out by boards of health and urban councils, at the present time.  Replacing some hundreds of public representatives we have now ten members selected by the county council, ten of the picked administrators in the county.  I do not know how it can be seriously contended that these ten picked administrators in any county elected on a limited franchise cannot be trusted to fill a public appointment when it is borne in mind, as I said earlier, that under this Bill no name will go before these people unless the name of a person who is fully qualified to fill the position which is about to be filled.  When President Cosgrave was speaking on this Bill he expressed great anxiety about the position of the poor man's son if this Bill became law.  He said in the debate here on Wednesday: &ldquo;What about the poor man's son who had no influence if there be not some premium for talent and capacity to fill these positions.  The Deputy responsible for the Bill has not explained how a poor man's son would secure an appointment on merit alone.&rdquo; It appears to me that if the original Act is not amended by a Bill such as this, the poor man will not take the risks of spending his life's earnings in endeavouring to give a profession to his son or daughter.  Deputy Hennessy supplied the reason in the debate here on this Bill. Deputy Hennessy told us that as a result of the original Act the men are coming forward to fill those positions, and the men who are being placed in those positions by the Appointments Commissioners were men who had taken out post graduate courses and had got high degrees as a result of those post graduate studies.</P>

Deputy Hennessy informs us that the poor will gain as a result of this.  Do we take it from Deputy Hennessy that the medical officers who have been appointed before that Act came into operation&mdash;the dispensary service&mdash;are at the present time the scum of the medical profession?</P>

      <P>It appears to me that a little human kindness and a little intimate knowledge of the conditions in which the poor are living, and the domestic conditions under which they exist, are more important qualifications than any degree or diploma that a medical man may hold.  There is another qualification that Deputy Hennessy did not refer to.  It is an important qualification, an especially important qualification in the matter of local appointments, and that is the moral code of the man appointed.  To my mind, that is in medical appointments especially the most important consideration, and I submit to this House in all seriousness that it is only the local people who are in a proper position to judge of that particular point, inasmuch as they are the persons who are personally familiar with the history of the candidate and his family, and have a knowledge of these matters, which the Appointments Commissioners have not.  Deputy Hennessy suggests here that the people are delighted with the results they have got under the new system of appointments. He suggested they are delighted with the new medical officers that have been appointed under the original Act.  I am afraid that Deputy Hennessy is not well informed on this subject; though he appeared to be reasonably well briefed, I do not think that he is well informed.  We had the case recently of the appointment of a dispensary medical officer in the district of Scotstown. A local man, a native of the county, had been for four or five months, I think, acting as temporary medical officer of that district&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I said, this man was for four or five months practising and doing the duty temporarily in this particular dispensary. He had given absolute and entire satisfaction to the people of the district. Evidence of that satisfaction was submitted to the Board of Health in the form of a very extensively signed memorial requesting the Board <Col N="344" /> of Health and the Department of Local Government and Public Health to retain this man's services.  I have no fault at all to find with the man who was sent there.  But I am not aware that he had any special qualifications unless the fact that during all the years of the national struggle when this other man's family brought themselves down financially in the world owing to their national services, this man all this time conducted his practice in England and that he came back from England to fill this appointment over the other man.  Unless that was a qualification, I do not know what it was.  I know that the Minister for Finance was pressed by his constituents to give an explanation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Hennessy has been in such an agitated state of mind that he has failed to grasp the fact that I have not said a solitary word against the man appointed.  I have no doubt but he is a good practitioner.  I have not a solitary thing to say against him, but it cannot be defended that here you have a man brought back from England after ten years' service there and the local man is sent to the emigrant ship.

There is not a solitary native Irish speaker in the district to which this man has been sent, and when we consider the action of the Minister for Finance regarding your appointment, A Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, to the important position you now fill, you who have not a word of Irish in your head, we see the substance of the arguments about this man being appointed to a district where there is not a solitary Irish speaker&mdash;appointed because he was a native Irish speaker.</P>
      <P>Recently we had a further dispensary appointment in the County Monaghan. I understand the man appointed to that position had been able to take up one of those post-graduate courses that Deputy Hennessy told us about and that he had degrees that the local candidate did not have.  But I do say this that the other candidate has taken his degrees in medicine, surgery and midwifery and he had been four years practising in the town.  That town with a couple of thousand of a population has four doctors in it already.  I do say that it is not good administration to send down another doctor to that area because some one or two of them must go to the wall.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hennessy apparently never heard of the dispensary appointment known as Kilskyre.  He said here in this House that apparently there was no public feeling against this Act as it operates.  I have before me here a letter from the Very Rev. Denis Flynn, P.P., V.G., Kells, County Meath, regarding this appointment and perhaps it would be instructive to Deputy Hennessy and to the other Deputies if the substance of that letter were made known.</P>

      <P>It appears to have made no impression.  Coming from me, the Deputy may perhaps pay more attention to it than when he got this letter through the post.  The letter reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sir,</P>
      <P>Now that the Dáil has reassembled, many of us are looking forward to a critical review of the method of procedure of the body popularly known as the Appointments Commissioners, as well as of the system under which they are supposed to make their selections.  In the event of such a discussion one would like to see reasonable criticism, where such is called for, and it would be a matter to be regretted if every petty grievance&mdash;oftentimes, perhaps, only an imaginary one&mdash; were to be made an occasion of a sweeping condemnation.  As one thoroughly conversant with the circumstances of a particular appointment, and that a quite recent one, I claim the privilege of expressing my views, and I ask a little space in your columns to allow me to do so.  I refer to the appointment of M.O. to the Kilskyre District Dispensary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say, at once, that in any remarks I feel called on to make, I have not the slightest intention of reflecting on the professional skill or personality of Dr. O'Brien Kennedy, and if any words of mine are so construed, I desire, in anticipation, to disassociate myself from such an interpretation. Least of all, would I be foolish enough to close my eyes to the signal services that have been rendered, and that are being rendered by medical men of every persuasion, in the cause of suffering humanity.  Long may such a state of things continue.  All this, notwithstanding, I consider it a duty in the interests of the public good, and in particular in the interests of those who may any day find themselves in a similar situation, to give the circumstances of the Kilskyre case as much publicity as possible that the people may be forewarned as to what they may expect from those who, for the moment, occupy the Chair of Cæsar, should the occupants be permitted to continue, unchecked, in <Col N="347" /> flouting the reasonable and most sacred wishes of those so intimately concerned.</P>
    <P>Kilskyre is a completely rural district, extending over many miles, with its plains, its hillsides and its bogs.  For a district in Meath it is comparatively thickly populated, at least in parts, and without vouching for mathematical accuracy, I would say that upwards of 99 per cent. of its dispensary people&mdash;many amongst them the poorest of the poor&mdash;belong to the Catholic faith.  Will it be believed that whilst there were amongst the aspirants to the position at least one Catholic&mdash;and there may have been many for aught I know&mdash;and this one a doctor who has laboured for three years among the very poor for whom the appointment has been made, and with such striking success that it is only half the truth to say that they have clamoured with singular unanimity for her permanent appointment; will it, I say, be believed that in the face of all these circumstances a stranger has been appointed and, most disappointing of all, one who, by common repute at all events, belongs to another creed?  The matter was not finished in the dark, for long before the day when, under threats of pains and penalties, and representatives of the people were stampeded into giving an unwilling sanction, I have the best of reasons for knowing that the vital circumstance was, to use the exact words of a distingushed intermediary, &ldquo;placed before the proper authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently the consideration was of trivial or of no account.  May I ask if it be of no account, in view of the fact that in the lonely hovel, on the hillside, or in the bog, in cases of premature parturition, in cases of difficult parturition, in cases of weakly births, it is so often the Catholic doctor who does the good Samaritan, and administers the Sacrament of Baptism in the trying circumstances.  We priests are obliged to instruct our people on the absolute necessity of Baptism, on the method of administering it in cases <Col N="348" /> of urgency, and we are especially warned to inform such most likely ministers of the stages of parturition at which it may or should be administered, of the method of doing so, of the form to be used in cases of doubt, and of such other circumstances as may suggest themselves in the concrete.  Our poor people know all this, and just because they know it they have the greatest consolation and the securest guarantee in their hour of trial that when all other hope fails they have about them one of their own creed, who, just because of his professional coolness and his instruction in Catholic principles, will administer the Sacrament in accordance with the minds of the Church to which they and he belong.  I need not refer to kindred considerations nor develop this one further&mdash;who runs may read.</P>
    <P>The poor have few friends, and one would have thought that their own Government, or the Executive of the Government, built up so largely by the sacrifices of their blood and substance, would be the last to inflict such a wanton outrage on their most cherished feelings.  Had the thing happened under an alien Government there would have been a cry of execreation throughout the length and breadth of the land, and the most dependent of the community may well ask themselves to-day, is their last state worse than the first?</P>
    <P>The happening is, in my judgment, a foul blot on the system, or on its Ministers, or on both.  There may have been a necessity for such a body as the Appointments Commissioners; of this I do not profess to be a judge. Jobbery and corruption have, I understand, been alleged.  After fairly long experience, I have not come across it to any appreciable extent, but, even if it were so, better jobbery twenty times over than the concrete, autocratic expression of the principle that the creed of the &ldquo;red-ticket&rdquo; doctor who is called to attend the poor, in circumstances such as I have alluded to, is a matter of no concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> The Government is responsible for the acts of its Executive, and they cannot escape from it even if they would.  Why, then, do such things happen?  Is it that they have eyes to see and will not see; or have those once clear and virile minds become enslaved in the intensive cult of toleration?  I cannot answer these questions, but they are very much in the air.</P>
    <P>Kilskyre is quite an obscure place as places go.  You will probably not find it on the ordinary map, but I venture to say that in the not distant future it will gain an uncomfortable notoriety which it has not hitherto enjoyed.&mdash;D. FLYNN, P.P., V.G.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is fairly conclusive evidence that the appointments that are being made by this body are not just as popular as Deputy Dr. Hennessy would ask this House to believe. Arising out of the same appointment, there was a resolution passed by the Meath County Council.  I am sure the terms of that resolution have been before the Local Government Department. It is an exceedingly long one, and I suppose we can leave it at that. Deputy Dr. Hennessy probably knows all about it, having been the principal spokesman regarding the popularity of the original Act.  It is for his conversion I produce this document.  If he wants to see a copy of the &ldquo;Meath Chronicle&rdquo; containing a report of the debate at the Meath County Council I will oblige him later.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy, in the course of this debate, said: &ldquo;The one thing that surprised me about this Bill is that the Chancellor of the National University should sponsor it, and the fact that he sponsors it is not consistent with his being an efficient Chancellor.  If this Bill is passed into law it will be a very serious thing for the graduates of the National University.&rdquo;  I need not comment further on the Deputy's bad taste, but I would remind him that there are four medical graduates of the National University on these Benches, and these four medical graduates have a better right to speak on behalf of the medical graduates of the National University than he has.</P>

      <P>Recently a new departture has been adopted in the method of selecting people to fill public appointments. I suppose the intention was to popularise it with the followers of the Government Party down the country. I do not know whether it is a universal practice but in my county a local selection board was recently set up.  A vacancy occurred for a matronship in the Monaghan County Hospital and a local selection board was set up to make a selection for the post.  That board consisted of the medical officer of the county home, who was appointed to the county home after the Minister refused to sanction the appointment of a doctor selected by the board of health and who <Col N="351" /> held republican views.  It also had on it the medical officer of the sanatorium who, by a coincidence I suppose, happened to be a sister of the election agent of the Minister for Finance in the last election.  The other member was the State Solicitor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. WARD Dr. WARD">
      <NameTxt>Dr. WARD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the case for what it is worth and the House can put its own interpretation on it.  With a selection board constituted such as that, what chance would any person have for such a post who held republican principles, no matter what his qualifications were?  That board, as I say, comprised the State Solicitor, a sister of the election agent for the Minister for Finance, the medical officer of the county home, appointed as I mentioned, and somebody who is, of course, a true blue, representing headquarters. There is not going to be any confidence in the administration of this Act while that kind of thing continues. I understand that even in connection with the recommendations of that particular selection board very powerful influences are at work to ensure that the person recommended by the board will not be appointed.  We are watching with interest what will happen.  I would suggest that if we are not getting a good public service and if we are not getting the best, second best, or even third best, class of persons to man public posts in local administration the obvious remedy is to raise the standard of qualification, making it sufficiently high so that you cannot have any duds appointed.  You cannot, however, achieve it in the way in which the original Act set out to achieve it.  The ordinary man in the street will not take the risk under existing circumstances, owing to the lack of confidence in the administration of the present Act, of spending his life's earnings in educating his children because he believes that if they have not the necessary pull at headquarters they will not get appointments.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy also suggested that if there were any real grievances amongst the medical profession regarding appointments <Col N="352" /> they should be ventilated through the Medical Association.  That is only begging the question.  It is all humbug to talk about grievances being ventilated through that Association.  The Deputy did not inform the House what percentage of doctors belong to that Association. If he did, it would show the fallacy of his argument.</P>

      <P>Some years ago members of the Executive Council thought considerably more of public representatives than they think now.  When the present President of the Executive Council was Minister for Local Government his views regarding public representatives and public appointments were somewhat different to the views expressed by Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies and by the successors of that Government on the opposite Benches. On the 1st of June. 1920, the Minister for Local Government addressed the public bodies of Ireland in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann greets the newly elected councils and boards of guardians and recognises in the results of the recent elections, carried out under the system of Proportional Representation, further proof of the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of the Irish <Col N="353" /> people to the Government of the Irish Republic.  It is a great honour for the individuals elected to have been chosen by the free vote of an indomitable people to hear the standard in this great rally of an ancient race for its God-given right to liberty.  It is also a great responsibility.  Dáil Eireann is confident that the recently elected councils and boards will become important factors in the nation's struggle for political and economic emancipation, and that they will make every possible effort to efficiently administer local affairs in a manner creditable to the dignity and genius of the Republic. Your council is requested to pass without delay the attached resolution of allegiance to Dáil Eireann that it may be clear to all at home and abroad, to friend and enemy, that the people's representative on local bodies stand with their Parliamentary representatives, solid and uncompromising, on the question of their Country's Independence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will read one paragraph dealing with the question of public appointments.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In filling public appointments in the public service your Council should see that only loyal citizens of the Republic are elected.  Preference should be given to candidates having a knowledge of the Irish language, and subject, of course, to merit and ability, appointments should be filled by promotions in the existing staff of the department in which the vacancy occurs or, failing this, from the staff of some other department under the control of your body.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell criticised the Bill before us as being a bad example of legislation by reference.  Legislation by reference may be very good legislation. There may be no other way of suitably framing a Bill and it may result in the making of excellent laws.  I want to take this Bill from another standpoint, to consider what will be the position if this Bill is carried into effect for the purpose of achieving any object.  The Act, which it is proposed to amend, in Sections 1 and 2 gives us a very complete statement of what is to be regarded as a local authority and very complete provisions as to how appointments that ought to come under this Act should be regulated.  In Section 2, sub-section (1) (a), the section sets out explicitly that the chief executive officer under every local authority shall come within this Act.  The Bill that is before us purports, as a matter of improvement, to amend Sections 1 and 2 of this Act.  If we look at Section 3 of the Bill, it proposes to effect an improvement, but we find that it takes into consideration a desire to secure that certain executive officers or chief executive officers shall come under the scope of this Act, but it takes no cognisance at all of the fact that there is such a thing as a county borough, a rural district, a board of guardians, a port sanitary authority, and commissioners of a town.  It gives no consideration to the fact that such authorities as those named here may set up important committees which will have chief executive officers under them.  It makes no provision to bring these officers under the Act.</P>

    <P>(c)  all other offices and employments under a local authority as the Minister shall from time to time with the concurrence of the Commissioners declare to be offices to which this Act applies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  For one reason or another, or because of forgetfulness, we leave out a county borough.  That may be due to forgetfulness. We also leave out a rural district council, a board of guardians, a port sanitary authority, the Commissioners of a town and all committees. The supporters of the Bill are going to require that the Minister shall individually consider all these matters, and see whether they should come in as a general scheme, whether in the case of a chief executive officer of a town council or of a committee of management of a mental hospital, they ought to be brought under the operations of the Local Appointments Act, or whether they should be dealt with individually. A change has taken place there, and we have not a word as to what improvement there is.  The Bill actually would bring about a chaotic state of affairs in which you would have no uniformity, no clear statement as to what local bodies or officers come completely under the Act.

There is no such animal in the show.  There is no such body in existence as a county committee of technical instruction.

    <P>On receiving such request as aforesaid from the local authority or the Minister (as the case may be) the Commissioners shall select in accordance with this Act and recommend to the local authority for appointment to the said post a person or a panel containing the names of not less than three persons best qualified as requested and when judging qualifications <Col N="357" /> the Commissioners shall consider local knowledge or experience an additional qualification.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners &ldquo;shall select.&rdquo; That is to be introduced into an Act in which the following clause occurs&mdash; Section 8, sub-section (1):&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subject to such exceptions as are or may be made by or under this Act, the Commissioners shall select every person to be recommended by them to a local authority under this Act solely by means of competitive examination conducted according to regulations made by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>That is, that when the Commissioners are told to select they are told that they shall select by competitive examination, except in so far as there are other arrangements made here.  That &ldquo;shall select&rdquo; in this section will be governed by this.  The effect of it, if put in in its present state, would be that in a case where a candidate was selected by examination local knowledge or experience would have to be regarded as an additional qualification.</P>

      <P>This particular section I am quoting from means that in the case of an examination local knowledge and experience should be regarded as an additional qualification. That may or may not be the intention of Deputies on the other side, but, judging by their statements, we must regard it as their intention, because the question as to whether an appointment is to be filled by written examination or other means does not, I am sure, take away from the arguments that they make with regard to the advisability of a person appointed in any area having local knowledge.  From that written examination from which these people shall be selected a panel is to go down.</P>

      <P>Not only have I the Bill to guide me in seeing what the effect of it is going to be, but I also have the speeches of Deputies who supported it, and they are no help to me, good, bad or indifferent.  Whereas Section 7 says that where competitive examination was the machinery for finding out who ought to be recommended to a local authority, you will have to put up a panel of candidates to the local authority; you will have to give better marks or recognition in some other way of local knowledge and experience. Section 9 lays it down:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When for the purpose of filling any post under a local authority a competitive examination is held the name of the candidate who obtained first place in such examination shall be sent by the Commissioners to such local authority for appointment or where there are two or more vacancies the names of such two or more candidates as have obtained highest places in such examination in order of merit and the candidate or candidates <Col N="360" /> so recommended by the Commissioners and no other shall be appointed by the local authority, subject in all cases to the usual regulations as to health and character.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How are you going to reconcile the provision in Section 9 that no other than the first person shall be appointed with the sending down of a panel of candidates to the local body; that is a matter that I cannot suggest a remedy for, but I do suggest that if the sections in this Bill are brought into our legislation there will be simply nothing but confusion.</P>
    <P>Let us pass on to Section 10, which is supposed also to give additional powers to local authorities.  The section reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend to them the names of a person or persons qualified for appointment to an office to which this Act applies and the local authority in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Minister is of opinion that having regard to the knowledge and experience necessary for the efficient performance of the duties and qualifications prescribed under this Act for that office, the person or persons to be recommended as qualified for appointment to that office cannot be satisfactorily selected by competitive examination the Commissioners with the sanction of the Minister may dispense with the competitive examination required by this Act and may select the person or persons to be recommended as qualified for appointment by the local authority by such means and in such manner as they think proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They may dispense with the competitive examination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing they do not think it proper to dispense with them, there is nothing in the Act. as it stands, or as it would be amended by things that are here, to force them to agree with the opinion of the local authority that a competitive examination <Col N="361" /> ought not to be held.  The whole position as disclosed by the Bill leads one to the conviction that there is no clear vision, good, bad, or indifferent, on the part of those who drafted it as to what they intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go back to Section 6, one part of it says that a person with five years' clerical service must pass a qualifying examination before he becomes entitled to promotion or transfer to executive officer under a local authority.  Take the various committees of technical instruction. It has been the practice so far as possible to appoint to the position of secretaries of committees one of the many teachers who have had experience of teaching under those committees. This clause would prevent one of those thousand odd teachers being appointed as chief executive officer under a technical instruction committee.  Is that intended?  Now on the general question of a qualifying examination.  Deputy de Valera has a certain amount of academic and educational experience. Has he made any attempt to visualise what the qualifying examination is going to be like that would enable a clerical officer to come into the running for promotion or transfer?  Take a youth engaged in the Public Library in Capel Street or in the office of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital at the age of eighteen.  What kind of a qualifying examination is to be put up to him that is going to enable him to be a candidate for the secretaryship of the Galway County Council or the Roscommon County Council at the age of 27 or 29?  Would the same kind of qualifying examination entitle a man who is a clerk in a library here in Dublin to be a candidate for the secretaryship of the Galway County Council, or for a position in the Accountancy Department of the Cork County Council, or for the position of secretary to a Board of Health or chief clerk or accountant in a Mental Hospital? Is it going to be the one examination or is there any clear idea, when speaking of the qualifying examination, of what kind the examination is to be? Are we to understand, because it is neither clear from the Bill nor from Deputy de Valera's long contribution to the discussion that where a technical <Col N="362" /> officer is transferred or promoted he must pass a qualifying examination?  If they are not to pass a qualifying examination, I do not see that there is any reason for introducing Section 6, because the local bodies have the same powers under the present Act for the promotion and transfer of officers holding technical and professional qualifications as are embodied in the second portion of this Section 6 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole Bill, if carried into effect and joined up with the Principal Act, would give as contradictory and as absurd a piece of legislation as it would be possible to imagine.  It might certainly raise the confidence of people on local bodies who consider how much more intelligent they might be in drafting legislation than the people up here. But there is no other way in which it could possibly help to meet the situation for the local bodies.  I am driven to the conclusion that there is no clear picture, good, bad or indifferent, in the minds of the framers of this Bill as to what they want.  In the &ldquo;Leitrim Observer&rdquo; of Saturday, May 12, Deputy Holt makes a contribution, in which he says:&mdash;&ldquo;The other matters which the Fianna Fáil Organisation hope to promote if a majority is secured on the local bodies are,&rdquo; and he sets out the sixth as follows: &ldquo;Abolition of Local Appointments Commission, and the restoration to local authorities of the making of all public appointments to offices in their own areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Connaught Tribune&rdquo; of May 19 reports that at the monthly meeting of the Galway Home Assistance Committee at Loughrea a resolution was received from the Kilkenny Board of Health suggesting that the Local Appointments Commission should be done away with.  The Chairman then asked: &ldquo;Has any member any suggestion to make?&rdquo; and a Mr. Jordan, that is Deputy Jordan, said, &ldquo;I would rather a suggestion would come from some other members of the Committee.  I have always held that the elected representatives should have the right to make appointments and ought to be let manage their own house within the house.  I am in favour of the resolution.&rdquo; That statement encouraged the <Col N="363" /> Chairman to say: &ldquo;It seems to me very reasonable.  If we have not power to make little appointments we have no right to be here at all.&rdquo;  So that while we have the introducer of the Bill talking about the undesirability of throwing back upon the local bodies the power of making their own appointments, and while he made some remarks that suggests he has a vision that there will be generally a national service developed for the employees of local bodies, we have a situation in the Party opposite that members have publicly expressed themselves as wanting to wipe out the Local Appointments Commission entirely. It seems to me that the introducers of this Bill are pandering to a desire that exists on the part of some people and on the part of some members of their own Party to destroy the Local Appointments Commission.  In view of the complete absence of vision on their part that their Bill discloses there seems to be no other interpretation to be put upon their action in introducing it.  The Civil Service, as an institution in Great Britain, only dates from the year 1870.  The situation that made it desirable that the Civil Service should be instituted in Great Britain was fully inquired into as early as the year 1854, but the reception that was given to the Report in 1854 was very hostile.  One of the principal officials of the time made the statement when the Report was produced: &ldquo;I am afraid that the world in which we live is not half moralised enough for the acceptance of such a scheme of stern morality as this.&rdquo; It seems to me that the introducers of this Bill are simply pandering to those in the country who are not prepared to accept a scheme of stern morality in the matter of public appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies opposite are pandering to that feeling in the country.  Well, Deputies apparently accept the stern morality of the Civil Service Commission and the stern morality of the written examination.  It is not clear from their Bill whether they do or not, but I have a kind of feeling that they do. <Col N="364" /> As I say, apparently they accept the stern morality of the Civil Service Commission.  As was pointed out, the Civil Service Commission consists of A, B, and C&mdash;three Commissioners. The Local Appointments Commission consists of three, B, C, and D.  In the regulation and discharge of their work Deputies on the opposite Benches apparently accept without suggestion of corruption, inefficiency or otherwise the work of A, B, C, but when they are faced with the work of B, C, and D, using to a certain extent the same staff and working along the same principles, they do not accept that at all, apparently.  I am not convinced at all that they do not accept it, but I say that this is simply pandering, for one reason or another, to the opinions of people who do not accept the stern morality of the Civil Service Commission in the making of appointments. Deputy de Valera has. as I have suggested, in intervention in the debate, all through his statement suggested that corruption surrounds, to a large extent, the work of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  He states that all through the country there is a complaint of corruption. He more or less leaves us under the impression that, having had the advantage of talks with people who acted on selection boards, he is not completely rid of the idea that there is corruption.  That is the impression he has left us under, and he told us that Deputies would give details.</P>

      <P>Personally, I would be very willing not to introduce the question or suggestion of corruption against local bodies in making appointments, and I am not aware that I ever did, but I am certainly prepared to stand over the Act of 1926 as a suitable piece of legislation, enabling us to get proper local services, if there was never corruption in the country at all. So that on the definite kind of suggestion <Col N="366" /> that is made now, that the discharge of their duties by the Local Appointments Commissioners is tinged with corruption, let us get fair and detailed arguments on that, and not the kind of argument that throws back and says: &ldquo;You said yourself that other people were corrupt.&rdquo;  If there can be given here details of corruption or anything that savours of corruption in the making of any particular appointment under the Local Appointments Commissioners, let us have them.  Deputy O'Connell asks that a Select Committee be set up to report and inquire into certain matters in connection with the Local Appointments Commission.  The Minister for Finance has stated his position on that.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that the Local Appointments Commissioners had been working for the last three or four years.  As a matter of fact, the Act was only passed in July, 1926.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case let us get to the actual facts.  The Act was passed in July, 1926, and the Commissioners were appointed in October, 1926.  As far as I know, the first actual appointment made to a position under a local authority by the Commissioners was made in April, 1927, so that the Act has been in operation for about fourteen months.  I doubt whether the Local Appointments Commissioners themselves, or the Department of Local Government, or local bodies, are in a position to say exactly what defects there may be in the Act.  No doubt we all want certain things remedied, but I do not think we are in a position at present to give a complete contribution to a committee that would enable every possible improvement required to be made in the Act.  Following discussions in the House on a particular appointment I have discussed the matter with representatives of the General Council of County Councils, and with representatives of the Local <Col N="367" /> Government Employees.  I asked the General Council of County Councils to review the matter for the next twelve months with a view to considering anything that they might like to draw attention to in the working of this body during that period, and at the end of that time to make suggestions to us that would enable us to set up a committee, such as Deputy O'Connell suggests, with a view to reviewing the whole position.  There is no doubt that some useful matters might be brought out if a committee were set up now, but I feel that the thing would be incomplete. We might be in a position to face the setting up of a committee to review the matter in the autumn when the Dáil has re-assembled.  It would be a more suitable time, perhaps, for all concerned than the present rush period. But the representatives of the General Council of County Councils did not seem anxious to meet me in the matter. They were rather concerned with a particular case, and in that particular case I could not do anything but take the stand which I had taken. I felt, too, after a discussion of this matter with representatives of the local bodies' employees, that they had been misled and confused with regard to the Department's attitude and with regard to the terms of the Act, by the movement of antagonism that has gone on against the Act in the country.  That is quite understandable where there is a big volume of agitation in respect of an institution that has only been working from the point of view of actually making appointments for fourteen months.  Our attitude in the matter is that we must have satisfactory machinery for seeing that the persons who enter the employment of local authorities are fitted for the positions, and that there is fairness and justice to all concerned in the making of these appointments, and we are not prepared to leave anything undone to improve the machinery.  I do not want to deal with a number of absurd points that have been made, points as absurd as some of the actual terms of the Bill itself, but I would like to refer to a few points.  Deputy Ward raised the question of the religion of people <Col N="368" /> appointed to positions under local authorities.</P>

      <P>I listened with very great attention to Deputy Ward. All through his speech he made constant reference to the Minister for Finance, and he gave us instances of cases that had occurred in the County Monaghan.  I do think that he has succeeded in leaving upon this House, both <Col N="370" /> by what we have heard and by what we have seen from him, the impression that it is quite possible that the medical services in the County of Monaghan may be in a very bad way and may require a thorough overhauling and a thorough revision.  I would join with Deputy Ward in making an appeal to the Minister for Local Government to have these services in the County Monaghan which are in the condition that Deputy Ward has described thoroughly overhauled and revised at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I heard from Deputies on the Opposition side&mdash;and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary gave force to the suggestion which came from them in a more aggravated form &mdash;that this was an unpopular Act. There was never a greater mis-statement of fact.  No Act that has been passed since 1922 has been received with more popular favour by every decent man, and by every man and woman in the whole of the Free State who is opposed to jobbery.</P>

    <P>Deputy Ward referred&mdash;I took down his words at the time&mdash;to what he called corruption at headquarters. What is the meaning of that?  We are not children.

Deputies' speeches must be listened to without allusion to other circumstances. Yesterday evening we had on two occasions this kind of thing occurring.  The attitude of the Chair on the matter is, <Col N="372" /> that if this kind of thing is going to become general there can be no such thing as debate.  It would be all personalities, and there is a great deal to be said on a great many sides.</P>

      <P>Having read the letter of the parish priest, the Deputy proceeded to act on it by recommending to us the moral code which should be followed in the selection of a medical officer.  What that amounts to I leave it to the House to say.  I join with Deputy Dr. Hennessy in saying that it is not a good thing for the medical profession to have such a thing said of it in this Assembly.  As I know it does not represent the wishes or the feelings of the majority of the members here.  We have heard Deputies say: &ldquo;Take that sort of thing up to the North of Ireland.&rdquo;  We prefer to keep it here.  The toleration, the good-will, and the freedom from religious bigotry that exist in the Saorstát to-day are a national asset.  Let the Deputy who made it take that particular suggestion up to Monaghan or the North of Ireland, or anywhere else he likes but let him not take from us the national asset which we possess in the toleration and the freedom from bigotry that exist amongst the people of this State. I claim that there is no one in this House more competent to speak on the subject than I am.  Mizen Head, where I come from, is in my constituency, and I have been a member of public boards for over 30 years.</P>

When I ceased to be a member of them, I became an official of at least ten different public bodies, and I assert that there could be no greater tribute to the toleration and the freedom from bigotry that exist in this State than that I should have been appointed by these boards as their solicitor.  I can say this&mdash;I think it only a right and fair thing to say it when I have the opportunity of doing so&mdash;that I never asked one of the members of these boards, directly or indirectly, to vote for me.  They appointed me of their own free will.  No one will suggest for a moment, certainly no member of the Opposition, that I was appointed on the grounds of merit.</P>

      <P>All sides of the House will agree when I tell them that I was appointed, not because of any merits of my own, but appointed by my friends as one who they knew would be loyal to them and would stick to them through thick and thin. It has been suggested to the House that three names should be sent down to the local bodies.  How, in the name of heaven, would that get rid of corruption? Is it suggested that any of the Deputies sitting behind Deputy de Valera who belong to county councils would vote for the man they thought the best of the three?  When I was a member of a public board&mdash;it is a shame for me, I suppose, to have to confess it, but we all know the facts&mdash;I, like the other members, voted for the man I knew best or for the candidate whose friends I knew best, but I never voted for a relative.  I did like everybody <Col N="374" /> else.  It was the common custom.  We all held it to be our duty to vote for the candidate we knew best or whose friends we knew best, but while that was so, we all looked forward to the day when we would be relieved of that responsibility.  Those who were interested in the national cause at the time looked forward to the day when we would have a Parliament and a Civil Service of our own, free and unbiased, and when we could impose that duty on a body such as we have in existence to-day in the case of the Appointments Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Suppose, for instance, a vacancy occurred in the position of rate collector under the Cork County Council, does Deputy de Valera suggest that his followers, who are members of that body, would vote for the best man?  It is a matter of common notoriety that not very long ago a job was put from one rate collector to another at a salary of £850 a year.  One of Deputy de Valera's first lieutenants, who is a member of that council, voted for the man who had that £850.  Some days after, whether or not he was suffering from a sense of remorse for what he had done, he came up to Dublin and went up the back stairs of the Local Government Department with a piteous tale asking that a commissioner should be appointed at once and an inquiry held, and succeeded in dismissing the man for whom he had voted himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The question which I am obliged to raise to-day arises out of the unsatisfactory answer given to a question addressed by me to the Minister for Fisheries, first on the 23rd May, and secondly on the 7th June, with regard to the distribution of the lands of Inchedoney Island, County Cork.  The Minister in his reply avoided the real issue, which was as to whether or not justice was to be done to the evicted tenants who had a clean, just and straight claim to these lands from which they or their predecessors were evicted in the olden times.  The people concerned&mdash;Edward Nugent, Thomas Deasy, Mrs. Mary Mahony, Edward Arundel, Dennis Mahony and James O'Regan, of Clonakilty&mdash;or their predecessors, had been evicted by their landlord from their holdings on Inchedoney <Col N="376" /> Island.  The delay of the Land Commission in dealing with these cases during the last four years is certainly a disgrace to any public Department. We were led to expect when this Government came into power that the claims of these wounded soldiers of the land war would receive first consideration, and that justice would be done to those citizens.  Preceding the revolutionary movement that gave rise to this Government in 1922 we were led to believe that the first claim to the attention of the Irish Government that was set up at that time would be those people who in days when it was not popular to do things sacrificed everything that the tradition of Irish independence might live.</P>
      <P>When this Government had the chance to come to their assistance, when this administration had it in their power to relieve these people, this administration evaded the issue and replied to every advance made by those evicted tenants with quibbles and sneers.  A red tape fashion is a mild way of describing the conduct of whoever is responsible for this discreditable transaction.  I cannot call it anything else.  It is red tape in order to facilitate the award of public property in the Island of Inchedoney to one who had no claim to it, and is inconveniencing and bluffing those who have genuine claims.  I base the case I am about to make on the sworn testimony of one, Edward Nugent, of Clonakilty.  He is a feeble old man, and in view of the fact that he may soon die the matter is urgent, and that is the reason that I have brought this matter to the notice of the Dáil, having regard to my experience in receiving unsatisfactory replics to a claim to justice on behalf of these people which I put through the form of questions.  The facts of all the six cases are practically the same as those outlined in the sworn testimony which Edward Nugent made on 27th April, 1926.  The claims of these evicted tenants were lodged with the evicted tenants branch of the Land Commission between June and December, 1924, with the exception of Dennis Mahony's claim which was lodged in January, 1925. Receipt of these applications was acknowledged by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> The circumstances of the case reveal as callous a story of neglect and indifference on the part of this administration as has been heard in this Dáil, or has happened in these Twenty-Six counties of what was once Ireland, since 1922, and a lot of things have happened. Edward Nugent, father of the man who claims the land, held 13 acres on the western side of Inchedoney Island from one Thomas Hungerford at the yearly rent of £20 1s. 0d.  He was evicted in 1852 from his holding and house by Thomas Hungerford.  Although he owed no rent he was evicted. Old Mr. Nugent was not present at the eviction, having been sent by the landlord on the day of the eviction on a message to one Captain Sandes, who was the father-in-law of Thomas Hungerford.  On the evening of the day of the eviction Nugent found his family evicted from their home, and his furniture and goods on the foreshore floating in the sea.  In consequence of this eviction, Nugent&mdash;the father of the present man&mdash;and his family were reduced to a state of starvation, and he took employment from the landlord, Thomas Hungerford, looking after his sheep at the remuneration of eightpence per day, without any perquisites.  It is well to know that there was no question of arrears of rent being due to the landlord, and that the eviction was carried out as part of the settled policy of enlarging his farm on the Island.  As a result of that eviction the lands of Richard Nugent and the other tenants who were evicted at that time were farmed by the landlord&mdash;Hungerford&mdash;together with his own farm, until 1866.</P>
    <P>In 1866, Thomas Hungerford, the landlord, let to Patrick O'Donovan, of Killeagh, Rosscarbery, the lands occupied by one Timothy Deasy, who was also evicted by this same landlord from his holding on the Island, and other lands, making in all about 40 acres. These lands were farmed by Patrick O'Donovan and his son Michael until 1888, or thereabouts.  When Patrick died, Michael voluntarily left the Island and went to reside at another farm which he possessed at Killeagh, Rosscarbery, which was his home and principal farm.  In the answer which the <Col N="378" /> Minister for Fisheries made on 23rd May it is stated that Patrick O'Donovan possessed no land.  This Patrick O'Donovan, it will be noted, was never evicted from the Island, or anywhere else, no more than the Minister for Fisheries was ever evicted.  Michael O'Donovan left this holding shortly afterwards, and about four years before he left the Island he put up for sale by public auction the holding he possessed, but no bid was made at the sale because, so far as we can understand, the land was poor and the rent was high, and he was desirous of getting out of that holding if he possibly could.  After his departure from the Island the lands were farmed by Mary Hungerford.  Patrick O'Donovan was the grandfather of Michael O'Donovan, who was the father of Deputy Timothy O'Donovan, West Cork.</P>
    <P>In the year 1925 the Irish Land Commission acquired some land in the Inchedoney Island on the estate of Richard K. Donovan, and awarded something like 78 acres, 2 roods, and 20 perches to Michael Donovan, who was not an evicted tenant and who had no right to claim for land as an evicted tenant.  The land awarded to him at that time has been farmed by Deputy Donovan since then, and he and his wife and family and Michael Donovan are residing there.  Shortly after the Land Commission awarded this farm to Michael Donovan he sold his own farm at Killeagh, Rosscarbery, which he possessed beforehand, for a price exceeding £1,000.  This will serve to give an idea of the value of the holding he possessed while at the same time he claimed land as an evicted tenant. Neither Edward Nugent nor any of the other evicted tenants has received any compensation whatsoever in respect of the land they lost at that time, although in 1924 the solicitor acting for Mr. Donovan offered one of the claimants, Timothy Deasy, a sum of £20 as compensation. It was refused.  In other words, Mr. Donovan refused valuable compensation directly and indirectly by claiming land as an evicted tenant, whilst those who had genuine claims got nothing but dilly-dally and quibbles and being put off from time to time. These facts are indisputable, and they <Col N="379" /> are based on an exhaustive examination of the whole question made not alone by local solicitors, but by me as a Deputy for the constituency, who was asked by his constituents to inquire into the claims of those six evicted tenants and endeavour to secure justice for them before it was too late.</P>
    <P>Since 1924 this land and the Island mansion, which is the principal mansion in and around the Clonakilty area, have been worked by Mr. Donovan.  This mansion with the land and out-offices is worth about £3,000.  The evicted tenants got absolutely nothing.  Some of them are down and out, and there does not seem to be very much sympathy for them.  In 1924 all these evicted tenants applied to the Land Commission to be reinstated on the Island, having regard to the fact that their parents and grandparents had been evicted from their holdings there. Their claim for compensation, apart from the moral aspect of the question and their inherent right, is based on the Free State Land Act, 1923, Section 31 (f), which states <i>inter alia:</i>&ldquo;Any other person or body to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission an advance ought to be made.  In selecting persons under this paragraph the Land Commission may have regard to the cases of persons who, or whose predecessors, have been evicted from their holdings in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of the landlord, and who are not included in paragraph (c) above.&rdquo;  Paragraph (c) states that &ldquo;a person who within 25 years before the passing of the Irish Land Act, 1923, was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Purchase Acts apply, and who was evicted from that holding in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of his landlord, or in case such person is dead, a person nominated by the Land Commission as his personal representative.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsequently the solicitor acting on behalf of these six evicted tenants, Mr. Cullinane, of Clonakilty, entered into a protracted correspondence with the Irish Land Commission with a view to having his clients reinstated.  But his efforts were futile.  He did everything possible to secure justice for them, but <Col N="380" /> failed.  He called several times to the office of the Irish Land Commission, with no result.  Afterwards, Mr. James Tanham, solicitor, Dublin, acting for Mr. Cullinane, took up the case and, on the 3rd November, 1927, entered into a long correspondence with the Land Commission.  He sought an interview with the Minister or with the chief of the evicted tenants section of the Irish Land Commission.  He was put off on several occasions and he was eventually refused.  If I remember rightly, the Parliamentary Secretary in replying to my question with regard to the files yesterday informed me that no attempt was made by the solicitor to secure an interview.  I have here the correspondence which goes to prove that an attempt was made to secure an interview, and that he received from the Irish Land Commission a reply that no useful purpose could be served by granting an interview in connection with the matter.</P>

      <P>Mr. Tanham asked permission to inspect the files in these cases, in order to enable him to ascertain under what circumstances the distribution of the land on Inchedoney Island had been made, and to see if possible whether the claims of the evicted tenants should be granted.  He was refused access to the files on the grounds that they were of a secret nature.  If there was nothing shady in the transaction, there was no reason in the world, in view of the dissatisfaction that exists in Clonakilty as a result of this distribution, why access should not be given to the solicitor to ascertain on what ground the land was awarded to one whose claim as an evicted tenant was bogus.  On the 20th December, 1927, the following letter was received from the Secretary to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A Chairde,</P>
      <P>Re INCHEDONEY ISLAND.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to previous correspondence relative to the application of certain persons for reinstatement in lands at Inchedoney Island, Clonakilty, County Cork, I am directed by Mr. Lynch to send you the <Col N="381" /> attached copy of a communication on the subject received by him from the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>On the 15th December, the following letter was received from the Minister for Fisheries:&mdash;</P>
    <P>With reference to your Minute of the 11th ultimo, addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary, enclosing a letter addressed to you by Messrs. J. H. McLoughlin &amp; Son, Solicitors, 18 College Green, Dublin, on the subject of applications made to the Land Commission by Edward Nugent, James O'Regan, Mary Mahony, Thomas Deasy, Denis Mahony and Edward and Mary Arundel for reinstatement in lands at Inchedoney Island, Clonakilty, County Cork, the Land Commission have already considered these applications which relate to evictions in 1852 or thereabouts, and have decided not to take any action in reference thereto.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners acquired under the Act of 1923, about 126 acres of this island, and divided it between two evicted tenants, Michael Donovan and Daniel Hayes.</P>
    <P>Now, the general feeling down the country about these transactions is that favour was shown in the distribution of the land, and that the evicted tenants' claims were not dealt with in a just and a fair manner, particularly in view of the fact that Michael Donovan, who was awarded the land, was not an evicted tenant.  As the records go to prove, he voluntarily left his holding on the island for personal reasons known to himself, and the parents and grand-parents of these men whose cases I put before the Minister were evicted tenants with a just and a legal claim.  I raise this question to-day for the sole purpose of demanding a complete and thorough investigation to be held into the distribution of this land, so that justice may be done to those people who in those days made it possible to establish even this little bit of freedom we have.</P>

      <P>It can have no other object, because what the Deputy stated is to my own knowledge a direct contradiction of the facts.  I cannot promise, as he did, to take my memory back to 1852, but I can take it back, so far as this particular district is concerned and in which I spent a good portion of my childhood, to 1886, when this gentleman to whom the Deputy referred was evicted out of his holding on the island.  Mr. Donovan was evicted to the knowledge of everybody in the district, and the story that has been told here was concocted by a disgruntled old maid in order to throw disrepute upon the memory of this man and his family, who are as well known as any other family in West Cork. Deputy Mullins thought it necessary to refer to Mr. Donovan's connection with an honoured and respected <Col N="383" /> Deputy of this House.  I want to say this much, that I know him probably all my lifetime, and the Deputy in this House ought to be proud of his connection with Michael Donovan, than whom no more honoured name can be found in West Cork.  I would like to tell Deputy Mullins this, that when he tells us of his personal knowledge of this thing, that statement is directly contrary to facts.</P>

      <P>I would like to tell the Deputy that this claim of Michael Donovan's was investigated in 1903 following the passing of the 1903 Act.  Immediately on the passing of the Act that claim was made.  That is to say, that claim was made 25 years ago and was fully investigated by the Land Commission and, after investigation, was passed.  The man that the Deputy complains has got undue preference in this land, had his claim that he made 25 years ago proved over 20 years ago by the Estates Commissioners. He has proved his claim, and whether that is on the file or not, I do not know.  I hope that under no circumstances whatever will we in this House ever again hear the suggestion made by a Deputy who ought to have some sense of responsibility and honour, that the files of public documents should be left open for inspection by the public.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Mullins did not take much pains to investigate the real facts of this case.  If he did, he would not have made some of the very foolish statements he has just made.  I have absolutely irrefutable evidence in the Land Commission to show that Michael Donovan is an evicted tenant, evicted in 1886 for non-payment of rent.  He lodged a claim for land with the Estates Commissioners in 1904, and the Estates Commissioners and the Land Commission decided that his claim was a just claim, and that he was entitled to get a holding on Inchedoney Island.  Correspondence in this case has been going on since 1904.  A number of influential people who were interested in this case in the neighbourhood where Mr. Donovan lived wrote to the Irish Land Commission on the matter.  Quite a number of questions were asked and answered in connection with this case in the British House of Commons, and the Estates Commissioners and the Land Commission were so impressed with the justice of this case that they decided that directly these lands would be acquired they would give Mr. Donovan a holding on the Hungerford Estate. With regard to the parties in whom Deputy Mullins is interested, I find that all these people are living in the town of Clonakilty.  Their ancestors were evicted prior to the year 1864. In the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907, an Act specially framed for the purpose of dealing with this class of people, it is clearly stated that no application that was not received prior to the 1st June, 1907, would be considered.  Yet these people, who were the representatives of evicted tenants, and who should have lodged claims, never lodged claims prior to 1st June, 1907. The only two claims that were lodged prior to 1st June, 1907, were the claims of Mr. Hayes and of Mr. Donovan. Those people were surely aware that they were representatives of evicted tenants, but they lodged no claims, and by a strange coincidence their claims to be treated as representatives of evicted tenants were not lodged until 1924 and 1925, when the scheme for the distribution of the land had been actually prepared and ready <Col N="385" /> to be put into effect.  Who are those people who are claiming now as the representatives of evicted tenants? These six people are living in the town of Clonakilty, and at least four of them have no experience whatsoever of farming. Yet, presumably it is the Deputy's suggestion that the State should advance to these people, who have no experience of farming and no experience of the management of land, large sums of money for the purpose of buying land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>These things are dealt in accordance with legislation passed by the Dáil.  The Land Commission must act in accordance with that legislation. Presumably it is the suggestion of the Deputy that the State should advance these people large sums of money for the purpose of buying land &mdash;people who have absolutely no experience whatever of farming.  That is the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>They are outside the scope of the Land Acts.  It was never the practice of the Estates Commissioners or the Land Commission to give land to persons who were evicted before 1878.  As the Deputy knows, if you go back beyond 1878 you will not only have to deal with one evicted tenant in respect of a particular holding, but you will have to deal probably with half-a-dozen evicted tenants in respect of that holding.  It was never the practice to go back beyond 1878.  But as a matter of fact, an exception was made in this case because of a particular sub-section in the Act of 1923.  As a result, these cases were investigated and inspected by the Land Commission, who decided that these people were not suitable applicants for lands and that they should not <Col N="386" /> get land.  I am perfectly satisfied, and I am sure that every fair-minded Deputy is satisfied that they are not people who should get land.  In fact, the putting into effect of the Inchedoney scheme was actually held up by the Land Commission in order to investigate these cases.</P>

      <P>As to the justice of these particular cases, I will say that Donovan's case is an historical one.  I think everybody in the neighbourhood is aware of the fact that Donovan's eviction was undoubtedly a case of great hardship, and the Estates Commissioners and the Land Commission were so satisfied that they recommended that Donovan's case was one for reinstatement and that he should get a farm. At the time that Mr. Donovan got this farm he was not in possession of any other farm.  He was an evicted tenant, and consequently, according to the Land Act, he was entitled to a holding, and he got it.</P>

      <P>I think it is perfectly clear that this case has been dealt with in an absolutely fair and just way. There was absolutely no influence brought to bear on the Land Commission. It was dealt with on the merits, and it was on the merits that Mr. Donovan got the holding that he was entitled to.  Every Deputy must recognise that Mr. Donovan was entitled to get it.</P>
      <P>It being now 2.30 p.m. the House adjourned until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 13th June.</P>
