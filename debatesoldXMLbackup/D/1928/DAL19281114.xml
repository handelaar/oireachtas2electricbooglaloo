      <P>The Committee on Economy in Government Expenditure is still engaged on a detailed examination of expenditure on the various Votes. Thirty-four meetings of the Committee have been held since the 1st August, 1927.  I understand that the Committee hopes to be in a position to furnish a Report about April next, but it will be appreciated that, having regard to the magnitude of its task, it is difficult at this stage to state definitely when the Report may be completed.</P>

      <P>The only claim which can be traced in my Department from Mr. Bacon is one for £4,000 lodged under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, for the alleged commandeering of shop goods between July, 1921, and April, 1923.  On foot of this claim, a Report dated 18th July, 1925, recommending the payment of £2,125 was made in respect of goods alleged to have been commandeered between March, 1922, and April, 1923. From inquiries made, I was not satisfied that the goods were taken without the consent of the applicant, and I am, accordingly, unable to make any payment on foot of the Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that an advertisement for &ldquo;Royal Baking Powder&rdquo; was broadcast from 2RN on Tuesday, 6th instant.  The broadcast was arranged in the usual manner through our Departmental Staff and in accordance with the existing regulations governing such matters, which permit of broadcasting advertisements of an approved type at a stated charge.</P>
      <P>The Department's policy is not to accept advertisements of foreign-made articles which are in competition with home-made articles.  The Department was not aware that baking powder was manufactured in the Saorstát.  The latest issue of the Directory of Users of the Irish Trade Mark, issued by the Industrial Development Association Incorporated, of 102/103 Grafton Street, does not include any manufacturer of baking powder.</P>

      <P>The action of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in granting special leave to appeal in the case of the Performing Right Society, Ltd., v. the Bray Urban District Council was not taken in accordance with the wishes of the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann. It has been made abundantly clear that the Executive Council are opposed to the hearing of any appeal from the Supreme Court and the action to be taken in the matter is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are certain members of His Majesty's Government of Great Britain, who bear joint responsibility, who are also members of, and sit on, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council? In view of the statement of policy <Col N="7" /> of His Majesty's Government of Great Britain could the Minister say whether any attempt was made either by His Majesty's Government in Great Britain, as a whole, or by individual members who sit on that Committee, to inquire as to what are the wishes of the Government of this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he will make arrangements whereby prisoners charged with treasonable and political offences and in whose cases a jury disagrees will be tried again before a second or third jury at the same court sitting, and whether he will see that the practice of discharging prisoners where three separate juries have disagreed be carried out in such cases.</P>

      <P>I cannot undertake to make any arrangements whereby, as a matter of course, any particular class of person returned for trial will, in the event of the jury disagreeing at the first trial, be put on trial again before another jury at the same sitting of the court; neither can I guarantee the formulation of the practice suggested by the Deputy in the latter part of his question.  All these matters must be considered in the light of public interest, and in the light of the attempts made by persons <Col N="8" /> awaiting trial or their friends to tamper with juries.</P>

She was brought before the Central Criminal Court on the 22nd June last when the jury disagreed. The Circuit Court is at present holding criminal sittings and I understand that Miss Humphries will be brought up for trial again at these sittings.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question there is no such practice as detaining persons in prison for extended periods awaiting trial.  If persons are in fact kept in custody for a considerable time awaiting trial the fact is entirely accidental as far as the prosecution is concerned and very often it is due to the person himself or herself.</P>

In fact the house of Mr. John O'Callaghan, Town Clerk, was not searched as such.

There is already a considerable trade in seed potatoes, and further steps are in contemplation with a view to the extension of this trade, and also for the development of the trade in ware potatoes. As to flax-growing, three instructors, whose sole duties consist in giving advice on flax-growing, are employed in the county, and their services are freely availed of.</P>

How long does the Minister think the people of Donegal are going to pay part of the subsidies for the Shannon scheme, the sugar beet factory, and the amalgamation of creameries when they are compelled to live in the mess they were put into by the President's &ldquo;damn good bargain.&rdquo;</P>

There is a motion on the Order Paper in my name with reference to the letting or leasing of portion of the workhouse premises at Scariff.  County Clare.

The necessary number of days will have passed before that matter can come up for consideration, and I want to know what is the position&mdash; whether the fact of its being on the Order Paper is taken as holding the matter up until the discussion would come on, or whether time will be accorded for discussion of the motion within the necessary period.

It remains to be seen whether or not that is a feasible proposition. As to the motion on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Cassidy, I think that the Whips might take that matter into consideration and see if they could come to an arrangement about it.  It is a matter that must arise.  The question to be decided is: How long will the debate upon it last? That is not a matter, I think, that can be decided in the House now.</P>

      <P>According to the Standing Orders, it is provided that the House can meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  Up to the present, the Government have only arranged for the House to meet on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. This question, in regard to relief schemes affects thousands and thousands of the unemployed throughout the country.  We are now asked to make an arrangement as to how long the discussion on this question is to take.  I think that is treating the unemployed in the country in a very unfair way.  On one occasion during the present year, the House sat all night to discuss one of the Constitutional (Amendment) Bills.  As far as the unemployed are concerned, the question with which this motion deals affects them to a far bigger extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They outlined a certain programme, and I am asked now, without consulting the Committee, to alter that.  I cannot do it.  The Committee came to a certain understanding and I abide by that understanding. One proposal which was put to my Parliamentary Secretary in connection <Col N="38" /> with the consideration of the Estimates was, that we should sit all night one night last week and one night this week.

That arrangement, so far as it affects this Party, was come to on the understanding that reasonable facilities would be given for a discussion of the motion. Vote 71 is the one on which a discussion of the motion in the name of Deputy Cassidy could take place.  We now find that Vote 71 is the last one on the Order Paper that will come up for discussion.

      <P>An arrangement about my motion would be a simpler matter.  Do the rules of procedure prevent me getting the opinion of the House upon proposed leasing or lettings under the State Lands Act except a post factum opinion?  It is clear the Department can act before the Dáil can decide, if the motion is only taken according to the order in which it appears on the Order Paper. Lands which are acquired for disposal can be disposed of before the Dáil has an opportunity of expressing an opinion on them by means of this motion.  That is my point.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this Vote on Friday last I dealt with the distinction which seemed to be made <Col N="43" /> by the Revenue Commissioners between the income tax payers of small amounts and of large amounts in respect of dividends. There is another matter to which I hope the Minister will devote his attention in connection with this Department, and that is the apparent discrepancy between the total assessment for the income tax and the amount of income tax collected.  The assessments for the years 1923-24 and for 1926-27 amounted to something like £34,500,000.  According to replies which he gave in this House, the income tax collected has fallen short of that amount by something like £10,000,000.  We are anxious to know whether the Minister can give a satisfactory explanation for that deficiency. Some of it undoubtedly may be due to the fact that large amounts have been written off.  I believe there is a prevalent opinion that a considerable proportion of that sum is represented by income tax assessed upon the larger incomes, and which for one reason or another the Revenue Commissioners have not been able to collect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When land annuitants default in payment of the land annuities their names are given to the public.  Some time ago I put down a question asking the Minister if he could disclose to the House the names of those people or firms who were defaulters for the largest amounts and the Minister said it was not within his power to give such information. Well, I think it is only fair if land annuitants are to be held up, as they are more or less, to public odium when they default by having their names published, that income tax payers, particularly those who have been assessed for a large amount and from whom large amounts are properly collectable, ought similarly to have their names disclosed to the public, because the fact that they do default in that way imposes an additional burden on the whole community.  If arrears are allowed to stand out from year to year, arrears by people who can perfectly well pay them, then there is only one of two things going to happen.  Either the Minister has to increase his taxation, or he has to reduce his expenditure, and invariably the experience in this House has been that when the Minister has to <Col N="44" /> reduce expenditure the services which he curtails are those which the community can least afford to be without. For that reason I think every possible means ought to be used to compel income tax defaulters to pay who can.</P>
    <P>There are limits to the pressure which can be exerted beneficially.  I do not think it would be for the benefit of the State if firms which now find themselves in difficulties were compelled to pay income tax and go out of business, but there are certainly a considerable number of people who could pay income tax with a trifle of inconvenience, but who somehow or other manage to escape. The Minister I think on one occasion disclosed the reason.  He said Deputies and others interest themselves on behalf of their friends.  That, of course, is very wrong on the part of Deputies, but I do not think it is any less wrong for the Minister to yield to such representations.</P>
    <P>The question of income tax I think should be overhauled from the point of view of returns and of the machinery for collection.  I should like if the Minister would disclose to the House the amount of tax collected under Schedules A. and B.  I believe that the amount might be called large, but I think the net proceeds to the State is very much less than the amount collected; that, as a matter of fact, large sums are collected under these heads, because the tax must be paid in respect of all property, but absentees can and do claim allowances if their income does not reach the required figure and repayment is claimed and has to be made. The question arises under this head whether there is really a revenue to the State derived from income tax assessments under Schedules A and B.  It seems to me that is a position that warrants very close investigation because what we are faced with is this: First of all, we have one staff to assess tax in respect of property on which the annual income may be very large; we have another staff to collect the tax in respect of that property, and we have a third staff, I think, to refund to people who make claims for repayment. Surely, if the net proceeds to the State upon the tax collected in this way is not a significant figure it might be <Col N="45" /> advisable to consider even its abolition. There is one other point that I would like the Minister to give some information upon; that is the practice which has been adopted to recover arrears of income tax under Schedules A and B. I believe that up to recently, at any rate, the practice was either to attempt to recover those arrears by distraining or by threatening to distrain.  I understand the matter is under appeal with the Revenue Commissioners.  I think it has since been held that we are not entitled to proceed under that.  If that is so, I think, as I said before, we are entitled to use every possible and legitimate means we can to collect this tax. If at the same time the Commissioners exceed their legal powers and harass the citizens in this present distasteful and inhuman way, the Minister ought to put a curb upon such unjustifiable proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">

      <P>Some few months ago I put a question to the Minister relative to income tax deducted from holders of Guinness's shares in this country prior to the double income tax arrangements.  If I recollect aright, the Minister informed us that these people from whom the tax was deducted had a moral claim to the refund of a portion of it.  That is to say those people are entitled to a refund but had no legal claim.  The present, I think, is an appropriate time to raise the question again and to ask if any legal means can be provided by which those people would get a refund of this tax.  Many of them, in fact the great majority of them, are depending to a great extent upon their investments in Guinness.  I know a great many of such people myself and it is a hardship that they should be deprived of this money to which they are morally entitled.  Surely some means should be found for restoring to them what is morally due to them.  It is well that this matter should be gone into and the money restored to these people.  I understand from those who have made an application for a refund that neither side will admit liability.  When they appeal to the British Authorities they are referred to the Saorstát and vice versa.  It is not fair that the matter should be left in this way.</P>

      <P>On this Vote I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to what is to be found in page 20 of the Estimates for Public Services&mdash;that is in connection with the Office of Customs and Excise.  I am not in any way making a complaint against the officers. I must say that on any occasion in which I had any business to do with them I found them the embodiment of courtesy.  But even the members of the Government Party would not have any objection if they had been less vigilant in some of their activities so far as taxing is concerned.  We realise that they have duties to perform which are not always pleasant.</P>
      <P>Last year on this particular Estimate I brought before the Minister a couple of points in relation to Customs and Excise along the Border.  I think the same practice has since continued as was in force then and nothing has been done in changing the practice with regard to that.  My complaint falls under two heads; first the case of people who are living under very peculiar circumstances, who owing to the nature of the regulations, though they may be very convenient to the public roads, have not the access to them that their business would warrant.  The other is the policy which in the year before last was introduced in regard to the taxation of motor cars, belonging to people outside the Saorstát.  In regard to the cars, it might be well, for the information of the House, if I say that the procedure in respect of them was changed.  There was an arrangement by which the motor cars going from the Saorstát into Northern Ireland, or the motor cars from Northern Ireland coming into the Saorstát could be put under bond. They could have a bond signed at the frontier post on each side.  The change was made by which what are called business cars coming into the Saorstát were made liable to thirty three and one third per cent. duty payable on the cars without any refund.  On our side, we made that change.  On the other side, it still remains the same. We from this side go in under no bond, no matter what our business is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to claim that all business cars should come into this country duty free.  I suppose we may leave <Col N="47" /> what we may call the commercial traveller to take care of himself.  He will manage all right.  But we who live by the soil and the markets feel that we have a distinct grievance.  Those towns that are near the frontier have a grievance, because a very serious inconvenience has been caused to those who raise competition in our fairs.  It was my suggestion last year that a change should be made in respect of that.  I will just give an illustration.  Take, say, my own locality.  Two men are living in the City of Armagh, and they want to come into our county.  One of them is coming in to see his friends and drink a cup of tea with them.  We welcome everybody who comes that way.  One of these men comes out of our county to visit his friends, drinks tea with them, and goes back.  He pays no duty on his car.  Take another man from the same city who attends all our fairs, and at each fair to which he comes he will cause competition to the extent of anywhere from £1,000 to £4,000 in the cattle market or grass seed market, or pork market, according to the amount of produce that is bought by him.  It does not take any great intelligence to see which of these two people are the most use to our country. In the one case we have a man coming in who raises competition and buys our produce, and in the other case the man comes in solely for pleasure.  I do not make any case that that man should not be here, but I do say that it is not tending to benefit our trade to put a tax on the man coming in to spend money.  The only case I know where such a procedure as this is adopted is in regard to a bazaar.  When you go to a bazaar you are charged an entrance fee, and then they try to rob you when you get in.  My suggestion is that a person coming to buy produce in our markets should be allowed to come in duty free.  He is only coming in temporarily.  The same applies not alone to the dealing man but to every man who has a motor car and wants to attend a fair in our district.  It is a matter of common knowledge, and we cannot close our eyes to it, that our trade has suffered tremendously by that policy.  The Minister for Industry <Col N="48" /> and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture are looking abroad for avenues by which our trade can be bettered, and by which we may have a new outlet for our produce.  Here is a thing at our own doors, and by our own action we are trying to turn it away.</P>
    <P>The other case is in respect of the people all along the frontier from County Louth to County Donegal. They are placed in a very awkward situation; they are people who, owing to regulations, we might describe as living in a sort of pocket.  A number of cases have been brought before the Commissioners, but perhaps it is not within their power to make any change.  I wonder is it the will of the House that that state of affairs should continue?  Let us take the case of three men who live together in one particular locality.  Two of them have motor cars, and they are in a fairly large way of business as farmers. Thirty yards would have brought any of them to the main road with their cars, but in order to get there legally&mdash; in order to cross there&mdash;they must make a journey of six miles.  Suppose any of the three men was getting in stuff by road the method of transport would become a very great and acute problem.  Suppose a motor lorry is used, though that lorry would be only thirty yards from the avenue leading to the man's house, it would have to make a journey of almost twenty-five miles before it could reach there. Those cases can be duplicated all along the Border.  Looking at it entirely from the standpoint of the business of our own State I think it is not serving our people right.  Those people are expected to pay their rents and taxes, and possibly income tax, and they have to meet those additional burdens that I have indicated.  That condition of things does not help to bring loyalty to the State, because loyalty to the State is engendered by the feeling that the State is causing no unnecessary inconvenience. I know that this is an awkward problem, but the fact remains that very great inconvenience is caused along the Border, and I think some effort should be made towards alleviating the little difficulties under <Col N="49" /> which the people suffer.  I desire to make as strong an appeal as I am capable of making to the Minister for Finance to see if a way can be found out of this very awkward, very tedious, and unnecessary state of affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case we are dealing with a Department that collects a lot of money, and my difficulty in this connection is whether, having regard to the cost of the collection, it is really worth while.  I do not want to discuss in any way the desirability of income tax or anything of that kind. I want to get information which will enable me to confirm or change the opinion that a great deal of the tax which is collected is collected under conditions which do not give adequate results in view of the expenditure.  I have at different times asked questions of the Minister for Finance, questions which, if studied, would reveal to him that we were really anxious to get very significant and important information which would enable us to judge this matter.  I want to ask a series of questions now in relation to this, and I hope I will get the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Answering Deputy MacEntee in a written answer on the 25th April, 1928, the Minister for Finance said he was unable to give a proper division of the earned and unearned incomes prior to 1923-24, but he gave the following details for the years 1923-24, 1924-25 and 1925-26:&mdash;&ldquo;... it is only possible at the moment to segregate the total of £24,461,000 for 1923-24 between earned and unearned income, the estimated amounts being £9,206,000 and £15,255,000 respectively.&rdquo;  I will call the attention of the House to those figures&mdash;earned income £9,206,000 and unearned income £15,255,000.  Can the Minister supply a correct proportion of the figures for each Schedule? It is noted on page 88 of the Report of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;the scheduled reductions and exemptions&mdash; that what is now required is to apportion the net figure of the gross assessment as between the various sums charged.  There is an issue in the minds of a good many as to whether certain assessments on incomes up to a certain amount are worth collecting. <Col N="50" /> Until we get that information it is impossible to come to any definite judgment.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Briscoe on the 9th May, 1928, the Minister gave details of the amounts collected in 1923, 1924 and up to 1928.  Deputy Briscoe asked if the Minister could state the total amount of arrears assessed as due to the British Exchequer and assessed by the Revenue Department for collection, and the total amount of those arrears actually collected from 1922 onwards.  He desired particularly that the amount for each year should be given separately.  In the Minister's reply we are faced by the fact that you have apparently a declining yield in income tax.  As I will show you later, any income tax which is taken into account in a particular year apparently has no relation whatsoever to the conditions in that particular year.  Therefore, if we are to estimate the trend of income which the Minister and his successors can expect from income tax, it is absolutely necessary that we should know over a period of years exactly how the income now coming into the Treasury under the head of income tax is made up.  Obviously, the arrears of certain good years would be disappearing and the arrears which we have to collect now may be years of a different standard.  Broadly speaking, unless you have those particulars it is quite impossible for the Minister to estimate what his probable income is likely to be under those particular heads.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister state what amounts are now outstanding, or were outstanding, on the 5th April last for income tax in respect of each of the years from 1923-24 to 1926-27?  That is a key figure which will tighten up the whole curve.  In reply to Deputy Briscoe on the 9th May last&mdash;Deputy Briscoe seems to have asked very interesting and significant questions&mdash;the Minister for Finance said that the assessments made in 1922-23 were made by the British under an agency agreement. Could the Minister state the exact details of that agency agreement?  I have not been able to lay my hands on the particulars and it is rather necessary for me to have them.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that in the middle and west of Ireland very severe <Col N="51" /> inquiries are being made from income tax payers as to the income they had for years as far back as 1900?  This particular activity seems to have started in that particular district, and seems to be in a rather violent state of local eruption.  I want to know by what authority these inquiries were made; whether the inquiries have resulted in any payment to the Exchequer, and, if so, how much?  I want the Minister definitely to direct his mind to the question of whether he has any authority, whether the Free State has any authority, over moneys collected or supposed to be due for that period.  I am asking that question very definitely.  I do not want the sort of obvious answer that &ldquo;certain things are done, and if you do not do certain things we will go back.&rdquo;  What I want to know is, what authority there is to collect money which would be supposedly due between, say, the years 1900 and 1905-6?</P>
    <P>Certain information has come into my possession which I desire to check, and which I put forward neither affirming or denying it.  Is the Minister aware that the Secretary of the Minister for Finance has interviewed certain taxpayers with regard to their tax payments? If so, will he state under what authority the Secretary of the Minister for Finance deals with income tax matters? I want to know whether any such act is within the knowledge of the Minister; if it has taken place; if it is with the authority of the Minister; and if it is with the authority of the Minister, under what right it is done?  Can the Minister state the exact number of assessments made from 1923-4 to 1927-8 inclusive under Schedules A, B, C, D and E?  The Minister, in reply to a question previously, stated that this could not be got without a great deal of difficulty.  My information is that these assessments appeared in books, a certain number of assessments to the page, and that the total amount could be got without very serious difficulty. For instance, I think we all get numbers on our assessment forms, which certainly must mean something.  Having regard to what we know of the large proportion of income tax which is <Col N="52" /> collected, and the small number of sources from which the vastly larger proportion of that income comes, having regard to what we estimate the assessments to be&mdash;I estimate them in millions; I may be wrong, but I am speaking on very good and very expert advice in making an estimate of that kind&mdash;it seems that there must be an enormous number of assessments which are not worth even the paper and the lack of stamps on which they are sent out.  Can the Minister state for each assessment area the following particulars for the twenty largest assessments under Schedule D: The gross sum assessed; the actual sum of the tax paid thereon, and the actual sum assessed, but not all paid.  The figure should cover each year from 1923 to 1927-8 inclusive.  These figures will have to be got out by the Minister for Finance if there is to be any intelligent use made of the inquiry, and I assume that the intention of the Minister is to make a very intelligent and effective use of the inquiry which he is setting up into the whole income tax position. For the information of those who may be very anxious and who are very anxious to help him in seeing that the income tax system as it comes out of that Committee is a more reasonable and more profitable one to the State than it now is, I suggest that that should be given to us now, so that we can digest it in the interval.</P>
    <P>I have tried in the innocence of my heart to get certain information out of these records and certainly an attempt to read these reports of the Revenue Commissioners and get information out of them raises enormously my opinion of the Minister for Finance, if he does understand them.  I can say that though they have been subjected to the most expert examination, and though much more than midnight oil has been spent on them, these significant figures which one wants to get have not been got out of them by the experts.  I say quite frankly that from the information in the possession of any layman at present it is not possible to come to any sound conclusion as to the effect and influence of income tax collection upon the country.  All we can do in that matter is to go back to our own individual <Col N="53" /> experience and it is on that largely that we are going.  I know actually the circumstances of fifty or perhaps a hundred cases, the examination of which has led me to believe that the benefit which the State is receiving from income tax collection under the system as it now exists is very questionable. I think there is very considerable evidence to show that in relation to, it may be, the majority in number of actual taxpayers, the amount which comes into the State is considerably less than the cost to the community.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of going back to 1900, and I might just quote from page 80 of the third report of the Revenue Commissioners.  I find them stating in paragraph 8:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The time limit for making additional assessments was extended to eight years.  This extension applied in 1922/3 and subsequent years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The law relating to fines and penalties was revised and extended to six years for the year 1922/3 and subsequent years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a very big difference between 1923 and 1900 and six years, and I want to know under what authority that was done.  Table 79 of the report shows that in 1923/4 a gross sum approximating to 68½ million pounds was assessed for income tax purposes and before a penny of the tax was collected of that enormous sum, the sum of approximately 44 millions had to be discharged or exempted or granted under personal reductions.  Out of 68½ millions originally assessed, 44 millions had to be discharged at once from assessment.  That is about 64 per cent. of the total.</P>

      <P>In the year 1924-25 we find that of 64 millions £35,643,000 had to be immediately discharged from assessment.  That represents 56 per cent. of the total assessments.  If I might go back for a moment to the question of what amount of nominal income tax income which comes in in a particular year can be related to that particular year, in the second report on <Col N="54" /> page 88 it states that the total ultimately held to assessment for 1923/4 was £4,455,000 and one would expect that a moiety at least of that would come in in the year.</P>
      <P>Certain inquiries were made of the Minister by Deputy Briscoe, on the 9th May last, and the Minister said there was collected in 1923-24 the sum of £3,461,000 in respect of assessments made prior to 1923-24, but it appears that the only sum collected in 1923-24 in respect of the assessment actually made in that year was £1,433,000 out of £4,455,000.  Yet in the Report the Commissioners inform us that for 1923-24 £4,455,000 was collected for assessments actually made in 1923-24.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Vote 6, item L, page 24.  Taking the years 1924-25, to come a bit closer up, the tax collected in 1924-25 was £5,180,000, less arrears for years 1922-23, £1,023,000, leaving £4,356,495; deduct the tax for 1923-4, the second instalment payable on July 1st, 1924, and including April, 1924, £3,022,319, leaving a balance contributed to the actual assessment for 1923-24 of £1,334,176.  There are other cases which, frankly, I would like to discuss, but I think I had better abandon income tax under these circumstances.</P>
      <P>Another point which I would like to raise, and it is a small point, but it is one with which I think the Minister for Finance is now painfully familiar, and that concerns the definition by the Revenue Commissioners of the word &ldquo;educational&rdquo; in relation to certain taxes.  I will take a particular case merely to illustrate what the effect of that definition by the Revenue Commissioners is.  I propose to read the following letter, which I wrote to the Minister for Education in relation to the matter:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" />&ldquo;I am very much obliged for your letter of the 24th inst., in which you set out quite clearly what is the existing difficulty&mdash;that there is in being a definition of &lsquo;educational&rsquo; and a method of interpretation thereof which has been held to exclude activities of the character described.  What I am asking your co-operation in is the finding of an alternative definition and method of interpretation which will, while excluding a great deal of stuff which is not entitled to consideration, include activities which are, in fact, as predominantly educational in their purpose and effect as, I contend, this company's will be shown to be if subjected to the formal test of educational value which I suggest to you.</P>
    <P>Broadly, I suggest that the existing definition and interpretation of &lsquo;educational&rsquo; for tax purposes has in fact broken down, and I produce the effect of this definition on this specific case as a proof that it has broken down and should be revised.</P>
    <P>I have in my mind this procedure &mdash;that the onus of proof of educational purpose and effect shall lie, as at present, on those claiming exemption; that in some form the certificate of the educational departments shall be required as part of such proof; that the cost of such inspection by the educational department shall be borne by the applicant in any case in which the educational department is not satisfied as to the soundness of the claim.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A tax is levied upon entertainments unless they are of an educational character and we have in the Cork Shakespearian Society an example of what seems to me, at any rate, and as I shall show you seems to infinitely higher educational authorities than myself outstandingly an educational institution predominant.  Imagine a body of this kind which is made up of very ordinary people.  It does contain a few people of a different educational standard but, broadly speaking, they are very ordinary people indeed.  In it you have Ford workers, pawnbrokers' assistants, drapers' assistants, grocers' assistants and people of that kind. These people have been so trained that <Col N="58" /> in one particular week, without any single public rehearsal, they have put on in public seven uncut Shakespearian plays, and they have put them on in a quality which is amazing.  There is no other word for it.  I can speak for that because when I was first asked to go to see one of these performances, I turned it down, as I think any experienced person who had suffered from amateur Shakespearian performances, would.  I expected to find something very different from what I did find.  I went to curse and I stayed to pray.  The actual merit of these performances was of such a character that I was induced on two successive nights, the only two nights that I could give them, to lose my last train and stay in Cork rather than miss the end of uncut Shakespearian plays performed by amateurs.  I saw Hamlet by a boy of eighteen who had a split palate or some other defect of that kind, who when he started was unable to enunciate but who gave a representation of Hamlet of an amazing quality. Last Monday night I saw a boy of sixteen and a half perform Hamlet and he performed it with an absolutely clear and complete understanding of the implication of every word he used. I saw the whole caste, without exception, using every line and every word with complete understanding and that is what I have not seen in any professional company in my experience.  I think those who have seen an ordinary Shakespearian&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be.  What I want to stress is the actual educational value and purpose of this thing which has been turned down as being non-educational. On Monday night the President of the Cork University, Professor Merriman, appeared on the stage and on behalf of Cork thanked them for the educational value and purpose of what they had done.  He said that in no place had the drama performed a more direct educational work and fulfilled a more direct educational purpose than in that particular case, and he said that he ought to know what was the meaning of education.  Now we have asked the Minister for Finance to send his <Col N="59" /> representative to examine into the educational value of this thing.  We have asked the Minister for Education to subject it to the ordinary formal test of his educational inspectors.  I do not think that has been done.  But what other thing on earth can we do to prove that this thing is directly an educational institution?  They took five boys from Farrenferis to fill a caste.  They trained them, and when they went to Maynooth they took the first five places in elocution.  We have children taking 100 per cent. marks in examinations of that kind.  We have children trained wholly there who are now teaching elocution in this country.  As to the Minister for Finance, I know that as far as this particular case is concerned I am pushing an open door, but however open it is we cannot get through it.  What standard of education do they want in order that this thing may be done?  I am a moderately educated man, and probably the majority of Deputies are moderately educated men, but I am perfectly sure that the education of every single Deputy would be increased enormously if they were subjected to the mere educational training which the people in this particular thing are getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister for Finance to tell us what he is going to do in the matter of finding a definition of &ldquo;educational&rdquo; which will not exclude from the benefit of his remissions things predominantly educational of this kind.  Frankly, I am not out to take revenue from the Minister under this head.  I think there will be a whole lot of cases in which it would not apply. I would even press cases on the border line, but where you are using your tax machinery for the purpose of preventing the continued existence of an institution so blatantly educational as this, then some change ought to be made, and I ask the Minister for Finance to provide the machinery.  In this particular case we are prepared to be examined by his educational officers. We are prepared to have them inspect every thing that is going on, and if they say it is not educational, then we are up against the fact that there is a definite difference in the meaning of <Col N="60" />&ldquo;education&rdquo; between the Government and ordinary outside people.  I ask him to take a much better authority than I, the President of Cork University.  If he is in any doubt as to its educational work, let him ask him.</P>
    <P>My other point is this: We want a good deal more information on the subject of income tax and income tax collection than we are getting.  There is an enormous amount of invisible cost.  I do not think that the Minister for Finance will question it if I say that the invisible cost to the community of the collection of income tax is very considerably more than the cost which is shown in his books.  I estimate that there are at least a thousand people, and there may be between thirteen and fourteen hundred, in the city of Dublin living on the community, due to the fact that there is an income tax in existence. Officials are scattered all over the country.  What I suggest to the Minister is that he should give us in the fullest possible detail the information which he must have, and which he must give out eventually for the use of his own committee, so that when we come to consider the whole question of income tax collection we can do that with very much more knowledge than we now have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephXMurphy" hpid="Mr. J.X. MURPHY Mr. J.X. MURPHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. MURPHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether he thinks it would be possible in the near future to adopt some more simplified form of collecting income tax than the present one.  The present method is very cumbrous and is both irritating and annoying. A man makes a return of his income tax for the year, and then he has four or five different people looking for money from him.  It would be just as simple if, when he made a return, he got an assessment and paid the amount to one office, which could distribute it to the different districts in any way it liked.  I should think, following what Deputy Flinn has said, that there must be some means of collecting income tax in another way which would mean much less expense to the State.  There is another small thing that I would like to bring to the Minister's attention, and that is the over-zeal, or what sometimes amounts to impertinence, used by income tax <Col N="61" /> collectors.  Cases have come to my notice where an investment appeared in a return for one year but did not appear for the previous year, and the inspector wanted to know where the money came from.  I say that that is not his business.  In another case which came before me the man was married, his wife lost her mother and father some time before, the inspector found out somehow that she benefited under the will, and he wanted to know what the wife did with the money.  I say that that is impertinence on the part of the inspector, and I presume that they are not entitled to any answer in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>So that at the outside I may be in order I would refer to Item E&mdash;&ldquo;Remuneration, etc., to Deputy Collectors and Assessors of Taxes,&rdquo; and I point out that in the Appropriation Accounts every year an item appears where there has been an excess cost caused by the payment of remuneration for the collection of arrears of tax outstanding from prior years.  That also applies in the present year, and therefore I presume I am quite in order in referring to arrears of income tax, as they are covered by the cost for that particular item.  As Deputy Flinn has pointed out, no matter what questions we put to the Minister for Finance, and no matter what answers we might get embodying certain figures, or series of figures, it is quite impossible for an ordinary individual or an ordinary Deputy to get down to the point where he can make a case in criticism of the whole system that prevails at present with regard to the collection of income tax.  But one gets, as a result of intercourse day by day with people who are in trouble with the Income Tax Department, an idea as to how the system works, and I join with Deputy Murphy in asking the Minister if he could possibly hold out hope that the system will be overhauled and made more simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not at all in agreement or in sympathy with anybody who wants to evade the payment of income tax when it is due, but I say that it is not fair to penalise people who do not owe income tax, because <Col N="62" /> of technical points that arise, nor is the average taxpayer at all in agreement with the penalising of people who do not owe income tax but who are assessed for income tax and become liable as defaulters because of a technical difficulty.  Everybody is not educated up to such a point that he knows what forms mean and the seriousness of neglecting to read forms, and you have cases to-day such as that of a man with a very small salary, provided he is a single man, or a married man with a slightly larger income who is due to pay income tax.  One cannot expect from the ordinary working man a full knowledge of all the technical points that there are in connection with income tax.  I understand that in the first instance assessments go out to different people.  The addresses may be got from a directory in the inspector's office, the inspector saying: &ldquo;So-and-so has a place; he is not paying income tax, and I had better assess him,&rdquo; or it may be a lady.  If that person is assessed wrongly, is not earning the money that would mean the payment of income tax and does not appear before the Commissioners within twenty-one days, he goes down in the books as owing the amount of tax for which he was originally assessed.  One, two, or three years might go by and that person would be re-assessed.  According to the books of the income tax collector he is in arrears, and then the trouble begins.  The income tax collector is, of course, blamed for his over-zeal.</P>
    <P>I sympathise to a great extent with those income tax collectors whom I had to deal with.  Their duties are laid down by regulations.  If one of them goes down to a certain place and finds that an individual who has not got a halfpenny in the wide world is down as owing nine or ten pounds he cannot help him; he cannot write it off.  The only way in which that item can be written off, as far as I know, or as far as I could learn, is by giving sufficient proof to the Commissioners that it is uncollectable.  What is the proof?  The only proof that can be got is by proceeding to hand this arrear over to a solicitor.  The solicitor naturally means further cost for the <Col N="63" /> Department, and until he gets back a return of &ldquo;no goods&rdquo; from the sheriff these arrears cannot be written off.  I consider that if a person, in the case of working class people or small shopkeepers, through a technicality, appears to be in arrears, and if, upon examination the inspector is satisfied that that person should never have been assessed, there should be some change of policy or, if you like, some Act brought in to change the present regulations, that would at least make the collector appear a human being, in place of the position he holds to-day in the eyes of the public.</P>
    <P>I have also had brought to my notice the fact that the method of assessment involves sometimes assessing people who are dead for a number of years; the whole procedure is gone through and the man is not proved to be dead until it has gone to the last stage.  All through the Department have been working on figures that are merely shadows.  The assessments mean nothing. Deputy Flinn has pointed out the difference between the assessments and the amount afterwards collectable including those people who do not owe because of a technical oversight.  Then the amounts collectable do not bear any relation to the amount collected.  The Minister should go through the books of the people assessed to find out the amount assessed and see whether he could not introduce a simpler form of procedure; he should also find out what relation the amount assessed bears to the amount collectable.</P>
    <P>Another case of hardship, in my mind, is this.  The ordinary farmer or business man has the option of paying his income tax on an average of three years.  What about the man in a job? I have a distinct case in mind where cost was involved to the State and no benefit accrued.  A man got a job in a printing office; he was idle for a year but during the time he was engaged there was a boom in the printing trade and the printing house worked overtime. This man earned sufficient to be assessed for income tax.  Immediately his twelve months were up the boom in the printing trade ceased and the man became unemployed for a certain number of months.  He ceased drawing his <Col N="64" /> unemployment benefit.  In the ordinary course of events the books of the firm were audited, sent in, and this man appeared on the list of wage earners as having earned over £156.  He was assessed for income tax for that particular year and thus came into arrears with his income tax.  I have a letter from a solicitor to him stating that unless the amount of income tax is paid a decree will be taken out against him. That man is in fear of being put in jail because he did not pay his income tax, a man who could not even pay an instalment of sixpence a week.  These are the things that bring up the costs of collection.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flinn pointed out, people should get a better idea of the situation as it confronts the Income Tax Department. Something should be done to simplify the collection in general, and cases of hardship should be dealt with in a manner to show that there is some moral understanding between the State and its citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the figures themselves.  The figures I got in answer to certain questions make it quite clear that there is something obviously wrong there is such a difference between the amount assessed and the amount collectable. Deputy Murphy mentioned some cases.  I would like to confirm what he says.  In one particular case a professional gentleman asked me to accompany him to a certain office where he was acting on behalf of a client who was paying arrears.  He asked me to accompany him to listen to the abuse which he, as a professional man, had to put up with from a single individual. I went along there, and it was disgraceful that a professional gentleman, acting in the interests of his clients, should not be treated with common courtesy rather than as if he was a defaulter himself.  I am prepared to substantiate what I say.</P>
    <P>I believe income tax officials are up against certain difficulties.  They are blamed for being harsh and rude, but they cannot help it on account of the regulations.  On the other hand, people who are being harassed ought to be considered on account of these regulations. I ask the Minister to hold out hope that something in the near future will be done to do away with the odium <Col N="65" /> that income tax collectors have to contend with and the difficulties of the smaller income tax payers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JasperTraversWolfe" hpid="Mr. JASPER WOLFE Mr. JASPER WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JASPER WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with some interest to what Deputy Flinn addressed to the Minister for Finance.  I think he must have forgotten for a moment or two the fact that we have it on his authority that the Minister for Finance, in common with other members of the Executive Council, does not possess even a second-class brain.  How he expects him to answer the questions and the enormous mass of figures he has put up, I do not know.  I think this question ought to be treated seriously.  I think there is, throughout the country, very grave dissatisfaction with the method by which income tax is being collected to-day.  I agree with what Deputy Murphy said, and I think it is absolutely wrong to have the ridiculous questions income tax collectors put.  We will get no money for the revenue.  Also we are driving out the deposits in the banks.  They are going out day by day and hour by hour, being driven out by income tax collectors and inspectors.  Since I came into this House, on looking through my correspondence I find a letter from a constituent of mine who tells me that he was asked by the income tax inspector for a return of interest on deposit receipts.  When it was sent to the inspector for the last three years, a request was sent back to get similar certificates from the 5th April, 1914.  I think that is wrong, and it ought to stop somewhere.  Already within the last few weeks I have seen many thousands of pounds leaving this country and going to another, sent by people who were not asked for returns but were afraid they would receive similar treatment to that of their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only within the last week or two that my firm sent to an inspector of taxes an audited return dealing with a company started in the year 1926 which, on its face, showed that it was started in the year 1926.  Back comes a query from the inspector of taxes, one of 17 different queries, &ldquo;Kindly say how long before 1926 the company was trading?&rdquo; The company could only have traded from 1926 and anybody of ordinary intelligence <Col N="66" /> would know that the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies would not allow a company to take its title for 1926 that had started trading earlier. Still, notwithstanding that the accounts were as clear as noon-day, clear to the ordinary schoolboy who may not have second-class brains but is only in the second book, yet there came back seventeen different queries all done for the purpose of annoyance. That ought to stop.  There is no use in harassing taxpayers.  I am sure the Minister for Finance would be no party to it and, even though having only second-class brains, I should say he would be able to tell the inspector of taxes that he ought to treat this as a matter of reason and ought to treat taxpayers with courtesy.  I know a man who has paid each year his income tax.  In sending in his form to the income tax office he omitted to put the interest on the deposit receipts of some money he got from my firm.  When he was asked, he gave it at once and sent up the certificate.  The answer he got was: &ldquo;Please note you have made a false declaration.&rdquo;  I suggest that inspectors of taxes should be warned and told that they should not indiscriminately hurl criminal charges against taxpayers.  The law and common sense are against it.  There is no reason why these charges should be fired against taxpayers.  Unless inspectors adopt different methods I suggest to the Minister that they are only engaged in one object, that is, hunting money out of this country.  That should be stopped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'REILLY Mr. M.J. O'REILLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I think the President stated that farmers did not pay income tax.  They are, however, rather seriously afflicted with that misfortune.  I say &ldquo;misfortune&rdquo; because I believe that in many cases they are paying largely out of capital. Under Schedule A and B, the method adopted to raise income tax is in respect of the poor law valuation, whether there is any income or not, so that the farmer has to pay in any event.  That may be all right, but what I am not satisfied about is whether the revenue authorities are able to raise as much in one year as would pay the officials.  In other words, does the <Col N="67" /> amount obtained cover the cost of collection? It seems to me that the system is not suitable to the agricultural community and, from what I have heard here, I do not believe that it is satisfactory to the commercial community either.  I suppose that when protection was done away with in England, income tax was introduced as another means of raising revenue, but it was never meant to be used on the farming community as it is being used to-day. About a week ago I heard of a case of seizure, for income tax, of a farm in Meath.  I do not know the man in question very well, but I know the land and the district, and, without seeing a book or account, I could guarantee that such a man could have no money.  The method of assessment is most unsatisfactory, with the result that farmers get puzzled.  They are charged with arrears of income tax.  They do not usually keep accounts, and they become so frightened of sheriffs and lawyers that they come to Dublin and seek advice from what are called income tax experts.  That in itself means an extra tax.  If this system in regard to farmers is to be continued it should be simplified so that they might have an opportunity of understanding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with what has been said in regard to the desirability of having a little more courtesy from officials.  It would be well if income tax inspectors got it into their minds that farmers are not altogether so dishonest as they believe them to be. More courtesy would I believe, lead to greater harmony and to greater confidence between the parties.  The general impression among income tax collectors is that farmers have a habit of hiding things and that they are clever in withholding necessary information.  That is not as it should be.  The other matter, of which Deputy Jasper Wolfe has spoken, is one which I have observed in many cases, and it is seriously affecting the question of capital and the investment of capital.  People are afraid to invest any capital because, if they do, the first question they are asked is: &ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; They have to make open confession and to state where that money was in 1916 or some other year.  The result is that, <Col N="68" /> whereas there may be a whole community looking for employment, the money is locked up, and as it generally has to earn some interest it very often is sent out of the country.  That is one very serious effect of the present system.  Day by day it is depriving the country of capital and preventing people from investing.  It brings no benefit to the community here.  Then again, as regards curiosity and the number of questions which are asked of people who are supposed to owe income tax, to my mind they amount to nothing more than indecent curiosity. I think that farmers should get a little more credit in regard to their sense of honour.  If they did, I think that the authorities would get a good deal more information and that farmers would have more confidence in giving such information. My main objection to the present system is that it is impossible for the ordinary farmer to understand the demands which he gets.  It is not easy for him to fill up forms.  The system is altogether too intricate for the average farmer.  It may suit commercial bodies with staffs of clerks, but it is not suitable to the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a type of case which is pretty common.  I know that complaints have come to me from Waterford in regard to goods sent in here on approval, and on which a tax has to be paid.  If they are sent out afterwards and come back here again the tax has to be paid a second time.  Some machinery should be set up by which a tax on goods coming in on approval need not be paid.  I know a case in which a certain quantity of the goods sent on approval was purchased and the rest sent back, but there seems to be no way by which one could get a rebate in the case of the goods sent back.  There seems to be something wrong with the present machinery.  I would associate myself with the remarks that have been made about the administration in regard to income tax.  There is a general feeling that not only is the administration harsh but that it is also tricky.  Whenever groups of professional people come together you hear case after case cited in which people are asked to pay tax on imaginary income.  Demands <Col N="69" /> are made to saddle claims on them which should not be saddled upon them.  The result is that each individual who has a demand made on him has to go to a lawyer or an income tax expert, and very often wastes his time and money in trying to clear these demands for tax on an imaginary income. If these individuals are not quick enough to realise the penalties involved by delay they will be saddled with an additional tax.  Then there are cases of hardship, such as those mentioned by Deputy Briscoe, in regard to people who earned an income previously but who are now unable to do so.  There are people in Dublin who have been unable to pay their income tax and who have either to go to jail or sell their house in order to pay the income tax.</P>
      <P>The whole attitude in connection with the collection of income tax is wrong.  I admit that it is a difficult matter, that people are generally not willing to pay more than they can help naturally enough.  But I think the general public are willing to pay what is due, and certainly when they go to professional men for advice they obviously get the advice that they should pay what is due and no more.  You do have cases where people have been evading the payment of income tax for a long time.  In another debate I mentioned this matter and made a suggestion that where there are deposits in the banks, where people have money which is concealed, it would be far better to make some arrangement with these people and get some income from them.  The attitude taken up by the Minister for Finance is a point blank refusal to deal with these people except at the point of the gun.  However logical that attitude may be, and however strict it may be according to law it is a false attitude from the point of view of getting money in.  These people can take their money out of the country and they are doing it, and we have the evidence of Deputy Wolfe that the money is going out.  I suggest that it would be far better to make some offer to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid-19th century in England, what happened in the case of income tax was that it was found extremely difficult to collect it.  The Chancellor <Col N="70" /> of the Exchequer at the time in England fixed on the idea of giving rebates. The result of that was that he was able to discover a great deal more about people's incomes than he was able to discover before.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should go some way by offering an inducement to people who have not paid income tax in the past to do so.  He would know exactly how much they would have to pay.  In that way, too, the Minister would be able to collect income tax which otherwise he is not going to be able to collect at all.  Another suggestion that I made on another occasion may be worth repeating.  It is that we should have here, as they have in England, some system of arbitration.  In England you have a system by which neutral parties, professional men or lay men, as far as the Department is concerned, are availed of to arbitrate and decide on matters regarding income tax assessments and the amount of income tax to be paid.  I think that with a little more willingness to co-operate, and an attempt to get people to feel that the Department is not being administered either harshly or in an intricate manner, that you would probably get in a considerable amount more in the way of income tax than you are getting at present.  I know that the regulations are binding on the officials, to a certain extent.  I suppose they feel that they have to sacrifice even their own feelings in the matter, but I suggest that the situation is an extremely serious one and that it should receive the immediate attention of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I wish to protest against this human machine.  In particular, I object to the farming community being asked to pay something like £400,000 in salaries and £186,000 in war bonus to these officials.  I think that a salary of £1,500 a year is high enough without carrying with it a war bonus of £212.  I notice that there are a number of officials in this Department with salaries of £1,000 a year.  I suppose they are also paid a percentage according to the amount of money they are able to squeeze out of the people. I suggest that in the present state of agriculture it is an outrage to be paying <Col N="71" /> such salaries and to be looking for income tax from farmers when one considers the position they are in at present. Every member of the Executive Council is well aware that the farmers at the present time are quite unable to do more than pay their way.  Several cases have been brought to my notice where the present Government proceeded for the collection of the arrears of income tax for the years 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921.  I have known farmers who entered into possession of their holdings in the end of 1920, or early in 1921, who were visited by collectors of income tax with two &ldquo;bums&rdquo; and their cattle seized for arrears of income tax due on their holdings in respect of the year 1919.  I would like to know by what process the Minister for Finance arrived at the conclusion that these farmers were liable for these arrears of income tax.  Some of them, from 1918 to 1920, had not as much land as would sod a lark, and yet &ldquo;bums&rdquo; and bailiffs were brought to their holdings in 1921 and their cattle seized for arrears of income tax on holdings which they did not occupy in 1918 or 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time we have the Minister for Agriculture on the one hand, and the Executive Council on the other, telling the farmers to work harder, to live more frugally and to grow what pays.  All this good advice is given to the farmer at a time when he is asked to provide £186,000 a year in war bonus for gentlemen who have salaries of £1,500 a year.  I think it is time that there was a cry of halt somewhere. In my opinion it is an outrage and an impertinence for any Minister to look for money to pay war bonus to officials with salaries of £1,500.  We are informed that two of the Income Tax Commissioners, with salaries of £1,000 and £1,200 each, are out of good nature acting as secretaries to Departments without any additional salary.  One is really amazed at their generosity.  I think that these gentlemen ought to have statues put up to them.  As you have knocked down William you can stick up one of these gentlemen.  The Minister for Finance would, I think, be well advised to finish up as regards the collection of income tax in the case of <Col N="72" /> the farming community who at the present day are in such a bad condition. The Minister for Agriculture can tell him that the farming community is not in a position to pay income tax.  In fact they are quite unable to pay their way, not to talk at all about paying income tax.  It is quite ridiculous, too, that the assessment in regard to income tax should be based on the poor law valuation of a man's holding.  We all know that there are farmers whose poor law valuation is £150, but whose income from it would not be £30 or £10. How, by any stretch of the imagination, can the Minister think that these people are liable for income tax?  It is more than I can fathom.</P>
    <P>I would like to know definitely by what process he succeeded in finding farmers liable for income-tax who never entered into possession of their holdings until the end of 1920 or the commencement of 1921, a tax that was due by their predecessors in the holding.  I know farmers who had bums and income tax collectors calling on them to seize their cattle for income tax due in that way.  I have known several farmers who were on the run or in gaol during those periods and were compelled to pay a tax on their farms which were derelict during those periods, and who were visited by bums and bailiffs for the collection of taxes. I would like to know the process by which the Minister arrived at the conclusion that these individuals were liable for income tax.  I think that he certainly should not give a war bonus to officials with a salary of £1,500.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee referred to requests that were being made by income tax inspectors for the production of deposit receipts.  It is not normal to ask for a deposit receipt in the case of the ordinary honest taxpayer in whose case no suspicion arises.  In general, deposit receipts are asked for when the taxpayer has been detected in some type of fraud, or in the attempt to perpetrate some kind of fraud on the revenue.  I mentioned that I had lately a case brought to my notice where a man was giving a good deal of trouble over the production of information in regard to sums on deposit in the banks.  Here is what happened. <Col N="73" /> He was in a comparatively small town where there were a number of banks, and he produced a certificate from a bank manager that he had no deposit account, but after further investigation it transpired he had withdrawn money that was on deposit in that particular bank a few days before the appeal meeting of the Special Commissioners, that he held the cash until after the hearing of the appeal, and then re-lodged it.  Further investigations disclosed that he had both a deposit account and a current account in every other bank in the town, and that he had deposits in the names of his wife and daughter.  There were in fact, eight deposit accounts in all.  No doubt, that is the type of gentleman who would go to the Deputy and tell him about the dreadful iniquities of the income tax officials.</P>
      <P>A great many Deputies have come to me with complaints, and on investigation I found that the people who went to Deputies only told them half the story or even less than half the story. I have no doubt with regard to a good many of the cases mentioned here that the Deputies have not got the facts. Personally I have no means of getting the facts in regard to any case, except the taxpayer, or somebody authorised by him, comes to me and discloses his private affairs.  In that case the Revenue Commissioners may reply to the point I put them.  Otherwise, they cannot give me any information, for it would be disclosing improperly the affairs of a private individual.  It is wrong, in my opinion, to suggest that capital is being caused to leave the country by anything that the Revenue Department is doing.  There was a withdrawal of capital in 1923, and there might still be some occasional withdrawals, but there is no evidence we can find to suggest that there is any substantial withdrawal of capital going on.  I would like to say I believe the complaints we heard here to-day are really due to this fact, that we have within the past twelve months for the first time established an investigation branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that when the change of Government took place the whole question of income-tax collection <Col N="74" /> was in a state of chaos.  Documents had been destroyed, great masses of arrears had piled up, and there would have been great difficulty in dealing with that even with a full staff, but we had the additional difficulty that, I suppose owing to the disturbed conditions in the country, we could not get a sufficient number of income tax inspectors who would transfer to the service of the State, and for a considerable time we were only able to carry on the collection of income tax in any sort of satisfastory manner at all by reason of the fact that the British Government lent us as many, I think, as ten income tax inspectors, who remained with us until such time as we could get tax clerks whom we could promote, and recruit a certain number of people from other branches of the service to carry on the work of inspectors. Because of that mass of accumulated arrears, and the shortage of staff, we were not able to set up any investigation branch to deal with cases of fraud or cases of extreme difficulty.  In Great Britain there is a very large investigation branch, consisting of a considerable number of highly-expert tax officials, and they are the people who get after all sorts of difficult cases and all sorts of fraud.</P>
    <P>The ordinary tax inspector in a district deals with normal routine work. So far as we were concerned, the inspector in a district had to deal with an abnormal amount of routine work and to try occasionally to get after cases when he believed false returns were being made.  He could not pursue investigations to the extent they ought to be pursued, as otherwise a fresh mass of arrears would be piling up.  Within the past twelve months we have been able to detail a number of inspectors for investigation, and they have been able to get after the people who have been defrauding the Revenue and their neighbours, and they made large numbers of them pay up.  As a matter of fact, the work of the investigation branch has brought in in the present year something like £100,000 from people who had that money by fraud, by false returns and falsifying books, people who were not merely cheating the Revenue, but their neighbours, because owing to the fact that <Col N="75" /> they did not pay up the revenue had to be contributed to in a greater degree by their neighbours who were honest. Well, I think income tax is essentially a fair tax, and the only tax that does not fall more heavily on the poor than on the rich.  It is only fair if it is as rigidly collected as possible.  It is only fair if everybody, as far as can be done, is made to pay his fair share.</P>
    <P>If there is slackness or anything like that which allows one man with a substantial income to get away with the tax while the man next him with lesser income is obliged to pay his tax, then it is unfair.  I believe that the complaints that are coming to the ears of Deputies are due to the fact that people who defrauded the Revenue successfully up to recently have been got after, and one hears them going around spreading their complaints and telling stories that are only partially true.  They tell these stories to the Deputies or to anybody else who will listen to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, I think, misunderstood me when he quoted my reference to the fact that people came to me and came to other Deputies, and he went on to suggest that because they came to me or came to other Deputies they were allowed to escape the payment of the tax.  They are not allowed to escape the payment of the tax.  What happens is that the tax collector is often deterred from taking proceedings, because he is told and he has had letters shown to him, that Deputies are making representations to the Minister or to the Commissioners.  I have known such cases.  I had a case recently before me brought up by two or three Deputies in this House.  That was a case in which a man made all efforts to avoid paying a sum of several thousand pounds.  He succeeded in seeing me.  He used the fact that he had seen me to put off the collector and to put off the paying of the money. He fought a delaying engagement in that way.  Here is the fact: The man, on his own statement, admitted that he had marketable securities that he was trying to sell.  But what he was trying to do was delaying action so as to hold on to the interest of £6,000.  The Deputies <Col N="76" /> who first came to me about him believed that he was most hardly treated and that the Revenue Commissioners were going to put him out of business and all that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to say that the Revenue is perfect, I do say that so far as the cases brought up by the Deputies are concerned the great majority of them are incomplete stories.  Some Deputy has referred to impertinence on the part of tax officials.  I would certainly take steps to ensure that any official who was guilty of rudeness or impertinence to a taxpayer would be properly reprimanded and would be induced not to be guilty of that again. I have occasionally heard cases like those I have heard to-day at secondhand, where somebody said that a tax official was guilty of rudeness or impertinence to somebody else.  But I have not yet heard of any such case from a taxpayer at first hand.  Nobody came to me to say that a tax official was guilty of rudeness or impertinence to himself.  Before I would conduct any investigations I would need to have a complaint from the person who was directly concerned, and who would be in a position to give direct evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember the particular points of Deputy Briscoe's case at the moment, but I have some note of it here.  The main point is this, that the person actually aggrieved ought to write to me and stand over his complaint and not refer it to somebody else.  I, so far, have not had a direct complaint.  In these cases we would often want to hear the whole story again, because what might be an impertinent inquiry in certain circumstances might, in the course of an argument about an assessment, be a very pertinent and fair inquiry.  A man might be contending certain things and might be trying to induce the inspector to accept arguments of his, and it would be quite fair and reasonable for the inspector in such cases to ask questions which he could not ask on his own <Col N="77" /> initiative.  In all these cases we should have the facts, and the person who feels aggrieved should be willing to write to me or to the Revenue Commissioners, and any such complaint will be investigated.</P>
      <P>The question of simplification has been mentioned here.  I have stated several times in the Dáil that I am satisfied that the present income tax code is not suitable to the conditions here.  I have also stated to the Dáil that if it had not been for the extreme pressure of work on the staff we would, long before this, have taken some steps to bring about simplification.  We have had a Committee sitting in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners with a view to preparing legislation, at any rate to take some first steps in simplification, and we hope to include in the next Finance Act some provision along that line.  We are not in a position to overhaul the whole question, but we will try to remove some of the difficulties and take definite steps towards simplification. I do not know whether we would be justified in going the whole hog, so far as this country is concerned, to abolish deductions at the source in respect of certain classes of income. There is a great deal to be said for it, but we will have to see whether it would lead to a great loss or whether it would lead to an evasion of revenue tax, or whether in order to prevent that evasion you would not have as great difficulties and as much work and expenditure as would be attendant on the repayment necessitated by deduction at the source.  There is this much to be said, that we are clearing up the arrears position.  A staff is being trained.  We will shortly be in a position to have men available not merely for investigation but for something more than mere routine work, for undertaking inquiries and investigations and all the calculations that are necessary for an overhauling of the entire system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haslett asked a number of questions with regard to the land frontier. He asked for exemption from the necessity of paying tax on cars bringing in men who are going to do a certain class of business.  He raised the question last year.  I got a good many local inquiries made and I could not ascertain that in fact there had been <Col N="78" /> any reduction in the number of dealers or cattle buyers attending the fairs by reason of the arrangement that was made some fifteen or eighteen months ago.  The arrangement made fifteen or eighteen months ago was made in consequence of complaints that cars from Northern Ireland which had not paid taxes were being used in competition for business purposes against people whose cars, as the owners live in the Saorstát, had actually paid taxes.  We rectified the complaint that then existed, but in rectifying it, as a matter of fact, there arose some new grounds of complaint.  These new grounds of complaint were created. We modified the order and most of the new complaints were removed.  There are still some other complaints and if they can be remedied, we will give the best consideration possible to the question.</P>
    <P>As to people living in awkward places along the Border, I do not think that we can get rid of these difficulties. Sometimes, individuals in these cases would, by opening some sort of a new path, which could hardly be dignified as a road, but which would enable them to avoid crossing the Border, be able to get over a difficulty of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flinn asked me a great number of questions which were really in the nature of Parliamentary questions. He gave me notice of them, but the notice only arrived this morning and for that reason I am not in a position to answer them.  As a matter of fact, I was occupied until 2.15 p.m. and I had not a chance even of seeing the Deputy's letter until that time.  The only thing I can suggest to him is that he should put them down as Parliamentary questions now and we will give him whatever information we have or that can be obtained.  We will give him in some cases partial information and an explanation why more cannot be given.  The Deputy will be able to get all the information that can be reasonably obtained.  If there is information which can be obtained only with considerable difficulty, we can discuss with him whether it is worth going to the expense involved or whether partial information might not suffice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Cork Shakespearian Society, I think Deputy Flinn <Col N="79" /> realises that a matter like this is really difficult.  A man might be inclined to say that if it were taken alone he could regard it as educational, but really the question is: Where are we going to stop in the matter of exemption?  Are we to exempt every Shakespearian society, and, if we are, are we going to tax other plays by authors of repute?  Are we going to exempt only amateur Shakespearian performances that may be deemed necessary for educational purposes?  Is the work of amateurs of more educational value than the work of professionals?  Is the work of a particular society of educational value to the audience or to the performers? The question could be asked whether it is the performers who derive the whole educational value rather than the public on whom the tax is charged. There is a very good Shakespearian company which has toured the country and given good performances.  That company has attracted large audiences, and it is, in my opinion, doing a type of educational work; but after all it is a commercial company and there could be very much the same sort of plea made for it as was made for the Cork Society. So far as public societies are concerned we have looked into this matter and if we were to exempt this particular society, unless we can get some formula better than any we have found yet, the difficulty is that we would be admitting others and we could not find any logical line at which to stop.  The matter can be further considered, but it is very difficult.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked about people who became liable owing to some technical difficulties about an oversight in not making returns or not lodging any notice of appeal when an estimated assessment was made.  If notice of appeal is not given and if the assessment is allowed to be final and conclusive, then there is no method of discharging it.  The situation that Deputy Briscoe depicted arises, but I do not feel that we ought to give discretion to inspectors to discharge assessments. Undoubtedly, if they had such power they would be subjected to pressure and to temptations that it is not desirable to <Col N="80" /> subject them to, and the difficulties of supervision would be enormously increased. The real remedy for the situation is to get it into the minds of the people that a notice of assessment is not a thing to be ignored and that they ought to take steps on it.  If this is done we will not have these cases arising.  We cannot depart from the position that where an assessment has become final and conclusive a debt to the State has been created and if the money can be collected then it must be collected.  I think if we have no rigidity, then we open the door to every sort of intrigue, political and otherwise, and I believe it would be an extremely bad thing for the whole community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jasper Wolfe mentioned a case, but I think I have dealt with the position where people were asked for information back to 1914.  Deputy Flinn mentioned cases where people were asked for information back to 1900.  The position is that if a taxpayer is detected in fraud in respect of this or last year it is a common thing to give him a choice either of making a clean breast or allowing an investigation to take place that will cause the particular tax he has defrauded the revenue out of to be recovered and pay a mitigated penalty or stand for prosecution and pay the penalty that would otherwise be inflicted.  People very frequently choose to pay up a tax rather than face prosecution and full penalty, and in that case the Revenue Commissioners take the more lenient line of recovering the tax out of which the Exchequer has been defrauded. plus a mitigated penalty, rather than proceed for full penalty against the taxpayer.  That is the way in which some investigation in regard to years very far back arises, and I think there are no reasonable grounds for complaint in regard to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly, Deputy Corry and others mentioned the case of the agricultural community.  I do not see any reason to alter the view that if we are considering the farmers who live by agriculture who have no other source of income but their farms, the entire income tax from them would not pay for the electric light used in this <Col N="81" /> Chamber.  The farmers who do pay are the farmers who are also shopkeepers and who have investments or something of that nature.  There may be the case of a large farmer, but he must be a large farmer, if a married man with children and with a large valuation, to come within the ambit of the tax beyond the exemption limit.  It might happen that such a farmer would be assessed, but whatever can be said about that type of farmer, there is an excuse for the small farmer who does not keep accounts.  So far as the large farmer is concerned, if he does not keep accounts he ought to pay, and there is no excuse why a farmer of that kind should not produce accounts which would enable assessments to be discharged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred to cases of people who bought land some considerable time ago towards the end of the boom period.  These people were assessed for arrears of tax on the land. I do not know what the facts of the particular cases are, but so far as Schedule A is concerned, I have known cases where people bought land, where they or their solicitors did not take the necessary precautions, and they were charged and had to pay considerable sums of income tax which were owing on that land.  It is the business of a purchaser to ensure that there are not arrears of tax to which he will be liable outstanding on the land.  I undertook, as a matter of fact, arising out of certain inquiries from the Fianna Fáil Benches, to make a new arrangement whereby information which was not hitherto given by the Revenue authorities would be given to the purchasers in future to facilitate them in making sure that tax was not due on land.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into that at length.  If the Deputy will send me the names of the cases I will get him full information with regard to them.  I was only stating general principles for the information of the Deputy, who seemed to think that it could not arise without some definite wrong-doing or act of harshness on the part of the Revenue authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little referred to the case of goods coming in on approval.  I suppose he was referring to wearing apparel. We deliberately refrained from making any arrangement for the payment of drawback on articles of apparel which had been imported on approval. We did that because there would be a great number of payments to be made, if we had made arrangements for it. A great deal of expense would fall on the State, because of the staff that would be employed and the precautions that would have to be taken to avoid fraud. We came to the conclusion, on the whole, that the best thing to do was to make no arrangement for the payment of drawbacks in such cases, and the Revenue Commissioners are simply carrying out the law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little also pleaded for more friendly treatment of people in the position of being defaulters.  I cannot agree that good results to the revenue would follow that.  We did give a certain time.  Advertisements were published and a period was fixed during which defaulters could make a clean breast of it and no penalties would be incurred. I do not think it would be desirable to repeat that.  I believe the result would be that we would probably have people again carrying on a policy of default in the hope that there would be another amnesty.  As a matter of fact, I do not think the problem is of the magnitude Deputy Little believes it is.  I do not believe that there is such an amount of fraudulently withheld tax which cannot be got after otherwise that Deputy Little believes there is.  In view of all the circumstances, I think it would not be justifiable to make any special arrangement at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Deputies who took part in this discussion did not, in general, make any attack upon the Revenue <Col N="83" /> officials, who were doing their duty. But, apart from the question of any attack on officials, I would remind Deputies that we hear requests from almost all quarters of the House from week to week for expenditure on some new service or for further expenditure on some existing service.  In order to maintain existing services, or to provide for any new services, the revenue has to be collected, and an attitude of sympathy with people who do not do their duty in the matter of meeting their obligations to the State and to the Exchequer is only going to make it more difficult&mdash;if it is thought that there is that attitude in this House&mdash; and more costly to the Revenue Commissioners to carry out their work.  I believe that, while, as I have said, no personal rudeness to any taxpayer should be tolerated, and while there should be no question of pursuing or harassing any individual, there ought to be a rigid insistence that where the tax is due it will be collected, and that where a person is making false returns for the purpose of avoiding his obligations every possible effort will be made to find him out and inflict penalties on him that will discourage him from doing the like again.</P>
    <P>I once heard the Revenue Commissioners tremendously blamed for harshness in a particular case.  On investigation I discovered that the apparent harshness at the end was due to too much consideration which was abused at an earlier stage.  I believe that if there is not support in the House for the reasonable and proper efforts of the Revenue authorities to collect the revenue, not only are we going to have people escaping at the expense of their neighbours, but, in the long run, stronger methods&mdash;if you like, harsher methods&mdash;will have to be used than if people get it into their heads that there is no escape and that they ought to pay what is due and look as pleasant as they possibly can about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy discussed that before.  The real difficulty is that <Col N="84" /> the law both here and in Great Britain is entirely against those people.  If Guinness's shareholders here feel they have a grievance against us, Great Northern shareholders in Great Britain or Northern Ireland have a grievance against the British Government.  If we had not got the new income tax relief agreement, it would have been necessary to make legal changes and get rid of the position which undoubtedly has inflicted a certain hardship on the people whose incomes are below the exemption limit and who derive their income from shares in firms such as Messrs. Guinness.  But it seems to me that at this stage it would be difficult to go back over the matter and to do it in a one-sided way&mdash;to do it without having the same thing done where the converse case holds in respect to, say, Great Northern shareholders. I believe myself that there is no ground for thinking that the British Government would be prepared to go back over the matter and deal with their case.  It was a certain hardship&mdash; if you like, it was a definite hardship&mdash; to these people, but we have got a new arrangement whereby that cannot recur in the future.  On the whole, I do not think it is desirable to re-open the case and retrospectively amend the law for the benefit of a particular class after the lapse of two or three years or more.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £798,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the payment of Old Age Pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1924, for certain Administrative Expenses in connection therewith, and for Pensions under the Blind Persons Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>The only thing I need say in connection with this matter is that the decrease shown in the Estimate as compared with last year is largely due to the fact that there will be one less pay day&mdash;one less Friday in this year&mdash; than there was last year which had 53.

      <P>There is, I note, on the whole a general improvement in the administration of the old age pension scheme.  I think, however, the Department should see that there are weaknesses in the Old Age Pensions Act that ought to be modified to some extent.  It is hard in some cases for the claimants to prove their claims owing to the system as it exists to-day.  The Pensions Committee, seeing they are to a great extent administering the Act, should be taken more into the confidence of the Department.  In many cases where claimants come before the Committee and after their claims have been considered and every aspect of the case has been gone into and a certain pension recommended the pensions officers., who perhaps get their instructions from the Department, appeal against the decision of the Local Pensions Committee.  The position really is that the pensions officers very often appeal against the recommendations made by the Local Committee although they are very much less well informed of the facts than the Committee which has made the recommendation.  I think, therefore, that the Committees since they are more or less facilitating the carrying out of the old age pensions scheme should be taken more into the confidence of the Department and that when they strongly recommend that certain pensions should be given more heed should be given to their recommendations by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are many cases where the pensions officers are too rigidly opposing the recommendations made by the Committees, and in that way there have been great hardships often done to the claimants in regard to appeal cases.  Those administering the old age <Col N="87" /> pension scheme come a good deal more in touch with the poorer classes of the people than practically those of any other Department of the State.  I think a very sympathetic attitude should be adopted by the pension officers.  Probably they are not allowed by the Department to take up such an attitude, since it is the instructions of the Department, I understand, that they are to seek out in every possible manner any little flaw whatsoever whereby the claim might be turned down.  If that is not the Department's view, it is very often the view taken by the pension officers.  I know they have a very hard and difficult task to perform.  Many people put up bogus claims, but on the whole I think the attitude of the officers is unduly harsh in dealing with claimants generally.</P>
    <P>I know of cases brought before the Department, and I know they are always very generous in dealing with them on their merits.  Still I think there is something wanting in the system. I am aware, and I make the point here, that throughout the country there are many people in receipt of old age pensions not entitled to the amount they are getting.  I put that point very plainly, and I feel it is a fact, but against that there are large numbers of people getting no pensions or getting much less allowance than they should get.  The Department's attitude seems to be this.  They feel there are many people getting allowances they are not entitled to, and because they cannot get at them they are too stringent altogether trying to prevent other people getting allowances to which they are entitled.  I think a general overhauling of the whole system would do no harm.</P>
    <P>With regard to clerks of the Pensions Committees, I think the Department has no say at all in the matter.  I think the Committee has power to employ a pensions clerk, no matter who he may be, and he may carry on at the pleasure of the Committee, the Minister for Local Government having no say whatever in his appointment.  I am not pleading for appointments commissioners in this case, but I think that there should be at least some supervision. I think there is none.  In fact, <Col N="88" /> I know a case &mdash; I brought it before the authority concerned &mdash; where a county councillor who, by virtue of being a member of the council, is a member of the Committee, is acting as the paid secretary of the Committee.  I think that that is not at all a proper thing, and I think if the Minister has no power to prevent a county councillor from acting as secretary and drawing a salary from the county council, of which he is a member, for acting as clerk of the Committee, some change should be made in the Act which would empower the Minister to take action in such a case.  I think that the provisions with regard to the appointment of pensions clerks came in with the old age pensions scheme years and years ago.  It was a new scheme at the time, and it has not been changed to any extent since.  The Minister should look into that point and should be empowered to see that people are not appointed as clerks who should not be.</P>
    <P>Another matter which would need attention is the blind pensions scheme. The fact that the blind pensions scheme was entirely inadequate was brought before the House some time ago.  No person is entitled to draw a blind pension until he reaches the age of fifty years.  There are many people throughout the country, unfortunately, who are imbeciles, and who are blind and unable to work, but they will not be allowed blind pensions until they come to the age of fifty years.  I think the Department should give that matter serious consideration with a view to changing the Act to some extent, so that people who cannot earn their livelihood and who are very badly catered for, except by relief out of the public funds, should be enabled to get blind pensions at any age.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what has become of the recommendations that were made by the committee that was set up some years ago to inquire into the working of the old age pensions scheme.  Certain recommendations were made dealing with the work and powers of local pensions committees and dealing with the work, powers and salaries of pensions clerks.  These recommendations were put before the Government some time ago.  I read <Col N="89" /> them some time ago &mdash; I have not them at hand at the moment &mdash; and I found that the recommendations were very good.  I think that the Government, having set up a committee to inquire into the working of this scheme, should not put their recommendations aside without giving them very careful consideration. I should like the Minister to tell us what it is proposed to do with those recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that for some time past there has been a very great improvement in the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, but there are a few matters in connection with which I think there could be considerable improvement.  One of the greatest difficulties with which I have to contend at present is the difficulty which applicants for pensions have when proving their ages and in putting before the pensions authorities in Dublin proofs to show that they have arrived at the age of seventy.  When they fail to obtain birth certificates the procedure is, I understand, that they have to make an affidavit before two Peace Commissioners.  In the counties I represent, the people seem to be very unfortunate in not being able to obtain birth certificates, but in numerous cases they are unable to do so.  The result is that the onus is put on the claimant of endeavouring to get two old people whom he knew in his youth to swear an affidavit to prove that he is over the age.  I have had untold trouble in connection with innumerable cases, and I am sorry to say that a great many of them have certainly been, to my mind, unduly delayed.  I believe that they are sympathetically considered, but at the same time these old people have sometimes to go twenty, thirty, and forty miles to get this proof, and it is undoubtedly a very considerable difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matter which I wish to bring forward in the nature of a very serious grievance is this: that where persons who were in receipt of British war pensions in respect of relatives who were killed, and who gave their ages when they were claiming these pensions, have these pensions automatically reduced, while at the same time they have not been able to <Col N="90" /> obtain their old age pensions in the Free State.  I have one particular case in mind, which will illustrate thousands of cases of the same kind&mdash;the case of Mrs. Willis, of Harbour Street, Mullingar.  She was in receipt of a British war pension of 11/- a week for a son of hers who was killed in the war.  She gave her age on filling in the documents for the war pensions people. Six months ago she arrived at the age of seventy, and her pension was automatically reduced to 6/- a week.  She has gone before the Peace Commissioners, and she had got several people of seventy in the locality where she was to testify, but to-day she is further away from getting the old age pension than she was when the 5/- a week was taken from her.  That is a matter that I think the Minister for Finance ought to take up with the British Finance authorities.  They have automatically reduced her 5/- a week; she is not receiving it from the Free State, and they are benefiting to that extent.  That is affecting thousands of other people in the Free State who have received and are entitled to British war pensions.  I know that at present there is an investigation with regard to war pensioners and the grievances of war pensioners, and this is a matter we should take up.  It is really very important, because it is not fair that the British War Pensions people should be saving 5/- a week at the expense of the woman I have mentioned, while at the same time, because she is not able to prove her age, she cannot obtain a pension here.  I put that case before the Minister, and I hope that the matter will be investigated, because it affects a very large number of people in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a type of case which, in my opinion, is the cause of unnecessary hardship amongst a rather limited number of pensioners.  I refer to the case of persons in receipt of pensions who find it necessary to enter county homes.  When a person who is in receipt of an old age pension goes to the county home payment of the pension ceases.  When such an individual leaves the county home he cannot get the pension allowance again without <Col N="91" /> making a fresh application.  Very few cases of that kind have come under my notice, but I have been assured by the officials responsible for dealing with pension applications that it is considered necessary that the law should be amended so that pensioners of that type would be allowed automatically to receive their pensions without going through the formula of making fresh applications.  If it is considered necessary or advisable to amend the law to enable people of that kind automatically to receive the pensions which they were in receipt of before going to the county homes, I suggest to the Minister that the necessary amending Bill should be introduced without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to another matter.  It appears to me to be the procedure of the local pensions officer automatically to oppose all pension applications, or to make a case against them.  Dealing further with that aspect it appears to me that the pensions officer in a great many cases&mdash;I do not say in all cases&mdash; goes out of his way to make a case against the pension application, especially on the question of maintenance allowance.  When an application is made for a pension the local pensions officer is asked to report on the circumstances of the applicant.  In doing so he takes into account the valuation of the holding on which the applicant lives, the number of hens, ducks, and drakes that the owner possesses, and he appears to fix the standard income on the average number of eggs sold during the year by the owner of the home in which the pensioner resides.  I have been trying to get figures in some cases regarding the income, or the so-called income of the owner of the house in which the applicant resides and I find it impossible to get detailed figures to justify the pensions officer opposing the application.  The whole question depends on what is reasonable maintenance allowance for the pensioner in the place where he resides. There appears to be a great <Col N="92" /> difference of opinion between the view held by the local pensions committee and the pensions officer in matters of this kind.  I do not know if any new instructions could be issued to pensions officers so that they will only put up cases against applications where they have evidence to support their cases.</P>
      <P>I rose to bring under the notice of the Minister particularly the first point I mentioned in regard to individuals who go into county homes, who are in receipt of the pension, and which is stopped while they are there.  It is necessary, I understand, under the existing law for them to make a fresh application before payment of the pension is renewed.  I suggest that whatever slight amendment is necessary to remove that obstacle should be made without further delay.  I think it is an unnecessary restriction, and that where a person is in receipt of a pension before going into a county home that person should automatically receive the pension on leaving that institution.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say on this service except to try to find out if the Minister would give any indication as to what is the standard of assessment by which income is made out.  I asked that question before on several occasions, but so far I have not been told.  We know from experience of pensions committees that certain values are placed on certain things which are not the value of these things when calculating income for old age pension purposes. There is a very illuminating light thrown on this matter when we consider that if an applicant for an old age pension has a few pounds in the bank he is charged at the rate of 10 per cent. on that money.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance would tell us where 10 per cent. could be got on any money now.  Would he be prepared to issue a National Loan and offer 10 per cent.?  If he did I am sure it would be over-subscribed before long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of blind pensions, I would like to ask if the Minister would consider having these claims considered more quickly and much earlier. In my constituency I know cases waiting for six or eight months before they <Col N="94" /> were investigated.  Surely that is a hardship, because these people have to depend upon somebody to take care of them, to lead them about, and to give them assistance.  To leave cases of that kind for eight or ten months is a state of affairs that should be remedied. Surely some means could be devised by which the Minister could arrange that medical inspection would take place at an early date after the application for a pension was made.  That is a matter to which I suggest the Minister should give serious consideration. I put a question about it to-day, but I do not think it was taken seriously. I think it should be considered seriously.  I know several people who have applied for old age pensions, whose claims have been turned down because they could not prove their age. In the first place they cannot find certificates. That is a fairly common occurrence.  Then they cannot collate their age or something in their memory with some incident that can be traced. They cannot convince the Minister that they are the age.  Do these people, in the official mind, ever become seventy, or how are they going to prove that they are seventy?  They linger on, and make fresh applications, go before the committee, their pension is granted, an appeal comes up the pension is rejected, and the thing goes on eternally.</P>
    <P>There is no means of deciding.  I think there ought to be some means really by which these people would be allowed to receive a pension on the evidence of certain responsible people who could subscribe to the belief that they were seventy years of age.  I find it is impossible for these people to find the necessary data to convince the Minister. I have also a case or two where people who were American citizens came home and cannot get their pensions because they have not been long enough in the country.  I know of a case where a man is in very necessitous circumstances.  I do not believe Finance and the Local Government Department, especially the latter, are anxious to be hard on any particular individual who is making a claim, but there is legislation, and this poor man cannot get a pension.  He is in necessitous circumstances and is entitled to the pension in common fairness and justice.  The <Col N="95" /> legislation was passed years ago.  Some alteration in it should, I suggest, be made.  I would ask the Minister to look into these matters, particularly the matter of age, the amount, and the basis of assessment, and see whether some means cannot be arrived at by which some of the hardship may be alleviated or removed entirely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect regarding old age pensions that needs special attention, that is, the calculation of the means of the applicants&mdash; of small land holders.  It is easily understood that the valuation, say, of a cow will vary in different parts of the country from three pounds to as much as twenty pounds a year.  Still we find that in the poor parts of the country, at least it is my experience, that the valuation put on a cow, in many instances, is in excess a good deal of what the value is.  Then again, the pension officer may take the valuation of half an acre of oats, turnips, or other crop. These crops cannot be calculated at a money value inasmuch as the farmer uses a crop for the purpose of feeding cows or cattle, which is included by the pensions officer and is necessary for their very sustenance on the farm. In calculating the value of crops of this sort used for the purpose of keeping cattle in existence, you are taxing twice the same commodities, to the disadvantage of the applicant.  If more consideration were given to the locality and as to the actual value of cows, which are the main source of revenue, I am sure good results would accrue, as far as applicants are concerned.  I am satisfied that the actual amount on which these things are assessed are too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again one very important factor which would go a long way towards doing justice to all concerned would be if the pension officer took more into account sub-committees dealing with the cases.  These sub-committees are made up of people interested, in the first instance, in saving themselves as tax payers and cutting expenditure down within reasonable limits, at the same time with a keen knowledge of what the actual condition of all its applicants is.  If the pension officer <Col N="96" /> took into account, and put it before him when he and the Committee are discussing the various cases, how he has calculated the means of each applicant, what means he has discovered, and any other information he has on his mind that may not be in the possession of the Committee, you would find that very fair amounts would be arrived at as a fair calculation for all concerned.  As it is, the pension officer refuses to give any information at all to the sub-committee as to how he has arrived at the amount.  The sub-committee, seeing there is such a wide discrepancy between what they estimated as the applicants' means and what the pensions officer estimated, feel that their opinion does not count, and they go to the opposite extreme and grant, without full consideration, the fullest possible award.  The result of that is injurious from an equitable point of view in arriving at what would be a fair pension.</P>
    <P>I have had a great deal of experience with the local government officials here, and in the matter of appeals I found them very expeditious and anxious to do their best within the limits of the law for the applicants. At the same time they are not as favourably placed as the pension officer would be if he were instructed to take his case and consult with the committee when these applications are before it.</P>

      <P>Since the last occasion when the Old Age Pension Act was before the House we find universal satisfaction through the country.  I do not think the country has suffered much loss by the contribution of one shilling extra to old age pensions.  There is one thing which has inflicted great hardship on a number of old people, and that is the difficulty of getting sufficient evidence to prove their age.  I know in many cases they look the age, and even more, but are not able to find sufficient evidence to prove it to the pensions officer.  I do not know whether it would be proper for me to speak with regard to reducing the age to, say, sixty-five, or to have some system introduced into the old age pensions papers such as a confidential <Col N="97" /> report from the Old Age Pensions Committee.  In our county the committees in general are conscientious in granting pensions to old people.  We find in most cases that their findings have been accepted by the Local Government Board.  Having regard to the conscientious manner in which the sub-committee can deal with the matter, there might be some sort of form introduced upon which they could make a confidential report and say: &ldquo;We are of opinion that the applicant in this case is to the best of our knowledge and belief, a certain age,&rdquo; seventy years or so, and allow that person to benefit by it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOLLY</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people of that age in dire circumstances, and their means of livelihood is much less in many cases than that of people who can prove that they are of the necessary age.  The money paid in old age pensions is not entirely lost to the State, as the contributions of nine or ten shillings a week very often come back in the shape of revenue.  These people cannot indulge in luxuries.  They can only buy the merest necessities of life. A more generous outlook should be taken by pensions officers when cases come up for review.  The best means of doing that would, in my opinion, be to have a closer co-operation between the committees and the Department which administers the fund.  There should be joint responsibility.  If the onus was placed upon the sub-committees in various districts, and if they were put upon their honour to report faithfully they would do so.  In that way a good deal of distress would be relieved and people who gave real human service to the State would be put in a fairly independent position. They are entitled, after all, to be in that position.  In many districts, where <Col N="98" /> the land is poor and where the means of getting money by selling the produce of the land is scanty, the people have no other prospects beyond the old age pension.  The pensions granted in my area are generally very small, and vary from three shillings to six shillings a week.  They seldom reach the maximum amount.  That shows that the sub-committees are very conscientious in the matter of dispensing public funds. Special regard should be paid to cases in which people reach the age or a little over it.  People of 70 or 72 years of age very often have no means of finding out what their age is.  I trust that that fact will be borne in mind, and that the Minister will direct the attention of inspectors to it.  It will relieve great distress, and the money will not be lost to the country.</P>

      <P>It is rather pleasant for some of us who have somewhat severely criticised the administration in regard to old age pensions for the last four or five years to be able to say that the attitude now adopted by those administering the Act is a good deal less rigid than it used to be.  I would endorse what has been said about the officials of the Department concerned.  I have had experience of the very sympathetic way that cases have been dealt with by them, and I would like if the Minister would endeavour to have the same attitude adopted by the pension officers who have to deal with the claims.  Deputy Davin, I think, stated that the local officers usually adopt the attitude of being hostile to claims and take up the position of viewing each claim with suspicion until it is formally established. In my opinion the attitude of officers should be a great deal different, and they ought to be considerably more helpful to claimants than they are.  Their whole attitude, so far as a good many of them are concerned, seems to be purely automatic, and they seem to confine themselves to dissenting from any recommendations made by the pensions committees in connection with claims.  The appeals appear to be entered automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other matters that require attention.  The question of age is frequently a source of trouble to <Col N="99" /> applicants and, when appeals are entered and questions of age are involved, applicants are often in a difficulty about getting the proper kind of evidence to satisfy the Department. Those of us who have experience of this kind of work would, perhaps, be able to help applicants, but generally they are not able to understand the type of evidence that would be acceptable to the Department.  Claims are consequently rejected, and the whole machinery of lodging fresh claims and the same routine of going before the Committee have to be gone over again. Some arrangement should be made whereby, if applicants are in a position to furnish additional information, the claims could be decided by the Department on that additional information rather than having applicants to go through the whole routine again, thus involving considerable delay and loss of a certain amount of pension.  A fair case could also be made for removing disqualification in the case of people who enter county homes.  Most of those who go into county homes are people who are destitute and who have nothing whatever, not a penny, to exist on.  When they leave the county home they often have to wait for three or four weeks for a meeting of the local committee.  That is a matter of great hardship.  If it is possible to remove that hardship it should be removed.</P>
    <P>As I say, pension officers should be more helpful to applicants.  A great many people who make claims, which afterwards become the subject of appeal, have not the slightest idea how to establish their cases when they get appeal notices.  The officers should adopt a more helpful and sympathetic attitude to claimants of that type and should assist them in putting their cases properly before the authorities. The few matters which I have mentioned appear to be the only criticisms which I have to offer, but I wish to express the hope that the legislation which the Minister has promised in regard to blind pensions may be expedited. A good many causes of complaints have been removed, but others still remain, and I hope that they, too, <Col N="100" /> will be removed so as to make the system better than it is.</P>

      <P>There is only one item on which I would lay stress, and that is in connection with the onus put on applicants to prove their age.  I have had some considerable intercourse with the Department responsible and I must bear out what Deputy Murphy has said in regard to the officials, as those with whom I came into contact were considerate and sympathetic, but in some cases they were bound by regulations which they found it impossible to overcome.</P>
      <P>I had one case of an old woman who applied for a pension in the usual way. Her case was turned down on the grounds, as stated, that she had not sufficient proof of her age.  I went into the matter and found that she was born in the Rotunda Hospital.  In the records of the hospital it was stated that a Mrs. So and So had given birth to a daughter.  The child's name was not entered in the hospital register, and very considerable trouble arose as to whether the applicant in this case was the particular person born on a particular date in the hospital.  After a time, by accident, I came across the idea of finding out if this woman had any other sisters.  I discovered she was an only daughter, and after a time the Department accepted that as sufficient proof of her age.  She subsequently got her pension and the back money. I am not making the claim that there is anything due.  During the time, however, that the claim was under consideration, and before it was granted, she was in a very poor state of health. It was a great hardship on her to have to wait from week to week until this technical difficulty was got over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several cases in which it is impossible to produce baptismal certificates. It frequently happens that pages are missing from parish records. In cases of that kind I would suggest to the Minister that he should take the recommendation of the local pensions committee in regard to a person's claim and accept that as final one way or the other.  I suppose it will be said that I am rather fortunate, but in any transactions that I have had with the Old Age Pension Department where <Col N="101" /> genuine claims were made satisfaction was given.  There is always difficulty, of course, in proving the date of birth, in the sense of being able to produce a birth or baptismal certificate.  I hope that the Minister will try to bring in some regulation which will be a help to the officials of his Department in cases such as I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I desire to support what Deputy Hogan said in asking the Minister to give consideration to an amendment of the principal Act in the case of returned nationals from America.  One case was recently brought to my notice.  It was that of an old woman who, when she was out in America, sent money home regularly to help an infirm brother and sister. When she had saved some money in America she came home and spent her savings on the support of her infirm brother and sister.  Now, that woman herself is deaf and blind.  She is in a destitute condition, and is ruled out from getting the old age pension herself on the grounds that she lived outside of this country for a period of more than twelve years.  I think that is very hard.  We must look at her case in this light, that when she was in health and vigour herself she did her part in sending home means from America for the support of an infirm brother and sister.  In that way, she did her part in helping the State. Now, because all her money is gone she is left destitute by the State.  Her case is a very sad one, and something should be done to meet it and others of the same kind.  It is very hard indeed that people like her should be ruled out from getting the old age pension under the residential section in the Act.  That section should not be rigidly adhered to in cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing but the best to say of the officials in the old age pension branch.  When I went to them with cases from my constituency the claims I made were considered with courtesy and care.  In fact, that is no new thing with me.  I found that out years ago. I do not believe that I ever said anything against them here in recent years as to the authorisation of pensions. There were some cases that I fought very strongly with the Department.  In <Col N="102" /> some of those cases, I found out afterwards that the means of the people involved were more than double that laid down in the Act, and that the information supplied to me was altogether wrong.  I always found, when I put up a fair case, that the officials met me in a courteous way, and were always willing to do what they could to help the applicants.  On the question of returned nationals, I hope that the Minister for Finance will give that his earnest consideration.  It is very hard on these people who, while out of the country sent their hard earned savings home for the support of relatives, that they should be deprived of the pension in their old age, and especially when they are in great need of it, simply on the grounds that they were out of the country for a certain period of years. If the Minister does something to remedy that situation I think he will have the support of Deputies in all parts of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MULLINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion before the House.  This is one of the few Votes that I would like to see increased.  The one criticism that I have to offer is under Sub-head B &mdash; Expenses of Pension Committees, £7,500.  In the present condition of things, and under the present powers conferred on local pensions committees, I think that a considerable amount of money could be saved if we were honest in abolishing them and allowed the pension officers to have full and complete dictatorial power.  From the experience that I have had of local pensions committees, I am forced to believe, as a Deputy said here some time ago, that they are only registering machines for the local pension officers' decisions.  They have really no power of granting pensions.  I sympathise with the complaints made by several Deputies as to the want of co-operation between the local pensions officers and committees.  It seems to be the procedure on the part of the local pensions officers, immediately a claim is passed by the local pensions committee, to dissent and object.  I have found, in a few cases, a want of sympathy and a lack of understanding on the part of the pensions officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases of appeal, I think, as Deputy <Col N="103" /> Clery has said, that there is a want in the Act.  That want is either to give the local pensions committees increased powers, to trust to their judgments and their sense of citizenship to see that the powers given are not abused, or else abolish them and be honest, and let the pension officer be the dictator. Deputy Shaw raised a point and suggested that it should be taken up with the British Government.  That reminds me that there is a little item in the Minister's regulations which should be taken up with the Government here with regard to British war pensions. In the constituency from which I come there are several towns.  This matter vitally affects a number of old people in them.  In the town I come from, the battle of Jutland in 1916 took its toll of the people in the place. Several of the old people were in receipt of British war pensions for the loss of their sons.  Because these people were getting 10/- a week the Free State Government refused to grant them the old age pension on reaching the statutory age.  I think that is not only unfair but very mean. I do not see why, when a person attains the age of seventy, consideration should be given to money which comes from a foreign Government, and which is not paid out of the pockets of the Irish taxpayers, in recognition of services rendered to that Government by the sons of the applicants concerned. I brought a case in this connection a short time ago before the Department, and it was turned down. I should like the Minister to give us some indication of Governmental policy regarding cases of the nature I have mentioned.  I do not see why such people should be debarred from receiving the old age pension because they are in receipt of moneys which are not paid by the taxpayers of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>On the question of harshness, I am sorry to say I cannot agree with several of the Deputies who have spoken.  As to the grounds on which means are assessed, I have had a considerable number of cases within the last six months, and I found that in each case there has been considerable <Col N="104" /> cause for complaint on this question of means.  I would like some directions would be given to the pensions officer by the responsible authority in Dublin to have a little bit of human understanding and tact when dealing with these cases.  These people cannot hit back themselves.  They cannot fight their own battles and have to rely on somebody else to do it for them.  More often than not the person on whom they depend is not in a position to deal with the real facts, and the result is that these people are thereby injured.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words on the question of proof of age, which is a matter of great importance. I have from time to time come across cases in East Cork where it is utterly impossible to get baptismal certificates. We have got people who know the applicants for pensions to make affidavits, but in many cases these affidavits are of no avail.  In some cases people who have been drawing the old age pension have made affidavits concerning other people, and no notice has been taken of them by the pensions officer.  I think that when people make an affidavit that they have known an applicant for a pension a certain number of years and had gone to school with the applicant it is unfair that notice should not be taken of that affidavit.  In certain cases names on school roll books would not be taken as proof of age.  If there is any little doubt at all the benefit of it should be given to the applicant.  I ask the Minister to try and see his way to deal as leniently as possible with these poor old people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. S. JORDAN Mr. S. JORDAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Vote, as practically every point of importance has been already dealt with.  When the question of means crops up it is the custom of the Department to attribute means to certain applicants for pensions who have safeguarded their interests by having an agreement with a son or daughter. as the case may be, when getting married. It is the custom down the country to have a marriage agreement People may not believe that, but it is a fact.  It is not all a matter of love affairs in the country.  People protect <Col N="105" /> their own interests, and the father and mother do not relinquish their rights. There is generally a settlement whereby they get a room in the house and are clothed and fed, and simply because of that agreement the old age pensions officer puts it against them as means.  If this agreement were not made probably those sons or daughters might tell their fathers or mothers after a few years that they were not wanted in the house, and then these old people would find themselves inmates of a county home, and that would cost the rates a certain amount of money every year.  The rates are saved by that agreement to which I have referred, but because of the agreement the Government refuses to give to these people the pension to which they are entitled.  I think that is a point the Minister ought to consider.  This marriage settlement ought not to be brought up against these old people who are protecting their own interests by living on in their own homes until it pleases God to call them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards proof of age, there are thousands of cases where people cannot produce baptismal certificates.  In these cases the custom is to swear affidavits and send them up.  Incidentally I might mention, pension or no pension, the affidavits are never returned. A lot depends on the particular man who drafts the affidavit.  I have heard it stated on reliable authority that the affidavits in many cases are not worth the paper on which they are written, because they are not properly worded. Some person in a district thinks he is able to draft an affidavit, and he puts into it the words &ldquo;I believe the person is such and such an age.&rdquo;  When the affidavit goes to the Department the technical point is raised that the words &ldquo;I believe&rdquo; are not sufficient.  To get over that difficulty I would make the recommendation for the Minister's consideration that the Department would draft a form of affidavit which would be acceptable, that the pensions officers should get a supply of them, and in cases where a person makes an application for a pension and is refused on the grounds of age the pensions officer should supply the affidavit drafted by the Department to the old people, who <Col N="106" /> would then know that in swearing an affidavit they were swearing a properly-worded one.  Some people might say that these old people would swear anything.  I do not think that is true. I believe that when swearing an affidavit they do so to the best of their ability, and they swear what they believe to be facts.  I ask the Minister to take that suggestion into consideration. If he thinks it would be an advisable thing to do it might save a lot of bother in the future in connection with old age pensions.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies who have had recourse to the Department have stated that they have been treated very fairly and decently by the officials there.  I would like to add my tribute to others in that connection.  I had several cases of appeals regarding old age pensions, and I must say that any time I went to the Department I was met very fairly there.  In cases where pensions officers had appealed against the decision, if there was any slight evidence in favour of the applicant for pension that could be brought forward in support of the original claim the Department was certainly very fair in the matter.  In a good many cases I was successful, and the pension was given to these people although the pensions officer had appealed against the granting of it.  I would like to say that, as far as the Department is concerned, they do their utmost certainly to meet all cases of appeal.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by asking the Minister to give consideration to the point about the affidavits, if he thinks it is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SMITH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the suggestion made by Deputy Maguire, that there should be closer co-operation between the pensions officers and the local sub-committees. It seems to me that the pensions officers who functioned under the British regime have a kind of feeling that Pension Committees were not very scrupulous during that time, and that perhaps these are composed, even yet, of men who are not very scrupulous.  I think it is only right to inform the Minister that as far as we know there is a complete change of heart on the part of the local committees and that they realise <Col N="107" /> their responsibility to the fullest.  I think, when the pension sub-committees make recommendations, especially where means are involved, that more co-operation should certainly exist between the pension officers and these committees.  I find that there is not that co-operation that should be there. I think that is a very good suggestion, and I hope that more recognition will be taken of the recommendations and decisions of the sub-committee in the future in this matter.</P>

      <P>In my district I find that about ten or twelve years ago pensions were allotted to poor old women whose sons had married at that time.  Now that pension was a reduced one, and since that time a family of seven or eight have grown up.  As I said, the pension was a reduced one at the time it was granted, because of the means and the land.  But I hold that when seven or eight children come along they over-balance the means, and they should be taken into account now.</P>
      <P>There is another case in my particular district, a particular case where a woman, when giving the wages of her husband, said he was a labouring man getting ordinary wages.  The pensions officer found out that he was a road steward getting £2 a week.  That was only two or three years after she had enjoyed the ten shillings a week.  He found that she had £60 overdrawn. Now he is paying her the pension only by giving her credit for the ten shillings a week in the £60 she has overdrawn. The woman has now to be supported out of the rates, because her husband died a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now making an appeal to the Minister.  I was trying the other day to find him, but I could not catch up with him.  I am making the appeal now before the whole House, and I am sure there is not a Deputy here who would object to the woman getting the 10/- a week now.  I ask that the poor old woman get a clear sheet after having paid £30 out of the £60 that was overdrawn. If she is given back the 10/- a week it will be a relief to the rates. She will drop out of the rates, and we have a lot of people ready to drop into her shoes.  I make a personal appeal <Col N="108" /> to the Minister.  I am afraid to go home if I cannot do something for her in this case.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Daly in that case, because I know the particulars of it.  I was, however, astonished to hear that there was any Minister that Deputy Daly could not capture.  I would also wish to support Deputy Mullin's statement here that you either wipe out the committees or give them at least some power.  I think the action of the pensions officers in many cases is to be deplored, particularly with regard to the matter of means.  I happen to be a member of a pensions sub-committee. Some of these reports came up before us and the actual valuation of means was ridiculous.  There was a valuation of so many hens which were on the poor old woman's place, and there was a valuation placed on so many eggs in the year.  I do not know whether the pensions officer was in consultation with anybody or if he valued how many eggs would the hen lay in the year.  I think it is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Very small farmers, in making over their places to their sons on marriage, keep a room in the house.  They have their meals and clothing, and so on. Now very often the owner of that farm at the present day is a man with a wife and young family to support, and if he has to provide for the support of the father and mother in addition he is apt to clear out and leave the place and all there.  As the Minister is aware, at the present day, those small farmers are not able to pay their way, not to mind supporting their fathers and mothers.  The stopping of the old age pension on these grounds&mdash;and it is occurring every day&mdash;is very unjust and unfair.  I think in these cases the Minister should make some special change in the arrangement by which these old people will not be victimised in this manner.  You have the case of a small holding with a valuation of £50, perhaps some of them as low as £10 valuation, in which the old couple keep a room in the house and they get their clothing and, therefore, under the existing arrangement they are to be kept out of their pension on that account. That is unjust and unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> In regard to the onus of proof, that is another matter that is unfair.  We had several cases of that description in my area recently, and I must say that as far as I could judge the objections of the pensions officer were totally unsound. The people were, apparently at any rate, over seventy years.  I think that the victimisation of these people, because they cannot bring forward their birth certificates, is very unfair.</P>
    <P>I submit that where people in the district who know them and who are themselves over seventy years, and who can vouch that those people are older than they are themselves, should be sufficient for them in the way of proving their age.  I would ask the Minister to give very serious and definite consideration to the case of small farmers in this matter of means. Farmers at present have very little means, and if they have to support the old parents the burden will be too heavy, and it only means that these people will have to be wiped out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJKillane" hpid="Mr. KILLANE Mr. KILLANE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KILLANE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one phase of the question about old age pensioners to which I would direct the attention of the Minister.  That is the case of the small farmer who has a grown-up son.  The choice that is presented to that son is to wait for the father to die or to go to America or some other country to earn a living. Everybody in this House recognises that it is a loss to this country to have so many of the youth leaving the land. The old fellow will not give up the farm to the son and allow him to get married until he himself dies.  He will hold on to it.  It is not worth the son's while waiting for a little bit of land, perhaps five or ten acres.  He has no choice but to go to America or wait until he is almost ready to draw the old age pension himself.  That is a phase of the question that ought to be considered in its national aspect.  The Minister should devote some little thought to it.  It will be the means of keeping at least one member of a family at home, and it will put the land into the possession of the young, energetic man, who will be able to manage it both in his own interest and for the benefit of the State.  A man of <Col N="110" /> seventy years is not able to do much farm work, either to his own advantage or to the advantage of the country.  There are many farms from five to fifteen acres in extent, and it is hardly worth a young fellow's while to wait for ten or twenty years for the old fellow to die, wishing probably every day for his death.  It is not worth a young man's while to wait so long in order to take over possession. Possibly the land would come into his hands when he would be a cripple and almost entitled to the pension.</P>

      <P>One of the main grievances of applicants for pensions is that the details with regard to their means are not furnished to them.  A list of the items that comprise their means, together with a list of the prices charged, all of which go to make up the statement that the pensions officer prepares, is never furnished.  An applicant is informed that he has been refused a pension on the grounds of means.  The old person, who in most cases is unable to read or write, is expected to make a statement refuting what has been submitted by the pensions officer.  The applicant has no idea of what comprises the statement of means, and he does not know how it is made up.  He is, nevertheless, asked to submit proof that his means do not exceed a certain amount which is submitted by the pensions officer.  I do not see how, in the present circumstances, he can do that.  Either the Committee or the pensioner should be furnished with a list of the items that go to make up the statement of means.  The Committee should have that, and the pensioner should have access to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. KILROY Mr. KILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>We find in the West that the stipulations between old people and their children who are about to be married, or who are actually married, are one of the greatest obstacles to the old people receiving pensions.  It is quite natural that the old people, in parting with a little farm, would make a stipulation of that kind as regards maintenance, and it is not fair that such an item should debar those poor people from receiving a pension.  They have been paying taxes all their lives, and it is a very serious problem for <Col N="111" /> them if they are debarred from receiving a pension.  The little farm is not sufficient for them to live on, and when they come to this age, a little item of the kind I have mentioned should not debar them from their just rest.</P>
      <P>As far as blind pensions are concerned, persons must be totally blind before they can receive a pension.  I hope in the new Bill the Minister will see that there will not be any hardship on the old people as there was in the past.  People who are not really able to work because of blindness are entitled to get a pension.  They may perhaps have sight enough to walk around, but not enough to work.  I know instances where such people were deprived of pensions.  That matter requires serious consideration, because the hardships are very severe indeed.</P>
      <P>I find that the local pensions officers are usually afraid of supervision from the Local Government Department. When the Department sends down an inspector, the inspector visits the old people and interrogates them.  Instructions should be sent to the inspectors to be more considerate as far as judging the age and appearance of an old person is concerned.  I know of many instances where people who were unable to prove their age, although they had reached the limit, were deprived of their pensions.  Any lenient-minded person would easily admit that they were over seventy.  Many people who submit affidavits with regard to their age usually put a stamp of two shillings or two and sixpence on the affidavit. I understand that stamp is not at all necessary, and I think it is the duty of the officials concerned to make that known to the old people.</P>

      <P>When the Old Age Pensions Act of 1924 was passed the Minister for Local Government and myself interviewed the officials responsible for dealing with appeals, and we asked them to deal as sympathetically as they could with all cases, and if there was a real doubt to give the applicant the benefit of that doubt.  I have no doubt that the praise we have heard to-day of the appeal officials results from the instructions then given. I think, on the whole, there is very <Col N="112" /> little to complain of in the administration of the Act.  No matter what regulations or provisions we may have, difficulties will always arise.  I believe the provisions that exist at the present time are in the main satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Deputies have suggested that no attention was paid to the opinions of the local committees, and Deputies have also suggested that pensions officers appeared to have instructions to oppose all applications.  That is not so.  They have no such instructions. They are left the largest possible measure of freedom in exercising their judgment in different cases.  For instance, in estimating means, it is the duty of the officers to keep lists of prices locally and, so far as they can, give an impartial and accurate estimate of the means.  Where you have numbers of officers operating in different areas where the circumstances vary it is impossible to obtain uniformity of outlook or uniformity of treatment, and one officer is bound to take a different view from the view that would be taken by another officer in the same case, and we only get uniformity in so far as it can be got by the operations of the appeals tribunal. It is impossible to give any better instructions where there is such diversity of conditions than that officers should take all the circumstances into account and act quite impartially.  I am satisfied that officers do that, and that if there are differences they are simply honest differences that you will find in the outlook of any two men dealing with any work like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need attempt to go over the individual points raised by Deputies.  As I indicated in reply to a question the other day, the drafting of the amending legislation in regard to blind pensions seems to be extremely difficult.  It is one of those cases where, if a certain type of amendment were passed, we should find that we had departed altogether from the principle of blind pensions and had instituted a system of invalidity pensions, which is a step we are not prepared to take at present.  Meantime, while consideration is being given to this question of amending the definition of blindness, instructions have been given again for <Col N="113" /> the most sympathetic administration of the Act, and I understand that as a result of that special sympathetic administration of the Act, the number of hardships that were experienced have been very materially reduced.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we can remove the provision whereby the onus of proof of age lies on the applicant, but if any sort of reasonable evidence is given it is accepted.  Where no evidence can be given, and where no affidavit that will contain any facts that indicate that it is really based on knowledge can be made, inspectors are sent down to see the person, to talk with those who have known that person for a considerable length of time, and to come to a conclusion.  We have been using the inspectors much more frequently than in the past.  I do not know that any great change can be made in that respect.  I would remind Deputies that in the case of blind pensions and old age pensions, as in other matters, we are up against many unfounded applications and, in many cases, the cooking of evidence.  I mentioned last year, I think, that in two parishes in County Mayo a conspiracy of fraud had existed for a considerable time.  The agents of the fraud were two parish clerks who prepared false birth certificates, and the clergymen in these parishes were so careless as to sign the certificates prepared by the clerks and submitted to them without even checking them.  The result was that the Revenue authorities accepted these certificates signed by the local clergymen, and were actually defrauded of £27,000.  Things like that indicate that you can push the plea that the pensions officers should be sympathetic too far.  It is much easier and better, where sympathy has to be exercised, that it should be exercised by the appeal tribunal, and that the pensions officer, while he should not act against the applicant, should take all care to see that nobody gets a pension who is not entitled to it.  If an old age pension be given to somebody who was not entitled to it, it means on the average that from £120 to £140 of State money goes to waste.  I do not see that, in the main, any change can be made in the system, or that any steps can <Col N="114" /> be taken to give instructions to officers to scrutinise cases less carefully than they do.</P>
    <P>With regard to the old age pension committees, some time ago when some changes were being made in the law it was suggested that the committees should be abolished.  When we looked into the matter, we came to the conclusion at that time that as far as the great majority of the committees were concerned it would be all to the good to abolish them, but that there was a minority of committees who had done their work well and conscientiously. For the sake of that minority, and in the hope that we might find other committees later on taking a more serious view of their responsibilities, we retained the committees.  I am satisfied that where there is a good committee, which does not pass cases without scrutiny, and does not pass cases that it knows to be wrong, then a great deal of attention is paid to the opinion of that committee.  But where we have a careless committee, an entirely irresponsible committee, the members of which are simply out to get a little popularity by passing all the cases that come forward and by awarding the full amount, then no attention is paid to the opinion of that committee. There can only be improved co-operation between the officers and the committees according as the committees take a more serious view of their duties in the matter.  As I said, there have always been some good committees. It may be that within the past two or three years other committees have improved and that we have a greater number of good committees now.</P>
    <P>With reference to taking 10 per cent. of the value of the money in the bank as income, that is prescribed by the Act, which says that the first £25 of the capital value shall be excluded, and that the yearly value of so much of the capital as exceeds the sum of £25 shall be taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value thereof.  So that in doing that the officers were simply carrying out the provisions of the Act.  I do not think that we can ignore any kind of means in calculating what is the weekly or yearly income of a person for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions <Col N="115" /> Acts.  It does not make a bit of difference whether the money comes from a shop, a farm, a pension from the British Government, or anything of that sort.  I think it would mean a fundamental alteration of the Acts if we excluded any class of means.  I think we must include all.  If we decided, on the other hand, to abandon the means qualification altogether, it would mean a very great increase in the sum annually required, and I do not think we can make any change.</P>
    <P>It was agreed upon some time ago, and legislation is being prepared to deal with the case of people who lose their pensions going into the county homes and cannot obtain them without a fresh application.  Deputy Jordan suggested a stock affidavit.  It is not that the affidavits are valueless or that they are ignored because of their form; it is because of their substance.  I do not think if a person said: &ldquo;I believe so-and-so is seventy years of age because I am seventy-two myself and he was in the next class below me in school&rdquo; that that affidavit would not do.  The use of the words &ldquo;I believe&rdquo; would not invalidate it.  But if it is an affidavit that is entirely vague and contains no facts that the person making it knew of, then it has to be ignored. Deputy Daly mentioned a case where he thinks the pension that was fair some years ago would not be fair now because several children have to be supported out of the production of the farm who had not to be supported when the pension was given.  It is open to the pensioner to raise the question and to have the pension reviewed.</P>
    <P>With regard to people excluded on the ground of being United States citizens and for similar reasons, it is recognised that the provisions of the Act in that respect should be amended.</P>

    <P>Go ndéontar suim ná raghaidh thar £1,870 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na <Col N="116" /> bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1929, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Teaghlachus an tSeannascail (Uimh. 14 de '23).</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,870 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Governor-General's Establishment (No. 14 of '23).</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that the only new item in expenditure shown in this estimate is sub-head E &ldquo;motor car replacement fund, grant-in-aid.&rdquo;  That provision is inserted because the cars which were bought when the first Governor-General took up office have become worn out and useless, and it is necessary to purchase new cars this year.  It is intended that that sub-head should appear in the Vote every year but the amount, of course, would normally be much smaller than it is in the present instance.  This Vote arises from Article 60 of the Constitution which provides that &ldquo;the Governor-General shall be appointed in like manner as the Governor-General of Canada&rdquo; and that &ldquo;his salary shall be of the like amount as that now payable to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and shall be charged upon the public fund of the Irish Free State and suitable provision shall be made out of these funds for the maintenance of his official residence and establishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>In looking through the items of this Vote I began to wonder whether there was any one of the expenses that the ordinary individual has to meet from his salary met by the Governor-General from his salary of £10,000 a year.  Certainly the expenses of a house have not to be met by him out of it; expenses of rates have not to be met; the expense of lighting has not to be met; the expenses of his servants have not to be met.  Taking it all round, it seems to me that this Vote is characteristic of the general policy of the Government in connection with financial matters.  He has not even to <Col N="117" /> pay his doctor nor to pay his dues, for he has a chaplain.  He has not to pay his chauffeurs, or for any single thing that the ordinary man has to pay out of his salary.  Compare, for example, this total expenditure of £28,000 with one single item here&mdash;relief schemes £32,000. We spend on an absolutely useless office a sum of £28,000 a year, whereas this year, when everybody knows the conditions of unemployment, the only thing we can find for the relief schemes is a sum of £32,000.  It seems to me this whole Vote is indefensible.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance gave Article 60 of the Constitution as a reason for this expenditure.  He says that by the Constitution the salary shall be of like amount to that now payable to the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and shall be charged upon the public funds of the Irish Free State, and suitable provision shall be made out of those funds for the maintenance of his official residence and establishment.  It is not permissible for me to criticise, in this particular debate, that Article of the Constitution.  But certainly when we have seen the Constitution scrapped in a number of particulars recently, we might have thought that when a pressing burden is being placed upon the taxpayers of this country those anxious to lighten that burden might have thought it advisable to scrap that particular Article.  The Treaty does not make such an Article necessary at all.  And even in accordance with the Constitution &ldquo;suitable provision&rdquo; does not imply that over and above the salary of £10,000 we should spend £18,000 in maintaining a suitable establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now what would be suitable in a case of that kind?  Our attitude towards it is quite well known, but, even taking the position that is taken, I understand, by the Executive Council in that matter, what does &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; connote in the present condition of this country?  Compare the whole cost of that establishment with the cost of the President's own establishment.  I am not satisfied, for instance, that a reduction could not be made in the President's establishment, but, at least, we know that the President has some work to do, that there is some work to be <Col N="118" /> done by that Department.  But what work is being done by the Governor-General? I cannot see any.  I cannot see any reason whatever for the maintenance of this establishment.  The Irish people do not want it.</P>
    <P>I was looking up some of the old debates to see what justification the Minister for Finance had for it, and what view he took of the establishment, and it seems to me he wanted it to be a respectable office, a highly respectable office, the centre of a new court life or something of that kind.  Now no money that you can give will ever make that office respectable in the eyes of the Irish people.  We all know perfectly well that the Irish people, if they were allowed freely to vote, would not want any such office.  Even if we take the Treaty there is no reason whatever why such work as the Governor-General does&mdash;it means merely a signature&mdash;could not be done very well, for example, by the Chief Justice.  If he has to sign laws there is no reason why that could not be done by the Chief Justice.  We were also told that the reason for this excessive cost is that the Viceregal Lodge is a very expensive establishment to keep up, and the excuse for not going away from it a few years ago was that they did not wish to evict the then occupant.  But an opportunity arose not very long ago for them to change to a less expensive establishment, and they did not do it.</P>
    <P>I would like to know why it is that, instead of trying to diminish the costs, they are increasing them.  I had the Appropriation Accounts looked up.  We have not got the actual Accounts for last year, and we can only take the Estimates for last year and this year, but taking the Accounts that were available we find that, for example, in the year 1926-7 the establishment cost a total of £26,650; in the year 1925-6 it cost £26,219&mdash;these are actual costs, not estimates, and as far as we were able to make allowances for any refunds to any of the Votes, we have done so&mdash;in the year 1924-5 it cost £29,000. The total cost for 1922-3 and 1923-4 could not be got with the same certainty because of the fact that there was a change in the form in which <Col N="119" /> the Estimates were presented, and in which the Votes were arranged, but taking the average, we find that the amount for these years would have been over £30,000, and taking the actual Votes that were passed&mdash;those other Supplementary Votes that were affected by the establishment&mdash;we find that there was over £30,000, including the salary, in 1923-4, and very nearly the same amount in 1922-3.  Adding it all up, we find that it has cost us every year on an average over £28,000.  Again I ask what is the justification for it?</P>
    <P>Compare this with some of the other Votes.  I have already compared it with the Vote for the President's establishment.  The President's establishment costs a little over £12,000. Therefore the Governor-General's establishment is costing us about two- and-one-third times as much.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General's Department, which audits and checks all the public accounts, costs about £20,000.  The General Registry Office costs us £26,000, and, as I have said, to cap it all, the amount put down for relief this year is £32,000, while the Governor-General's establishment is £28,000.</P>
    <P>It would be well worth the while of Deputies to go through these items carefully, and see how every possible kind of expense that could be incurred is provided for.  All the Governor-General's official work is provided for, and, as I have said, he seems to have very little official work to do now&mdash;at least we are told by the Executive Council that he is not to be regarded in any sense as the representative of a foreign Power, that he must do everything he is told, and that his official work, in the long run, amounts to nothing more than signing Bills.  For all that he must have a comptroller of the household who gets £600, a chaplain £250, a medical attendant £100, a private secretary £350, an assistant private secretary £350, a clerk to the comptroller £3 a week, a typist and telephonist and two aides-de-camp, who cost on the Army Vote £1,073 and on this Vote £300.  Even the National Health and Unemployment Insurance is paid for him.</P>

      <P>Most of these are inclusive of bonus, so that the bonus does not come in here.  If by any chance he should go out and take any of his staff with him, he is allowed £275 for travelling expenses, and he has telegrams, telephones and notepaper. As I say, I cannot see what justification there is for this lavish expenditure, because it is lavish for this country.  The President of the United States of America gets a personal salary of £15,000 in that land of big salaries.  He is a working President. He is really an executive officer who does executive work, and he has 117,000,000 of the richest people in the world to contribute to that salary.  He has an area from which it is drawn which is, roughly, a hundred times the size of the whole of this island.  What are we thinking of at all when we maintain an establishment of this character at the present time?  It is said, when we criticise this Vote, that we are acting in a mean fashion; that there is something mean and petty about our action.  They say: &ldquo;Why do you not go for the big Votes?&rdquo; So we do.  We talk of the needless expenditure on the Army, the needless expenditure on the Civic Guard, as it is at present.  We talk of the needless expenditure on large salaries, because we think that when the ordinary person who is paying for the upkeep of all these is scarcely able, on the average, to make a living, it is most unfair that public servants should be getting salaries which are altogether out of proportion to the income that he is able himself to make, and we think that these big salaries can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the cases we are able to point to substantial percentages of reduction that could be made, but here the reduction we want is a reduction of 100 per cent.  If we were careful of these particular items and if a proper headline is set in these cases, the taxpayer who is asked to bear these heavy burdens might be satisfied, feeling at least that his money is being properly spent. But at present the feeling of the taxpayer is that a large part of his money is being badly spent, that there is needless waste, and that the salaries and the <Col N="121" /> general Governmental establishments are altogether out of keeping with our resources.  I have tried to express that more than once by saying that we are working on a grand imperial scale, but that if we want to be prosperous we must make up our minds not to continue expending money on establishments of this kind in this lavish manner.  If we are to be prosperous and if we are to do the best for our people we must take as our headline, not empires the revenues of which go into nearly a thousand million pounds, but some of the small countries in Europe that have resources somewhat similar to our own.  We are going to vote against this Vote, which I do not think either the President or the Minister for Finance can defend.  I do not think that anybody can defend it.  I would ask all Deputies to indicate by their votes that they are not prepared to go on spending money at this lavish rate on this establishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'CONNELL Mr. T. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a time when the reason which the Minister for Finance gave for this Vote would have had a certain weight with me, but after our experiences during this past session it does not by any means carry as much conviction to my mind as perhaps it would have done before.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the Constitution now that it should be put forward as a defence for what, I agree with Deputy de Valera, is lavish expenditure.  I do not see, and I never could see, why we should try to compare with either Canada or Australia with regard to making provision for our Governor-General. The revenue of Canada, for instance, is something like three and a half times or nearly four times as great as that of this country, and probably the same proportion would hold good in the case of Australia.  I think it is simply ridiculous for us to try to provide for the Governor-General of this State on the same scale as either of those countries, either in the matter of salaries or establishment.  I am in agreement with most of what Deputy de Valera said with regard to the lavishness of the establishment set up for the Governor-General's Office, especially as under the new arrangement, <Col N="122" /> following the last Imperial Conference, whatever duties the Governor-General performed are taken out of his hands and the negotiations with the British Government are no longer carried out by him.  Apart from signing Bills, really I do not know what work the Governor-General has to do that he should have all these typists, an assistant private secretary &mdash; yes, and a private secretary.  I think that if and while we have a Governor-General, a very much simpler establishment would be more in keeping with this country. It is not as if that establishment was the accepted centre of the social life of the country.  That is not the position; and I do not believe that it ever will be the position.  I think there is no reason &mdash; no good reason that I can see &mdash; why a very much simpler establishment would not suit the situation. Certainly at a time when the financial position is such as it is, there can be no justification for making provision on the lavish scale made for the Governor-General, and as a protest I intend to vote against the motion.</P>

      <P>It is with some hesitation that I rise to speak on this Vote. Amid the details of an estimate which concerns a person who lives in all the reflected glory of royalty an ordinary Republican like myself must tread very gingerly.  When one gazes at this magnificent structure which has been built up to commemorate our national degradation, one is inclined to feel a sense of awe, a sense which continues until gradually one remembers that this magnificent establishment, and all its glory, is being maintained and paid for by the average working man when he buys an ounce of plug or a bottle of stout, or by his wife when she invests in a pound of sugar.  It is no doubt desirable in the minds of those with the proper Imperial outlook that the representative of his Britannic Majesty should be given all the outward symbols of respectability, but we cannot forget that the people who have to pay for these symbols do not themselves enjoy a fraction of the luxuries which this gentleman is enjoying, and will continue to enjoy, no doubt, while the present system prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not attempt to overstep the <Col N="123" /> rules of order and on this Estimate advocate any alteration in the existing law.  I know that the Ceann Comhairle would probably object to my doing so, but I think that I can advocate a considerable alteration in this Estimate, within the existing law, because, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, the Constitution merely makes it compulsory on the Government to provide this gentleman with a suitable establishment. I have no doubt that when the members of the Executive Council were considering what was or was not a suitable establishment they looked all round the wide world for instances of similar establishments elsewhere, and they tried to judge by what they learned from conditions in Canada, Australia and similar States what should, in their opinion, be a suitable establishment for the Governor-General here.  But I suggest to them that if instead of having looked to Canada and Australia for a standard by which to judge, they had looked at Ireland only, they would have arrived at a very different result.  There are 78,000 people in Dublin living in single rooms in tenement houses.  Are these suitable establishments? Is it contended that any single one of these people has a suitable establishment for an Irish citizen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet they are there living under these conditions, and the number living under these conditions has increased since the present Government took office.  Apparently the present Government considers that such conditions form a suitable establishment for Irish citizens.  We must remember that they are under no compulsion whatever to provide an establishment any more lavish than that which those 78,000 citizens enjoy, for this person styled the Governor-General. They will, in any case, have to pay the salary of £10,000 yearly. That is one of the commitments they made which cannot be questioned here and now but they need not necessarily provide him with anything more or better than a single room in a tenement building in Dublin as his establishment, <Col N="124" /> and living in that establishment, he would be able, I think, to give his Imperial masters a much more truthful account of conditions in Ireland than he could possibly give under present conditions.  We ask Deputies, in considering this Vote, to remember that every halfpenny expended under any of the different headings here is coming out of the pockets of our people and that these people cannot afford to pay.  Let us look down the items of this Vote.  I think we will find that the great majority of the posts mentioned and the different items of expense referred to are absolutely unnecessary.  The first item is the Comptroller of the Household.  The Governor-General is a married man and yet, although he is a married man, we have to spend £600 a year to provide him with a Comptroller of his household.  A man who cannot control his own household is not fit to be put into a responsible position.  I do not know what purpose this Comptroller of the Household is intended to provide for.  He, no doubt, supervises the distribution of strawberries and cream at garden parties and other useful functions of the kind.  He acts as a sort of head waiter at an hotel, because it seems to me that what the Government are establishing at Phoenix Park is not a residence for the Governor-General but a sort of glorified hotel, an hotel at which no fees are charged and to which anybody can come if he is lucky enough to possess an invitation and a silk hat, because a silk hat is a sine qua non to an invitation.  Having provided him with a Comptroller who will control the household when Mrs. Governor-General permits him we find also that he has a medical attendant. No doubt the medical attendant is consequent on the Comptroller of the Household, but in case the medical attendant is unskilful we also provide him with a chaplain, a necessary precaution, a chaplain supplemented by a private secretary.  The private secretary is so overworked that he is provided with an assistant private secretary, and the Comptroller in the counting of the strawberries is provided with an assistant also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The other items mentioned here under the different subheads are also equally illuminating.  We must remember that we have already expended £10,000 in the salary of the Governor-General and £2,375 to provide for his household.  We then allow him a mere £3,000 to meet his expenses and, having allowed him that, we allow him a mere £275 to pay for his travelling expenses.</P>
      <P>Then we come to the most illuminating portion of the whole lot.  Telegrams and telephones &mdash; £200 for telephones. Sit down with a piece of paper and work out how many telephone calls in the year that amounts to at three-halfpence a call.  The Governor-General cannot possibly leave the telephone all day.  He must make an average of about 90 calls a day in order to realise that total of £200 a year.  The Estimate for telegrams appears to have been prepared before the Government decided upon the recent Telegraphic Act which increased their charge, or else, possibly, they anticipated that the Governor-General would do what most other citizens did after that Act was passed, proceed to send fewer telegrams. Twenty pounds a year for telegrams and £200 a year for telephones is, I think, an item not exceeded by the biggest business establishment.  I would like to get some Deputy to inform us of some business establishment of any size whose telephone bill or telegraphic bill in the year exceeds that of the Governor-General. We notice, of course, that it is estimated he will not use the telephone this year as much as before, and that is something to congratulate ourselves on.  The starving taxpayers of this country will no doubt be delighted to know that the Governor-General expects to spend £80 less this year because he will not have to use the telephone so often.  We are going to provide him with a new car for which we are paying £1,000.  It is not going to be a Ford or an Irish-made car.  He is going to import a car.</P>

      <P>I would like the Executive Council to make representations to the Governor-General to provide that in the expenditure of the £1,000 at least the body of the car would be made in Ireland.  There are quite a large number of people in this country engaged in the coachbuilding industry and in consequence of the delay of the Government, in meeting their application for a tariff, a number of them are unemployed.  I see no reason, as we are going to provide the Governor-General with a new car, why we should not at least ensure that the body of it would be constructed in this country.  It would, I think, be a fitting symbol of the national position to have a representative of his Britannic Majesty attending garden parties in an Irish-built motor car.</P>
      <P>The entire sum, however, represents an unnecessary luxury and I would ask Deputies to realise that there is no compulsion whatsoever upon the Executive Council to pay one halfpenny of the amount mentioned in this Estimate.  The Treaty did not compel them to do so.  There is nothing in the Constitution.  It is merely their generosity.  They want to give this little indication of appreciation for all the favours received from the individual whom the Governor-General represents.

Let him come amongst us.  Let him know exactly the same enjoyment and the same restrictions that we ourselves know.  Why put him above us on a pinnacle to which none of us can ever hope to attain?  Let him know the conditions under which the Irish people live and he will perhaps return in due course to those who sent him here and tell them that it is not worth their while spending anything or wasting their time considering plans for the subjection of our people.  If they knew the poverty under which the people are living and the gullibility of the representatives these people elect periodically they would realise that they would never have any difficulty whatsoever in reimposing their sway on this country, no matter for how long a period they relinquish it.  While we can get a majority here, and a Government elected by that majority in this Dáil, supporting a Vote of this nature, then there is no hope for Ireland except we put a wall around it and describe it, as many have described it already, as a home for those mentally incurable.</P>

      <P>We were invited in connection with this discussion to roam over practically every item of our expenditure and compare it with the several items which go to make up our Budget.  Deputy Lemass said that there were 78,000 people living in single-room dwellings in Dublin.  The number has increased since we came into office.  We provided over 30,000 persons in the City of Dublin with houses of their own since we came into office. Notwithstanding the fact, there has been an increase.  That has been provided out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, but if this money were to be saved, or if we regarded it as a sum which could be saved, it would not have enabled us to have built any more houses than we did during that period. The situation is as Deputies have correctly described it.  This is one of the institutions which has arisen out of the Treaty.  It is part of an honourable understanding which was arrived at at that time and embodied in the Constitution. I do not agree with Deputy de Valera that the Chief Justice should perform the functions of the Governor-General with regard to the signing of laws.  That is one of the things which we endeavoured from the beginning to keep clear of, namely, that those who are to interpret the law should not make it.  I think it will commend itself in future to those who come after us.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Legislature of which the Governor-General is part should be distinct from the Judiciary. The Deputy when considering the matter will, after mature consideration, come to the conclusion that what I have said is correct.  If he only subscribes his name he is part of the machinery which makes the law and he should not be called on to interpret it.  It so happened that the establishment which the Governor-General occupied <Col N="129" /> from the beginning is an expensive one, and it does not mean that if we vacated that establishment a corresponding saving would result.  If Deputies would look over the Appropriation Accounts for the past few years they would find that when the Chief Secretary's Lodge was vacant the cost of upkeep was fairly considerable. I may say, for my own part, notwithstanding the work in my office, no matter how laborious it is, I would prefer to do it than perform the functions which the Governor-General has to perform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. WARD</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been from all sides of the House speeches strongly in favour of the terms of this motion. It affords me much pleasure to support the motion moved by Deputy Tadhg Murphy.  The enthusiasm of Deputies from various quarters of the House appears to be controlled or damped by one factor alone, and that is the possible financial commitments of a scheme such as one in the terms of the motion. When we come to examine the possible cost of this pensions scheme for widows and orphans, we would require to be in a position to estimate the amount of money already expended in the various forms of relief for that section of the community.  There ought not to be any difficulty in ascertaining the exact <Col N="134" /> amount of money expended on home assistance or in institutions such as orphanages, industrial schools, county homes and other institutions availed of by orphan children or by widows.</P>
      <P>A greater difficulty will be experienced in arriving at anything like an approximate figure of the amount of money contributed by the ordinary taxpayer and disbursed by charitable organisations. Before we would be in a position to form a reasoned judgment as to whether the resources of the country could bear an additional strain at the moment we would require to have these detailed figures before us. Such charitable organisations as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Society for Distressed Protestants, and the various other charitable organisations distribute an enormous amount of money that I believe would surprise the members of this House, and probably surprise the Ministers concerned in this particular motion, if we were able to arrive at anything like approximately accurate figures.  Personally I believe that when these figures are placed before the House we will come to realise that a State scheme of pensions for necessitous widows and orphans will not inflict the heavy burden on the tax-paying community that some members of this House would ask us to believe it would inflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are obvious disadvantages attached to the various existing forms of relief.  The Minister for Local Government, when he spoke on this motion some days ago, seemed to be under the impression that a system of outdoor relief, properly administered, ought to meet all the reasonable requirements. I cannot think that anybody who has any knowledge of the method of administration of home assistance, in rural Ireland at any rate, will agree with the Minister for Local Government that it is a desirable form of relief.  There is no doubt about it that the taint of pauperism is attached to this particular form of relief.  The fact that circumstances have changed somewhat in this part of Ireland does not remove the taint of pauperism that is associated with the medical charities system, and the system of what was formerly outdoor relief, and which is <Col N="135" /> now called by the more acceptable term home assistance.  In most of the areas there are the same relieving officers administering this money that administered the outdoor relief under the old regime.  It is a well known fact to anyone who has been in any kind of intimate touch with local administration down the country that this question of outdoor relief is a matter which is very keenly debated at present by public bodies.</P>
    <P>I know myself, from Press reports and debates, where one area of a county is compared with another, and the area that has the biggest amount of expenditure in relieving this particular form of distress is held up to public ridicule by public representatives. In fact, in some areas I think they have almost gone so far as to threaten to publish a list of widows and orphans, and such classes of people, who are in receipt of home assistance. I submit that is a disgraceful state of affairs.  The disadvantages of the system of relief distributed by charitable organisations are equally obvious to anyone who has examined this question any way closely.  I do not think anybody will suggest that charitable organisations do not fulfil a very useful function in this country.  I think we would be all very sorry that charitable organisations should cease to exist, but the widows and orphans should be taken out of the domain of public charity.  That much at least is due to them.  If they were removed from the domain of public charity, there would still be plenty of scope left for the charitable organisations among the remainder of the existing poor.  The great drawback I see in this particular method of relief for widows and orphans is that the drain is very often borne by the people who cannot best afford it, the people who are charitably disposed, and who have perhaps more human kindness in them than their neighbours; or people who for one reason or another are in close contact with these charitable organisations, bear the burden of supplying the finances, whereas the materialistic, indifferent and selfish section of the community that perhaps could better afford to contribute towards the upkeep of <Col N="136" /> the widows and orphans are allowed to go scot free.</P>
    <P>I think that some form of State scheme that would secure a more universal distribution of the burden is certainly desirable.  No matter how well institutions are run, no matter how well these various institutions that are being utilised by the destitute or necessitous orphans at present &mdash; no matter how well these are run the result cannot be the same as the result that is achieved in the home.  Everybody will, I think, agree that the children reared in these institutions bear a certain hall-mark that is not an asset to them in life.  I think every sensible man in this House will agree that the influence of the mother in the home cannot be replaced in any institution. That is an aspect of the question that we ought to keep in our minds when we are considering the possibility of a financial burden that any scheme that we might devise would inflict on the people.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in this House that if we adopt a scheme of insurance or a contributory scheme of pensions the burden will have to be borne by the small farmers and small shopkeepers.  I would like to say, and I think there are many Deputies in this House on these Benches and on the other side of the House will agree with me, that any scheme of pensions that will have our support will be a scheme that will be for the benefit of the widows and orphans of small shopkeepers and small farmers if they are in distress or if they come under the head of &ldquo;necessitous.&rdquo; The motion standing in the name of Deputy Murphy asks the Executive Council to present to the House schemes and an estimate of the cost of such schemes, and in that connection I would like to draw the attention of the House to a statement by the Minister for Finance on the 17th October last.  The statement appears in column 493 of the Official Report in which the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it would be a good thing for the Executive Council to examine the matter, to get out such figures as could be got out to prepare the best estimates that could <Col N="137" /> be prepared of the cost of applying to the Saorstát the scheme which is in operation in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland, and to examine what modifications, if any, would be necessary to make that scheme properly applicable here, having regard to the fact, for instance, that the proportion of people in health insurance is less here than in the North.  I think it would be, as I say, quite proper that the Executive Council should conduct that examination and should lay the results of it before the House so that a motion or a Bill dealing with this matter could be more satisfactorily discussed by the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on in the debate, in reply to Deputy J.X. Murphy, the Minister for Finance indicated that in his opinion he would require from two to three months to be in a position to put such figures as he mentions here before the House.  The Minister for Finance may be deserving of criticism for not having gone into this question during the past twelve months while this motion was on the Order Paper.  The fact remains, however, that he did not do it, and that he now admits the desirability of going into this question and putting the figures before this House.  Personally I do not think that the detailed information that we would require before we could form an opinion on this important question can be available in a less period than two or three months. Deputy Law professed to be anxious to avoid a party attitude on this question. His own action in introducing the amendment, that will very probably prove acceptable to the Government, is certainly calculated to give this debate a party tone.  I am surprised that Deputy Law should lend himself to such a manoeuvre if it would be correct to describe it in that way.  If his amendment were carried it would mean that the question was going to be shelved in all probability for the lifetime of the present Government.  Deputy Law's amendment requests &ldquo;that this House requests the Executive Council to take into special consideration whether, etc., etc.&rdquo;  Deputy Law requests the Executive Council to take certain matters into special consideration.  That does not bring us any further&mdash;to take these <Col N="138" /> matters into consideration.  What this House requires, and what this House is asked for in Deputy Murphy's motion, is that certain figures be laid before this House in order that this House may make up its mind whether the burden can be shouldered or not. The House is not asked to affirm that anything in particular should be done. It is asked to affirm that it is desirable that a certain thing should be done if it can be done.</P>
    <P>We will probably be told that money is not available for this particular object, and, however desirable it might be, that the money cannot be found to give us a scheme as generous as the scheme in existence in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We must face the fact that money in plenty is available for matters that are not as important as widows and orphans. There is no scarcity of money when it comes to supplying pensions to ex members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, to ex-civil servants or ex-members of the Saorstát Army.  But when it comes to a question of improving the social conditions of the poor the money cannot be found.  That is a state of things that has to be altered.  I think we have had ample evidence during this debate of the necessity for a careful examination of this question.  Evidence was supplied by the extraordinary discrepancy between the figures placed before us by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health estimates that a scheme of pensions such as is in operation for the North of Ireland for a particular class would involve a cost of two and a half million pounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the statement I meant to make.  I am sorry if it is not the statement I made.  The Minister for Finance informed us that the maximum amount would be £750,000. There is room, at any rate, regardless of how the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would explain his figures, for a detailed examination of what the actual cost would probably be.  I do not think the House can refuse to insist that this question be examined.  We are asking for nothing more.  We are committing ourselves to nothing.  We express that it is a desirable thing that a pensions scheme should be inaugurated.  The House is asked to express its opinion that such a thing is desirable, and in order to show whether it is possible to put such a scheme into operation or not, we are asking the Executive Council to place all the facts and figures that are available before us.  These facts and figures will be examined and analysed by the House, and I believe that when they are examined and gone into, if we are not in a position to give as generous attention to the widows and orphans as they get in the North of Ireland, that we shall certainly, without inflicting any great burden on the tax-paying community, be able to remove the taint of pauperism and give a scheme of pensions that will have the advantage of being universally distributed, and have the added advantage of a certain amount of uniformity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement that this debate has been remarkable, up to the present, for curious reasoning on the part of the Government Front Bench.  Reading the speech of the Minister for Finance one wonders by what curious system of logic he can decide that the passing of Deputy Murphy's motion would be undesirable, while at the same time he has no objection to an understanding that the Executive Council will consider the matter and publish a White Paper on the subject; or he would welcome the introduction of a Private Member's Bill dealing with the same matter.  There must be very few Deputies who can follow subtleties of that kind.  No less remarkable was the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, who started off by misrepresenting the <Col N="140" /> speeches of those who had favoured the motion and, not satisfied with misrepresenting Deputies on this side, he very seriously misrepresents his own leader. The chief point made by the Minister for Agriculture was that the small farmers and traders would have to bear the whole burden of this insurance scheme if it be agreed to pass it and put it into operation.  The small farmers and traders, mind you.  There is nothing at all about the labourers' portion of it.  One wonders why he says that the small trader and farmer will have to bear it and excepts the big portion that the labourers will have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not long ago ex-Deputy Johnson made a calculation in a weekly paper in which he showed that a Dublin working-man earning and spending £3 a week, spending it in an average way, would contribute something like fifteen guineas a year in taxation, and that is equivalent to two shillings in the pound, allowing nothing for abatement.  We all know that poor as the country is there are great numbers of workingmen earning and spending three pounds a week.  The Minister for Agriculture, who is, of course, considered a very sound economist, makes no mention whatever of the burden that Labour must bear of this charge if it be decided to impose it.  But it is not that point so much that strikes one in connection with the statement of the Minister for Agriculture as his complete repudiation of a very important speech made by the President some twelve months ago when we were considering unemployment here.  Deputies will remember the President went to great pains in reply to some remarks by Deputy Clery to show that a farmer who was patriotic, who did not buy clothes of foreign manufacture, did not deal in stocks and shares, did not enter into litigation so that he would not be buying stamps for legal documents, need pay nothing towards the upkeep of the State; that he was practically free from the burden of taxation.  It is a remarkable thing that twelve months after one of the President's chief lieutenants should say that practically the whole burden of taxation was borne by the small farmer.  It looks a rather serious thing to see such a wide divergence of opinion on a matter <Col N="141" /> that is fundamental to the whole system of Government, that is fundamental to every detail of our work here.  After all, the thing of importance in anything we consider is, who is going to bear it; on whom does the burden fall?  One would think the Executive Council would give a lead in enabling us to decide that; that they, with all their experience, would be able to say definitely where taxation ultimately finds its basis.</P>
    <P>What is the ordinary Deputy without experience to think when he finds such a wide divergence of opinion between two Ministers?  To make it all the more remarkable, in that same speech in which the President made that pronouncement, he expressed his impatience at having to listen to more economic heresies than ever he had heard before.  Now, the Minister for Agriculture says the President is himself an arch-heretic.  It was in that same speech that the President announced he was embarking on an educational campaign for our benefit.  It is a very sorry thing if all his efforts to educate us have been on wrong lines, if they have been on a totally wrong basis, as we are now to understand from the Minister for Agriculture.  The President must not think that we object to being educated or that we resent his efforts to educate us.  We are glad to acknowledge that we have learned a great deal both from himself and his colleagues since we came here.  The only trouble is that we can never hope to see the debt repaid.  It is an established though a sad truth, as the Minister for Education is aware, that wise men learn more from fools than fools from wise men.</P>
    <P>However, to go back to the main question, it is a very important thing indeed to ascertain in connection with this motion who is going to be responsible for it.  Whether the country can afford it or not is one of the first things to consider.  Is it worth while passing the motion even if it were desirable? Is it worth while passing it if it appears that those who will have to bear it are already bearing the utmost burden they can bear?  We are getting no light from the Executive Council.  We have to make up our minds for ourselves, because obviously the Front Bench is <Col N="142" /> divided on the question.  It seems to me there are two questions to be decided in connection with the motion. One is whether a means can be found of getting money for this service without making life too hard for the labouring population, the small farmers and other producers &mdash; for all who are rendering useful service to the country, in other words.  The other is whether or not that service is the most important one on which such money can be spent. If we think there is any probability that these questions can be answered in the affirmative, then I suggest that there is no reason why the motion should not be passed.  There is, perhaps, a further question: whether it would not benefit the State if the money which is voted each year for the payment of pensions to a number of privileged people could not be partly devoted to meeting humane requirements such as this.  We believe that there are economies that can be made in the working of the State, and the question is whether it would not be advantageous to the country if we endeavoured to bring about these economies so that a humane service like this would be established.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I think the Labour Party should consider very seriously in connection with the motion. It would obviously be much more easy to agree to put a service like this into operation if it were clear that the money was going to remain in the country, that the money was merely going to be transferred from one person to another.  We all know that, in present circumstances, out of every ten shillings that may be given for any service of this kind probably six or seven shillings will ultimately leave the country.  That is what to my mind makes all these services especially difficult in the circumstances of the country at present.  I put it to the Labour Party that the ideal which has been put forward from these benches so often, of making a much more determined effort to put the country in a position where it would be self-contained as far as necessities are concerned, should appeal to the Labour Party more than to any other party, if it were only for the fact that the social services would then be very much easier.</P>

      <P>I do not know that what the Deputy says is correct.  I do not think the Labour Party had that ideal in their economic programme.  It seems to me the most regrettable thing about nearly all the expenditure in this country at present that it is often good in itself, but that it often means a tremendous drain of wealth out of the country.  I think there would be less discontent with regard to the salaries of civil servants and other State servants, for instance, if it were clear that the money which the country is paying to support State servants was being spent on Irish goods and was going to the support of Irish producers ultimately. As it is, it is very often merely a subsidy to British industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading over the terms of the motion and the amendment, I can see no excuse for the amendment.  I do not think Deputy Law did himself justice in drafting such an amendment.  His amendment adds nothing; it does not help anyone in any way with regard to the motion.  If the Government is content to be saved by that sort of method, then they are easily pleased.  I can see nothing in the motion that any Deputy can have any hesitation about voting for.  I think he would be a very hardhearted person who would say that this proposal for better provision for widows and orphans bereft of their breadwinners is not desirable.  I do not think anybody would, in his own conscience, object to a proposal of the kind.  I fail to see how it will embarrass the Government in any way if it is passed, because it is only when the figures are produced and we examine the probable costs and go into possible methods that may be suggested for giving effect to the resolution that we will be able to see whether the country can afford it or not.  Personally, I hope sincerely it can &mdash; I believe it can.  I believe that when we come face to face with a problem of this kind and realise that in turning down such a motion we would really be passing a vote of confidence in the present lop-sided civilisation that prevails, none of us will have any hesitation as to how we will act.  After all, if we refuse to pass the motion, and if nothing more is <Col N="144" /> heard of any scheme of insurance for people who have not failed in any way in their duty to society, then I think we will be face to face with an extraordinarily curious situation.  We will have, on one hand, a luxury that is probably equal to the luxury that prevails in any other country &mdash; an extravagant and useless expenditure on the part of a certain number of people, and everything that civilisation can offer&mdash;golf, continental holidays, and big motor cars, everything that the richest people in any country can have.  You will have that on the one side, and on the other you will have to admit that your resources are so small that they cannot make provision for people like this, whom Providence has placed in an unfortunate position.  It seems to me that if we come to that conclusion, we are passing a vote of no confidence in ourselves and certainly a vote of no confidence in the country.  I trust that will not be the result of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardDoyle" hpid="Mr. E. DOYLE Mr. E. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion requesting the Government to initiate a scheme of pensions for widows and orphans.  It is unnecessary for me to say much on the matter, because I believe that the Labour Party, and particularly the mover of the motion, has made an unanswerable case for it.  The motion deserves the serious consideration of every Deputy, particularly of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies. It is one of those questions which Deputies should decide on the evidence before them.  Evidence of the untold sufferings of widows and orphans is very manifest.  They are compelled to live lives of abject misery, due to the fact that having lost their sole means of support, they have nothing to fall back upon.  A considerable number of these widows and orphans are living in thickly-populated centres, in miserable homes where only poverty, misery, want, degradation and wretchedness are permitted to enter.  That condition of affairs is not conducive to the physical or moral welfare of the people.  This respectable section of our community, because of the miserable pittance given to them by way of home help, on which they are solely dependent, and which is entirely inadequate to provide them with the bare necessities of life, are making a fierce struggle for existence <Col N="145" /> under circumstances which are scarcely known to the Minister for Local Government, who is now smiling, but are known to ordinary Deputies, who know their condition, and, if I might say so, have lived with these people and worked with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. DOYLE Mr. DOYLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOYLE</NameTxt>
      <P>This home help assistance is not the method by which this section of the community should be dealt with.  It is a system that was handed down to us from an alien Government and, if I may say so, is now being administered in the same fashion by a native one.  It is only capable of giving a miserable penny per meal to each person in the family.  I have been a member of a Board of Health and of a Board of Guardians, and I have known where the pittance paid out to these widows and orphans only reached that miserable standard of one penny per head per meal. Nothing was left to buy boots, school books, clothes, light or fuel and pay rent &mdash; no alternative for these people, none whatever, except the extraordinary position whereby they can only have one of two alternatives, either to go to the workhouse or that other institution which would give them more per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poverty, misery and want, all those damnable, soul-destroying agencies that bring about the physical and moral degradation and wretchedness of people not alone in this country, but in other countries, whether civilised or uncivilised, are evident where people are deprived of the means of existence for themselves and those depending on them.  Will we ever realise that the human health and happiness of the people are the most precious assets of a nation, and that the more people we have of that class living under humane conditions the better for every nation? How can modesty bloom in circumstances such as I have referred to? How can morality and good citizenship be maintained where the means of common decency are denied?  How can we have proper education amongst the children of those people when they have no <Col N="146" /> means to educate them?  These are questions widows and orphans of this country are asking to-day.  They are appealing to this House from the rural cabins, from the slum dwellings, workhouses, and other institutions in which they are at present to do something to alleviate their sufferings whereby they can keep themselves and their dependents within the limits of common decency.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these appeals, and despite the sad state to which these people, through no fault of their own, have been reduced, there are those who are not wanting in their endeavour to controvert the position by cheap scepticism, by assuming, as the Minister for Agriculture did, that most people in this country are in poverty through their own fault.  Surely the Minister does not contend that the widows and orphans are in poverty through their own fault.  If he does there is no use in discussing the matter with him, particularly in view of the fact that he is a bachelor and has very little knowledge of the position of those afflicted people now struggling for existence under extraordinary circumstances.  If that is to be the treatment meted out to the widows and orphans, and if that is the manner in which their case is to be dealt with, then I have little hope for the economic uplifting of those people.</P>
    <P>In 1919 we were told that there was such a thing as an economic policy, and we were told that no child should go hungry or naked and that they were to be the first call on the State.  These statements are only used for political purposes and as catch-cries for the purpose of getting into positions.  The widows and orphans have still to suffer in the Free State as they did under a monarchy.  The statement of the Minister for Agriculture reminds me of what Ruben said when breaking up Solomon's kingdom, &ldquo;My father has beaten you with whips and I shall beat you with scorpions.&rdquo;  That is not the manner in which the case of the widows and orphans should be dealt with, and as regards people being in poverty through their own fault, the meanest intelligence knows that no one is in poverty because he likes it.  On the contrary, they fight against poverty <Col N="147" /> until they are fairly beaten, and when they are beaten it is the duty of this or any other Government to come to the rescue and to do something to help them and to put them into a position in which they can live within the bounds of common decency.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Local Government that by increasing the home help benefit to those people to the extent of something like 7d. or 8d. in the pound it would give them the same right of maintenance as given under the widows and orphans scheme in Northern Ireland and England.  I contend that is not doing the best for the widows and orphans, because instead of uplifting them and putting them in a better way to happier lives and surroundings, you are casting them down by inflicting upon them the brand of pauperism and bolstering up that Poor Law system which is costing millions in an endeavour to remove the effects of a cause which was criminally neglected.  The cause is simple.  While you have badly fed and clothed and badly educated children, and that degrading and damnable system which now exists, they cannot be a benefit to the State.  This is an important question in this country at the present moment. I said I would not detain the House long, and so, in conclusion, I appeal to Deputies, particularly on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, to accept this motion.  It will be a step in the right direction towards alleviating the suffering of this section of our people.  By passing this motion you will be helping to keep the widows and the orphans in their homes instead of in the workhouses.  It will make their homes places where morality, good citizenship and cheerfulness, which are essential to happiness and contentment can be maintained.  In that way you will have done something for justice.  It will have the effect of averting the frightful perils which beset these poor people who are dependent on the home help system, which is entirely inadequate to meet their requirements.  By the acceptance of the motion; with a view to setting up a scheme of pensions, the effect, at least, will be to bring to an end the <Col N="148" /> privation, want, misery and all the other things which are a danger, not alone to the people concerned, but to the Executive Government.  What bright rays of sunshine would enter into the homes of many widows by the acceptance of the motion, homes that are now dark, miserable and dreary, because of want of means to buy food, clothing, and to house themselves in a manner which would reflect credit on the Government.  By providing such a scheme the children will benefit, and they will not alone respect and honour the Government that put them in a way that they can live better and happier lives, but into a condition to which they are entitled because of their humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. KENNEDY Mr. KENNEDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the side of this motion.  There are a few matters that I would like to deal with, particularly with regard to the speech made by the Minister for Local Government, who, if this motion was passed, would be the principal person to deal with it. The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan suggested that there is nothing more in this motion than what is on the face of it.  But there is, whether it is intended or not, and the speeches that have been made have shown us very clearly that this motion has been moved because, with regard to the whole system of home assistance, whether for widows or orphans or for other poor people, the local people are not facing up to its proper administration.</P>
      <P>For the last four or five years there has been a big decrease in the cost of administration of the various social services, but there has been no decrease noticeable in the cost of home help itself, and, if anything, from my short experience of boards, home help is on the increase.  That is the biggest answer to those people on the opposite benches who talk about prosperity and about the country having turned the corner. Every day the local boards are met with demands for more and more home help, because the people have no work. The Minister went on further and said that the solution of this might be met, for instance, in West Cork, by raising the rates from 3/6 in the £ to 4/1; in Wexford from 3/3 to 8/1., and in Donegal from 2d. to 7/6 in the £.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. KENNEDY Mr. KENNEDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's correction.  Anyway, these increases are much smaller than I at first thought.  The Minister must realise that any increase in the present rates under local administration would be unbearable.  The facts are that the people are hardly able to pay the present rates and are crying out for a reduction.  To increase them by one penny, twopence or threepence in the £ for one service alone would bring about a state of things that the people would not be able to bear. From my short experience of public boards and from what I have seen at the Westmeath Board of Health the one service during the past year that has gone up and exceeded the estimate is home help.  The Department of Local Government wrote down recently telling us to build a medical residence in a certain district.  The Board wrote back that owing to the finances of the county they could not do so.  The Department replied that if there was proper economy on the councils and boards that medical residence could be built.  The Minister for Local Government advocates increased rates here for a certain scheme of home help.  How can his Department talk about economy when he advocates such things?  The Minister talks about administering home help in a Christian way, and about people facing up to the situation.  I do not know if that is the term he used, but he talks about doing this in a Christian way, and his Department talks about economy.  You can have economy like the Dublin Commissioners have it by screwing the faces of the poor and cutting down home help.  The Minister talks about economy or about administering this fund through home help, but the pets of his Department &mdash; the Commissioners &mdash; are the very people who are cutting down home help wherever they are administering local government. I believe that the more local rates increase the less chance there is for industry to progress, that where <Col N="150" /> local rates increase for local services, as has been advocated by the Minister in order to administer this particular fund, you crush local industry, whereas general taxation has a less detrimental effect.  As regards footing the bill, there are dozens of ways to foot the Bill, but if I went into them I would open very controversial paths and I would probably be held up by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>As it is getting rather late, and I think there is a general feeling that this debate should come to an end, I will not stand very long between the mover of the resolution and his closing speech.  We have to deal with a motion and an amendment and, after listening to this debate very carefully, I find that the weight of argument, as I see it, is undoubtedly on the side of the motion; that the merits of the case are on the side of the motion.  I hope that when a decision has to be come to, if we are to divide, the House will answer by expressing the view that it is desirable some provision should be made, by way of insurance or otherwise, for widows and orphans bereft of their breadwinners.</P>
      <P>The amendment would be no expression of the opinion of this House, and when we are asked to express our opinion on the merits of the motion we should not be afraid to do so.  On the question as to whether it is financially feasible or not we are not asked to express an opinion at all.  I do not know that anybody has yet given us an indication of what the financial commitments on this motion would be, but we are only asked to express an opinion as to whether it is desirable that widows and orphans, bereft of their breadwinners, should, by an insurance scheme or otherwise, have some provision made for them.  I can hardly imagine how the Government can resist taking this matter up and reporting to us what would be the probable cost of putting it into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion commits us to nothing at the moment, and even its mover, if the figures were of such magnitude to show that such a scheme was not feasible at the moment, might be the very first to say: &ldquo;Well, I did not think <Col N="151" /> that this would run into so much expense, and such being the case, I think we should adjourn it until the country is in a better position to deal with it.&rdquo; Still, I do not think that the figures would be so astoundingly great as to make it impossible to frame some scheme for providing for widows and orphans, and as the mover very properly said, to remove the stigma of pauperism from these poor people.  I could enlarge very much on the question of home help and other things, but it is now ten o'clock, and I think it is only fair that the mover of the motion should get ample time to conclude.  He made an excellent and a moderate speech, and I would like to compliment him, and all others who have spoken, particularly those who spoke on the motion.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words in support of Deputy Murphy's motion.  I know of no system by which the people mentioned in the motion can be relieved except one, and that is the system of home assistance. To me that system is degrading, no matter how sympathetic the boards of health are to the people mentioned in the motion.  I am a member of a board of health, and I know the degradation through which these people have to go in order to obtain this home assistance. Everything in connection with themselves and their children is inquired into by the home assistance officer, and when that has all been done they have to go before a doctor and get his certificate before they can be given relief. As I said, no matter what relief they get, it is degrading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryBroderick" hpid="Mr. H. BRODERICK Mr. H. BRODERICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. BRODERICK</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a fact in the case of the board of health of which I am a member, the Westmeath Board of Health.  It is the general practice there, and therefore I think I am correct in making that <Col N="152" /> statement.  That is the only system I know of.  That system has been handed down to us by the British Government, but they themselves have abolished that system, as far as widows and orphans are concerned, by a scheme which provides for pensions, and that is also the case with the Northern Government. The question of obtaining funds by insurance or by a pension scheme, to provide widows and orphans with the necessary amount of money to maintain themselves seems to be the trouble.  I know of one trade union and friendly society which, by a contribution of one penny per week by its members to a particular fund, is able to give a pension of from 7/6 to 12/6 a week to widows and orphans of its deceased members.  I do think that if the Government &mdash; and I sincerely hope they will &mdash; consider formulating a pensions scheme for these widows and orphans they will be wise in doing so.  I am sure that there are a number of Deputies on the benches which are occupied by this Party, and Deputies on other benches, who would be only too pleased to put suggestions before the Minister to assist him in formulating such a scheme.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion.  I think that any means that we can adopt to remove the taint of pauperism from widows and orphans is worth while considering.  I think, further, that when this motion only asks the Executive Council to prepare and present to the House a report upon such schemes of insurance and estimates of the cost, this motion should be passed without any opposition.  The Minister for Agriculture, I notice, said that it is not out of production this money will have to come, and if this was an Executive Council that was taking any interest whatsoever and devoting any attention to economy I would give some consideration to that suggestion. But I know that if I wanted to economise I would go through the list of Estimates, and I would find many ways of raising the wind to provide money for such a proposal as this.  The Government lightheartedly voted £18,000 towards the upkeep of the Governor-General's establishment. Surely if they put £16,000 of that <Col N="153" /> towards a scheme like this it would be more in keeping with the needs of the country, and they could do a lot of carving on such things as this £15,000 police barracks that I alluded to the other night.

I am making a few good suggestions as to where he would get the money to finance the scheme if he was prepared to put it in force.  I consider that there is expenditure in the Departments and on salaries which any Government should economise on, if they wanted to economise on anything. There is in that proposal the whole groundwork for providing money for such a scheme.  I would say, without fear of contradiction, that you could provide very close to £200,000 by reducing the cost of living bonus on salaries of £400 and upwards, which would go towards providing for such a scheme.  The cash is there, and I think any Government which has to vote <Col N="154" /> £15,000 for a police barracks and a million and a quarter for pensions going out of the country should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ní bheidh mé i bhfhad.  Níl morán le rá agam.  I heard, I think, the Minister for Local Government say in reply to Deputy Corish that there was no reference in the democratic programme adopted by the first Dáil to this question of widows and orphans, and I was surprised to hear him make that statement. I have taken these two small paragraphs from the democratic programme. One says:</P>
      <P>It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual welfare of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter and that all shall be provided with the means and facilities required for their proper training as citizens of a free and Gaelic Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to Deputy Corish's reference in column 498 in which he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think an Executive Council composed of men like the Minister for Finance and the President who were members of the first Dáil Eireann who made a proclamation in January, 1919, that their first duty <Col N="155" /> was to look after the widows and orphans of the country should be able in this year 1928 to say to the House that they had made up their minds as to what their policy is as regards the starving women and children of the country.</P>
    <P>I said there was no such statement there and it would be well generally if the Deputy would look at the reference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, while it does not state here that it is our first duty it is very definitely and clearly laid down that it is the duty of the Government whether it be the first or the second duty.  I think this House will agree that where a question of poverty arises it is our duty to maintain people of that kind.  I think Deputy Corish was right in saying that those of us who accepted the democratic programme of the First Dáil were bound in honour and conscience to do everything within our power to provide adequately for the poor, the destitute, the homeless, and particularly for the children.</P>

The Minister, however, can maintain his opinion of what a fact is and we will maintain ours. The strange part about it was that I had forgotten the fact until I looked at the proceedings of the First Dáil, that the Deputy who is now Minister for Local Government was the member who proposed that.</P>

      <P>I have one or two more points.  The Minister for Local Government asked members of the Labour benches why they did not put up a scheme.  I think that comes very badly from him or anyone occupying his position.  He has the whole officialdom of the State at his disposal, and in particular he has the officialdom of his own Department at his disposal.  Some of the officers there have been in the service for a very long time and they must, in the course of some twenty years or so, have gathered a great deal of experience in dealing with matters of this kind.  If they cannot produce a scheme let them come to Labour; they may go to Labour and Labour will produce it.  If they cannot produce a scheme it is a blue look-out.</P>
      <P>The same Minister challenged us with producing ill digested Bills, Bills made a mess of.  He knows, as far as draftsmanship is concerned, it is one of the things, to put it mildly, in which there is not a surplus of specialists here, and that any draftsmen there are in the country, and there are not many, are in the service of the Government, employed and paid by the Government, and not at the disposal of anybody else. Knowing these facts, he comes to the Labour Benches and taunts them with not producing schemes, whereas he has all the officials to produce what he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay Deputy Murphy in his reply, as I presume there is probably going to be a vote on this matter, but I want to say one word in reply to Deputy Doyle.  He made an excellent speech in favour of the motion except for one point, and that is, in my opinion he talked too much of and over-emphasised the question of the moral, physical and spiritual degradation of the poor.  I know the poor of this city.  I was born and reared in Dublin.  I say of them that they are poor, and very poor.  There is poverty amongst them, but they are not degraded. They are not moral, physical or spiritual degenerates.  I think that was overdone.  They may be poor, and they are, but their standard of morality <Col N="157" /> is high and can compare with that of the richest and the best society people in the land.  With that little protest, I wish to say that those of us who accept the first Dáil's programme generally believe that all of us should stand behind the principles enunciated when the Republic was first founded and will back the motion and not the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Murphy replies, perhaps I will be permitted to correct a false impression that is likely to arise from a statement made by him in his opening speech.  I do not believe that he intended to create such impression by his remarks. I am quoting from the Official Debates, page 484.  Deputy Murphy said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I agree that perhaps often the industrial schools do very good work, but we have an alarming number of failures amongst the children turned out by industrial schools.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that, so far as the County Dublin is concerned, it is only right that it should be mentioned that we have, I believe, the largest industrial school in the world. I refer to Artane where they have between 900 and 1,000 boys and the percentage of failures from that institution is no higher than the percentage of failures from the largest college in any part of Ireland.  I think it is only fair to the Christian Brothers and to the pupils and their parents that that statement should be made. As I have said, I do not believe that Deputy Murphy intended to create that false impression.</P>

I do not think that Deputies have been given reasonable opportunity of making up their minds as to what they should do in regard to it. The matter was introduced at 9 o'clock to-night and is now about to be decided at 10.30 p.m.  As a matter of fair play to all Deputies, the question <Col N="158" /> should be adjourned to give them an opportunity of considering the motion in all its moods and tenses.  It will reflect either credit or discredit on the party who introduced it, and will also reflect credit or discredit on the Government of the future who will have to deal with it.  Under these circumstances I respectfully suggest that the matter be adjourned to give Deputies an opportunity of considering it.  It is not fair to have such a big issue decided in an hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion.  In the experience of the oldest Deputy in this House the question of providing for widows and orphans has, I think, been one of the chief planks in the programme of every political party. I cannot see why the Government should object to accepting the motion as, to my mind, there is absolutely no difference between it and the amendment. It has been stated over and over again by Deputies on the Opposition and Labour Benches that this is only a question of the desirability of the Government making provision for widows and orphans.  I would go so far as to ask the Government to accept the motion, and I would say that each of the political parties here, both Fianna Fáil and Labour, should make contributions towards the financing of the scheme, because it is a scheme that affects not alone the supporters of the Government, but those of all parties here.  It is one of the social reforms which has been long overdue.  Having achieved the measure of freedom we are now enjoying, we cannot afford now, to say the least of it, to lag behind our <Col N="159" /> neighbours in Great Britain or Northern Ireland in the matter of social reform. Our chief boast previous to the Treaty was that if we were rid of British rule, not alone would we be able to maintain old age pensions but increase them. Those promises have been made, and it is most unfair to taunt people who are in favour of this motion with more or less making political capital out of the sufferings of the poor.  Each party has promised this reform to widows and orphans, who are as much entitled to pensions as those young men whose names I have seen on the Order Paper as being in receipt of pensions from £280 down to £50 and £60 a year.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the point of view put forward by the Minister for Finance, namely, that this is a very important question affecting taxation.  I appreciate the difficulty of the Minister for Finance and appreciate and sympathise with his point of view, but that does not excuse him or his Government from making suitable provision for the widows and orphans in the State.  I am not going to go into details in connection with the scheme, nor to refer to the speeches of other Deputies, but I think the Minister for Agriculture has stated what are not facts when he said that the small farmers and shopkeepers would be called on to bear this extra financial responsibility.  What, after all, is the small farmer or the shopkeeper but a worker?  He is nothing better than the ordinary worker.  He is a worker all the time. If this scheme materialises I can envisage the widow of the small farmer coming under it.  I know cases in my constituency where widows of small farmers are in a very bad financial position.  They have been left with young families and very small farms of from three to four acres.  If they let that land the most that can be got out of it is anything from £15 to £20 per annum, and when the annuities and rates are paid very little is left for the widows and the orphans.  Surely that type of person will come under any provision made by the Government in regard to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the Government would be well advised not to divide the House <Col N="160" /> on this motion.  It is true, of course, that it has been introduced by a member of the Labour Party, but that does not make very much difference.  That Party is not going to claim any credit for it and is only carrying out its promises to the people, namely, to make provision for widows and orphans.  I think that the Government would be wise to get away from party in a matter of this sort and allow the House on this occasion to be unanimous in passing a motion which commits it to nothing definite.  I must candidly say that I would oppose anything in the nature of increased taxation, because it is well for us to remember that increased taxation means increased unemployment. The revenue derived by means of taxation is taken out of industry, and I would be very slow in voting for anything that would increase taxation, because we must remember that we have a considerable number of workers in the Free State who are dependent more or less on the speculation of money by people who have a little money to speculate.</P>
    <P>Unless they can make use of that money with advantage to themselves, the chances are that they will not invest that money and, incidentally, you might be imposing a hardship on the fathers and mothers of families whose members might not be able to obtain employment.  I do say that the Government should make an effort to provide for the widow and the orphan and accept this motion without throwing the onus of dividing upon the House.  I think it is about time that the Government recognised that it is not on party lines that questions such as this, any more than the question of unemployment, will be solved.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the leader of the chief Opposition Party in this House put down a question recently dealing with unemployment.  He made certain suggestions that I am glad to say were readily accepted by the President. I should like to see a little more of that spirit displayed in this House. I think there could be no more opportune time for the display of that spirit than on the present motion.  I confidently expect that the Government will fall in with the suggestion made by <Col N="161" /> Deputy O'Hanlon and accept the motion unanimously.  After setting up a committee to inquire into the financial details in connection with the scheme&mdash; a committee which would include members of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; if it was found that it would impose too great a financial burden on the industries of this State to make provision for the widows and orphans, there would be no more about the matter.  I am sure the Deputies in favour of the motion would be the first to admit that, in these circumstances, it would not be wise to proceed to make provision for the widows and orphans.  But let us make a beginning. Let the Government accept the motion and let a committee representative of all parties be set up to work out the financial details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put down a question for to-day to the Minister for Finance, I did not think there would be any necessity to raise the matter on the adjournment.  I would have much preferred if the Minister, instead of evading the question I put to him, had made some effort to give a reply which, if not satisfactory, would have proved to me that he had at least considered the state of affairs which exists in County Mayo.  A short time ago a resolution was passed unanimously by the Mayo County Council drawing attention to the state of affairs in that county and appealing to the Government to take some steps to remedy the conditions there.  I was <Col N="162" /> surprised when the Minister for Finance informed me to-day that the Government &mdash; or the Minister at least &mdash; had not received any intimation as to that resolution.  I understood that the chairman of the county council, who sits on the opposite Benches, had made it his duty &mdash; as I think it was &mdash; to communicate that resolution to the Government Party or to the Executive Council.  I thought that that resolution had been placed in the hands of the Government and that they would make some effort to deal with the matter.  I find that they plead ignorance of the matter.  In his reply to me to-day, regarding the demand for some relief in the County Mayo, the Minister referred me to a reply given on the 10th October last, when he said that the sum of £32,000 voted in the current year's Estimates for the completion of works unfinished on 31st March last had been spent and that it was not proposed to make further provision for relief schemes this year, as any such provision would entail the presentation, at the same time, of proposals to the Dáil for the raising of an equal sum by the imposition of fresh taxation.  That reply, of course, is quite good enough for the Government to give, but if they really understood the position in the country to-day, and if they really understood the position as it is in the County Mayo, which I deem it my duty as one of the county representatives to give a short account of, I think they would face up to the facts more seriously.  I have made it my business to go around the County Mayo, not to inquire about things which I wanted to talk about or in respect of which I wanted to make complaints, but simply to find out the position as it is.  I found that from the extreme end of the county, from Kilmovee to the coast of Erris, there was extreme poverty.  I was told that by responsible people in every parish. I was asked by them to try, with the other Deputies, to make the Deputies on the Government Benches and the Government realise the seriousness of the matter and see if anything could be done to provide a remedy during the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The flooding this year in Mayo was commented upon by the County Council, and it was brought to the notice of the Government that flooding took place this year to a greater extent than in the previous year, with the result that crops are seriously damaged in the county. In the Erris area, there was flooding which caused very serious harm in the district, and I forwarded particulars to a certain Department.  The same thing has happened in parts of East Mayo and, perhaps, throughout the whole county.  I think if the Government were in earnest they would, regardless of the Drainage Acts which empower county councils to take up drainage schemes, initiate, through the Public Works Department or through the Land Commission, some schemes of drainage or other works that would repay the money spent on them and which could be carried on during the winter or spring months.  The County Council, in the resolution they passed, pointed out that the potato crop in Mayo has suffered very seriously owing to flooding and other causes.  There was a very bad harvest in parts of the county, I was informed of that and I saw that it was a fact.  Then you have, as a rule, thousands of migratory labourers going over to England from the county every year.  They had a very bad season this year, and they came back not as flush in cash as they used to be.  The fishing industry in Mayo, as the Minister for Fisheries knows, is practically a dead letter.  After the unfortunate disaster of a year ago, I thought the Minister would have taken some steps to put that industry on its feet or to see to the welfare of the fishermen who have to fight the waves in order to get a livelihood. I thought he would, at least, have established some local industries when the matter was brought so forcibly to his notice by the disaster of last year.  It was a sad thing last year when County Mayo had to send out appeals for charity to the whole world for the fishermen of Mayo and the people who suffered as a result of that disaster. These appeals were made to charitable people all over the world, so that these people might be enabled to live.  And after that has been done, we feel <Col N="164" /> ashamed of the position of the fishermen of County Mayo.  This year they are in a serious position.  That is not confined to the fishermen this year, as hardship exists amongst a great element of the population.  We had hoped that local industries which had been set up would be fostered by the new Department which is to look after the Gaeltacht, but while those concerned have been deliberating about what they should do those local industries have been dying out.  In one parish in Erris you have machinery lying idle, while a promise was given by the Government some years ago that extra engines would be provided so that that machinery might be set working and provide employment.  I mention these facts to show that when I speak of relief schemes for County Mayo I am not talking of anything that might be described as &ldquo;doles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are schemes actually there that could be made operative by a sympathetic Government.  They might not be called relief schemes, perhaps, but they are schemes that would give a very good return for the money expended on them.  I suppose what I have said about the County Mayo could be said about nearly every other county.  The Government seem, however, not to realise that there is necessity to take the ordinary people into consideration, as we unfortunately know in the County Mayo. Some years ago, the Congested Districts Board used to expend a lot of money in works of different kinds in the congested areas.  At present there is not a single penny being expended by the body that has replaced the Congested Districts Board.  The only reply we can get from the Land Commission is that estates which are in their hands in every part of the county for fifteen years are receiving attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there are estates in the hands of the Land Commission for over twelve years.  The work that used to be carried out by the Congested Districts Board in improving estates, in improving and making bog roads, and in carrying out small drainage schemes is not being done by the Land Commission.  Those are some of the things I have in mind when I speak of &ldquo;relief schemes.&rdquo;  If the Government were in earnest, expenditure on schemes like those would be well repaid, and they should be carried out by the Land Commission or the Board of Works or some other Department.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health seems to think, by his expression, that it is quite all right to talk and make speeches about those things and have an evasive reply given by the Government &mdash; that the whole thing must pass with that.  We were told that the Government knows nothing about resolutions passed by Mayo County Council regarding the poverty existing in that county or about demands for grants of some kind.  But the Minister for Local Government and Public Health seemed to know very well the position of other elements in County Mayo, when instructions were sent out from his Department that doctors in County Mayo were to be given a large increase in salary.  I do not say that dispensary doctors should not get a decent salary, but you have the Government attending to the wants of certain people who are <Col N="166" /> very well off at present &mdash; far better off than the ordinary people who have to pay their rates and taxes.  The Government are taking an interest in these people and are seeing that salaried officials get increases at the present time, and when an appeal is made to them in the interest of the ordinary taxpayer, I think it should not be dealt with in a sneering manner by any Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over the whole state of affairs that exists in the county. I think it is rather a degrading thing to have to turn round and place before the Government the position that exists in any single county in the Free State. The Government should know the facts without being told about them here. The Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, who do not think it worth their while to be present when this question is being discussed, even though they are members of Mayo Council, should in common decency have put the matter before the Government before this.  I do not want to go over the whole position, but I would like the Minister to tell me if there is or is not necessity for some action to be taken, not alone in County Mayo, but in every county.  If the Minister proves to me that there is no such thing as poverty in any county in the Saorstát, then we can perhaps go on in the grand, luxurious way that we are doing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if he admits that there is necessity for the Government to provide relief works of some kind, then we will all be inclined to give sympathetic assistance to the Government in formulating schemes which will provide employment and, at the same time, give a return for the money expended. It is probably well to remind the Minister that when the relief Vote of £200,000 was passed last year there were appeals from County Mayo for different classes of works which amounted almost to that £200,000, and there was only expended in the county a sum of £4,000.  In March last the Mayo County Council, under the chairmanship of Mr. Davis, who is a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, passed a resolution asking for an increase of the road grant to Mayo.  Last year there was £12,000 given in road <Col N="167" /> grant to the county, and this year there is only £8,000 given, while there is over £17,000 given to a neighbouring county.</P>
    <P>We have a reduction in the amount that is granted by the Central Authority to counties like Mayo in the Gaeltacht, and at the same time we have increases voted in the Dáil for expenditure on the Governor-General's establishment.  We had every single member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party voting £1,000 extra to the Governor-General for a new motor car this year.  We had increases of Army pensions voted of £40,000, as compared with last year, and an increase of District Court charges of £34,000.  We had every member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party voting for an increased subsidy of over £8,000 for the sugar beet factory and, at the same time, we find in the Estimates £118,000 less for relief schemes than was provided last year.  I think it is about time that some action was taken by Deputies, no matter what their political views may be, to open the eyes of the Government to the existing circumstances. One would think by the way questions regarding the condition of the people are answered here that we were simply living in a gold mine.  It is quite all right for us to vote £1,000 extra, or thousands of pounds extra, to a Government Department, and at the same time to send the bailiff down the country to the people who are not able to provide these sums.  When we make a demand for relief schemes, having the backing of what I might call a Cumann na nGaedheal County Council, we are sneered at in this House and told there is no need for relief schemes in any county.  We have, it is said, got round the corner that we have so often heard about from the President.  In fact, I think we have got round so many corners that we are almost back where we started from.  I do not want the Minister, in replying, to tell me that if relief schemes are embarked upon they will mean extra taxation.  There was no such talk of extra taxation when we voted increases in respect of the Governor-General's establishment.  I want the Minister simply to inform me whether there is need, in a county like <Col N="168" /> Mayo or other counties similarly placed, for relief works of an economic character &mdash; drainage work, for example &mdash; to be carried out during the coming months. If the Minister denies that there is such a necessity, I should like to know where he gets his proof from.  On the other hand, if he admits that there is need for schemes of an economic character, and if the Government are prepared to face the matter fairly and squarely they will get all the co-operation that can be given by parties in this House.</P>
    <P>There are many things which I could suggest for County Mayo and which if embarked upon would well repay the Government.  If the Minister wants any solid schemes put forward by this Party or any other party, we can prove to him that there are economic works which could be carried out.  I do not want the whole matter to be brushed aside as if everything was going on all right.  I want the matter to be faced in a decent manner by the Government.  If they do that, they will be simply doing their duty and nothing else.  I should like the Minister to deal with some of the points I raised.  If there is any doubt about them.  I am sure the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies for Mayo, who are not here, will, if asked by the Minister about these things, bear out what I have said.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity of drawing the attention of the Minister and of the House to a few matters appertaining to County Mayo. Recently, I put down a question with regard to the drainage of the Robe. The answer I got to that question was that until certain technical matters and regulations were complied with by the County Council of Galway the drainage scheme could not be pushed forward.  Heretofore, the attitude of the Government had been that the drainage of the Robe was held up because the County Council of Mayo would not do its duty.  A few months ago, a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who is also a member of the county council, brought this matter up at the council and he got a resolution passed &mdash; I myself seconded it &mdash; accepting responsibility on behalf of Mayo County Council for their <Col N="169" /> share of the work.  In any communications the council had received up to that, there was no mention of Galway. We were told that if we levied a certain rate the drainage would be done, but now we are told, at the last moment, that unless Galway backs this scheme the Robe will not be drained.  Before I backed that resolution of the Mayo County Council, I asked the member of the Government Party concerned had he a definite guarantee that the money&mdash;£37,000&mdash; would be forthcoming from Government sources and he answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The drainage of the Moy concerns Mayo and Sligo, but I cannot see how the County Galway is interested in the drainage of the Robe. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries stated that there were no estates in the County Mayo fifteen years in the hands of the Land Commission.  On at least two occasions I have put questions in the House regarding the de Clifford estate, which is about seventeen years in the hands of the Land Commission. It has also been brought to my notice that for a number of years the Sligo estate is in the hands of the Land Commission &mdash; it is certainly over ten years. Portions of the Sligo estate have not yet been dealt with.  The same thing applies to the Fitzgerald estate.  The total amount of money spent in Mayo out of the unemployment grant last <Col N="170" /> year was something less than £5,000, as far as I understand.  There were schemes amounting to about £200,000 put up to the Government as necessary for Mayo.  Out of that there was, as I have said, something less than £5,000 spent in the county.  That represents the amount of energy, money and time the Government has given to solving the unemployment problem in Mayo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOURKE Mr. BOURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what Deputy Clery wants us to do in this matter.  It appears to me that if we were to give the relief he desires it would be necessary to change the whole character of County Mayo.  Mayo is, unfortunately, a poor county.  It has always been a poor county, and no action the Government can take can get away from that fundamental fact. There is an economic committee at the present time considering the whole question of the Gaeltacht, and no doubt they will be able, after some time, to bring forward proposals that will bring some relief.  At the moment I cannot see that the Government can take any action that would give satisfaction to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred particularly in his question to the state of flooding in the County Mayo.  There are many rivers in the County Mayo normally and usually subject to flooding, and, so far as I am aware, the flooding in the county has not been exceptional this year.  We had a very wet June, and that caused a great amount of flooding all over Ireland.  No doubt, Mayo came in for its share of that.  But, as I say, I do not think that was exceptional in the County Mayo.  No drainage operations that would give relief to Mayo, or any other county, could be carried out immediately.  They would have to be the subject of consideration and of well-considered plans.  They would have to be carried out in the dry season of the year.  We have been considering the drainage problem in the County Mayo.  We have given it a good deal of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many proposals have been put up to us and, giving way to the wishes of the Mayo County Council, we have concentrated on the two main river drainage schemes &mdash; the Moy and the Robe.  After prolonged investigation, we decided that the Moy scheme would not be economic. It would cost about £200,000, and it would give no commensurate return. That is fairly plain after superficial investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. CLERY Mr. CLERY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOURKE Mr. BOURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of months ago.  We have been dealing with the Robe scheme as well, and we have decided that that scheme does hold out some promise.  We believe it would be practicable and economic.  It would cost between £30,000 and £40,000 and, with a free grant from the Government and the County Council contribution, we believe it would pay.  Before we can go ahead with that scheme, it is necessary that the provisions of the Act should be complied with and that a formal application from six interested people should be sent forward.  That has not been done yet.  We have more or less anticipated the procedure under the Act.  We have carried out our investigations, at the request of the representatives from County Mayo, before these petitions came to us in order not to waste time.  It is up to the counties concerned now.  As I am informed that Galway is affected by this scheme as well as Mayo, they will have to send in a petition.  That is quite a simple matter.  If there are not six landowners whose lands are going to be improved by this drainage scheme interrested in the matter in Galway and <Col N="172" /> Mayo, there is not much use in our going forward with the scheme.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary state that the County of Galway is to be asked to bear a charge for the benefit of the people of Mayo? The people of Galway will not benefit one halfpenny by this scheme.  Is it not begging the question to bring Galway in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOURKE Mr. BOURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Our opinion is that the people of Galway will benefit from a certain portion of these operations and their consent must be got.  If that is not the case, it is sufficient for six petitioners from Mayo to move in the matter.  They have not done that.  That is one way the Deputy can interest himself in a practical way in the scheme &mdash; to get those landowners whose land is going to benefit to send forward a petition. We are ready to go ahead with the scheme, but it will ultimately depend upon the occupiers whether the scheme is put into operation or not. We are quite anxious to see this scheme put into operation.  I am not concerned with the other points raised by the Deputy, but when we have this scheme in operation, as I hope we will, we can consider other schemes in the county.</P>
