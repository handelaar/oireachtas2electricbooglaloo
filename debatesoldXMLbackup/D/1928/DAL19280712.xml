      <P>In September, 1924, the Gárda Síochána, acting on a warrant, carried out a search on the lands of Mr. John O'Grady, Everlaun.  The warrant was issued on an information sworn to the effect that a bicycle had been stolen and was believed to be concealed either in a corn field or a hay rick, the property of Mr. O'Grady.  The corn field was searched, and it was necessary to turn over the hay in the rick which had been built after the larceny of the bicycle.  No avoidable damage was done by the Gárda, and it is not possible to entertain any claim for compensation in the matter.</P>

      <P>The case referred to may be that of Thomas Byrne, Stonepark, Aclare, County Sligo, who was allowed a pension of eight shillings a week by the Aclare Pension Sub-Committee on the 2nd May, 1927.  An appeal was received, and the claimant's yearly means, as calculated for pension purposes, were estimated at £31 10s. 7d.  The estimate was considered reasonable, and by a decision dated 14th June, 1927, a pension of four shillings a week was allowed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether his attention has been directed to the delay in the return of butter forwarded by co-operative creameries to the Department for surprise butter inspections, and whether he is aware that, in cases where there is a delay of upwards of three weeks, the delay militates against the subsequent sale of such butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the present year 830 exhibits have been forwarded from 220 creameries to the surprise butter inspections held by the Department of Agriculture, and there has been no complaint regarding delay <Col N="333" /> on the part of the Department in the return of any of these exhibits, nor were there, so far as I am aware, complaints as to any such delay in previous years.  As regards the second part of the question, butter has not been held by the Department as long as three weeks, except on one occasion in 1927 when the exhibits were placed in the cold store at the Butter-Testing Station with a view to ascertaining, for the benefit of those engaged in the trade, the effect which cold storing for various periods has on the texture of butter.  Butter of good quality will not deteriorate in three weeks if reasonable arrangements for keeping it are made.  The conditions at the Butter-Testing Station are exceptionally suitable for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBoland" hpid="Mr. P. BOLAND Mr. P. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that a number of County Committees of Agriculture have passed resolutions expressing a desire to have presented to the Tariff Commission an application for a tariff on imported barley and malt into the Saorstát; and whether his Department will issue a general circular setting out procedure as to the taking of evidence, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN Mr. P. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that several County Committees of Agriculture have passed a resolution in favour of a tariff on imported barley and malt. I observe, however, that the Agricultural Committees of at least two of the counties in which barley is largely grown did not pass such resolution when it was submitted to them by another County Committee of Agriculture. The Secretary of the Tariff Commission will supply applicants for tariffs with a copy of the regulations relating, inter alia, to the form and manner in which submissions should be made and evidence given to the Commission. I may point out, however, that the funds administered by County Committees of Agriculture can be expended only in accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, and that it would appear that the payment <Col N="334" /> of fees to the Tariff Commission and of the expenses of witnesses appearing before that Commission is outside the scope of that Act; that, therefore, such payments could not be made out of the funds at the disposal of County Committees of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Official Report of March 2nd the Minister for Finance is reported as having made the following statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If two or three County Committees from the barley-growing counties submitted an application for a tariff on barley, I would consider them sufficiently representative to allow their application to go to the Tariff Commission.  I would take a liberal view of their representative character, provided that they made a definite application for a tariff on one article or on a group of articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBoland" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister consider that the application should be referred to the Tariff Commission by the Minister for Finance under Section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  If three county committees join together to put up such an application I think it would be easy to arrange.  I think there is no reason why it should not be arranged that the Tariff Commission would hear them, provided other conditions were carried out.  But the point I am concerned with is that under the Act of 1899, setting up the Department of Agriculture, I think as a legal matter that the joint funds of the committees cannot be used for the purpose of paying the fees.  The fees, of course, are small, and they would have to be paid by the applicants themselves, but I presume they will form some sort of an organisation for making the application.</P>

The landlord appointed an engineer for the purpose but owing to the attitude of some of the purchasing tenants he was unable to provide allotments and the holdings were vested in accordance with the purchase agreements signed by the parties.

      <P>I think this company has a big grievance against the Government for the manner in which it has been treated.  The legislation that was brought in to set up the company was faulty, and there have been attacks made on the company here.  Suggestions that were made about re-insurance are, I think, part of the campaign of the British insurance ring.  That is my view.  I may say that what recommended this particular type of company to me was that it is unlike other Irish companies which were built up here, some of which have been successful in spite of the influences of British companies to break them.  When they were successful, some of them were bought over.  The very nature of this company is such that it could not be alienated, and for that reason alone it is very desirable that a company of that sort should be supported.  There is this also to be said in support of it, that since this company was started, the premiums for the insurance of public bodies have been reduced by 25 per cent. by other companies.  That is a very big consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to support this passing of this Bill, because in it I think we have the first sign and germ of the building up of an insurance system in Ireland, which will be for the benefit of Ireland and not for the benefit of somebody else.  Insurance is one of the five fingers of the grip in this country. In insurance one and a half millions of money are sent out of this country unnecessarily every year.  I am one of those people who believe that this country is not rich enough to throw away a sum which, capitalised, is thirty millions of money, and while a very great many very well-intentioned and very patriotic efforts&mdash;I want to say that quite definitely&mdash;have been made in the past to put Irish insurance on a sound basis from the point of view of Ireland, up to the present they have always failed, and they have failed because they have not attempted, with full knowledge of the difficulties with which they are faced, to put insurance on a basis on which the value could be kept in this country.  The whole history of all these patriotic efforts is this: they struggled very hard for a time and they either failed or partially succeeded. While they are in the process of failing, while in a process of great difficulty, trying to build up, while they are unstable and while they can be pointed to as unstable, they are the greatest possible asset to their competitors.  There is nothing that a sound and strong business man likes better than weak opposition. Very often he very wisely and deliberately creates it, and a great many of these companies, which in the past have lived their little lives and faded away, have done great service to the outside financial interest which is concerned in Irish insurance.  The second thing that could happen to them is that if they weather that first difficult period they are then faced with two alternatives, that they must be bought or they must be smashed.  That has been the invariable history.  It has always been the policy and, from the business point of view of the people on the other side, a perfectly sound policy, to ignore the weeds and to cut off the tops of all the tallest of poppies.  I support this Bill because this particular scheme has in it the germ of permanency, something upon which we can build something <Col N="342" /> very much bigger and very much better, because it does face the real difficulties of the situation, by providing the germ for an insurance organisation which cannot either be bought nor smashed, without the deliberate and open connivance of the people of this country.  I am going to mention a particular case to show the difficulty which faced those who had these patriotic ideas and these very good business intentions in the past in relation to Ireland and how they have been smashed.</P>

They were nothing of the kind, and I am sure that every Deputy who was here knows that nothing of the kind was intended.  Our statements were simply that the whole question should be examined, and that in respect to this particular Bill we were doubtful whether the way proposed in it was the best way, from the legal point of view or from the point of view of general policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Bill is very similar to the Act of 1924, upon which it is founded.  I think the only clause that is actually new, outside the change of date, is the third clause, which states that in the period of a year for which the time is now further extended notice may be published in the &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil&rdquo; stating that no applications for guarantees under Section 1 of the principal Act, as amended by this Act, or for loans or guarantees under Section 2 of the principal Act, as so amended, made after a date specified in that behalf in such notice will be entertained by the Minister.  That, of course, will not be availed of unless it is seen that the <Col N="344" /> apparent necessity for this Act has departed and consequently it is necessary to say that no applications after a certain date will be entertained.  But when one comes to the renewal period next year, if it is to be renewed, and if it is discovered that the necessity is gone, there might then be transactions pending which would necessitate carrying the Bill over the further period. Under the 1924 Act, and further amending Acts, as between applications for the two types of loans that might be entertained, a sum of a million pounds was set aside, divided by an amendment of the first Act into a sum of £900,000 under Part 1 and £100,000 under Part 2.  Nothing has been granted under the loans section.  Of the other moneys, up to the 11th June, the latest date for which I have got accounts, £322,000 had actually been guaranteed, and in addition to that there were pending applications which covered an amount of £34,000, on which the committee had reported and on which the two Ministers had agreed, but where the legal formalities had not been completed. There are quite a number of other applications pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Second Reading of this Bill Deputies will, no doubt, have in mind the reports of the Public Accounts Committee, and I will again state my position in regard to what the Public Accounts Committee have said on two occasions. They called attention to certain cases and made certain recommendations, and, I think, on each occasion I said that I regarded these cases as exceptional, but that I regarded them as good cases at the time of their inception. I say further that I did say, and I say again, that it was not my intention to accept the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee on either of the two occasions on which they reported, and unless the Dáil brings in amendments and gets them passed making it obligatory on me to accept the findings of the Public Accounts Committee, I intend to operate this Act as it has been operated since the beginning.  In other words, I do not entirely rule out the matter of reconstructed companies, and I do not entirely rule out the question <Col N="345" /> of allowing a liability to be created in front of the State liability.  I have stated that I would regard the type of case in which that would occur as being very exceptional.  It would not be a practice that I would favour to any great extent, but I do believe that there are exceptional cases where that is bound to take place, and I do not want my hands tied in regard to that matter.  If the Dáil thinks otherwise it will be for somebody to bring in an amendment.  Left as it is the Act is sufficiently elastic to allow of very good help being given to firms desirous of extending existing businesses or of opening up new businesses, and that is the purpose of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the Minister, in introducing this Bill, to continue and to amend the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, would have availed of the opportunity for the purpose of giving us a general review of the working of the Act.  I do not mean merely a statement as to the amount that has been guaranteed, or the number of firms which have got guarantees, but a review of the consequences which the existence and the operation of the Act has had upon the industrial life of the country.  I think it will be generally admitted&mdash;it cannot be denied&mdash;that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act has not realised all the highest hopes which were based upon it when it was introduced. It cannot be said that the results which we were led to expect from it have materialised.  It has not, in fact, led to any widespread revival of industry, or to the provision of steady and regular employment for the workers.  In so far as this Act was intended to induce that revival and to provide that work it may be said to have had only a very partial success, and I would like to know from the Minister if it represents the maximum effort which the Government is prepared to make towards that end.  If it is not their maximum effort, if they are prepared to recognise its limitations and to realise that something further must be done if industry is to be revived and put upon a proper basis, we would be glad if the Minister, during the course of the Second Reading debate upon the <Col N="346" /> Bill, would tell us exactly what the Government have in mind.  I think it had been hoped by the Government at one time that the result of the Banking Commission's deliberations would be such that an Act of this nature would be unnecessary, that arrangements would be made by which financial institutions in the country would be induced to offer to industry the loans which industry requires, and at suitable terms.  That hope has been disappointed. The Banking Commission, in that respect, at any rate, proved to be a damp squib.  We maintain, therefore, that it is up to the Government to face the question as to whether or not this Act is sufficient to meet the requirements of the country, and, if not, to tell us whether they have considered what future steps must be taken, and when it is hoped to take those steps.</P>
      <P>Financial institutions in this country have shown no readiness to facilitate Irish industry with long-term credits, and as it will not be denied, I think, that Irish industry is in need of these credits, it is our contention that it is the duty of the State to intervene and to place State credit, if necessary, at the disposal of industry.  This Act, of course, does not provide working capital in any way.  There has been some doubt as to what exactly it does provide for, but the Minister has given us a practical demonstration of his interpretation of it by proceeding to guarantee loans in cases similar to those on which the Public Accounts Committee raised this question.  On the strict interpretation of the Act of course it would only operate to facilitate the purchase of fixed assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the explanatory statement issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce concerning the Act, it was definitely pointed out that the Minister has no power to guarantee a loan which is used, in whole or in part, for the provision of working capital, or that he has no power to give a guarantee in respect of any loan which will be used, wholly or in part, for the purpose of extinguishing existing liabilities or commitments.  The whole of the guaranteed loan, the statement says, must be used solely for the purpose of carrying out works of a capital nature. <Col N="347" /> The difficulty that has arisen is really due to the various interpretations which can be put upon the phrase &ldquo;works of a capital nature.&rdquo;  It would be, for example, easy to imagine circumstances under which protection would be accorded to a certain industry in this country, and a firm engaged in that industry might be anxious to take immediate advantage of the fact that a tariff had been imposed for the purpose of extending their business.  It would not perhaps require any additional fixed assets.  It would not require anything except the means to provide for an increase in the staff and additional credit to its customers. A firm faced with that situation might have considerable difficulty in raising the capital required for that purpose without the backing of a State guarantee.  I personally cannot say whether or not a case of that kind could be brought within the terms of the Act.  Certainly, on a strict interpretation of the Act, it could not.  It is in such a case that State credit should be made available, and there is no reason whatever why the Act should not be amended so as to cover cases of that nature.</P>
    <P>There is a suspicion in my mind that the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with the Report of the Public Accounts Committee is very largely one of stubbornness. He has made up his mind that he is not going to be browbeaten by the Committee, irrespective of whether the Committee is right or wrong, and irrespective of whether the question raised by the Committee did or did not require attention.  It is our view that this Act should be amended so as to enable capital to be provided for the purpose of developing existing industries, whether or not that development would take the form of the purchase of additional fixed assets.  The difficulty of drafting an amendment is considerable for a Party in the position in which we are, but the Minister, with a skilled draftsman at his disposal, could, if he thought fit, take the responsibility of introducing an amendment and letting it be discussed here.</P>
    <P>In a previous debate we criticised the <Col N="348" /> general policy of the Government as represented by this Act, on the grounds that it was inadequate to meet the situation in so far as it leaves the Government playing a passive and not an active part in relation to Irish industries. The Government attitude in connection with the Bill is, as we said from time to time, very similar to their attitude concerning tariffs.  They say: State guarantees can be made available, but they will only be made available to such firms as overcome the difficulties which we place in their way; we set up machinery, we make that machinery as hard as possible to work, and we tell the firms that they must pass an endurance test to make the machinery work before they will be given what they require, whether their requirements are a tariff or a State guarantee for a loan.  We think that it is up to the Government, in the peculiar needs of the country, to take an active and not a passive part in the furtherance of Irish industry; that they should be on the look out for directions in which they could provide help to industry, that they should devise some scheme which would enable them to interfere unasked for the purpose of furthering industrial development. This Bill does not do that.  It leaves them playing a purely passive part, and in so far as that is the case, we maintain that it is utterly inadequate to deal with the needs of the situation.  But it does some good; it has done some good; it has helped to establish a few new industries and to keep a number of industries in existence; because of that we intend to support it.  But we certainly think that it is up to the Government to take further steps along the road which they started on when the original Bill was introduced in 1924.  I hope the Minister will give us a general indication of the Government's policy in that connection when concluding the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the speech he made when introducing a similar Bill in 1926 and to quote some extracts from that speech.  In doing that, I should like to show the Minister that there was some just reason for the members of the Public Accounts Committee making the recommendations <Col N="349" /> they did in their report, and at the same time to show that the Minister himself evidently was quite in accord with the view the Committee held.  On that occasion the Minister said:</P>
      <P>We have already appealed to the Banking Commission, and put up to it that the working of this Act has been disappointing in its results.  The number of applications that have come before us under it, and that have to be withdrawn by reason of working expenses being a necessary item, as well as the big number of applications we have received. show the necessity for some provision by way of long-term credits for business or industries.  In the last eventuality, if there does not proceed any suggestion from the Banking Commission, it might be taken up by financial houses here.  Then, I believe, I would have to come later to the Dáil &mdash;possibly explaining it as the worst means of meeting it&mdash;but asking them, nevertheless, to grant some such liberty as would be given if Deputy Johnson's second amendment were carried.  At the moment I would urge against that.  I would have great hesitation at any time in asking for it, and I certainly do not want to ask for it this time, until, if I may put it without offence, the Banking Commission has failed me in this respect.</P>
      <P>&mdash;[Official Report, June 23rd, 1926, column 1608.]</P>
      <P>Further on in that speech, in reply to an interjection of ex-Deputy Hewat, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated on the Second Reading that at about Christmas-time I had made up my mind that it should not even be extended to this year.  Then I came to the conclusion, because a number of applications began to come in, and because it was seen that the applications already in hand could not be completed before the expiry of the present Act, that some extension was necessary, and inasmuch as the report from the Banking Commission, which may establish a new state of things, could not be expected <Col N="350" /> before the expiry of the present Act, I decided to move forward for an extension to this year.  I think that shows my mind.  I did not by any means regard it as a thing to be continued from year to year.</P>
    <P>Further on the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is only to meet an emergency that this type of legislation ever came about.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I hope we will get from the Banking Commission some suggestions, and that these suggestions, if adopted&mdash;there is another &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; will relieve us from the necessity of having any type of legislation of this sort, even as a temporary measure continued from year to year.  Looking at it, however, as a temporary measure to be continued for this year, we should neither enlarge nor restrict it in either of the ways suggested by Deputy Johnson.</P>
    <P>The Minister was satisfied that in order to enable industry to take advantage of the idea in the introduction of this Bill that it could not be done to the full extent under the Act as it is or to the extent at least of the granting of working capital.  The Minister in 1926 indicated this Bill was not a desirable piece of legislation to be introduced year by year and certainly it would convey to the minds of Deputies in the House at that time that it was intended if the Banking Commission failed that he himself would undertake to introduce legislation either by an Amending Act which would enable the sense of the amendments introduced by Mr. Johnson at that time to be embodied. I only want to refer the Minister to that in the hope of getting some indication from him as to whether he has yet received any suggestion from the Banking Commission or if he did get any, whether they were acceptable or workable and whether they are receiving consideration from the Minister and his Department.  If not will he consider the matter when this Bill expires, so that we may in the next year look forward to something in the <Col N="351" /> sense of at least an extension in the direction suggested by Mr. Johnson on that occasion.  The Minister said on the introduction of the Second Reading of the present Bill that up to date £323,000 had been advanced on loans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean guaranteed, but in 1926 the Minister indicated that roughly the same amount though not altogether had been guaranteed.  He mentioned that £220,000 had been guaranteed and that a further £100,000 odd of guarantees were under consideration and awaiting the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  So unless these other applications which in 1926 had been passed by the Advisory Committee had been rejected no fresh applications could have been accepted by the Minister's Department so that since 1926 up to the present time the balance of the £900,000 has not been availed of which in itself is sufficient proof that there is something wanting.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in reply to the report of the Public Accounts Committee that he had no intention of in any way acceding to their request, and he said that the suggestions made by the Public Accounts Committee to the effect that it was not wise to allow the Government to retreat from its position with regard to its holdings in exchange for guarantees he considered it was not advisable to do in every case, but that he did not consider it was wrong.  I ask the Minister if, under the Act as at present worded, he has no right to guarantee a loan where part of it might be used for working capital, can he explain to the House what he means by guaranteeing a loan, retreating from his position as mortgagor, as holding certain of the assets, and allowing the very firm that he must not give a guarantee to, to exchange that released for money which they can use as working capital. I contend that is just a long way round, but it means the same thing.  I am not contending it was wrong to do it.  I am not suggesting the Minister was wrong, but I say that in accordance with the Act, if it is to be continued from year to year in its present form, he is acting <i>ultra vires</i> to the Act itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> I maintain that where the released assets of a concern to which he has given a guarantee for a loan are surrendered in exchange for money from outside sources that he is in fact allowing to use portion of the money of the guaranteed loan for working capital because ultimately the Minister is liable for the full loan they originally went in for.  I do not wish to delay the House further.  We discussed this matter in detail at the Public Accounts, and I would like the Minister to explain the position now.  I may have have misunderstood him with regard to the figures. I would like the Minister to say definitely how much in loans have been guaranteed since 1926 outside those already under review and awaiting the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  I would like also to ask the Minister if he is prepared to stand over what he stated on the Second Reading of the Bill in 1926 and if he is at the same time prepared to say that he will consider next year either an Amending Bill to make it possible to extend the loans under other terms, particularly those embodied in the amendment of Deputy Johnson, or if he intends to bring in a new Bill altogether to put this class of Government help for giving employment on the one hand and for extending the loans on the other on a different basis altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very anxious that this Act should be as successful as possible, and that it should fulfil the objects which I presume the Minister had in mind when he introduced his proposals, namely, doing something to develop industrial organisation in Ireland.  It appears to us that one of the ways in which this Act has failed to fulfil anticipation has been that it has not really created very much interest in industrial development amongst the citizens generally. A number of firms have availed of the facilities under the Act, but I think a great deal of the return and benefit that might be expected from the operations of the Act have been lost because the public has not been generally aware of the facilities which exist for those who wish, upon their own initiative, to create new industries here.  It seems that by a slight extension <Col N="353" /> of the principle of the Act a good deal might be done towards making it easy for those who are interested in industrial projects and have a sound proposition to put before the public to secure public support for it and to attract public capital.  We think that might be done if the Minister would consider whether he could not embody as a condition for a guarantee under the Act that a certain proportion of the capital which it was proposed to raise under Government guarantee must be submitted to the public.  It has been argued, and I think there is a good deal of truth in it, that one of the drawbacks industry exists under is that there is no free market for shares in Ireland in any industrial project, and that there is great difficulty in creating public interest in these shares; that people feel that if they do invest money in Irish industry they will find it very difficult to realise it if they want to do so in a hurry.  That is largely due to the fact that there is practically no stock exchange operation in the investments and shares in Irish concerns.  If you read the ordinary returns from the Dublin Stock Exchange, with the exception of one or two big enterprises&mdash;the banks or Guinness's&mdash;they are mainly concerned with English companies.  It seems to me, at any rate, that if the Minister would make it a condition that people who receive a Government guarantee under this Act should offer to the public a certain proportion of their shares, and if the public begin to realise that in Irish industry they had as good safeguards, as good a return, and at any rate that their capital will be returned to them intact and that they would be assured a reasonable return on it during the time that it was being utilised in Irish industry, they would be very much readier to invest their money in it.  That would mean that machinery would have to be provided, I suppose, and that the ordinary general financial machinery would have to be developed.  I think that difficulty would be got over if the Minister himself would consider, either as an amendment to this Bill or an addition&mdash;I suppose he would have to prescribe the rules under which the <Col N="354" /> loan would be issued&mdash;making it compulsory upon the company or the persons&mdash;in most cases, I presume, it would be a limited liability company &mdash;to offer a certain portion of this guarantee capital to public subscription.</P>
      <P>In that way you will create a market; at least, you will take the first step in creating a market in so far as you have something to sell to the public which would be an attractive proposition. The return on capital would be guaranteed and they would have the knowledge that they are investing their money in concerns at home, the operations of which are more or less under their own eyes.  I suggest to the Minister that he might consider that as an amendment which he might introduce into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think there will be complete agreement among all parties that if there is one thing we are anxious to do it is to facilitate and develop industries in this country. There will be no divergence of opinion on that point, whatever divergence there may be on the methods as to how that is to be accomplished.  In the Act, which the Minister asks us to renew, very ample facilities have been given to industrialists to develop and build up new industries in which they may be interested.  It is unfortunate that more advantage has not been taken of the facilities given to industrialists in that measure.  As a member of the Committee on Public Accounts, I know that criticisms were passed on the working of the Act, but if anything could be said against the action of the Minister, the only thing that any fair-minded man could say is that he erred on the side of leniency in endeavouring to give Irish industry a chance in the particular instances in which criticism arose.  The Minister previously pointed out that the circumstances were quite exceptional, and he has now been frank enough to say that it is his intention to work this Act in the coming year, if it is renewed, as he worked it in the past.  I feel that if there is any reasonable amendment which the Opposition would like to see incorporated in this Bill, if there is any idea at the back of <Col N="355" /> their minds which they think would lead to people availing themselves more largely of the facilities contained in the measure, it would be very sympathetically considered by us on these benches. There can be no party capital made out of efforts to develop Irish industry.  We are just as anxious to have co-operation with Deputies opposite on a measure of this kind, as I am sure they are anxious for the development of Irish industry. I think, however, that the criticism offered was rather illogical, because Deputy Briscoe, on the one hand, pointed out that the Minister was inclined to forego his legal lien upon certain assets and that portion of the money, as the Deputy put it, could be used in a roundabout way as working capital.  As against that, Deputy Lemass asked was the Act sufficiently wide in its scope to furnish capital for working expenses?  It appears to me that one of these propositions destroys the other.  If it is the opinion of Deputies opposite that greater facilities should be given, we on these benches would be anxious to consider that if a motion was put down.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to give a definite promise.  The Minister is here to do that, but I say that such an amendment would have my support, and, I am sure, that of many Deputies on this side.  I would like to ask one or two questions in regard to statements made by Deputies opposite in respect to the operations of the measure.  Why has the Act failed? It has been suggested, I think, by Deputy MacEntee, that it was because people were not sufficiently aware of the facilities offered under the Act.  In my capacity as a business man I have come into touch with several industrialists coming into this country who have been considering the proposition of establishing industries here.  I know two cases where sites for premises had been taken and everything had practically been arranged, but at the eleventh hour their schemes were upset.  I said to these people: &ldquo;If you are prepared to set up industry here the Government is prepared to furnish money for the <Col N="356" /> provision of plant.  That is an inducement you will not get at the far side of the Channel.&rdquo;  The one thing we have to bear in mind, so far as industry is concerned is, as I have pointed out on several occasions, the small turnover that exists in the various industries. This particular firm to which I refer have a working capital on the far side of over forty millions sterling.  They did not want to avail of this Act as they have ample capital at their disposal, but the main thing which kept them from starting industries here was the fact that the turnover was too small and that they would not receive sufficient return on the money invested. I do not see how you could get rid of that difficulty by way of legislation.  In my opinion&mdash;I trust this statement will not engender any heat&mdash;there are a great many holders of money, people who have control of capital, who have a feeling that there is still insecurity here.</P>

      <P>While my name has been associated with reports of the Public Accounts Committee which dealt with certain aspects of the administration of the original Act, I am not going to have it said that I looked on the administration of the Act, or the Act itself, as a failure.  I have listened attentively to the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches who have taken part in the debates on the report of the Public Accounts Committee in the hope that I would hear something from them as an indication of the type of amendment which they were prepared to suggest on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I mention this matter because <Col N="357" /> the Labour Party, as Deputy Briscoe mentioned, put forward amendments to the original Bill when it was going through in 1926.  I was waiting and listening in the hope that I would get from Deputy Briscoe, who knows something about the administration of the original Act, some indication that his party were going to father the amendments we put forward in that year.</P>

      <P>From my observation and from the knowledge I have obtained of the working of the Act as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I realise that the Minister, or whatever Minister would be charged with the administration of an Act of this kind, would have to proceed very cautiously.  I know cases in which this Act prevented the closing down of large concerns in this country, but Deputies, when they come to consider either the amendment or extension of this Act, will have to say how far they are prepared to go in using the taxpayers' money for the purpose of preserving decaying industries or building up better ones.  If we are confronted with the prospect of seeing industries closed down by the pressure of Joint Stock Banks it is for the House to say, on behalf of the State, whether they will guarantee so many thousand pounds and allow the banks to have a charge on that money in priority to the State guarantee.  That is what Deputies will have to make up <Col N="358" /> their minds upon and decide when they are considering a more generous interpretation of the original Act. The State has certainly, as far as I could see, from an examination of certain files, taken a very great risk in order to help to carry on particular industries that were certainly dying out at the time the applications were sent to the Minister.  Deputy Briscoe knows that perfectly well.  He has seen certain files in connection with loans guaranteed by the State.  I hope the State guarantee will not have to be paid, but I do say that the Minister in certain cases has been very lenient&mdash;over-generous if you like&mdash; and I hope his action in taking risks, very serious risks, in order to carry on certain industries will be justified in the course of time.  I hope that Deputy Briscoe or some member of his party will indicate whether he is prepared to father the amendments which were put forward when the original Act was in Committee and that he will let us know whether he will take the responsibility of presenting these amendments or amendments similar to them on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>All that Deputy Lemass has committed himself to is, that he does not regard it as adequate. Deputy Lemass has advanced no constructive suggestion.  He has not even advanced cases of industries which would be worth carrying on and which would be inclined to make application but for certain defects in the Act.  He brought that forward as a reason for saying &ldquo;There is a gap; close it,&rdquo; but he gave no evidence of that.  He simply appealed to me to say that the Act was not adequate, and if it is not adequate to say what I would suggest myself.  I do not think that the duty of the Opposition should be confined to that.  The Deputy also made a remark that I countered on another occasion.  It is only a matter of opinion.  It was that the financial houses in this country have an attitude towards Irish industry which is not helpful to Irish industry.  I confessed here on another occasion that I had made a remark of that sort myself, but after the first six or seven months which I spent in the Department of Industry and Commerce I had to change my view.  I said that personally I had not been able to find a single case in which it could be proved that the banks &mdash;I think these were the main financial houses referred to&mdash;had shown an overrigid attitude towards Irish industrial concerns if one took into consideration the fact that the banks are merely the guardians of other people's money.</P>

When the Minister made that statement before, he did not say that his statement referred only to the <Col N="360" /> case of applications which had been made for loans.  I think that statement has been taken to indicate that the banks have been over-generous in their dealings so far as some firms were concerned and they closed down some private concerns.</P>

      <P>It does not refer only to applications coming before me, applications for loans.  I have often been asked to take up with the banks certain cases, and I think Deputy Davin was interested in one case.  He was not interested as a party, but he was interested, I think, because that particular firm came from his own constituency. I think the Deputy, in the end, was quite convinced that in that particular transaction the banks&mdash;I will not say they have been over-generous, but that they had not been too rigid and that they had not been adverse to that application.  I had other examples when I was interrupted.</P>

      <P>Surely one could go midway between patting people on the back and saying that in his opinion they have not been hostile in their dealings with Irish concerns. I say no more than that they have taken up what could be regarded as a good banking attitude.  I do not know of all the cases, but I say that of cases which have been brought to my notice in which it was alleged that hostility was shown by banks towards certain concerns I was unable to find a single case in which there was any evidence that the banks are actuated by hostility towards industrial development in the country.</P>

I do not say that the banks are to be lauded for their attitude.  I think if they took a more liberal attitude they might really do even better banking business.

      <P>I am sorry if I cannot even look at the Deputy.  A very serious charge has been made against all the financial houses in one group in the country.  These charges should not have been made without some evidence having been brought forward.  These are delicate transactions.  The Deputy may have cases which will show the attitude that he has referred to but that should not be applied to all the houses in a group.  I would be glad to be informed in confidence of any matters of that sort.  I believe certain persuasion can be used with the banks to get them to take another attitude if it can be proved that this is not bad banking business.  This Act was intended to get outside business transactions that could not be regarded as normal business of the type that a bank does in the country.  It does not go the whole way; it goes a certain way.  It does meet the case to a certain extent by my keeping strictly within the terms of the Act, having possibly widened the administration of the Act.  It does not deal with a bigger type of case that I do not want to deal with at this particular moment.  That is to say, a type of firm which finds itself short of working capital.  My view there is that whether originally or by reconstruction a firm finds itself unable to get working capital from the shareholders or subscribers, then there is a very bad case for that business.  I think that is <i>prima facie</i> a <Col N="362" /> good point.  I would not like to give money for working capital without being fully aware of the regulations with regard to the conditions under which money for working capital will be met.  The Public Accounts Committee has, to my mind, taken up a rigid attitude with regard to the administration of this Act.  I would not like to be faced with their attitude hereafter with regard to the supply of money by way of working capital.  I could see voluminous reports proceeding from the Public Accounts Committee in view of what they have already written about the two cases which have come under their notice.  If there are regulations which the Executive Council think will safeguard the taxpayers' money, then there may be some approach to this very big difficulty of working capital.  It will not help business if people interested and who know the business&mdash;people living in the locality who know those who are running the business&mdash;will not help by way of providing working capital when the State in fact takes the burden of the other charges on its shoulders.  The Public Accounts Committee has been referred to.  I referred to it myself, and Deputy Davin, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Lemass referred to it.</P>

They get two or three transactions, and they get them always a year or two after the particular date on which the loan or guarantee was given, and they cannot possibly get back to the circumstances. They write reports and produce recommendations which from the point of view of good banking and the purest of pure finance are admirable, but they do not fit in with the circumstances at the moment.  I cannot understand people sitting in that critical attitude <Col N="363" /> on the Public Accounts Committee and then coming here and adopting the other view-point that money should be lavished on Irish industry&mdash;given out hand over first under no conditions, just to help any decent Irish industry.

That is not the case.  The Minister must understand that when the members of that Committee have to go through the items of expenditure that they are committed to the examination of that expenditure under certain terms, and that is as to how that money should be spent. When the Public Accounts Committee finds that that money, in their opinion, is not spent as it should have been spent they would be lacking in their duty or in the discharge of that business if they did not refer to it.  They look upon it as their duty to do so.  In this particular case under review we have sympathy with the extension of the powers of the Minister with regard to the Trade <Col N="364" /> Loans Guarantee Act, but at the same time we maintain that under the Act as at present provided the Minister has not power to do what he has been doing.

The Public Accounts Committee never on their own initiative asked for things to be brought before them except when previously the Auditor-General had called their attention to them.  They have asked that similar cases be brought up in future.  When the Comptroller and Auditor-General brought these cases to the notice of the Public Accounts Committee, there were two points at issue: First, the legality of the loan, and secondly, the advisability of continuing in the future what I had done in the past.  Deputy Briscoe joined the great army of amateur judges who go contrary to the high legal opinion that this action which the Public Accounts Committee are criticising was quite legal.  This was the opinion of one Attorney-General who is now Chief Justice; a second Attorney-General who is now a Judge of the High Court and the present Attorney-General.

      <P>It is such a valuable point that it should be availed of and debated.

      <P>No, but some person who is more pure in finance even than the Public Accounts Committee might challenge some of the cases.  There are some people in business who are aggrieved by what was done on two occasions under consideration. But there is a second and a bigger thing in question&mdash;should this be continued for the future?  There is in the Report of the Public Accounts Committee a phrase which sets out that they are of opinion that the creation of a liability in front of a State liability is undesirable and that it should not occur in further cases.  If the Dáil wants that to be imposed on me, then, somebody should father a resolution dealing with that.  I do not agree with it.  It would tie my hands more tightly and it would, in fact, destroy three or four cases that are pending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I want to test the feeling of the Dáil with regard to that.  There is no question of where there was merely an Act there and that the money had been guaranteed illegally under it.  The Public Accounts Committee gave the opinion that it was undesirable that certain things should be done.  And the <Col N="366" /> very people who held at the Public Accounts Committee that it was undesirable are the very people who have come here and criticised in the Dáil the Government's attitude towards helping industry as inadequate.  One of the reasons why the Government's attitude is inadequate is that there is not a way of providing working capital.  They ask how will you provide working capital and get any security for the money you provide.  You have people there of two minds.  They do not think that the State guarantee should be prejudiced by having a liability in front of the State liability, though there is the same security for it, and on the other hand they would like some money to be given out and they want that it be given out without any security at all.  Deputy Lemass confined himself to the statesmanlike utterance that the Government should devise some scheme.  That is very helpful.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has not stated what scheme it is and he does not give any indication how that particular scheme is to be devised to meet the cases he has in mind.  He merely contents himself with the statement that the Government should devise some scheme.  He might stereotype that phrase in the future, and instead of making long statements he could say &ldquo;The Government should devise some scheme.&rdquo;  But that does not help those who are trying to face up to the realities of the situation, and trying to get all the parties in the House to come into one group and help to meet the wants of these industries&mdash;you do not get any further by saying: &ldquo;There is something to be done, there is inadequate provision, and you should devise something better.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I cannot answer one question that Deputy Briscoe put to me.  That is the matter of a further guarantee since 1926.  I pointed out that there was a certain amount then and a certain amount to-day.  I know that in the 1926 statement there was included a loan of £150,000 which was then passed under certain circumstances.  The circumstances have since changed and the loan has been held up.  There was another loan of £50,000, which could not have been included in the 1926 statement. If those two were included, that would mean £200,000 odd in regard to which guarantees have not been given.  The Deputy can easily find out what moneys have been guaranteed in any year, because I publish every three months a statement of the moneys guaranteed. Deputy Briscoe has referred to the way around the Alesbury case and the Glass Bottle case.</P>

I think it is a good power to have, and there may be certain cases in which, by reconstruction, money may be free for <Col N="368" /> working capital although it is not, in fact, Government money.

I say there is not a case that has been dealt with that I would regard as an undesirable precedent for myself.  The Dáil ought to take cognisance of the fact that I intend to act in this matter as I previously did.  I disregarded the report of the Public Accounts Committee where it seeks to tie me in the administration of this Act, and I ask the Dáil to support me in that policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not certainly from the explanation given by the back-benchers opposite.  I have been asked if I stood for what was done.  I may say that I do.  As regards the provision of money for working capital, there is a less case to be made for it than in the year 1926.  I would have to take into consideration the attitude of the Public Accounts Committee in the past and adopt a very narrow, rigid and conservative attitude regarding the provision of working capital unless there was something that would prevent absurd criticism here afterwards as to the method in which that particular matter was dealt with.</P>
      <P>I do not know that I understood Deputy MacEntee's point.  If I did understand him, I do not know if he understands what happened under most of these applications for moneys to be guaranteed.  The Deputy wanted that I should insist on offering to the public some portion of the guaranteed capital. People come along with a business proposition and that is considered by an advisory committee.  One of the points is the payment of interest and the repayment of capital.  It is when one can see at what rate money can be borrowed from a bank, and the committee has a good proposition before it, that it can make up its mind whether the future of the firm will give such reasonable hope that the security can be given.  Supposing there is an offer to the public, how is that to be done? It would be done first of all by asking a bank to take on a portion, say three-fourths, and then the rest could be offered.  The only one or two cases in which, apart from any necessity, appeals have been made to the public have resulted in this, that the appeal to the public having failed the bank rate of interest rose and the firm was faced with a heavier burden by reason of the fact that there was failure.  I do not think in the type of case that comes before the Department you are going to get the public interested; I think, on the whole, the suggestion would be unwise, because it would mean going for some portion of the issue to the public.  In that case it would mean that you would have either the danger of failure or that the bank would refuse to take up the issue at all.</P>

      <P>Would not that be safeguarded by this?  I thought the Industrial Trust Company was going to act as an issuing house and was going to underwrite these issues and then offer them to the public.  I admit that in a number of cases there has been failure.  I think it is due to the fact that the public have not been accustomed to do it; they have not learned to invest in Irish enterprises.  In those circumstances very few industrial enterprises take the risk of going to the public, finding that they have to get their capital more expensively if they fail.  If the Industrial Trust Company were to undertake the functions of an issuing house and underwrite most of those issues, then the difficulty the Minister referred to in connection with past instances at any rate would be overcome.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is not what you call an investing public here in the ordinary sense of the term, that people are not used to invest, but I believe that the worst way to induce them into the habit of investing is the promulgation of this particular type of case that comes before the Department.  It does not work well.  I can promise the Deputy this: where a case comes up and it seems to me to be one which the people can be interested in and brought into it, it would not be right to insist on it, but we would make the suggestion to the people concerned to look for some portion of the money to be put up by the people instead of through the banks in the ordinary way.</P>

He also points out that he has no power to do what he discussed with Deputy MacEntee&mdash;that is, to guarantee ordinary and preference shares.  If the Department takes that interpretation and the Minister takes another, I think there is a strong case made out for the purpose of amending this Act so that there will be no doubt in anyone's mind as to the legality of the action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this debate was adjourned our Party have considered the Bill, and we are going to bring in several amendments.  We object to a good many provisions in this Bill.  We think, first of all, that the idea of bringing in five people at a time to make a start is very bad, and that there is no case whatever for not electing the whole council together.  If it is said you will have too large a panel, the obvious thing is so to divide the city as to make a convement size of panel. Then we will be told that there will be all sorts of ward-heeling going on, but it will work itself out the same way in practice.  If there are a certain number of seats to be filled there will be a fairly rough idea of what the quota will be, and it will work out in practice that candidates will select particular areas in which to get their No. 1 preferences, so that there is nothing in the objection to dividing the city because it will be divided in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also objected when the debate was on before to the amount of power given to this manager.  We maintain that there should be local control all the time, whereas in this Bill the idea is that the control is to be centralised in Dublin.  As I said before, if this were only to be confined to Cork it would be all right, it would be a matter for the Cork people, but it is not.  It is setting a headline to municipalities all over the country and is going against the tide. It should be the policy of the Government <Col N="373" /> to give as much local control as possible and to encourage what they say is lacking in the people, that is the civic spirit, and to get the people to take an intelligent interest in the management of their own local councils and corporations.</P>
    <P>When they talk about giving concrete instances of jobbery, the Government themselves have proved very little against the old bodies.  They had to admit&mdash;at least they did not contradict it&mdash;that when these things did happen the public knew about them and there was a chance of stopping them.  There will be no such chance if we revert to the system that obtained before the Local Government Act was forced out of the British Government. The Irish people revolted against the grand jury system and got this system of local government.  It may have needed certain modifications.  I believe it did.  But certainly we do not want to revert to the old grand jury system. That is what this means.  I am not going to monopolise the time of the House in discussing it further.  I said enough on the last occasion.  I only want to add that this Bill needs to be withdrawn and redrafted before it will suit us, anyhow.</P>

I do not want to repeat what I said on that occasion, but I would like to amplify, in some respects at least, some of the things I said.  We have heard a good deal during this discussion, and I suppose we shall hear a good deal more, about democracy and the principles of democracy.  As I have said, I want to amplify in some measure what I said on a previous occasion.  The strict observance of the democratic principle, it is conceded, is necessary for the growth of human freedom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>These so-called economic administrations, in my view, are not an adequate substitute for self-government. I suppose, as the debate proceeds, we will hear a good deal of the rights of citizens and of the dignity of citizenship.  In my view, citizenship is just as important as nationality.  I very much regret that coincident with the dissolution of the old Cork Corporation we had the loss of civic pride amongst our citizens.  I suggest that any sound scheme of local government should not merely place the final responsibility of government in the hands of the citizens, but that it should be also designed to develop a civic responsibility.  The determination of policy, which I submit should come within the purview of the reconstituted Corporation, will work out, according to this Bill, to be purely and solely in the hands of a City Manager.  Another defect in the Bill, in my view, is that some of the clauses provide that the City Manager shall have absolute control in some matters.  I want to submit that the controlling influence of the citizen is through the council and that the council should have effective control of permanent officials, which is not conceded in this Bill.  So far as the determination of the city's future is concerned, which I submit is the exclusive right of the people, it, too, is taken from them in this Bill.  Some of the clauses provide that the Manager shall confer with the council and that he shall act as adviser, but the Bill seems, in the view of many citizens of Cork at any rate, to go farther than that.  It suggests that upon the Manager should be placed the rights of dictator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to submit to this House that surely after having achieved a certain amount of freedom we are not now going to cancel and negative everything we have fought for and suffered for by putting into the hands of any one individual the arbitrary powers suggested in this Bill.  It is also conceded that there is a close relationship between policy and finance.  Yet in this Bill these financial provisions appear to be exclusively placed in the hands of a City <Col N="375" /> Manager, which, again I submit, is not right.  Assuming for a moment that a Corporation of Cork decided on the extension of the municipal trading, town planning, an extension of the borough boundary, or any of the other things they could have done under the old regime, the Minister certainly would be giving me some information if he would let me know would the Manager in that case have power to veto this policy or policies of a somewhat similar character. There is no indication in the Bill that the Manager has not these powers. Again, some of the advocates of this Bill talk about economy, that it is more economical to govern by means of a City Manager.  I could very easily prove that it would be more economical for the city of Cork and for this country, if all goes to all, to be governed from Westminster than in the way it is governed now.  I submit that for consideration. If we are out for economy let us not economise in small things. Let us be honest.  Let us have that much common decency.  If you are going to compel the citizens of Cork, because of your economic theories, to this course let us develop that argument a little further.  Let us be just and honest and say to John Bull: Come and govern us again, because government was more economic under your rule than it is under our own.  I submit that for the very serious consideration of this Dáil.  I want to say, in this connection, that I hope that Deputies discussing this Bill will separate the City Manager from the existing City Commissioner. I do not want to have the name or the personality of the Commissioner introduced into this matter at all, but I do suggest it would be far better to continue the present system of City Commissionership than to set up what to me would appear to be a sort of &ldquo;Pooh-Bah&rdquo; for the City of Cork, who would have in his hands the administration of the whole city, the directing of its policy and everything else connected with the city's welfare. I do know that there are many people in Cork who pretend at least to have the city's interest at heart, but who are actuated by no other motive than a class motive.  People who preach to you that we should have no class warfare are the <Col N="376" /> very people to-day who are at the back of this Bill.  These people are waging class warfare in the city of Cork.  I defy anyone to contradict that statement. They succeeded in disestablishing the Cork Corporation.  I believe that 56 was too large a number.  It was an unwieldy number.  There might have been some things done that should not have been done, but, at any rate, there was no corruption proved against the old Cork Corporation.  I have already suggested that nepotism might have existed.  As long as human nature is human nature nepotism will continue to exist.  It exists in Government Departments and it will continue to exist. It exists in commercial and industrial undertakings and it will continue to exist.  It is one of the things you cannot get rid of by an Act of Parliament. Human institutions will continue to be human and they will have all the human defects, limitations and faults.  I move the rejection of the Bill in its present form.</P>

      <P>Knowing that there is an anxiety, and I think an almost unanimous anxiety, on the part of the people of Cork to have local government restored to their elected representatives as soon as possible, I suggest that the House should give this Bill the very closest possible attention and should look at it with a view to getting, as nearly as possible, a Bill that will meet the requirements of every individual opinion in the House, while at the same time not rushing its consideration.  To my mind, if we were to take the difference between the old system and what is proposed now, we would get a very good Bill.  The essential difference is the introduction of the City Manager system.  Offering an individual opinion. I say that I am prepared to accept that as a step in the right direction, and in stating that I would like it to be definitely understood that I want a City Manager appointed and not a city master. I believe that there is in this Bill a basis on which we could all meet one another's wishes, and I would suggest that the Minister should, if possible, meet the views and the criticisms that will be expressed on this Bill, allow the people of Cork to vest full authority <Col N="377" /> in those that they will elect and give them the right and the authority to administer the city's affairs.  My objection to transferring that authority to a manager is exactly the same as it would be if it were transferred, we will say, to the Minister for Local Government. I do not mind the Minister having a check on and a certain amount of authority over the proceedings of the Council, but he should not be in a position to suggest or to recommend particular activities in the city, at any rate, without making these suggestions through the elected representatives.  In speaking of the City Manager, I would also like to be satisfied that there is a necessity for existing officials, particularly the Town Clerk.  I would like to get an assurance that the body elected will have authority&mdash;I think they actually will under this Bill&mdash;to suggest, if the occasion arose, that only one official would be acting in that capacity.  To my mind, the functions of the City Manager and of the Town Clerk are similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of opinion that the first election should be for the entire number of members for the future body.  I admit that there may be an argument for the annual election of a portion of the number, but I suggest that the Minister should give weight to that point.  I firmly believe that in Cork it would be more popular than an annual election would be.  Again, there is the expense of annual elections.  While agreeing, personally at any rate, that the appointment of a manager is a good one, I think it was a wrong principle to name a particular individual. I hope I will not be misunderstood in making that remark, because I am not going to enter into any controversy as to whether Mr. Monahan is or is not the most capable manager that could be found for Cork.  The Bill states that &ldquo;there shall be paid by the Council to the Manager such remuneration as the Minister shall from time to time determine.&rdquo;  I think that that is absolutely wrong in principle, that the elected representatives are really the people who are most competent to judge what additional remuneration the Manager may be entitled to.  As far as I can see the Manager is being <Col N="378" /> brought up to the level of the elected representatives, and beyond that level. I am prepared to give the Manager every authority possible, provided that that authority comes from the Corporation. In my opinion they should have the same authority as the board of directors of any business concern, and the City Manager should simply take his orders from them and carry out their policy.  Another point is that the Manager and the Town Clerk can themselves pay accounts, and admit any expense or accounts or any liability incurred by the Council.  I think that at least another name should be added to theirs, that is the chairman of the meeting at which those accounts were passed.  Again, I would suggest that, in the formulation of the actual policy of the Corporation, the Town Clerk should give at least the usual reasonable notice of the intended working of that policy, at periods of one or two months, so that the Council would have an opportunity of advising and making suggestions to the Manager.  I do not quite understand what machinery will be substituted for the twelve standing committees of the old council. whether they will simply be suspended and the work done by the Manager, so that committee work will no longer be necessary and that the council will simply meet fortnightly or monthly but will not have an opportunity of discussing the actual carrying out of their policy.  I would like the Minister also to consider seriously Section 19, which places in the hands of the Manager the absolute right of acting for the Corporation &ldquo;in every action or other civil proceeding, whether civil or criminal, instituted in any court of law or equity by or against the Corporation.&rdquo; I am perfectly satisfied that there is in this Bill a basis on which we could construct a good system of government for the city, after an exchange of ideas by Deputies and an endeavour to meet their different points of view.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that this Bill will be applied to other boroughs in Ireland. That may be right or it may be wrong. Possibly the principle could be applied, if accepted by the other boroughs and <Col N="379" /> by this House, but I do not think&mdash; and I do not think there is a Deputy here who will disagree with me&mdash;that the actual details which could be suitably applied to Cork could at the same time be suitably applied to Dublin, particularly the greater Dublin which is now in the air.  I am perfectly certain that there are many activities that are peculiar to Cork and that could not be applied to Waterford, Limerick or Dublin.  The real essential I think the Minister ought to meet is to vest the full authority of the people in the representatives.  It is only a question of trust.  The Manager will have his actual position defined, giving him every authority that is absolutely essential for the efficient administration of the city.  I believe that in time it will really develop in such a way that he must be really influenced by his directors, who are elected representatives, and that they will guide him in a policy for the future government of the city.  I ask the Minister why not concede those points now?  In making that right, while the amendments that would be necessary would be many&mdash; some from myself&mdash;they would simply be a change of words.</P>
    <P>For instance, I cannot understand what objection the Minister could have to having the cheques in settlement of accounts which are sent in signed, in addition to the two servants of the Corporation, by an elected representative. Is it that his signature is not as good as those working under the city authorities?  I quite understand that small accounts might be dealt with in the way they were met in the old days, when a limited sum was voted for the payment of such accounts.  That money would be at the disposal of a City Manager.  But I certainly think it is essential that the new body should have absolute right to deal with the spending of every penny of the rates.  They are responsible for striking the rates, and for the estimate.  I cannot see the reason for not granting power to criticise expenditure and safeguard their responsibility.  I saw that reference was made in the debate that took place last week to a public body and Irish manufacture.  I think it was wrong.  I remember the incident, and I <Col N="380" /> say that Irish manufacture got a preference from that body, and that Irish manufactured articles were purchased. I am sure the same would apply in the future.  In this Bill I think that the elected representatives will have authority to control the Manager to that extent.</P>
    <P>As to the authority over the staff, speaking personally, I think it is a step in the right direction, provided the Corporation have full authority over the Manager, and that if any victimisation takes place the elected body will have an opportunity of bringing him to book.  If his explanation is satisfactory, it is for that body to say so.  But the essential thing for the good government of Cork lies only in one direction and that is the question of authority.  If you take authority out of the hands of the elected representatives, you are not going to get a decent type of public representatives into these bodies, because they will not stand for election.  Perhaps, for a year or two, if this Bill passes as it now stands, you would get a certain representation, but, if it is going to be a close borough, and if the Manager will be the actual master of the elected representatives, I think it will be found that in a few years you will get no decent representation in local government. I am perfectly prepared to stand by that statement.  The difference between giving the Corporation full authority and the authority given them in the Bill is so small that I cannot see any reason why the Minister should not grant the little but more that is required in order to have a really good Bill, and get the good-will of this House and the good-will of the people of Cork.  In this Bill the absolute authority of the Corporation over policy has not been clearly defined with regard to future expenditure. The Bill says: &ldquo;The Manager shall cause to be prepared in each year at the prescribed time and in the prescribed form an estimate.&rdquo;  At what date prior to that do the Corporation have authority to suggest, say, a scheme of housing or improved methods of sanitation?</P>

      <P>I take it that the elected representatives will, as previously, be elected to the outside committees, and that it will be no longer essential that these representatives will <Col N="382" /> be members of the newly-elected body &mdash;that they will have authority to select members from outside their own body. I think it is a wrong principle that the manager should have authority within this, for instance, to attend outside committees&mdash;extern committees of the Corporation.  I cannot see how a measure is going to succeed that will bring to the level of the elected representatives even their chief executive officer.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that the essential differences of opinion when boiled down are very trifling.  I believe that under this Bill there is an almost solid foundation for an agreed measure, and I trust that while the Bill is before the House every Deputy will look at it from the point of view that authority should be vested in those whom the people select as worthy of it.  The manager will have his authority preserved within the definition of manager. As the Local Government Department has its veto, in so far as it receives the minutes and approves of almost every act of every public body, that is protection enough.  At any rate, the manager will get sufficient authority from the elected representatives to carry out his position efficiently.  The authority of the manager, to my mind, should be interpreted in the same way as you would interpret the authority of a manager of any business concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter and, if possible, meet the objections to the Bill, which, to my mind, would not seriously alter it.  You have given perhaps 70 per cent. of authority to the elected representatives, and you have held back 30 per cent., which, to my mind, does not lead to efficient administration. If you are afraid to transfer that to the elected representatives, would it not be within my right to say that on my part I am afraid to transfer it to two individuals?  You will have greater security, at any rate, in a reasonable number than in one or two. Many of the powers set out in the Bill for the Corporation would not provide matter for discussion for even one meeting per year.  You should allow the newly elected body full authority to define policy and make it clear that their Manager will carry it out.  There is a very strong feeling in Cork that the <Col N="383" /> full number of members should be elected the first year.  I can see a lot of arguments in favour of the other system, but I think greater security would result from such an election as that.  I would appeal to the Minister to try and get this Bill passed as soon as possible by accepting the recommendations, which are not very essential, and will not change the Bill materially.</P>

      <P>My experience of that Manager on the Board of Assistance for the past twelve months is that on every occasion I have found an extreme anxiety on his part to increase the salaries of already over-paid officials.  Of course, that is only a natural outlook for him.  I object strongly to the fixing of the salary of the City Manager by the Department and the Minister instead of by the Corporation.  I think it is the duty of the Corporation, who are the best judges of what they can pay, or what the ratepayers can pay, to fix the salary they can afford to pay, and that it should not be the duty of any Department in Dublin.  I can give definite instances, if the Minister desires them, of interference by the present Commissioner, who is to be the future City Manager, in connection with officials' salaries, even salaries which were fixed by Inspectors sent down by the Department.</P>

      <P>The same attack that I make here I made in the Commissioner's presence.  I am neither afraid nor ashamed of it.  I suppose the next thing we will have will be Commissioners coming in here to make laws. In fact that is the whole gist of this Bill.  It is the hidden hand, to set up the puppets as a cloak for dictatorship just as we have the puppets in here acting as a cloak for the dictatorship of the Executive Council.  It is about six of one and half a dozen of the other. This Bill is setting up in Cork merely a lot of puppets without any power whatever.  The manager is going to do the paying, and between the manager and the Minister they are going to fix the salary.  The cloak is going to be there in the shape of the Corporation to fix how much is to be paid.  I think it is nonsense.  Interference by the City Manager should be put an end to.  The Corporation should at least have the fixing of his salary.  I think the present Commissioner is the wrong man to be kept in as manager of Cork city owing to his attitude there, which has been a political attitude and nothing else but a political attitude.</P>

      <P>I am not a Cork man, thank God, and this is not a Cork Bill.  This Bill has been described by Deputy French as a step in the right direction.  I do not know what direction he means, but to my mind it is a very long step towards bureaucratic government.  Deputy Anthony said that when the Cork people asked for a tune they got a Beethoven Sonata.  I think when they asked for a tune they got a comic opera, because if this Bill was placed in the hands of W.S. Gilbert he would produce a comic opera that would beat the &ldquo;Pirates of Penzance&rdquo; for absurdity.  It is not in the City Hall that they should meet, under this Bill, but in the Cork Opera House, where the ratepayers might instal the Lord Mayor with a chain of office, while the manager would put the shackles on <Col N="385" /> his feet, and lead him round to the public boards to which he was nominated. The Lord Mayor may talk himself, but the purse strings will be held by the manager, and we are preparing a comic opera not only for Cork but for other cities also if this Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>The first few sections of this Bill are all right.  These sections lead the Cork Corporation to believe that they are going to get some powers, but what is built up in the first two sections is knocked down in the others.  If we were starting a Corporation in some &ldquo;shack&rdquo; town in Central Africa or America and gave this as a charter of liberty to administer there for the first time, we might then be on safe ground in saying these people have no experience and no local control and we are going to test them.  Deputy de Valera said that at the start he would rather favour the idea of separating the deliberative from the administrative functions.  I do not know if there are enough slaves in Cork to go to the trouble of getting elected to sit down to exercise deliberative functions with the manager beside them with the purse strings to do the administrative work.  That is not local government.</P>

      <P>It is not the reverse in the Bill.  The fact remains that the Corporation of Cork, as constituted under this Bill, cannot pay a penny except for one purpose, and that is that they can vote a gratuity to the manager. That is the only sum they are allowed to pay.  No matter what they deliberate about, the gentleman with the purse, that is the manager, the gentleman who goes around with the halter round&mdash;I was going to say the bear of Cork, but really the Mayor of Cork&mdash;to the public boards in Cork. will tell him he can take part in any discussion, or he can talk away as long <Col N="386" /> as he likes, but &ldquo;you will not get any money from me, no matter what you decide.&rdquo;  That is a humiliating position to put any town or city into: to elect a council to be managed by an official. It is the first and a very long step towards bureaucratic government, and one which the representatives of the people here should see is not started in Cork.  Even if the Cork people want it, we, as representatives of the people, should at its earliest stage see that that policy is not pursued in other places later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be remembered that when the motion for Second Reading was on, on the last occasion, I indicated I had no opportunity of discussing this matter with our Party.  I expressed my own individual views and indicated, as far as I was concerned, the belief that if the amendments I wanted personally could be got within the scope of the Bill we would be prepared to give it a Second Reading. Since then I have had an opportunity of getting the matter discussed by our members, and what I said on that occasion holds good, I think, for us as a body&mdash;that is, that we are prepared to give this Bill a Second Reading, provided that the amendments we wish to introduce can be covered within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments are rather numerous and they deal with almost every section.  Our anxiety to facilitate the Second Reading was to enable this Bill, if possible, to be dealt with before the recess.  We think it is advisable that the control of their city should be given back as quickly as possible to the representatives of the people, and accordingly we are anxious to facilitate the passage of the Bill.  It might be helpful if I indicated the amendments to the Minister at this stage, so that he might be able to indicate in return his attitude towards certain points that we are raising in Committee.  First of all, we believe that the number of the council should not be less than 25.  We have chosen the number 30 for our amendment.  When I state that it should not be less than 25, you will see why we have chosen 30 for our amendment; the reason will be obvious in a moment.  The next point is <Col N="387" /> that they should be all elected at once for the three-year period.</P>
    <P>Now it becomes obvious that under proportional representation the city would have to be divided into certain areas, and for the division of the city into suitable areas you would want to have some Commission to settle the boundary.  Possibly that could be done by the Minister and his assistants.  If he were prepared to accept that particular amendment it could, perhaps, be done here and put into the Bill itself. There is one division of the city which is obvious.  One should look at the wards and divide the city into two parts, where the population and the valuation are practically equal.  The trouble, however, is that it is not sufficient to divide it into two parts.  You would probably have to divide it into about four parts, so as not to have too much in each particular area and so as to get a reasonable panel.  We consider that more than ten vacancies would give you a panel too large for the convenience of the electorate.  Therefore, in dividing up any number between 25 and 30&mdash;30 might not be the best&mdash; we would be prepared to take any suitable number.  Next we propose that the aldermen should be elected yearly by the whole council, just as the Lord Mayor is elected; that the first manager should be appointed by the city council with the sanction of the Minister, but only for one year; and that subsequent managers should have a five-year period of office and be eligible for re-election.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to give our reasons for that suggestion, but we, at any rate, thought that plan advisable.  The main thing is that in regard to the powers of a manager we propose to give you an official who in practice would differ very little from a Town Clerk, so that if you want an expert you would deal with him, not as a permanent and pensionable official, but as one who would be frankly regarded as an expert to do certain work for five years, and at the end of the five year period it would be possible to re-elect him if it were considered advisable.  As regards the powers of the manager and the reserved powers <Col N="388" /> of the Corporation, our purpose is to put in amendments which will add to the reserved powers indicated in the Bill two further sections providing that regulations concerning contracts for and on behalf of the Corporation should be made&mdash;that the actual carrying out of these regulations should be in the hands of the manager, but that the general regulations should be made by the Corporation.  There would also be provisions in regard to regulations for the appointment, promotion, and removal from office and the minimum and maximum rates of remuneration to be paid.  In other sections, where the manager acts on his own authority, the intention is to bring in amendments which would mean that the manager would act in consultation with the Board of Aldermen, and in one or two instances he would have to get the express sanction of that Board.  Then there are minor matters, such as the affixing of the seal.  In general cases the seal should be affixed in the presence of the Lord Mayor as representing the elected body.  I have indicated roughly the general scope of the amendments and I do not think any of these amendments would be outside the scope of the Bill if we give it Second Reading. I think that all these amendments could be brought in in Committee without going outside the general scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have listened with much interest to the various Deputies who have spoken, particularly those who have spoken the views of the citizens of Cork.  Since this Bill was introduced I have been almost deluged with representations from citizens of Cork as to what ought to be done in respect of it.  In deference to their views I would put before the House what I think is the consensus of opinion in the city of Cork, and that is, that this scheme is a courageous, honest and able attempt by the Minister for Local Government to grapple with a very difficult situation. The first point I gathered from Deputy Lord Mayor French was in reference to the number of elected representatives. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should carefully reconsider that question and see whether it would not be possible to increase the number of elected representatives from 15 to, say, 21.  I do not for one moment suggest as Deputy de Valera suggested, that the Minister should take steps to turn the Corporation into a second Bedlam, like the county council at present.  We want to see in this Bill, when it becomes an Act, that every section in the city is represented on the new council that would be for the benefit of Cork.  If the proposed system is carried out there might be some question as to whether that would be arrived at or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the Lord Mayor's suggestion, that the first election should be for the entire number of vacancies.  You have in Cork a great many interests.  We would like to see the Government Party, though keeping as far aloof from politics as possible, represented on the Council.  We would like to see Fianna Fáil represented also, as the Corporation would not be full without them.  It is ably represented there at present.  We want to have the group which I represent also there.  There is, in fact, no group in the city of Cork which needs that representation more badly than that one.  If the Minister gets his view carried into operation.  I am afraid that the first result would be to knock out of existence the most useful group which Cork has at present&mdash;namely, the Independent group.  We would also like to find room for the Commercial group. I would like to go one step further <Col N="390" /> and say that Labour ought to be represented, and very well represented, in the Corporation.  As the Bill stands, however, you will not have a Corporation that will appeal to all the citizens. I think the ex-servicemen&mdash;I am not making any particular reference to Deputy Flinn&mdash;ought to be represented in the new Corporation.  The next question which the Minister will have to consider will be whether the new election is to be annual or triennial. One hinges on the other.  They are intertwined.  If he holds an election he must make up his mind whether he will increase the groups.  I suggest that he should.  I do not, of course, know as much about the matter as he, because he has gone to the trouble of visiting the city and interviewing every section and every interest represented there in his efforts to give them all a fair trial.  I put it to him to try and see whether he could increase the number of representatives from 15 to 21.  If he does, he will be met with the question whether he will elect them all together or have triennial elections.</P>
    <P>Everyone who has studied the past history of this country, particularly the past history of Cork, knows that elections are events that are of very little use to the general commercial prosperity of the country.  Other things being equal, if you have an election every three years, instead of every year, it will be better for the country, and, in this instance, better for Cork.  The other question which the Minister will have to consider is whether he will have in this Corporation a number of representatives only of the large parties of the country, and whether he will have a Corporation from which you will drive out the smaller groups to which I have referred.  I do not suggest that the group that I belong to is one of the smaller groups.  It has been abundantly proved that where an Independent did stand he belonged to the largest group.  It is a matter which the Minister will have to consider, because it might mean that one of the smaller groups might be driven out of existence, and, if so, so much the worse for the Corporation of Cork. The Lord Mayor told us that there is <Col N="391" /> in Cork at present&mdash;and I am afraid he is right&mdash;a fear that if the new Bill comes in as it stands you will get no decent representation.  That danger and fear exist.  The people of Cork are anxious that, in so far as Cork and the Corporation of Cork are concerned, we should have none but Irishmen, and that the day should never dawn when we would have anyone but citizens of our own city and country, and that none but illustrious citizens should serve.  There is that danger and fear in Cork, and the Lord Mayor thought it necessary to draw attention to it.  It was as an outcome of that fear at the last election that we had the great honour thrust upon us of having as our representative the President of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House is very glad to have the advantage of the additional statements by Deputy Anthony and Deputy de Valera. They have cleared the air and have shown what is generally thought about the different aspects of the Bill after mature consideration.  What I feel is the trouble, after much of the thought and much of the discussion that have taken place on the Bill, is that people are desperately frightened of clear-drawn lines.  They shy at them.  They realise the fact that if a man is put into a managerial position and has to carry on the duties of that position, the lines for him are very clear, but when you put down in cold print the straight lines with regard to the position of a manager, as distinct from an elected council, it gives you a magnificent opportunity of talking about democracy, the things that are against democracy and a lot of nebulous stuff like that. Really the only thing we are quite clear about at the moment is the extent to which there is a difference of opinion on the point of view of numbers for the Council, but until Deputy de Valera gave us the particular point upon which he is prepared to move amendments there was nothing but suggestions, obscurity and fighting shadows. Probably when we come to consider Deputy de Valera's amendments we will find that they also are built around shadows and nowhere come down to <Col N="392" /> really practical principles.  In the first place we have the question of numbers. I did not put down the number 15 for the Council as a figure to be fought step by step until I came to the stopping point.  I came to that conclusion in consultation with those in the Department and outside the Department with whom I had discussions on the matter.  I came to it as being a number that would give you a Council in Cork of very representative citizens, and as being such a number as would enable the Council to carry out its discussions in a systematic way and arrive at decisions without unnecessarily long discussions.</P>
      <P>There is no use in saying that if you make the Council too small you are going to rule out small and important interests.  If small and important interests do feel that they should be represented in the Council, what is the use of having them represented if giving them representation there means that the Council will be swollen to such an extent that it will not be able to discharge its business without dragging in nonsensical and extraneous matters in its discussions?  On the other hand, these interests have to depend upon the efficient carrying out of the deliberations of the Council, the efficient carrying out of the work of officials, and if you swell the number of your Council to an excessive extent you cannot have efficient discussions and clear and satisfactory decisions.  I would require to hear very much more said with regard to the numbers before I would agree that 15 is not the more suitable.  On the question of the division of the city, you have to balance, as Deputy Wolfe says, the annual elections against the division of the city.  I have looked at the city, at its divisions and different wards, and I am convinced that the interests of the city are very much bound up with getting representatives each one of whom is returned with reference to the city as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that to divide Cork up into four divisions for the election of the council of the Cork Corporation would be to blemish the future of your administration in Cork.  It would be simply getting back to a very definite ward system.  If, after <Col N="393" /> considering all that may be said on the matter and all that may be embodied in the different amendments that are going to come before us, it should be the fate of the Minister for Local Government that he has to draw a line through Cork, I certainly would not draw it along any particular line that was drawn there before.  I would be prepared in the circumstances to draw such a line through it that something would have to be done to remove that line in some way or other.  I personally would not have it on my own conscience to draw any line in Cork that would remain there and be the root from which ward interests of one kind or another would arise at some time in the city because it seems to be particularly important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the reasons for suggesting that Cork should be divided into one, two or three wards are because of the Minister's own objections that if an election took place for all the candidates, the ultimate number that he mentioned of fifteen, there was the possibility of a long ballot paper.  To obviate that difficulty, it was suggested that the city should be divided into two wards. The Labour Party are prepared to withdraw any objection they may have had to making the city one electoral area.  I would like the Minister to bear in mind that the reason I suggested two wards was because the Minister himself thought that the ballot paper would be too large.  I suggested that it would not be because of any anxiety on the part of the citizens to go forward for election.</P>

      <P>If there are details to be discussed it would be better that they should be discussed in Committee. I feel that it is so terribly easy to go off into generalities on the matters we are discussing that they could best be discussed on definite amendments. I personally found amongst every section of the people with whom I have discussed this matter in Cork a very strong desire to get away from wards. As far as I am concerned, I am very definitely against the division of the city into wards.  A long ballot paper would not frighten me away from that, <Col N="394" /> so convinced am I of the disadvantages that are likely to accrue.</P>

      <P>In this Bill I propose getting away from them by annual elections.  I think in Cork you can get away from the ward system by having annual elections.  Any further discussion on that matter would more properly arise on the Committee Stage. All I wanted was to be clear in regard to my attitude.  As to the question of the manager and the council, we have to be clear also in that connection. There is no use in falling back on the type of reflection that Deputy Anthony fell back on, speaking here to-day, that the policy was to be purely and solely in the hands of the City Manager; that he was to have the rights of a dictator. That is simply getting away from the actual facts stated in the Bill.  I want the Dáil to be definitely clear on the powers, duties, and responsibilities that are to be vested in the Cork Corporation. The Bill proposes that some be exercised through the council and some through the manager.  Those that will be exercised through the council are the important ones that are stated here and that, in my opinion, give complete control over the whole policy of the city, over the whole administration of the city, in so far as it is desirable or necessary that it should be controlled by a body which is simply deliberative and decisive.  The Bill contains, in addition, the powers necessary further to transfer from the manager to the council such powers, duties and responsibilities as a certain majority of the council, after full experience of the position there, consider should be transferred to the council, and that the Minister, with or without a local inquiry into the matter, is prepared to agree to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even to suggest, as Deputy de Valera suggests, that additional powers should be put in there enabling the council to frame regulations dealing with appointments and to frame regulations dealing with contracts; to put into the Bill that the new Cork Council when it is <Col N="395" /> appointed, or after it is appointed, or after it has had some experience, can of itself make such representations to the Minister as will transfer an additional responsibility to them or a power to them in this respect, seems rather out of proportion and it seems asking a body here to do what might more efficiently and satisfactorily be done by the council below.  In so far as the manager has responsibility thrown on him under Section 13 (2) he is subject to the regulations made from time to time by the Minister for dealing with these matters in the same way as any other local body.  It may be stated in too flagrant words for the purposes of a general discussion on democracy. The words here are: &ldquo;That the decision of the manager on any such question shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo; These words may be too flagrant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">

      <P>In so far as there are matters&mdash;and there are many &mdash;dealing with the conditions of service, pay and superannuation of the staffs, in so far as there are regulations made by the Minister in respect of these, the manager is subject to these things.  With regard to the position of the manager, it is dual.  In the first place he exercises, on behalf of the Corporation, those duties, powers and <Col N="396" /> responsibilities that are not vested in the council.  Then he is the chief executive officer carrying out the wishes of the council in the matters that the council have responsibility over, and carrying out his own decisions in those matters in which he has power of decision.  As regards the manager, the question has been raised of the appointment of the first manager, the term of office of subsequent officers and the remuneration of the manager.  I would like to put to Deputy de Valera on the proper occasion what kind of an expert, fully qualified to carry on the managership and the very intricate and difficult work of the management of a modern city, he is going to get, if he asks him to come along and take up a five years term of appointment?  It is not like a person in certain kinds of technical business who can go from one business to another.  There are not very many cities here.</P>

      <P>The Bill as it stands at present puts the manager in the same kind of position as any officer of a local body with a special provision as to his removal by the Council and Minister.  In regard to the question as to why the Minister rather than the Council should fix his salary, in fact it is only stating explicitly in the Bill the powers that the Minister has in respect of officers of local bodies.  I would like to say in this regard that from the experience that we have had of certain local bodies, who cannot distinguish between the importance of getting a good man and paying him well in a pivotal position, where so much depends on efficiency and economy, I think that the Minister's judgment in this particular <Col N="397" /> matter is a sounder thing to rely on in our present inexperienced position with regard to the fixing of salaries for managers than to rely on the local bodies.  I think it is not unreasonable that it should be stated that the Minister should fix the salary in this particular instance, because he would fix it actually in any case; if a satisfactory salary were not proposed by the local body he would step in.  My own position with regard to the officer in the position of manager is that so much for efficiency and so much for economy depends on him that he should be paid a substantial salary which should be fixed by the Minister. Harking back to what Deputy Anthony said with regard to the development of civic responsibility and civic pride, and that if your working of city government is not carried out in such an efficient way as to show results around the city, is not carried out in such a way as to stimulate civic pride&mdash;well, all the democratic theory that is going to be at the basis of the election of your council, all that is not going to be any avail to you, because you cannot develop character and civic pride in theory, except that theory is going to work out and show something in actual practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various small matters have been dealt with as regards the manager having responsibilities with the Town Clerk for such things as the making of payments.  There is no payment that will be made that will not be made as a result of a contract for which, if it is a matter within the sphere of the council, the council will have authorised the entering into.  In the first place there must be the current knowledge as to how different payments generally are being made. but in any case such payments as are made will have to run the gauntlet of the auditor, and if there is anything wrong with these particular payments it is a matter for the auditor, and it is a matter in very different circumstances from the old circumstances. Under the old regime responsibility was not properly fixed, nor properly focussed, and when he came after two years or so to examine accounts, certain action was taken, and it was <Col N="398" /> found that a certain payment was made that was unsound or irregular. From the point of view of the auditor, the auditor surcharged, but from the point of view of the Minister who had to uphold that surcharge or not uphold it, it was very often found that the responsibility in the matter was so diffused that it was impossible to stand over the surcharge or to get the money refunded.  But where irregular payments are made under the new circumstances, where you have a manager responsible for all these matters, and the responsibility sinks right down along in a very fixed way, you can have none of that loose responsibility in the making of payments that you might have before, and such payments as are irregularly or wrongly made can be made fully and effectively the subject of surcharge.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised with regard to the use of the seal.  May I say in connection with that that in reply to some question of Deputy Lemass the other day I spoke of the manager acting through sealed orders where he took action that otherwise would have been taken by the council. I should have said he would act through signed orders.  As far as the use of the seal is concerned, there are certain regulations with regard to the use of the seal, and if it is clear when we go into it, and if it is necessary for someone representing the council to be present when affixing the seal&mdash;well, that can be done.  The affixing of the seal is a simple business matter.  I do not see at all why any elected representative should come in and be present at the affixing of the seal any more than an elected representative simply should come in and put his name to cheques. Someone spoke of the manager, I think it was Deputy French, as the managing director of an ordinary business.  Well, I think it will be found to be a very silly practice in ordinary business that one of the directors should be called in to sign cheques going out, possibly to pay bills, or that he should be called in to affix the seal, the affixing of which is an ordinary business matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera introduced the idea of a council of aldermen.  I must wait until I hear the subject developed <Col N="399" /> to see what their particular functions will be.  There may be a number of other points that require to be dealt with, but there is the one I would like to be clear and emphatic about, and that is the control of the purse Deputy O'Hanlon speaks about.  The council is given complete power of making a rate and of borrowing money, and they are given complete power, in the ultimate, of deciding what the estimate is to be, and in so far as plans have to be made beforehand, such as Deputy French spoke about, of necessity if you are going to have a housing scheme and going to repair roads and make improvement in your water works, you are not going to wait until you make your estimate and strike your rate to get ahead with your plans.  The completest power of policy and of planning beforehand to carry out that policy and then striking a rate for the carrying out of that work is vested in the council.</P>

It is a fact that that particular section gives complete power to the council to strike a rate and to pass an estimate they think is right.  They are only required under that section to wait for fourteen days in case the manager puts up such a definite objection as is stated there, so that the thing will not be done in a hurry, so that the council and the manager sitting down to discuss the matter will not take a decision that might be a hot decision and might require to be amended.  Fourteen days on each side would see how the difference of opinion would be met and then the council could take its own decision.</P>

      <P>I hope I have made it somewhat clear that in so far as the control of the Minister is brought particularly into this Bill, he is brought in in no way that he is not brought in under the scheme of local government generally.  So far as he appears particularly in the Bill he appears as a suitable agent for the transfer from the manager to the council, and vice versa, of such reserved functions <Col N="403" /> as the majority of the council think should be moved in that particular way.  That is not interference.  He fixes the manager's salary.  That is simply a definite policy in regard to the Minister in this particular matter.  In no other way does he appear in the Bill except in such a way as his ordinary responsibilities with regard to any local bodies would bring him into contact with them.</P>

      <P>There are two amendments.  The first is: Section 6, sub-section (2).  To delete in line 2 the word &ldquo;Trustees&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;National Executive.&rdquo;  The section reads at present: &ldquo;The first ordinary meeting of the Trustees shall be summoned by the chairman of the Trustees....&rdquo; That was an obvious mistake, a drafting error.  The trustees will not have come into being at that time.  They are being appointed by the National Executive of the cattle trade, and the first ordinary meeting of the trustees must be summoned by the chairman of the National Executive, so that the amendment inserted in the Seanad was quite correct.  I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in the amendment.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the <Col N="408" /> Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Section 10.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3) If any person forges or counterfeits any stamp supplied by the Trustees under this section or uses, sells, or exposes or offers for sale any stamp which is to his knowledge a forgery or counterfeit of any stamp so supplied such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 10 deals with the method of the payment of the charges and sets out that the payment shall be by purchasing stamps from the trustees and putting them on a certain form which will be handed to the captain of the ship on the loading of the cattle.  These stamps will be printed by the trustees, who will make arrangements for selling them.  The stamps themselves will merely cost the price of the printing and the paper, but it was suggested that attempts might be made to forge these stamps and that provision should be included in the Bill for a penalty in the case of anybody who attempted to counterfeit or forge them.  To meet that point this sub-section was added in the Seanad.  I think that is necessary, because stamps will be put on, not only by the owners, but by drovers and all sorts of people, and it is only right that there should be a provision in the Bill to provide against the forging of stamps that would be quite easily forgable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated by the Minister for Finance that taxation had been reduced.  That cannot be held to be an explanation of the present position. We find the revenue down by £959,000.  We are faced with a declining revenue, which is a very serious situation.  Obviously the State must find new sources of revenue to meet such decline, and such sources must offer to the citizens some returns in the way of service other than those which are at present afforded.  The present services cost too much, and the <Col N="410" /> benefits which the trade and industry of the citizens derive are not commensurate with the burden imposed by these taxes.  If they were we would not be faced now with the situation which is developing.  When before four months of the financial year have expired it is already manifest that the whole basis of the Minister's Budget proposals has failed, it is time to take serious notice of the position.  The Minister budgeted for an extra £1,149,000 this year.  Already the revenue for fourteen weeks is over £950,000 less than it was for the same period last year.  I wonder how the Minister will account for that and what will be his explanation.  If taxation had been reduced, the explanation of course would be comparatively simple.  But taxation has been increased, and increased in such a form that receipts into the Exchequer should immediately react in that increase.  But the very taxes from which the increase was to be derived, which were depended upon to bring in this million odd, are those which are responsible for the greater portion of the decrease in revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By shortening the brewers' credit the Minister hoped to secure an extra £350,000 this year.  Some of the proceeds of that forced collection ought to be, and are actually included, in the receipts from taxes to date.  However, what do we find?  The receipts from Excise are down by £405,000; a decline of £405,000 in fourteen weeks.  By how much will they be down in 52 weeks?  What chance has the Minister of receiving from these taxes what he collected last year, not to mention the extra sum of £350,000 which he has budgeted for?  If he does not secure that, what chance has he of balancing his Budget?  The more we consider the present position the more alarming it becomes.  It cannot be explained by abnormal clearances being made before the Budget.  The actual position is the reverse.  So far as there was any expectation of a boom from the Minister for Finance, it was anticipated that there might be some reduction in the liquor duty.  At the very worst there was certainly no anticipation of an increase in those duties.  Therefore, there was no inducement to release goods from bond in anticipation of the <Col N="411" /> Budget.  On the contrary, the inducement was to allow the goods to lie in bond in the hope that there would be a reduction.  The explanation, therefore, must be found in the diminishing power of the people to pay.  Is the Minister alive to the gravity of that position?  Is he content to ignore it, and to drift on, Micawber like, in the hope that something will turn up?  If he is not so content, we would like to know what steps he proposes to take to deal with the growing deficit, or to make good the failure of his recent Budget proposals.</P>
    <P>There is one proposition to which I should like particularly to refer, and that was the proposal originally made in the Dáil by Deputy Hugo Flinn to establish a State scheme of re-insurance. Every method should be sought of obtaining this extra revenue, which is required at home, and not put the extra burden of a loan on the people.  We had before us&mdash;I do not want to go into it now&mdash;an Insurance Bill, which was very restricted in its form, and which might be much extended.  I am not permitted to debate that now.  But I am making suggestions to show that revenue could be derived from a further consideration of that matter.  The estimated value of the property belonging to public authorities is, I believe, £20,000,000.  The insurance premium might be taken at 1/6 per cent., or a premium income of £15,000.  If the Company continued to hold an average of only ten per cent. of all risks, the Company would offer to the Minister for Finance about £18,000,000 of risks. The Company would pay for their re-insurance about £13,500, less 25 per cent., or a net payment of £10,125. Thus the Minister would receive £10,125 per year.  The outgoings would be, say, loss due to maturing risk, at eight per cent.&mdash;the Minister calculated 7.35, as far as I remember, for Ireland &mdash;£1,080; administration costs, £1,500; total outgoings, £2,580; or an annual profit to the Department of Finance of £7,545.  It may be said that that is a small amount, a negligible sum&mdash;but it is profitable beginning, and in our present plight we will have to take account of every thousand pounds and every ten thousand pounds which it is possible to <Col N="412" /> get for the country.  You would have there the nucleus of a complete scheme for State re-insurance.  Handling thus the safest and simplest form of re-insurance, a staff would be trained and an organisation built up enabling the State to handle re-insurance on a much larger scale.  The way would be thus paved for a system of national re-insurance, such as obtains in France.  Incidentally, though not quite pertinent to the subject, I might mention that in Canada&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to rule out the Deputy, but I do not want him to go too far.  This is a Bill which deals with expenditure, and I do not think it is relevant to raise on it the question of taxation, although it is quite relevant to indicate that existing taxes do not produce a certain revenue, and to compare the figures of revenue with the figures of expenditure, to show that expenditure ought to be decreased.  I think that a different scheme of taxation could not be advocated on the Bill, or on any stage of the Vote on Account.  Still less do I find myself able to connect what the Deputy is now saying with this particular kind of Bill; but I will let him go on to a certain point.</P>

      <P>What is in order on these Bills is largely a question of practice.  The main debate on a Vote on Account, which, ordinarily, only takes place once during the financial year, is in Committee.  The Bill is required to give statutory effect to the resolutions passed in Committee and reported to the House, and the Second Stage of the Bill is, of course, an appropriate occasion for debate on <Col N="413" /> general questions.  But I find it difficult to fit in this scheme of State re-insurance with anything I have ever heard of on a Central Fund Bill.  I am not ruling it out, but it is a matter of time.</P>

      <P>Will the Ceann Comhairle allow me to help him a little in the difficulty which he has?  What Deputy Fahy is trying to do has a direct precedent in France, where the exact provision which Deputy Fahy is now advocating was introduced in a law for assuring the balancing of the Budget by means of new fiscal resources. It is exactly the same system, and for exactly the same purpose, which Deputy Fahy is now advocating.</P>

      <P>The title of the measure which the Deputy read out would seem to strengthen my own view, that the time to discuss this is on the Budget proposals rather than the Central Fund Bill.  It is a question of debate rather than of method.  However, I will allow Deputy Fahy to proceed.  The only thing is that if we are to have the Second Stage of the Central Fund Bill availed of for a general debate on, say, State insurance, such as took place on the Second Reading of the Mutual Insurance Bill, it would be rather extraordinary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose is to show that if the principle adopted in France were followed a considerable sum of money could be obtained for the Exchequer, with great benefit to insurance, and that you could get about £175,000 per year.  In France legislation was introduced to compel every insurance company operating in France to offer for re-insurance to the Caisse Nationale whatever portion of re-insurance the Minister fixed.  That safeguarded the interests of the policyholders, as well as enabling the French native companies to compete on better terms with the outside companies.  It gives an insurance to the policyholder that even though it was a small company it was carrying on proper business, and had in a way State support at the back of it.  If that were adopted in this country it would strengthen Irish insurance in addition to benefiting the Treasury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> Each year it is calculated that about £4,000,000 are paid out in insurance premiums from the Free State.  It is very hard to get exact figures, and that is a rough estimate.  Supposing the principle of State re-insurance were adopted, extended and established here, of the £4,000,000 paid in premiums, about £2,000,000 are in respect of insurance other than life.  Supposing that of these risks the companies were to offer the State fifty per cent, then the re-insurance premiums payable to the State would be about £400,000 per annum, while the risks maturing would not represent more than £200,000. Taking £25,000 for salaries and administration, it would mean a net profit to the State per annum of £175,000, in addition to keeping all that money here, and it would certainly strengthen Irish companies as well.  These are rough figures, but I submit that by adopting this scheme the Minister for Finance would help considerably Irish industry, keep money at home, and meet to a considerable extent the deficit which he is bound to have if things proceed as they have been proceeding for the first fourteen weeks of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has already been asked to make some definite statement to the House as to the economies he foresees can be promoted in the Government service. He was asked to do that already on the Budget, and I think that the present occasion is an appropriate one to reiterate that request.  The reason is obvious.  It is that not alone, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, have we a scale of expenditure in this country that is altogether outside our limits and outside our capacity to bear, but that our financial policy at present seems to be in a peculiar condition.  We started off this financial year with the supposition that we were going to have an increased revenue of £1,100,000.  That was to come in chiefly by means of expedients that the Minister adopted, and which have already been adopted in the British Budget, shortening credit to brewers, making certain changes in the income tax collection, and so on.  But, instead of having the comfortable assurance that this year our revenue, by virtue of these expedients, will be increased <Col N="415" /> by £1,100,000, we find that for the first three months of the present financial year our receipts are down by £900,000.  Whether that indicates a general falling off in revenue or a failure of the expedients which the Minister had hoped would bring in additional revenue, I do not know.  What I do know is that if, as well as copying the expedients of the British Chancellor with reference to the collection of taxes, we had adopted some of his expedients with regard to the reduction of administrative expenses, our position might be a good deal more hopeful for the present financial year.  Sometime or another this problem will have to be faced.  It has been faced in England already by the setting up of the Geddes Committee, which went rigorously into expenditure in each Department.  The result undoubtedly was that the British people felt that their Chancellor was doing his utmost to endeavour to reduce taxation. They felt that some body was brought into existence in which they had confidence, and that it really set out to cut out waste and to refuse unnecessary expenditure. We have not such a body in this country.  The Economy Committee that was set up has nothing to show for its labours, and when it eventually has something to show, I think it will not be on the scale that the House has a right to expect, because the Committee in the first instance is not representative of public opinion in this matter.  It was simply as an expedient, in order to meet the clamant cry in the country that there should be a reduction in expenditure, that the Government set up this Committee.  The public has not confidence in it, and nothing has happened to show that they ought to have confidence in it.  We have heard nothing from the Ministerial Benches to show to what extent that Committee has proceeded with its labours, or to what extent it will be able to reduce the burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the administration which we took over from the British Government is altogether top heavy, and that amalgamations could be effected.  National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance are very glaring examples of an extraordinary proportion of the total outlay being expended <Col N="416" /> on overhead expenses.  In addition to that, we have the fact that in a great many of our Departments we have special professional annexes.  We have an Engineering Department in the Local Government Department, the Land Commission and the Board of Works. It has already been suggested from this side of the House that the exigencies of these various departments are not such, and that the work is not of such a highly technical character, that we could not get the same staff of engineers to carry out all these different works.</P>
    <P>We have also the question of the Civic Guards.  It has been stated frequently from this side of the House that the number of that force is altogether in excess of the requirements of the country.  It is true you have recently added to the duties of the Force: you asked them to carry out certain works for a short space of time, in connection with the Census of Production.  You have them collecting certain statistics in regard to tillage.  I do not know to what extent these labours which are demanded from the Police Force can be relied upon ultimately, when you require really expert information, and when you desire to be absolutely certain of it.  There is no doubt that in the larger areas you are making additional calls upon the Police Force in regard to traffic regulations.  Nevertheless, I find that in Scotland, where you have a larger number of thickly-populated centres, you have one constable to every 752 of the population; in this country you have one constable for every 426 of the population.  If we take as a basis of comparison the Scotch County Boroughs, which I think would be a more reasonable comparison, because there are several cities in Scotland and we have only one large city here&mdash;if you take as a basis of comparison the strength of the Police Force in the County Boroughs you find in Scotland there is one constable for every 1,062 of the population, whereas in this country we have one constable for every 426 of the population.  In addition to that, even if we are satisfied that the strength of the force should be maintained at the figure the Ministry require, we ought to see that the amount that is voted ought to be spent.  There <Col N="417" /> is no use voting money here as we are doing on the present occasion for the upkeep of the public services which we think are necessary and essential for the maintenance of public order and safety if the money is not expended.  In 1925-26 there was £61,291 unexpended, in 1926-27 there was £43,730 unexpended. In the Appropriation Accounts no doubt that will be explained as a saving.  Whenever money is spent in less amount than what has been estimated for that is said to be saving. Over-estimation has characterised the Government accountancy during the last few years.  In the last Public Accounts Committee Report it was stated that over-estimation amounted to 14 per cent.  There is no proof whatever and no statement from the Minister to show that there is any system of internal checks in the Department which would reduce that over-estimation and which will see that the money as voted by the House will be expended.  You have the same thing with regard to the Army. We believe the whole cost of the Army ought to be reduced, but if it is necessary to spend the amount which the Ministry allege is necessary for the maintenance of the Army, to strengthen the Police Force in this country, and to defend it from foreign enemies, it ought not to be the case that you should have, as you had in 1925-26, £389,649 less in expenditure than the amount actually granted, and in 1926-27, when the Ministry ought to have been in a position to make up their minds definitely as to what their future Army policy would be, that they ought to have been in a position in which they could say what the Army should cost after a certain number of years' experience behind them and ought to be in a position to reduce them to a certain standard, still they were in the position that £276,716 was unexpended.</P>
    <P>I submit that that state of affairs and the position with regard to Army pensions, where you had large amounts granted in 1925-26 and in 1926-27 running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, which were not, in fact, expended in those years, are a plain indication that the Government Departments are not exercising, in the making of Estimates, in the control of expenditure and in the cutting out of <Col N="418" /> waste that supervision which is necessary and which ought to be expected.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general policy of the Government, we are of opinion that the policy which was outlined by the Minister for Agriculture yesterday&mdash;namely, that the attention of the nation and the attention of the Government ought to be concentrated on the production of better butter and on the improvement of our dairy produce for the British market is not satisfactory.  Only to-day you have a statement in the British daily Press that unemployment in Great Britain is increasing enormously.  There is no doubt about that.  In spite of that fact and in spite of the fact that our competitors in the British markets have immensely greater resources and better technical training than we have to improve their produce and to get in front of us, we are still&mdash;because we are told we have such a splendid Minister for Agriculture whose policy must rule&mdash;persisting in putting all our eggs into one basket, and believing absolutely that the only hope for agriculture in the Free State is to concentrate on the improvement of our farm produce for sale in the British markets.</P>
    <P>We would like to have some assurance from the Government with regard to the other side of the picture. I think even the Minister for Agriculture, who I regret is not here, will admit that there is another side; in fact, he admitted as much to Deputy Dr. Ryan the other day, and said that there was some element of truth in the statement that we should, so far as we could, encourage the growing of wheat and try to make ourselves within certain limits as self-contained a nation as possible.  The difficulty with regard to the Minister for Agriculture seems to be that he does not see the point about the home market as distinct from the foreign market. He is apt to look on the question of Irish industry from the point of view of a speculator on the London Stock Exchange, who asks himself whether it would be better to put money into the Irish agricultural industry or into some foreign manufacturing industry. There is no doubt from the purely <Col N="419" /> business point of view, looking at it from the point of the speculator, that we must admit that our nation is far behind other nations in regard to productivity, but is that going to discourage us?  Are we going to look at this from the standpoint of the ruling prices in the British market, from the point of view of conditions in Canada or elsewhere, or are we going to look at it from the point of view of real statesmanship&mdash;namely, that our population has been dwindling, that the economic fact is that while bullocks have been increasing men have been decreasing?  One must realise that the steps proposed in the present policy of the Government are not sufficient, nor do I think that they can claim they are sufficient, to change that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Some policy is, however, necessary to make the Irish people feel that the Government are doing their best for the farmer, to make the man who tills the land realise that he has a real friend in headquarters in Dublin, who is doing his best to reduce railway freights, to see that he gets good prices for his produce, to see that he will not be left in the position in which he has hitherto been left&mdash; namely, that the man who employs only a herd and raises bullocks is going to get the same relief in agricultural rates and in income tax as the man who gives good employment and is a real benefit to the district in which he lives.  I think that all these points deserve consideration, and I hope that the Government, in view of the serious condition of affairs in England and the steadily-growing wave of depression over there, will realise, as we do, that while we are anxious to sell our products in as perfect condition as possible, and at as high a price as possible, we feel it is necessary to build up our industries at home, that the bulk of our population who are attached to the soil are either leaving the soil for America or drifting into the towns, and that some policy is necessary to keep our population on the soil in future.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the Gaeltacht. When that question was being <Col N="420" /> discussed here the Minister for Finance, while he was quite plausible, as he generally is when putting up a bad case and making excuses, was not even doing justice to himself in the matter.  The fact is that since the old Congested Districts Board was abolished the Land Commission have done nothing at all in comparison with what that Board used to do in poorer districts.  The result is that you have Deputies from various Western constituencies getting up here and, to the amazement and disappointment of Ministers, asking for doles and subsidies.  Why is that?  The reason is that under the old British regime you had a special department established and special arrangements made to deal with poverty and with small-holders, to provide them with employment throughout the year, to distribute land, and to give them grants for building and roofing their houses and for other purposes.  The Land Commission&mdash;I do not think any of the heads of that Department will contradict me&mdash;are not doing the same amount of work as was done by the Congested Districts Board, and there is nothing like the same number of men employed in the Congested Districts as there was under the old regime.</P>
    <P>The very estates which the Land Commission have distributed, or are proposing to distribute, were all arranged for and the entire work in connection with their distribution was actually prepared and done by the old Congested Districts Board.  The present Land Commission carried the work through and finished it, and now want to take upon themselves the honour of doing work which was really done by the old Congested Districts Board. Despite the fact that the Congested Districts Board had to cater for the poorest sections of the people, had to distribute all these doles and grants, at which the Ministry scoff, they proved it could be a genuine business proposition and they handed over to the National Exchequer a sum of over one million pounds.  Our experience of the present Minister for Fisheries does not lead us to believe, if he continues in his present aimless way, that he is going to do the things which the Congested Districts Board did. When the Ministers and Secretaries Bill <Col N="421" /> was going through, he and other members of the Government had ample opportunity to state their policy.  They had the assistance of their officials, and they had the Gaeltacht Commission Report, and despite the fact that they had two years to consider the question it was revealed that they had no policy to deal with one-third of our population. On the other hand, however, we are asked to subsidise the creamery industry because the Minister for Agriculture tells us that sixpence a gallon is going to be a safe financial foundation for the future prosperity of the country.  I do not believe it.</P>
    <P>I say that while these other problems of the poorer areas and of unemployment are not being considered by the Government, while they have no policy to deal with these problems, it is not fair that Ministers should present us with Bills like the Creamery Bill and tell us that in the particular matters they have in hand they require our support and that they feel that the situation is all right.  We cannot feel that. We have no proof of it.  We feel that it would be better to ease off legislation, not to introduce so many Bills, to try and realise that, after all, what the country needs is a rest, and see what the officials that we already have and the Departments that are already in existence are doing.  Let us try them out.  Let us examine them.  That comes back again to the original question of the value of the Economy Committee of the Minister for Finance.  That Committee will, no doubt, tell us that certain economies of a small nature are possible, that, as the Minister says himself in a jocose manner&mdash;a manner that I think is not the appropriate manner that a Minister for Finance ought to adopt in this matter&mdash;a messenger might be saved in this Department, or that the buttons of a Civic Guard might be saved in some other way.  No doubt the Economy Committee, in line with these jocose suggestions of the Minister, will tell us that certain small economies are going to be effected.  They will be only a small matter, and the real point is not that we must have all these officials and departments, but whether they are giving value to the country or not, whether they can say, as in the case of an ordinary business <Col N="422" /> firm, that they are doing work that is of real value and that is really necessary for the country, and that they are not simply kept there for preserving red-tape regulations.  That question will not be entered into, but these are questions that are constantly coming before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I trust that after the session that is now being closed and when the Minister will have the task of revising the estimates and preparing them, if he hopes for more co-operation and helpfulness from the Opposition, he will realise that in these financial matters especially, this House, as representing the people, cannot take for granted the position that he sees and that is perhaps quite clear and definite to his mind.  The country cannot see that. The country sees that it is being bled white.  It sees all its poverty and depression. It does not see that it is rounding the corner.  It demands from the Government some special effort that it will exercise more care, and that now when the conditions have changed and when it can expect a genuine will for work that it should work forward in the right direction for the advancement of the country.  I hope the Minister will acquiesce in the request of the Opposition in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to regret again that the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal are not contributing to the debate.  They are leaving it all to us. The tone of the discussion, some of which the Minister for Finance has heard, has been by no means controversial. I certainly am not anxious to introduce into it a note of controversy. I look at the financial position frankly with a very real anxiety.  I look at it from the point of view of the Ministers' successors and their successors.  The position is very serious.  Let us take this perfectly simple fact.  I am not now anxious to use one word of controversy. I recognise that we are all up against the really big problem in this country of how to make our very narrow means stretch to our necessities. Take this fact.  You have the total capital value of this country estimated at three hundred and fifty millions of money.  If you add together your central tax revenue, your local tax <Col N="423" /> revenue, and the five and a quarter millions that we send across the water, they are equal to ten per cent. on that total capital value.  That three hundred and fifty millions includes the whole of the assets which are supposed to be covered by the five and a quarter millions that we export.  The idea that you can carry on this State in a condition in which you first have to take ten per cent. off your total capital value for the functioning of the State, as distinct from the maintenance of the individual people in it, to me is an appalling state of things.  I find it very difficult to see how that can be adjusted.  You can say that you cannot do without this or that.  Well, if you have to raise ten per cent. on your total capital value every year for your housekeeping, before you begin to live in your house, you are in a position which no ordinary man could maintain.  None of us can get ten per cent. on our money with safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this State is running its Governmental institutions, local and otherwise, on the lines that it has to raise for Governmental purposes broadly ten per cent. upon its total capital value, before an individual in the State can clothe and house himself, this country is certainly in a position to cause the greatest anxiety to anyone who looks forward. The Minister for Finance is responsible for a very remarkable statement.  I am not now putting it to him in a controversial sense.  I am putting it to him as something to be examined and justified. He told a meeting that the land of Ireland could support no more people. The Minister for Agriculture has certain very progressive policies of one kind or another.  We have a Creameries Bill, Co-operative Bills, Agricultural Credit Bills and all sorts of Bills.  What is the purpose of all those Bills if the statement made by the Minister for Finance is true that the land can support no more people?  From the Central Fund from which we are now taking money for various purposes in a year we sent to the relief of that industry roughly three millions of money&mdash;to that industry which in the view of the Minister for Finance&mdash;he may have changed that view, and I am now giving <Col N="424" /> him an opportunity of saying so&mdash;cannot support any more people.</P>
    <P>That is the basis upon which we are to continue to provide ten per cent. of our total capital value every year; ten per cent. of the total capital value of this country for the Central Fund, for the local fund and for the export of capital abroad.  The Minister may not be anxious about this, but certainly I think it ought to give him cause for anxiety.  People have curious ideas of looking at national balances.  The tendency, I am afraid, is to look at your balance sheet in terms of money.  You produce money, with goods as an accident. You produce goods, with the maintenance of human beings as an accident in the production of goods.  What I am suggesting is that in this country, at any rate, we ought frankly and fundamentally to alter that and look at the production of goods as an accident compared with the production of a livelihood for the people.  If the land cannot support any more people, what is the good of the land?  If the land policy which is super-added to that cannot enable it to produce any more people what is the justification for that land policy?  The Minister for Finance may, since he made that statement, have found some hope in the policy of his colleagues, but I can see the condition quite easily in which everything which the Minister for Agriculture is asking for is attained, in which he can get such goods, in which he can get more goods, in which he can get higher prices for goods in the market, and yet the land will continue to be in the position of not being able to maintain any more people. Those are the fundamental things which I am offering to the Minister for consideration. I believe the statement made by the Minister for Finance was a very courageous statement, and a statement that, if it were true, it was a statement in the making of which he did a very real service to this country.</P>
    <P>But it is not a statement which one can reconcile with the agricultural policy and the Agricultural Department into which we are pouring all this money from the Central Fund to-day. One finds the same thing in relation to fisheries, and I heard the Minister for Finance speak very sympathetically of the fisheries the other day.  There is no <Col N="425" /> one in Ireland who will say with more real meaning than I do that that is an extremely difficult problem.  It is not so easy a problem to solve.  What is absolutely certain is that the money that has been taken out of the Central Fund in aid of that purpose is not being operative in maintaining more people in Ireland from the wealth of the fisheries.  If the money which is now being used in the Fishery Department was given to a business firm to use in a year in the progress of that business, they could undoubtedly distribute many times as much money to the ordinary fishermen as they do. We have had experience of doing it and we know.  Business is not carried on in its gross.  Business is carried on in its net, and if at any time in the carrying on of the Irish fishery trade we had at our disposal to use in that business the money that was used by the Department the fishing industry would now be on a different footing.</P>
    <P>I do sincerely say that as far as I know, and as far as I have been able to investigate, no money which to-day is being taken out of the Central Fund to be given to the Fishery Department is operative for the provision of a livelihood to maintain many in Ireland in the sea coast fishing.  I am not now saying anything in relation to the inland fisheries.  Probably most of the good work that was done in relation to the inland fisheries was done by the Civic Guards and not by the Fishery Department at all.  Probably the development of the inland fisheries was through the supervision of the Garda.  I cannot speak with any knowledge of that. That money is not being translated into the livelihood of men, and that is the test.  Our balance-sheet every year ought to be just this: How many livelihoods of men on a standard of frugal comfort are we producing out of the resources of this country and how is our Governmental policy in relation to the gathering in and expending of money being operative in increasing or decreasing the capacity of this country to produce livelihoods for men?  You can produce all sorts of money and yet not do it.</P>
    <P>The policy which the Minister for Agriculture stands over, as far as I <Col N="426" /> understand it, is diametrically opposed to the policy of the Minister for Finance at any time I have heard him speak upon the broader subject of national development.  One single customer for the perishable products of one single trade and all sorts of ancillary advantages and controls in the possession of that syndicate.  You can think of any revenue you like, you can build up any possible amount of goods you like, any quality of goods you like, and it has no necessary relation whatever to the production of extra livelihood for a single man in this country. If you were to look at agriculture simply and solely from the point of efficiency and you had to put an engineer, an economist, a business man or a farmer in charge of it, and you simply asked him to produce from the actual acreage in Ireland the amount of agricultural produce which he now produces&mdash;just that&mdash;you would not require the people you have here.  It is upon the inefficiency of our system of agriculture, and not upon the efficiency of our system, that we maintain in this country the agricultural population which we are maintaining. I think the Minister for Finance agrees with me.  That now is an extraordinary statement to make.  You do not need it.  Tear away your roads, pull down your hedges, get rid of your land hunger and work this country purely and simply as a farm efficiently for the production of agricultural produce, and you can produce agricultural produce and more agricultural produce than you are producing to-day, and of a higher quality, with one-third or one-fourth of the population.  Now that is what is happening there.  There is, as far as I can see, the confusion of these two ideas.  The Minister for Agriculture has a perfectly clear idea in the use of money which he is taking out of the Central Fund.  He wants to get more agricultural produce.  He wants to get a better quality of agricultural products, but he is not working to maintain a larger population in this country.  And there is nothing whatever, no necessary connection what ever between the success of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture and the success of the policy for which I believe the Minister for Finance stands <Col N="427" /> I am going to complete now the quotation from the Minister for Finance.  He said that Ireland can support no more people&mdash;I am not speaking now exactly literally, but I am certainly not misrepresenting him.  He said: &ldquo;If any of your young people, if the young people of Ireland are looking for maintenance they must look for it in industry.&rdquo; Now your whole Central Fund expenditure, its whole confusion, its national inefficiency is due to the fact that there are those two perfectly clear and distinct antagonistic lines of thought operating in the Government at the present moment.  Can you justify paying out of these central funds for the purpose of agriculture, for the maintenance of the I.A.O.S., for the development of creameries, funds as you are now doing for an industry which the Minister for Finance said cannot support any more people?  That is the crucial test.  Which of them is right?  Until that fundamental difference of opinion is reconciled there can be no sound government of this country from that Front Bench.</P>
    <P>Take again the question of expenditure. A great deal of the expenditure of this country is going upon the enforcement services.  I take two of the outstanding enforcement services, and I am not using the term in its technical meaning.  I take the Army and the Gárda Síochána.  I am not going to deal with those on conventional lines. The cost of the maintenance of the judicial machinery and of the law in this country is depending simply and solely on the relation of the people to that law.  If the people are sympathetic to that law, if they are enthusiastically anxious to uphold it, if they feel it is their friend and that those who are in charge of it are their friends, we can cut and hack that expenditure on the maintenance of law in this country down to any figure we like.  I am speaking as one who is very anxious to see the necessary cost of the maintenance of law reduced by putting the people behind the law.  Is this amount of money which we are now taking out of the Central Fund greater or less through the atmosphere and the policy of the Front Bench opposite?  If they <Col N="428" /> would feel, if they would try to be more sympathetic, if we did not have the scornful remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we did not have these obvious differences of opinion which we have had in this House on that Front Bench, would the cost of the maintenance of the law in this country, and the amount which we now have to vote out of the Central Fund be what it is? I remember a discussion about prisoners here and I remember a very sympathetic attempt being made by the President to find a way of accommodation. I remember another Minister following him with violent diatribes.  I remember the Minister for Finance actually tying himself into knots in an honest attmpt to find a formula which would relieve that situation and which would relieve that disturbance and the cost which was created by that situation, and we found another Minister immediately afterwards deliberately overthrowing the boat again.  From one side to the other the feeling rose again, and every one of those things&mdash;that atmosphere of mind&mdash;is inevitably reflected in the amount of money which we vote out of the Central Fund to-day for the maintenance of what you call law and order.</P>
      <P>I raised the question here before very sympathetically in relation to one Department of the State as to whether I could get some approximate figures.  I took out the figures that went on enforcement expenditure in the Department of Industry and Commerce and compared them with the amount which went obviously on production.  I put the figure of production as high as ever I could.  I think the House will recollect that the proportion obviously going to production was small compared with that going to enforcement.  Those are the things which matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have high over-head expenses here, and the destroying of high over-head expenses is a ruthless process.  I have seen it many times in life.  People who are living on a standard of expenditure, who are living in a house of a certain kind, using transport and social facilities of a certain kind&mdash;the spectre of shame was lying over those <Col N="429" /> people.  The man who does not know that he can balance his individual budget, who is living to a special standard which he cannot maintain, who is living upon a standard of personal expenditure in relation to other people and which he cannot maintain, has in front of him the spectre of shame.  It is the same also with government.  The remedy in every one of these cases, and the remedy that made the difference between perturbation of mind, anxiety of mind and very grievous pain to those people, was the deliberate crushing down of their overhead expenses. They did try different methods and did deliberately do certain things, although they could live within their means.  I have three cases in my mind now where that process of deliberately getting down to a different standard has meant that they have gone back considerably above the standard from which they broke down and which they could never have maintained unless they had gone back.</P>
    <P>It is exactly the same with this Government. We are travelling first class with third class tickets.  We are a poor country, trying to maintain the simulacra of wealth and luxury.  We are trying to maintain standards of expenditure and personal grandeur and governmental munificence which we cannot afford to do.  We are trying to get 10 per cent. on our money, before we begin to live, for overhead expenditure, for preventable expenditure in many cases.  I do not think this thing can be done in a day.  I am not saying it can, and the Minister's successor will not do it in a day; but we ought to begin to do it. There does not, unfortunately, seem to be the sign.  There is certainly no sign, in the amount we are now voting out of the Central Fund, of an attempt to do it.  I think on the part of all sides in the House there ought to be a deliberate understanding that in those things which it is necessary to do and which are unpopular, in order that we can get back to the standard of living which this country can afford and begin to develop on, all parties in this House ought to be prepared to take their share of the unpopularity.</P>
    <P>We must really face this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> We cannot continue to give out of the existing production of this country for the maintenance of a standard of governmental living and for its amenities&mdash;we cannot afford to give that proportion of production which we are doing, and it is in that spirit, and not in any controversial party spirit, that one who is really deeply anxious, looking forward 50 years at least, and who cannot see a solution on the present lines 50 years hence, asks the Ministry now to begin the work which their successors will have to carry out.</P>
    <P>In exactly the same way as in the retrenchment of expenditure, so, too, in the production of revenue.  I do not intend to deal with that for more than two minutes.  The proposal which is made to-day by Deputy Fahy follows the example of the French Government who faced exactly the same difficulty.  They did it when faced with the franc gone away to 240.  One of their means of doing that was to hand over a certain amount of their re-insurance revenue, and they got that re-insurance revenue specially for the purpose of balancing the Budget.  I am not worried about the re-insurance revenue amounting to £175,000 any more than I am worried about the Mutual Insurance Bill.  They are just necessary links, essential links, preliminary links to a thing which has to be very slowly built.  It does not matter who takes on the job of getting back for Ireland the one and a half millions of money going out of this country for insurance, if the job is going to be successfully done it will have to be done slowly.  We want it begun now, and if the Minister will take that particular little scheme of reinsuring his own local authorities' assets as a basis, he can from that develop to the building up on the top of that mutual society of the central organisation which is absolutely necessary as a centre through which he can co-ordinate existing and future Irish national insurance schemes into one big national scheme, so that he or his successors will eventually get back into the country the money which is now going out.  In the process of tackling that he will have opposition, all the forces will gather from the four corners of the earth to attack the effort.  I have no doubt <Col N="431" /> whatever about it.  If he is going to make a success of it he will need the assistance of every party in the House, and he will need the assistance and cooperation of organised and enlightened public opinion throughout the country. But when he has done that, and begun slowly to build upon the little germ of mutual insurance, and when he has won out there, he will have set the foundation of a scheme not merely for getting back into this country one and a half millions of money, but he will be winning back into the possession of this country control of the five fingers of the grip which is responsible for that system of production which we now have of a single customer enforcing upon this country by ordinary economic and commercial need that standard of living which has meant in the past, and if allowed to continue will mean in the future, a miserable small population living on a standard of comfort as low as the people will endure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Flinn, I do not intend to make remarks that could be called controversial this evening, but I would like to know, before this Bill goes through, whether the system of raids and searching which is going on in Dublin is going to be normal for the future.  I am not asking from any political point of view, but as a citizen interested in the rights of citizenship and all that, whether the raids and entering of houses on the part of the police authorities, the searching of people at Mass, and so on, is going to be continued indefinitely, or whether the Government has any change of programme to announce. Two days ago there was a raid for over two hours on a house in Dawson Street, and four men, rather highly paid, were during that time employed in searching a number of people on the premises as well as everybody else who visited the premises during that time.  I do not think that the two hours' raid, which was a very expensive thing, amounted to one solitary item in the way of results.  I do not think that they learned anything, and I do not think they have new information of any kind as a result of it.  This <Col N="432" /> has been going on week after week for a long time, and it looks as if, instead of easing off, it is being intensified. Last Sunday week a man well known to a number of Deputies on both sides of the House (Maurice Twomey) was observed at Mass by a C.I.D. man.  The C.I.D. man kept his eye on him so that he would not escape him, followed him, arrested and searched him.  A few weeks ago two ladies, one of whom was a hard-working member of a hard-working profession, were accosted by the C.I.D.  They were told to get into a taxi, and they were taken to Pearse Street Station to be searched.  The C.I.D. men admitted that they never had seen one of the ladies before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They apologised, and told her that it was because she was in bad company she was arrested.  The bad company lady is a partner in an important establishment in town; she has never been a member of a political organisation in her life, and she has never been accused of a political offence.  They never found her with any political document, yet before her friend she was described as bad company, and because the other lady was in her company both of them were subject to this scandalous thing, that walking along in broad daylight through Dawson Street they were accosted by C.I.D. men, told to get into a taxi, brought to Pearse Street and searched.  I wonder do Deputies realise that that sort of thing is going on every day in the week?  A doctor, who, to my own knowledge, has not got one hour in the 24 to do mischief of any kind, was arrested quite recently in the streets and brought to Pearse Street to be searched.  I am not asking it from any political point of view, because generally I leave political arguments to other people.  I am asking it from the point of view of a citizen: is this sort of thing going to be normal, and do the Government consider that any good is going to come from such a policy?  I wonder whether Ministers opposite would not admit&mdash;in private, at least&mdash;that that raid on Cumann na mBan was more of a stimulus to activity on the part of that body than if they got a gift of £1,000.  Is it not on raids and all that sort of thing that <Col N="433" /> such bodies thrive?  It will be a rather serious thing, I think, if it goes on&mdash;if the Government has no policy other than to continue this system of arresting all sorts of people on suspicion, taking them to different barracks to be searched, and all that sort of thing.  I do not think it will lead to the stability that everybody so much desires, and I hardly think it will lead to political contentment.  Before the Vote passes, I think we should have some statement upon that from some responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Vote generally, I think, as it is coming so near the time for dissolving, that the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Local Government should make some statement on the question of unemployment. The other evening we had a very unsatisfactory statement from the Minister for Finance on the motion for the adjournment.  He told us to go home, each Deputy, and study.  I am sure he did not say it in any cynical way.  I am sure that he was as sympathetic as anyone else with the unemployment problem, but his only solution was that each Deputy should go home and study what could be done for the unemployed. I submit it shows a great shallowness of thought on the part of the Government if that is all the Minister for Finance can tell us on the subject. If the Minister for Finance looks at the trade returns and realises that the greater portion of the necessities of the people of this country is coming in from abroad.  I think he need only ask himself what would give employment to the people here if we are making contracts outside the country for the supplying of our necessities.  What would give employment if our clothes, boots, furniture, agricultural machinery, building material and a great portion of our food are all produced abroad?  What would give us employment, I wonder, unless we get contracts for supplying other people with goods? I think we should not expect the Belgians, the Germans or the Russians to give us contracts for supplying furniture or building materials to them when our own people are not expected to give us such contracts.  It seems to me that there is a great deal too much mystery made about the problem of unemployment. <Col N="434" /> People talk about it as if it were a thing that could not be solved, that it was a very difficult subject. But until we have advanced a great deal further on the line of supplying our own necessities I do not know that we should talk about the difficulty of it.  It seems very natural to me at all events, that the one way of employing the people of the country is that the requirements of the people generally should be met from within the country.  If we decide that we are not going to supply such requirements from within the country, then we have got to contract with some other countries, either implicitly or explicitly. Otherwise we will be without employment. It cannot be said that the Government has attempted to help the people to achieve that position of supplying their own requirements from within the country.  There has been more cynicism on the question of tariffs than on any other question.  The other evening the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; usually he does not talk nonsense&mdash; made the remark that a tariff is an unnatural thing.  I wonder if there was ever a more shallow remark made on any subject before.  A tariff is an unnatural thing.  This Dáil is an unnatural thing.  The nation is a very unnatural thing.  Practically everything one mentions in the way of civilisation is an unnatural thing, and everyone who apparently believes in nationhood would not deny that he submits to the nation as a fundamental thing.  To talk about a tariff as an unnatural thing seems to me as shallow a thing as could be uttered on the subject. One was further amazed to find Deputy Morrissey pleading for more production.  We are all agreed that more production is a very necessary thing, that it must be done if even the present population is to live in the country.  But the method adopted by most countries to stimulate home production is to exclude foreign goods. Was there ever a party, I wonder, less enthusiastic for the exclusion of foreign goods than the Labour Party?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, I submit that we should all get a lot more determined on that question, and that we should not talk about the exclusion of foreign goods as an unnatural and artificial thing; that we should regard it as a fundamental right of the people; that since no other country is prepared to support our unemployed we should claim the right to help our unemployed, and that we should not be so anxious to talk about the difficulties, about higher prices and so on, as was the case here in the debates on tariffs.  In the Minister for Agriculture's statement it was also revealed that he practically gives up the idea of Ireland producing grain. He says we simply cannot grow wheat for our own requirements.  We all know we cannot grow barley, because barley is coming in in such huge quantities from abroad that there is practically no market for it in the country.  We cannot produce malt.  It is rather a curious thing that in Ireland, studded with malt-houses, we cannot produce malt.  We can produce oats, but at a price which does not pay.  Then the Minister for Agriculture leaves us with this prospect with regard to agriculture. We go in for the production of butter, eggs and beef, and for a rather unstable quantity of bacon, because, apparently, he does not object to bacon coming in here from Poland, Latvia, China, or anywhere else.  He says if we are able to buy that bacon cheaper and sell our own at dearer prices that it is all right.  As Deputy Derrig pointed out, the market for bacon abroad is weak and undependable.  Again I think the Minister for Agriculture's statement on the subject of bacon is hardly sufficient.  I think he should be able to say why it is that we cannot produce bacon as cheaply as the Poles, the Latvians, or such people.  In a country where there is such terrific unemployment, and where men are prepared to work, practically for any wages, it should not be a difficult thing to meet that competition.  It struck me as a very weak point in his argument.  Anyhow his picture does not show any great room for any increase in population. It does not show any great room for absorbing even the present unemployed population.  If his picture of the tendencies he favours in agriculture <Col N="436" /> in Ireland is accepted, I think it shows that the population employed in agriculture will probably continue to decline, because the efficiency, all the best machinery, and all that sort of thing that he favours in such industries as he mentioned, are not going to lead, at all events, to an increase in the number of people employed in agriculture.  The Government, apparently, are quite content to jog along in that way, making such apologies as we recently heard, that nobody should object to our Tariff Commission taking so long over a case, because in America cases have taken much longer time.</P>
      <P>I think in the present circumstances of this country that to make such a comparison with America is merely fooling, and denotes a lack of interest on the part of the Government that is rather lamentable.  Certainly, in the present conditions, I think the Government should explain what is to be done with regard to the huge unemployed population in the towns.  If there is to be no further forcing of industry than the present system allows, if there is to be no such thing as excluding foreign furniture, foreign agricultural machinery, or anything of that kind, it is a very bad outlook for a great number of towns with a surplus population.  I do not mean to say, supposing a greater number of things were excluded, that all the towns would necessarily gain, but, at least, a certain number of towns would gain, and if they were encouraged, something would be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the discussion on the Vote on Account a great deal was said about the roads.  I think we should be told definitely what is going to be the position in October when the two millions grant is expended.  It has been stated by several road engineers that the machinery for road-making is being put aside, as there is no prospect of sufficient money being available for road-making for a long period, and that a great number of road hands are being disbanded.  That is a pretty serious outlook, especially on the eve of winter.  I think it is time there was a definite statement on the whole subject of transport.  What does the Government intend to do after their experience of the two millions grant, with the experience of the working of the Railway Tribunal, also with the <Col N="437" /> fact in front of them that railway receipts are down £55,000 this year, and that road transport is greatly increasing? Are they satisfied that the two systems should be continued?  Have they made up their minds on which side they will throw their weight?  Are they going to continue paying for trunk roads, thereby encouraging road transport, and, at the same time, are they going to continue their support of the railways by maintaining the Railways Tribunal, and asserting control over the railways that the Railways Act gave them?  We should really have some definite statement on the subject, because a great many people are anxious about it.  Thousands and thousands of miles of roads have not been affected by that grant.  If sums for the maintenance of the roads that have been improved by the two millions are not available from the Road Fund, it will look as if we had wasted two millions, and a great many other millions as well. I hardly think that the Government has given the subject the attention that it requires.</P>
    <P>For instance, I cannot reconcile statements from two different Ministers on the subject.  The Minister for Finance in the course of the Budget discussion said:</P>
    <P>We realise that what the Deputy said is quite correct.  The prospects for the Road Fund do not seem to be as good as they would need to be.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government replying on the Local Government Estimate, said:</P>
    <P>We have no reason to think that the finances available for the improvement and maintenance of trunk roads are not going to be there.</P>

      <P>Have they really anything in mind or are they letting it slide in a very happy-go-lucky way?  A great deal was said in the discussion that took place on the Vote on Account about salaries.  Some of the remarks struck me as hardly being <Col N="438" /> serious they were so wrong; that was with regard to the attitude of this Party on the question of salaries. Deputy Davin wanted to know if Deputy de Valera thought £200 a year sufficient salary for an engineer.  I think neither Deputy de Valera nor anyone else could answer that question, because surely the salary must have some relation to the means of the employer. If the farmers of the country are as badly off as they seem to be&mdash; and as I think, and as Deputy Davin thinks they are&mdash;probably £200 is much too high.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Hennessy followed with illuminating remarks on the subject.  He was against small salaries, and against certain economies that the Government practised.  Deputy Hennessy showed great humanity in his remarks, but when there was an opportunity in the division lobby Deputy Hennessy voted for an increase in the sugar tax on every slum child, on every slum invalid, on every old age pensioner, on every unemployed person, and one wondered what sort of inconsistent humanity Deputy Hennessy was made of.  The Deputy was quite sarcastic about the Fianna Fáil Party favouring economies.  He did not favour economy.  In the interests of the poor, he was altogether against economies, but in the interests of the poor also, he voted for the sugar tax, the cinema tax, and various other taxes.  Frankly, before this debate closes, I think we should have a general statement as to Government policy.  We should have a great deal more information as to whether they intend to continue the same course and whether they think that that course is going to lead to anything but intense suffering, continuous emigration, and the other misfortunes that at present afflict the country.</P>

      <P>I want to take advantage of this Bill to try to elicit some further information on the question of housing.  I notice on Tuesday last the <Col N="439" /> Minister for Finance stated that he had very little time to refer to the matter. I know that he did not mean that in any flippant spirit.  But I do think that the House and the country generally are entitled to get some information as to what the intentions of the Government are on this important matter. Since May 15th grants both to local authorities and to private persons have been withdrawn, and I know that some people and some local authorities had schemes ready to start when the news was broadcast through the country.  I know for certain that the Wexford Corporation had a scheme ready.  They had a certain amount of money, and they were basing the cost of their scheme on the amount of money that they thought they would get from the Government by way of grants, but that scheme has now been knocked on the head.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that this is the wrong time to stop giving grants to local authorities, because if houses are going to be built, and built economically, the proper time for building them is during the summer and in the fine weather.  They have promised us a Bill in the autumn.  Nobody knows what that Bill will be like.  Whether it will embody the promise given by the President and the Minister for Finance early in the year that we were going to get long-term loans or not we do not know.  But I think the Minister will agree that if the Bill is kept over until the autumn nobody will be in a position to start any housing programme until next year, as it is most uneconomic, I suggest, to start building houses in the middle of the winter.  You have wet and short days, and things of that kind, which make the cost of building houses dearer than if the houses were built under the ideal conditions that we have during the summer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain amount of money was allocated for local authorities for housing this year&mdash;a sum of £5,000.  I wonder if that is all spent yet.  When we referred to the smallness of that item, during the passage of the Local Government Estimate, we were informed by the Minister for Local Government that, in his opinion, it was entirely adequate, that he saw no anxiety on <Col N="440" /> the part of local authorities to apply for grants.  Our answer was that it was because of the fact that it was impossible to secure long-term loans, and that the grants themselves, with short-term loans, would not solve the housing problem.  If that £5,000, small as it is, is spent, I think it goes to show that there is an anxiety on the part of the local authorities to do the best for the people.  Speaking for one local authority, the Wexford Corporation, we have built forty-two houses within the last two years.  We had another scheme ready, and the fact that the grants are withdrawn has stopped it. I do hope that the Minister will endeavour to do something before the Recess, because this is the time of the year when houses can be built to advantage. Surely the grants could be renewed until such time as the Government are in a position to bring forward the Housing Bill that we are promised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore said that the Labour Party were not anxious for tariffs&mdash;I think that that was the sense of his remarks. I want to assure Deputy Moore that this Party was pledged to tariffs long before the Fianna Fáil Party came into existence, and that we are as anxious as any other body to have the industries of the country protected. We certainly are not out for wholesale tariffs.  We want tariffs to protect existing industries; we want tariffs to protect industries which are staple industries in their own areas, and we are as anxious that the people should support the manufactures of their own country as any other party or individuals are.  I do think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department could do a great deal more in that direction.  I think that some person in that Department should have assigned to him the duty of being a propagandist, if one might call it so, or something of that kind; that something should be done by the Department to draw the attention of the people to articles that are manufactured in the country, because a great many people do not take the trouble to find out whether things are manufactured here or not.  I was glad to notice that during the past twelve months various local authorities opened <Col N="441" /> their eyes to the fact that it is necessary to support our industries in order to enable the country to live, and that they have had exhibitions held.  I have no doubt that that has been doing a certain amount of good, but I consider that it should be one of the foremost functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of his Department to try to educate the people up to the importance of supporting the products of their own country; that if the Minister and his Department would apply themselves to something of that kind the people would realise that it is in their best interests to support the products of their own country.  I know quite well that in many cases it would be useless to suggest to our unemployed that they should buy everything Irish.  That would be an impossibility, because of the fact that a great many among the unemployed have very little money to purchase anything.  But many things are brought in that this country manufactures as well as, and in many cases better than, outside manufacturers, and at the same price, and if we could get the people to think about these things and to realise the importance of supporting them, it would go a long way towards solving the unemployment question.</P>
    <P>On tariffs I agree with some of the remarks which came from the Fianna Fáil Party, and I agree especially with their plea that the Tariff Commission should not wait until a particular industrialist comes forward with an application for a tariff.  Many people running industries in this country are content to live with a small turnover, forgetful altogether of the fact that there are numbers of people living around them who could be engaged in these industries if the manufacturers put their best step forward and endeavoured to have a tariff placed against an article that is competing against them from the other side of the Channel.  I believe that it should be the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to inquire into the various industries to find out what they are capable of, and there are many industries at present in the country that are capable of greater things.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his Department would apply themselves to find out what their capabilities are they would <Col N="442" /> be doing very good work.  We know that there are a great many lackadaisical people amongst the employing and industrial classes who are content to go on living in a rut year after year.  If the country is to be put on its feet in a proper manner the Minister will have to go into those people's places and endeavour to persuade them to get out of that rut and to do something, not alone for themselves, but for the community at large.  After all, I take it that we are all here in the interests of every class in the country, and it is only by means such as I suggest that, in my opinion, we are going to have our towns industrialised and that we are going to do good for the people.  Again I would ask the Minister to request the Executive Council to reconsider their policy in so far as housing is concerned.  As I have said, they have promised us a Bill in the autumn, but I do think that in the interim period the grants ought to be renewed, so that some councils and private persons that I know would be in a position to go ahead with schemes that they have in hands and that they are ready to proceed with.</P>

      <P>Even the newspapers complained the other day of the hasty manner in which financial measures were being passed through the House. That was unsatisfactory from the national point of view.  But the way in which this Bill has been presented to the House is even more unsatisfactory. The Minister for Finance was not even here on its introduction.  We got no satisfactory explanation as to what we should anticipate the result of this Bill would be.  We are put in the position of legislating in the dark.  Section 1 of the Bill deals with the granting of supplies from the Central Fund, and Section 2 empowers the Minister, in whatever way he thinks fit, to raise by borrowing any money which may be required. We have had no explanation as to what he proposes to do, or as to what his necessities are, as he perceives them.  For instance, we do not know exactly how much money is at his disposal at the moment, or what he anticipates he will get in from time to time. We may make our own calculations, but I think we are entitled to know what his calculations and the calculations of his <Col N="443" /> Department are as to the money that is to come in, and as to how far he may have to look for short-term loans from the banks.  Further, we are entitled to know whether he proposes to issue more of the National Loan.  I suppose about half of that Loan has been issued already.  Does he propose to issue more of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are questions in respect of which one would imagine, on a Bill of this kind, in an ordinary business way, we would have been told at least roughly what the anticipations of the Minister were.  But we have got no information at all.  We differ altogether from him in his policy, because we regard credit as a national asset. We have asked that the Government hold an inquiry, so that we should know exactly what is the position of credit in Ireland.  I should imagine that any Minister would say to himself: &ldquo;The first thing I have got to do when I am issuing a loan is to find out what is the total credit in the country&mdash;what is the total amount of money which could be invested, and what is the total amount of goods and services which can be relied upon as a basis for credit.&rdquo;  These are matters which one would imagine the Minister for Finance would inquire into, and, having done so, would be able to calculate, perhaps, how much of that should be attracted into national purposes. That would be a national line on the question of national loan.  It would deliver the Minister for Finance from the hands of the international financiers, who regard money purely as a monopoly and something which they sell at the highest rate which they can get.  Because the national view is not taken, each one of us who has to pay either taxes or rates, and who is earning his own living, is forced to serve the international financiers.  That is because of the link which exists between them and the Minister for Finance. Instead of earning for ourselves in this country, we are forced to earn in order to pay these financiers high rates of interest upon National Loan and upon other loans, because this cuts through every aspect of life.  We saw already that this policy forced the Government to charge six per cent. to the <Col N="444" /> farmers for their money.  They have not, for one reason or another&mdash;probably because they are under the control of the bankers, whom they have to obey&mdash;introduced into the Agricultural Credit Act a clause by which the deposits of the farmers could be used for the purpose of financing agricultural credit.  The present position is that the farmers deposit their money in the banks and get roughly about two per cent. for it.  When they look for money, they have to pay six per cent.  That surely is a rotten situation. It is a situation which the Government should tackle, and, personally, I believe it has more to say to the poverty of this country than any other single issue.  In fact, it would be a miracle if Ireland were prosperous while those conditions are allowed to continue.  At present, what happens is that the banks, getting that money at two per cent., lend it on short-term loans to English banks for financing English interests, so that Irish money is actually being used to finance our rivals&mdash;money which should be lent to the farmers at, at least, a slightly higher rate of interest than the farmers are getting themselves.  For instance, if the money were deposited in an Irish bank at two per cent., the Irish bank should be able to lend back the money at three per cent. or three and a half per cent.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the contrast which exists between the rates which the Government will have to pay for these short-term loans and the rate which they have already given, which is really a gift to the banks.  The rate they have charged for fiduciary note issue is only about one and a half per cent, and they will probably be paying four per cent. or five per cent. for their short-term loans.  The whole situation, from the point of view of common sense, is a chaotic one and one which justifies us in taking up the attitude of opposing this Bill right through. Until the Government begins to take a more national attitude on the question of finance we will have to do that. If the Minister will take up that national point of view, he will not find that his hand will be weakened from this side of the House.  He will find that the more intensely national he becomes <Col N="445" /> in his financial policy the more support he will get from the whole country.  The more support he is bound to get, because he may find the solution of most of our problems in taking up a really national attitude on the question of national finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk in this House lately, and especially on yesterday, on the question of production.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture gave us advice yesterday to produce more and to sell in the best market.  That is really good advice.  We know where the best market can be found generally.  But there is, certainly, a great difficulty in the way of the farmer selling his produce at all times in the best market. The question of production is a simple one to preach.  It is quite easy to tell the farmer to produce more.  The farmer can do it and he is just as sensible as most other business people in the country.  But he has a difficulty in producing more, because he wants to get money when he has produced more.  In other words, he wants to find a market for that produce.  His difficulty would, then, seem to be not the question of producing, but the question of efficient selling.  That, to my mind, is just as important as production.  The general banking policy, I suppose&mdash;I do not know much about banking&mdash;would be to produce more.  I do not know whether they mean to consume less. Certainly, the policy is to produce more.  Lloyd George, after the war, also enunciated that policy.  They did produce, but they could not sell.  The point as to selling depends altogether on the number who are to consume. I take it the world is not consuming less.  I take it that the world will consume as much as ever it did.  Therefore, the point for us is to get at the consumer.  The most economic market for farmers in this country is, undoubtedly, the home market.  In the home market, the farmer has less expense in selling.  He gets paid immediately and he enjoys a great many advantages. Unfortunately, the home market, not having the cash to buy, cannot buy a sufficient quantity from him.  He is compelled, then, to try and sell in other markets products that are, <Col N="446" /> perhaps, not suitable for those markets. At the same time, the amount that he pays for the production of his necessaries, instead of going to this country, goes to foreign countries.  Therefore, the home market is short of that subsidy and, being short of that subsidy, it cannot possibly consume.  That is one reason why I, amongst others on these benches, and I suppose on the Labour benches, advocate a policy of protection.  The country, under that policy, would be in a position to retain certain sums of money for distribution in the home market and that would enable the producer to produce more, because he would have the consumers. To my mind, the question of production is altogether regulated by the question of consumption.  If the farmer finds that he can get a satisfactory price, if he finds he can sell, he will produce.  As I said yesterday, there is no industry in this State so completely disorganised, so completely left to its own, without sufficient education and without organisation, so far as the marketing of its products is concerned, as the agricultural industry.  Even in respect of local fairs, where farmers sell their produce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister responsible, in the first place, would be the Minister for Agriculture, and, in the second place, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Agriculture, I am quite sure, controls our marketing system.  I have had a great number of complaints about the method of holding fairs throughout the country.  You often find two or three fairs in the same locality, <Col N="447" /> all clashing, one fair without any buyers and another fair with all the buyers.  Most people will admit that that state of affairs is undoubtedly against the seller at all times.  The seller in that case is the farmer.  I believe some step should be taken to organise the fairs so that farmers will not take cattle and stock and produce to the fairs and markets and find themselves without buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transport difficulty is one that, I think, everybody will admit the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not paid sufficient attention to, if he has given it any attention at all.  You have not alone the question of railway transport, but you have the question of shipping, which members of the cattle trade have at all times made serious complaints about.  I hope they will continue to make these complaints until some satisfactory results are brought about.  You have the position in the port of Dublin of having to transport stock without any alternative. There is no competition in that port.  The shipowners there seem to be monarchs of all they survey.  They charge what they like and accommodate themselves without giving any accommodation, except, perhaps, an occasional speech, to the men who really count&mdash;the farmers and the producers of the wealth of the country.  The same thing arises out of the statement the Minister for Agriculture made yesterday.  He told us quite seriously that we were in a position to put beef in a better condition and better quality beef on the English market than the Canadians.  That is not so.  We could put better quality beef on the market, but do we put it there in as good condition as they do, or as cheaply as they do?  We do not.  We did not kill out the Canadian cattle trade.  The Canadian cattle trade was killed out purely and simply by the people of the United States consuming more Canadian cattle, because they had closed out the Argentine cattle. There is no use in our congratulating ourselves because we knocked out the Canadian cattle.  They were in a position, through efficiency in transport and in organisation, to knock us out, but in the meantime they got a better <Col N="448" /> market.  If the normal state of affairs returns we will be faced in a short time with more Canadian competition, and I do not think we have taken any particular steps to prevent their placing us in a rather awkward position again.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I am in order in referring to the Land Act.  In the constituency from which I come, there are a number of estates which have not yet been vested.  One estate has been in the hands of tenants for the last eight or nine years and has not yet been vested.  Another question which was referred to by Labour Deputies has to do with grants for labourers' cottages. In the constituency which I represent, there are a great number of people in need of cottages, and there is a cry for money to build them.  I believe that if the money could be found that would be a very deserving and worthy purpose for it.  There is also an agitation there for the purchase of labourers' cottages and there is an agitation for additional land to be given with the labourers cottages.  That is another question. Other countries have solved that question or are in the act of solving it.  I do not believe that an acre is economic to the labourer.  I do not believe it is very much good to him.  Another point about those cottages is that at the present time they cost the ratepayer anything from £4 10s. 0d. to £5 per cottage. He would be well rid of them and the labourer would perhaps be in a better position to carry on if he had the cottage bought out and if he had an additional four acres to make his present little holding economic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage, I suppose it would be very difficult to refer to anything new.  But I believe that when a Government comes before a national Parliament and asks it to vote it £7½ million for national services, the least we might expect from the Executive of that Government would be a definite statement as to where the two main features of Government policy are tending&mdash;where the national policy of the Executive Council is heading for and where the economic policy of the Executive Council is heading for.  We were told here about a month ago by the Minister for External <Col N="449" /> Affairs that we had accepted an invitation from America to attend the Outlawing-of-War Conference.</P>
      <P>We were told that with a flourish of trumpets, and a very important letter was read by the Minister for External Affairs.  That was certainly an advance, if one may say so, in the proper direction.  But when one considers that letter in connection with the report of the Imperial Conference where certain reservations were made by the predominant partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations, called the British Empire, that certain acts of that predominant partner would be carried out, and no conference would be allowed to consider them as an act of war, that is to say, that England would be entitled to land troops in Canada, Australia, or the Irish Free State, and that such action on the part of the predominant partner would not be regarded as an act of war, one would like to know whether our delegates at the Outlawing-of-War Conference are going to go into that Conference accepting these reservations, or whether they will refuse to accept them like Switzerland, France, Italy, or any other nation.  To secure peace among the nations is, we are told, the main object of the Conference, but are we to enter that Conference with exactly the same notions of peace as other nations?  Are we to enter it, like Switzerland, France, and Germany, realising that such action on the part of any other nation would be a definite act of war, or are we to enter it realising that it would not be an act of war? If the latter are to be the conditions, then one might well say that peace on such conditions would be a peace of slavery.  We would like to know what the Executive Council have to say on that matter.  That is an aspect of our national policy about which one is entitled to ask information when we are asked to vote seven and a half millions for national services.  I regard that as a very important matter, and I hope that the Executive Council also regard it in that light.  Next to the preservation of the Gaeltacht, I regard it as the most important matter at present before the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> One is also entitled to ask where the economic policy of the Government is tending?  One is entitled to ask are we to continue a policy which has left us fifty thousand unemployed, a policy that in one county alone with which I am acquainted from £15,000 to £16,000 is being spent on home assistance, that leaves these people to starve practically for the next twelve months?  Is there to be no indication from the Government of a general or immediate relief?  Are we to have no indication as to the position regarding road grants, regarding housing schemes, regarding anything in the nature of relief schemes, or such matters?  Are we to have no indication from the Government as to its agricultural policy beyond what we have at the moment, when the depression in agriculture is being met by an Agricultural Credit Corporation which will lend money at 6 per cent. and, in most cases, will not lend money to people who need it most?  Are we to have no indication as to the facility with which the land that is now going to the production of grass will be brought into the production of food for the people?</P>
    <P>Are we to have no indication as to how soon these ranches are to be broken up?  Are we to have no indication as to what is to be the general line of our agricultural policy beyond what it has been for the past three or four years? I do not wish to labour matters which have been laboured before, but I think we are entitled to ask on these two or three scores what the policy of the Government is.  Has it any intention of going any further than it has indicated already in the matter of preserving what I might describe as the soul of the nation in the Gaeltacht?  Is it going to sit idly by and allow thousands of emigrants to go out of the country yearly and make no definite attempt to stop them?  Is it going to allow our greatest national asset to be drained away?  Is it going to sit idly by twiddling its thumbs and make no real effort to stem that tide of emigration?  These are matters on which we have had no definite indication from the Government.  They are matters on which before we vote away seven and a half millions we ought to have some indication. <Col N="451" /> National policy and economic policy&mdash;if one may say so, there has been no indication as regards either from the Executive Council.  Before we vote this money we should have a definite declaration on these two matters, national policy and economic policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect in connection with this Bill which requires special attention.  That is the failure of the Government to deal in any effective way with the problem in the congested areas.  For a number of years past people in those areas had hopes that efforts would be made to improve things for them.  In the opinion of experts, and also in the opinion of people who live in the congested parts of the West and who have knowledge of the conditions prevailing there, it is an established fact that these conditions cannot prevail much longer. When we realise that a native Government has been in office for some years, that it is supposed to have all the sympathy that a native Government should have with the people and that it has done nothing to tackle that problem, we are bound to admit that it is a matter which now requires the very serious attention of this House before it passes this Bill.  I would like to have some assurance from the authorities that they recognise that the problem is there though they have made no attempt to deal with it.  Let us hear what their future plans are in regard to it.  I have painful experience in connection with the Government attitude on this question. It is not pleasant for me to stress it.  I do not like to be harping on it. But when I see the various cases in regard to which I made application to various Departments and which received no attention, I am forced to stress the matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take those who have suffered in the congested areas&mdash;the evicted tenants, for instance.  In at least three cases that I know of, these people are wandering about the country expecting the fulfilment of promises made in the past, to the effect that evicted tenants would be treated as wounded soldiers of the land war and be reinstated in their own land or in some other holdings.  I <Col N="452" /> know of three persons, the remnants of the disabled forces of the land war, who are still in the country and are anxious to get land.  They made application to the Land Commission; the Land Commission has investigated their cases and was satisfied that they were genuine.  I made application to the Land Commission and interviewed officials, who satisfied themselves that these men were evicted tenants, but, notwithstanding the fact that this same Department had land in the district to distribute, these evicted tenants were turned aside and strangers who came over from England, some of them as recently as 1918, got portions of land. These are statements I make deliberately. They may seem astounding to many Deputies, but nevertheless they are founded on fact, and these facts have been made known to the authorities. In view of these conditions, I am not satisfied that any money should be sanctioned by this House for a Government scheme that fails to do justice to the evicted tenant, that fails to do justice to the congests although aware of their condition, that wantonly flouts all honesty, that flouts all sense of national spirit and even of decency by compelling these men to wander about the country while the Land Commission has land at its disposal for distribution, some of which has been handed over to strangers instead.</P>
    <P>Stress has been laid from time to time on the great work of the Department. I suppose the Department have kept themselves busy and are endeavouring to make things better for the farmers. I heard a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture not very long ago in which he laid great stress on the improvement the Department have brought about in live stock in the country.  There may have been a better breed of cattle produced.  It is quite possible by ordinary means to arrive at a selection by which you can improve the stock of cattle in the country, but I have no hesitation in saying that, while I admit that the Government may have certain good objectives in view, and while ultimately you may obtain the big objective of having pure breeds of cattle in this country, the Act was not applied in the way in which it would have given the best results.  The <Col N="453" /> attempt to improve the live stock was pursued too vigorously and applied too rigidly, with the result that, as the Minister knows, in many parts of the country there have been complaints, and complaints founded on fact, that owing to the drastic limitation of bulls there has been a considerable lot of cows without calves.</P>
    <P>It may be a good thing to have a good breed of cattle in the country, but even a medium breed of cattle is better than none at all.  The ordinary farmer, in his intelligent or, if you like, in his unintelligent, way of looking at it, prefers to have a medium sort of animal rather than have none.  It is the opinion of farmers in the country that the epidemic of abortion, or whatever the disease is amongst cattle, was the result of the limitation of bulls being applied too rigorously.  It is also the opinion of many experienced farmers, who may not be able to go into the matter scientifically, but who, nevertheless, have at the back of them years of experience&mdash; and that counts for a good deal&mdash;that the introduction of these foreign breeds of bulls will not give the best results. They are not acclimatised, and therefore cannot give the best results.  In discussions I have heard, it was suggested that a more practical way of dealing with the situation would be if the Department took up breeds already in the country&mdash;and in the West we have some fairly notorious breeds, such as the Roscommon herds&mdash;and developed them.  They would in that way create a breed of our own, rather than continue importing bulls such as shorthorns.</P>
    <P>In that respect there is in the West another problem.  The Department limit the number of bulls of a particular species coming into a district. Quite logically they aim at improving not alone the breed but also the milking strain.  In some of the poorer districts the farmer depends much more on the production of calves for export than on the commercial value of the milk.  It is easily understood that the species of bull suitable for the production of a store animal is not suitable where the aim is to increase milk production. However, where the aim of the farmer is the production of a store beast he naturally wants a bull of that <Col N="454" /> strain.  The Department are too rigid and they take no account of local conditions. In some districts the value of milk would be considerably less to a farmer than the value of a calf as a store beast.  The Department send in a certain quota of bulls of each type&mdash; a certain proportion of store-producing and milk-producing animals.  The farmer, however, will continue to take his cows to bulls of his own selection with the result that bulls of the store variety would have too many cows and the consequences cannot be good. These points have been urged by various committees of agriculture to the Department with, so far, no beneficial results.  I have found the Department quite generous as far as yielding to demands for increasing the number of bulls in a district is concerned. Of course they are only quite anxious to assist, but they are entirely too rigid as to the quality of the bulls they send.  I am not at all satisfied that they have met the requirements of my part of the country in supplying the people with what they require in the way of particular breeds.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made here of the lands purchased by the Land Commission and not vested.  On a previous occasion I referred to an instance where the Land Commission had purchased under the Act of 1903.  The estate was purchased so far back as 1908 or 1909 and interest has been paid in lieu of annuities ever since, but the estate has not been vested.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear some statement made by the Minister responsible that he recognises that there is a serious problem in the congested portions of the West, that he intends to deal with it, and deal with it in some way that would meet requirements. <Col N="455" /> We are asked to vote here a sum of over seven million pounds for various services.  We realise that the State services that are essential must be maintained.  But we do realise also that the services that are essential can only be maintained to the extent that the country can afford Any person who speaks differently from what I said as to the conditions of the farmers and their inability to meet this expenditure tells an untruth.  There is no use in speaking of an upward curve.  It is very encouraging to speak in that way, and, sitting in this House here, one may be inclined to talk in that way.  But when one spends a week-end down in the country, and discusses the position there with the farmers and shopkeepers, one must realise that there is a very different angle, and one hears little there about the upward curve. These people have been asked to continue a rate of taxation which is mainly responsible for their undoing.  It is entirely wrong for this House to vote Estimates or give power to this Government to deal with Estimates so large as these, without discussing them and endeavouring to reduce them and reduce them bearing in mind that the taxation drawn out of this country is more than can be afforded.</P>
      <P>There is an item here for the Gárda Síochána.  We claim that that is unnecessary, even though it is an essential service.  We claim that under normal conditions it is excessive, but under present conditions it is impossible.  If it were merely a case of paying salaries to the Civic Guards, it would still be a grievance, and a big grievance, but when one comes to know, as I do, that at least in one instance a sergeant of the Civic Guards is in receipt also of an Army pension awarded him within the last month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the money was for the purpose of developing any form of industry in the country, if it were mainly for the improvement of the farmers' conditions; if, for instance, it was for the purposes of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, for which the farmers had been so long looking forward and out of which they expected some benefit; if portion of these moneys to be granted from the State was used for the purpose of reducing the rate of interest at which money could be borrowed by the farmers, there would be something to be said for it.  The farmers have been told that all loans made by this Agricultural Credit Corporation must be treated on business lines, and that they must pay at least six per cent. for the money.  That is a rate of interest that the farmers cannot and never will be able to pay under present conditions.  No doubt the farmers will borrow money at that rate, because they must have money or clear out.  But the State must make up its mind that unless conditions improve the money lent at six per cent. will eventually have to be borne on the Central Fund Account, because the farmers cannot pay it.  If portion of this expenditure that is spent in a non-productive capacity were directed towards reducing the rate of interest on the money borrowed by the farmers from six per cent. to four per cent., that taxation would be tolerable, because it would ultimately benefit the people in some way.  Again, if portion of this money were spent in the planting of the waste lands around the Western coast and other parts of the country; if it were spent on drainage schemes that would give employment in addition to having beneficial effects on the various localities and be a special benefit to the farming industry, the taxpayers would the better bear it, because ultimately it would benefit the entire community, and it would be a medium of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, if any portion of this taxation were levied for the purpose of developing any of our industries, it would be a different matter.  Down in Leitrim we have the coal-mining industry.  The <Col N="457" /> industry there is seriously in need of some aid from the Government for the purpose, say, of giving railway facilities to transport the coal to various markets.  If any provision had been made for dealing with the development of that area or for development on lines of that sort, this House would be quite justified in passing the Estimates to meet the taxation.  But, judging from the results that I have seen from the various Departments under the headings of which these Estimates are asked for, there can be no such hope.  We have their total and utter neglect of the conditions there.  There is the failure of the Land Commission to deal with the evicted tenants on the western coasts or to deal with the matter of the congests in the West.  Judging from the failure to a large extent of the Department of Agriculture to bring about any improvement in the conditions in my part of the country, I am satisfied that we are not justified in accepting the Estimate put down under this head.  This money will have to be raised from the people, and the people are not able to afford the amount asked from them.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the item for the Gárda Síochána, again I say that is excessive. The amount down for the Army is excessive, and the same can be said of the various other headings. I am not at all sure that any honest effort has been made to make this Credit Corporation a help to the farmer.  Even if improved by the amendments that have been brought in in the last week, I do not think it is seriously intended to meet the situation as it exists.  I am satisfied that unless some form of credit can be devised that will give easy facilities to the farmers to borrow money at a reasonable rate of interest, the whole fabric of farming has come to the pass that it can no longer go on.  I am satisfied that an honest effort on the part of the Government in an attempt to provide those credit facilities that are so necessary for the farmers has not been made.  Most of the farmers in the country and the small investors have money to spare.  They have this money on deposit in the joint stock banks.  They have a considerable lot of money there at 2½ per cent. interest. If the Government were anxious to <Col N="458" /> borrow money at that rate of interest. I think they ought to give to these small investors the security that they are giving to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and to a large co-operative effort.  The farmers could be organised in a large way and have a State guarantee given to them for this money. These small investors would lend that money at 2½ per cent., and if it were made available for the farmers at that rate it would be really beneficial to the community.  I fail to understand why the Government will content itself with dealing second-hand in a matter of this kind.  I fail to understand why they cannot borrow the money, in the first instance, themselves and give that benefit to the farming community.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies on the opposite benches, some of them coming from my part of the country, and elected by practically the same people that I have been elected by, and they know as well as I do what are the conditions down there in Leitrim and Sligo.  They know that the farmers there do need assistance of a very drastic and immediate kind, and I wonder very much why the voice of these Deputies has not been raised on this matter.  These and other Deputies on their benches should insist, as far as they can, that the Government would make an honest effort to reduce these Estimates and reduce them very considerably.  It is no use to say that they are essential services.  No matter how essential they are, the country cannot afford to raise that money in the present state of depression.  In the second place, having brought about a reduction in the Estimates, there should be some honest attempt made in the matter of credit facilities in the congested areas in the West of Ireland, and in Leitrim particularly.  In that way they would improve generally the condition of the people they represent here.  I say that with that knowledge in their minds these Deputies are failing in their duty if they pass these Estimates without pointing out to the Government the duties they owe to their constituents.</P>

      <P>The silence of the Front Government Benches and, in fact, of the entire Government Party in this debate has been most eloquent. Deputy after Deputy has asked them to <Col N="459" /> give us a general indication of their policy in relation to national and economic matters, and they have been silent.  Deputy after Deputy has asked them if they have any policy on national or economic matters, and they have been silent.  Deputies have asserted that they have, in fact, no policy, and theirs, shall I say, was the silence of consent.  This is a Bill to authorise the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund and apply towards making good the supply granted for the services of the year the sum of £7,438,635.  Seven and a half million pounds, one-third of the total amount required to run the services of this State!  The only argument advanced for the Bill by its sponsors is complete silence.  No doubt the less said about it the better.  The silence on the Government Benches may be a device to conceal their lack of policy; it may be the product of a very great wisdom.  So long as they remain silent as to their policy no one will be able to criticise it.  So long as they remain silent they are not liable to be misrepresented.  Having by this clever stratagem, carefully avoided the possibility of misrepresentation, they use the other opportunities which are afforded them to misrepresent those who are not as silent as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like particularly to refer to the matter of misrepresentation, because the remarks which I made concerning the financial resolution which preceded this Bill were misrepresented. The few Deputies who were here while I was making those remarks will remember that I was endeavouring to show that the cost of government in this State had become more than double the cost of the government of all Ireland prior to the Great War, and more than double, not in relation to money values, but in relation to the prevailing prices of agricultural produce, so that, not merely had they become more than double in terms of cash, but they had also become more than double in terms of real prices.  It has been alleged that I was endeavouring, consciously or unconsciously, to make an argument in favour of the restoration of the British Government in this country.  I was not.  I was making an argument, to the best of my ability, <Col N="460" /> in favour of the termination of British authority in this country, because I think it can be easily shown that the huge cost of government which the Irish people have to bear is very largely a direct consequence of the fact that we have not succeeded in terminating British government here.</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussion upon that Resolution I, for example, asked the Minister for Justice, who was absent then, but who is present now, what proportion of the seven and a half millions it was proposed to expend in prosecuting the campaign which he is directing against certain individuals with Republican sympathies. I asked him if he could give us some estimate of the money which was spent in carrying out the sixteen raids and arrests upon Mr. Peadar O'Donnell during the last month, and, if it is intended to arrest Mr. O'Donnell sixteen times again during this month, exactly how much is he going to cost the Irish people.  And if we are going to spend money carrying out activities of that kind, we would like to know exactly what we are getting in return. They may drive Mr. O'Donnell into a state of ill-health.  He is, in fact, I believe, in very bad health in consequence of the treatment he has been receiving.  We may even drive him far enough as to upset his mental balance and make him useless as a citizen; but is that the only advantage we are going to get in return for all the expenditure which these raids must have cost us?</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore made reference to other raids, and to the growing practice of stopping people in the streets, ordering them into taxi-cabs, and taking them to be searched in Pearse Street Barracks, which is going on every day in Dublin, but of which no hint appears in the press.  How much has that cost us for the first quarter of this year, what proportion of the money is going to be expended in that way, and why should it be expended? Will he deal with the general matter of the policy of his Department and tell us if it is the policy of the Department by this pin-pricking method to revive bitterness and ill-feeling in this country?  Is he deliberately attempting to awaken in the hearts of a certain element amongst our people <Col N="461" /> the desire to hit back wildly in order to avenge themselves for the torments to which they are being subjected? If not, what is the policy?  Have they no more policy in respect to these matters than they have in respect to other matters?  Are they, as I said during the discussion upon the Financial Resoultions, merely like children playing blind man's buff, stumbling along with their hands out waiting to bump into something in order to grasp it? Certainly, that does appear to be their policy&mdash;aimless, nothing consecutive about it, nothing indicative of previous planning, mere dealing with events as they turn up, a day-to-day policy, a policy of expendiency and the policy of the bankrupt shopkeeper anxious to stave off the evil day.</P>
    <P>It is because we feel there is no policy, in fact, behind the Government, that they do not know exactly where they are going or where they are dragging the nation, that we are anxious to force them into a statement in this House, so that they will be compelled to think out a policy that will be at least presentable.  The Minister for Finance appears to think that we may have some more insidious design in endeavouring to force a statement from him, but in fact we have not.  If he has a policy let us hear it and let us criticise it.  We may be able to improve it; I have no doubt we will.  But if he has no policy, let him say so.  Nature abhors a vacuum and there being no policy there, it will be up to the Irish people to put one there and even, if it is necessary, to put a different set of individuals there to manipulate it.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Bill asking Deputies as representatives of the people to vote seven and a half millions which will have to be squeezed out of these people. Deputies know the conditions that prevail in their constituencies.  They know that industry is languishing, that the general standard of living is declining, that there is poverty and unemployment widespread throughout the country, and before they give a vote for a Bill to expend out of the Treasury of an impoverished people the sum of seven and a half million, they should at least demand from the Executive that will have the spending of that money some indications as to the lines upon which they are going to work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> In the course of a week or so we will be adjourning for probably a long period. During that time the Executive will be free to act without the possibility of criticism here.  They will be free to expend that money in some cases on services which have not yet been approved of by this Dáil.  It was a custom, when dealing with Votes on Account, that new services would not be proceeded with until the amount of the Estimate for the Department concerned had been passed, but as the Minister for Finance indicated, it is possible that that rule will have to be departed from on this occasion, and, therefore, it will be possible that services of which this Dáil has not yet approved, or which it has not debated, will be put into operation with the money we are now voting.  It is well that the Government should give us an indication as to exactly how they hope to direct the activities of the State in the interests of the State during the period covered by this Vote on Account.  Even if they cannot see beyond the end of that period they must have planned out, however vaguely, some line of action to be followed during the next few months. We would be glad if they told us what it is.  I do not think it is sufficient that one Minister should reply.  The Minister for Finance may make a statement in conclusion, but we have received indications that the Minister for Finance, in many matters, sees differently from his colleagues.  When they meet at an Executive meeting, no doubt they are able to strike a compromise and effect Party decisions that all will adhere to.</P>

      <P>But individuals expressing that policy are bound to colour it with their individual views.  Therefore, in order to get a clear indication of what the Government's policy is, as a whole, it will be necessary that individual Ministers will expound that policy as they understand it, and particularly in relation to their own Departments. <Col N="463" /> We have had discussed here to-day already in a rather unsatisfactory manner one very important question, that of the facilities which the Government are prepared to give to promote industry in this country.  We had to discuss it in relation to a particular amending Bill which narrowed the scope of the discussion, but if the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who very adroitly evaded any attempt to nail him down on a specific statement in that discussion was anxious to tell the House what his policy in relation to Irish industry is, he could avail of the opportunity given him by the discussion upon this Bill.  We would like to know how exactly do the Government see the industrial future of this country, or do they, in fact, see it with any industrial future.  Have they attempted to visualise the Ireland they would like to see in existence, and having visualised it, have they planned out steps by which they are going to make their ideal a fact?  It does not appear to be the case.  We have had general statements made, some of which were already quoted in this debate, which would indicate rather the contrary. It is quite obvious if the evils which afflict our people are to be ended, if the decline in our population is to be arrested, and if emigration and unemployment are to be ended, it can only be done by the development of our industrial arm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before in a previous debate that it is my opinion that our agricultural industry is over-staffed and not capable of employing a very large number of additional workers. The Minister for Finance made a somewhat similar statement which would appear to indicate that that was his future policy.  When I talk of agriculture I mean agriculture as an industry.  Undoubtedly there is a very big future for the industries associated with agriculture.  They can be developed to an extent far beyond what they are at present.  You have the dairy industry, the bacon-curing industry, and similar industries.  It is on the industrial side that we must look for the remedy for the evils that afflict our people.  In the development of industry we must remember we have to find employment for those <Col N="464" /> now without it and provide an avenue which will enable us to keep at home 30 or 35 thousand adult people who are forced every year to go to America, Canada or Australia to earn their livelihood.  They are unable to get it in their own country.  How can we develop our industrial arm?  We have had a discussion here already to-day in connection with the provision of credit facilities.  It is obvious to anybody who studies the question that it is necessary in the first place that we should provide the infant industries in this State with an adequate measure of protection against the opposition of their much more highly capitalised foreign competitors.  It is useless to hope that industries will spring into existence in this country fully armed and equipped to meet that competition unaided.  In that respect the policy of the Government appears to be worse than useless.  I say that deliberately.  If their policy were useless it would be one thing, but when it becomes worse than useless it is much more serious, because they are keeping up a pretence of doing something while in fact they are doing nothing.  They set up a Tariff Commission to give the impression that they were willing to facilitate industries in getting tariffs if they were able to make out a case for them, whereas in fact that Tariff Commission has become typical, perhaps, of Government services, a monument of festina lente.</P>
    <P>We have had a report recently from that Commission with regard to the application for a tariff on flour.  I asked yesterday in the debate on the Financial Resolution if we could be told how many flour mills in this State have closed down and ceased business since that report was published.  I know of one.  It is possible that there may be more.  Can we be informed what exactly is the price we have paid in order to find what the Tariff Commissioners believe would result from the operation of an increase of a farthing in the price of bread?  What price have we paid?  How many men have been unemployed as a consequence of that report?  What volume of Irish capital has been wasted?  Have we avoided the probable increase of a farthing in the price of bread?  We had a discussion <Col N="465" /> here only last week on the subject of profiteering in bread.  Reference was made to the report of the Food Prices Tribunal which said that in every town of the Free State visited, with the exception of Limerick, they found that the level of bread prices was in excess of what it should be with regard to the price of flour; that in fact profiteering in bread was taking place.  If we have an Executive prepared to allow an old-established Irish industry to go to the wall, to avoid a rise of one farthing in the loaf, we maintain that it is up to the Executive to take drastic action to prevent profiteering in bread to the extent, in some cases, of much more than a farthing in the loaf.  If they were in earnest in their protestations concerning the probable increase of a farthing in the loaf they can prove their earnestness by taking effective action against those who are profiteering to-day.  They can do more than that; they can, if they know how, take steps that will prevent an inevitable increase in the price of bread following on the disappearance of the Irish flour milling industry.</P>
    <P>You will remember that was our contention, that the price of flour is at a particular level in Ireland to-day because there is a price-cutting war in progress between the English millers, a war between different groups of millers, each endeavouring to undercut the other in order to capture the other's trade.  When the Irish flour-milling industry is gone, and when that war in England is over, the victorious group will emerge and proceed to reap the fruits of their victory.  The price of bread will increase much more than a farthing as a result of the turning down of the application for a tariff on flour. That is only one industry.  We must remember that for months past there have been hanging around the offices of the Tariff Commission representatives of many other important Irish industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only dealing with the development of the industrial resources of the country.  I do not intend to deal with it any longer except to mention that representatives of these <Col N="466" /> other industries have been endeavouring to get the Tariff Commission even to make a beginning in the hearing of evidence concerning their applications. It is probable that shame will force them into making a beginning in the near future.  We would like to know what exactly the delay has cost us. Have any coach-building establishments closed down in the recent past, or are they likely to close down in the near future, in consequence of the delay? Have any woollen mills closed down, and how many are likely to close down in the near future, in consequence of the delay?  How many men have been unemployed or are likely to be unemployed as a consequence of the delay? It may be a good policy to hasten slowly or look before you leap, but we should know what we are paying for that policy, how much it is costing the Irish people in hard cash.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal generally with the main question of protection.  I take it the big majority of the Deputies in this House have accepted the protectionist as against the free trade policy. It is merely a question as to the effectiveness of the manner in which the policy is going to be put into operation. But merely to say that we are frankly a protectionist party, as members of the Cumann na nGaedheal have said, and then do nothing, is, I maintain, hoodwinking the Irish people.  We discussed early in the afternoon the matter of credit facilities.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he considered that the policy of the Government as represented by the Trade Loans Guarantee Act was adequate to deal with the existing situation.  He evaded answering.  I asked him did he think that it would be necessary to supplement the Trade Loans Guarantee Act with any other provisions.  He avoided answering very cleverly.  He is probably an adept at getting out of tight corners.  Perhaps I should not take from the President an honour of which I think he is very proud, of being the most astute Deputy in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>We are learning.  The fact remains that we have an Act in existence which has been admittedly a <Col N="467" /> failure in so far as the giving of adequate results is concerned.  When I say it is a failure, I do not want to imply that it has not done some good. It has, and because it has done some good we are voting for the continuing Act.  But in so far as it has not produced any considerable industrial revival in this country or decreased by any considerable extent the volume of unemployment, the Act has been a failure.  It has not realised all that we were told to expect from it when it was first introduced in 1924.  For some time after, whenever the Act was mentioned, Deputies were told to await the results of the Banking Commission. The Banking Commission was going to show a way out of the difficulty.  It was going to place its finger upon the root cause of the existing economic evil.  It did not.  The Banking Commission, in that respect, as I said, proved a damp squib.  It did not help the Government in any way, and then we have this admittedly inadequate Act continued without any indication from the Government as to whether or not they intend to take additional steps to put Irish industries on their feet.  The Minister, of course, said: &ldquo;If you have a scheme, let us hear it.&rdquo;  He knows as well as every Deputy in the House that a Party like ours has not got the resources or the information which would enable it to put forward a definite, concrete and complete scheme.  We have ideas; we mentioned them.  We believe that these ideas would be worth working out to their conclusion, to see exactly where they lead to.  If the Government are prepared to adopt the suggestion which we made some time ago, and establish an Economic Commission with an economic general staff, a body that will take these ideas and work them out, as I suggested, to their conclusion, we will co-operate in every way possible, but when the Government take up a merely negative attitude and say if you have ideas produce them, and imply by that that they themselves have none, then we must face up to what the consequences are going to be. We must remember that they are the Executive officers of this Dáil.  If we had a scheme we could not put it into operation.  It is the Executive that <Col N="468" /> must put all such schemes into effect. If they think it is a bad one, it is useless suggesting a scheme from these benches because the effectiveness with which the scheme is to be put into operation will be in proportion to the belief which the Executive have in it.  It is up to them, we say, to think out this thing themselves.  They know the situation; they have their Statistics Branch there to give them all the information concerning it, and if with that information, and knowing the difficulties, they cannot find the solution, then we maintain it is up to them, in common decency, to bow themselves out and let someone else take charge who will at least make an attempt to find a solution.</P>
      <P>One of the big difficulties in connection with revival of industry in this State is that the owners of capital in this State are very reluctant to risk that capital in Irish Industry.  They prefer to go and invest their money in oil wells in America, rich mines in China, diamond mines in South Africa, anywhere across the broad world except in Ireland.  £230,000,000 of Irish capital are invested abroad.  We are getting interest upon that capital undoubtedly, and it takes a big slice off the net adverse trade balance, but that capital could be much more effectively used in Ireland in giving work to Irishmen. We maintain that it would be possible to devise a scheme such as we suggested in the debate upon the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, a scheme of a State-guaranteed or a State-controlled national investment trust which would provide for the owners of that capital the security which they fear they cannot get if they place it directly into Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Or even if the Government considered the suggestion made by Deputy MacEntee to-day, that instead of guaranteeing loans, to be secured through the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, they were to guarantee shares issued by the company seeking loans, giving to the people who would be anxious to invest in these concerns the measure of security of guaranteed dividends which they cannot get now, that would be a step along the right lines. <Col N="469" /> In any case we maintain that it is up to the Government, knowing the facts as they do, and with all the machinery of the State at their disposal, to provide some avenue by which our available resources and capital could be directed to oil the machinery of industry.  Unfortunately, however, it does not appear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other Minister, is anxious to reveal the Government's mind in that connection if, as I said, they have, in fact, thought about the matter at all.  The several attempts made here in the course of today's discussion to nail them down to particular points all failed, and future attempts will, no doubt, fail too.  The Minister knows, and I think he has admitted that the present Government policy is not adequate to deal with the situation and, knowing that, it is up to him to supplement it by some other method.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House too long, but I would impress upon the Government the advisability of taking, not merely this Dáil, but the people of this State, into their confidence.  While they maintain this mysterious attitude of theirs&mdash;&ldquo;Leave it to us.  We know more than you, but we cannot tell you about it.  Leave it to us and all will be well&rdquo;&mdash;they are not going to get from the people that co-operation which alone can make their efforts successful. If they would even take this Dáil into their confidence, tell this Dáil what their difficulties are, tell us where and in what way they failed to devise a solution of these difficulties, then I am certain that every Party in this House would willingly co-operate in finding a solution, and in helping the Government to meet the situation.  If they would take the people into their confidence, tell the people exactly what their difficulties are, they would find that they would get in response that degree of co-operation from the people that they are not getting now.  But while they maintain their present half-contemptuous and half indifferent attitude they will not get that co-operation either from this Dáil&mdash;because it would be against human nature&mdash;or from the people.  When they say: &ldquo;We have a policy but&mdash;hush!&mdash; we cannot tell you about it,&rdquo; when they say <Col N="470" /> that Deputies on this side of the House as they have often said, are only babes in this matter, and that they cannot waste their time instructing them, they are going to continue drifting until they hit the rocks and go down.</P>
    <P>I pointed out the other day that the report issued by the Statistics Branch concerning the figures of the recent census showed that in many counties the decline in the last inter-censal period was actually much higher than the decline that took place between 1850 and 1860, the worst decade in our history.  In many of the counties, particularly on the Western seaboard, our people are going faster than they went immediately following the famine of 1848.  That is an indication that something is wrong.  I ask the Government to take the bandage from their eyes, to see the danger signal there, and, realising the danger, endeavour to secure that the whole people as a unit will face the danger.  If they get the united action of the people I have no doubt whatever that every difficulty can be and, we hope, will be successfully overcome.</P>

      <P>I do not know where they are going to wind up, but we see where they are definitely leading us to, and when we come to consider those stepping-stones that they have laid before the Dáil during the last few months we can definitely see the line of action that these gentlemen are taking. When we see that those stepping-stones have now installed here definitely as portion of the Oireachtas a Unionist majority, have handed over the reins of power definitely to that majority, to the old gang, that ascendancy gang who <Col N="471" /> were in power here and who cost a hundred years of trouble and toil to get rid of, we see where the stepping-stones have wound up.  That is, apparently, the national policy of the Government. That is the end of the famous policy that was started with the threat of &ldquo;immediate and terrible war.&rdquo;  You can follow that policy and the Government's economic policy, and you can see the same line of action, the line of action of the weak sister, the line of action of the poor crippled countryman who can do nothing but howl every time he gets a crack.  That is the national and the economic policy of the Government.  When I heard Deputy Lemass allude to the increase in the price of bread of a farthing on the 4lb. loaf as the danger that the Executive Council were trying to avoid, another thought occurred to me as to what they were trying to avoid, and I remember that this famous Tariff Commission went over and spent at least as much of their time, if not more, in England, carrying out investigations there than they did in investigating the flour mills in this country, during the time that they were supposed to be carrying out investigations for the purpose of bringing out their report.  I suppose when they landed over there they were again met with the strong argument, and they were told: &ldquo;We are importing into that little island of yours over £2,000,000 worth of flour every year. Be careful how you interfere with our trade.&rdquo;  Then they came back and said: &ldquo;We will not have a tariff.&rdquo;  No wonder I feel this matter rather keenly, when I remember that a sum of £28,000 a year was paid in my constituency alone in wages by three flour mills which will now be closed down owing to this weak-sister policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flinn expressed wonder at the difference between the policy of the Minister for Finance and that of the Minister for Agriculture.  The policy of the Minister for Agriculture is very clear to me.  The Minister for Agriculture has got a great idea into his head, that a farm of forty acres can support a man, his wife and a grown up family of from sixteen years upwards.  They can all work away on that farm for a <Col N="472" /> while until they get enough to carry them to America.  In addition to that the Minister's idea is that that farm should support about seven inspectors. That, I think, is the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, that that man, his wife and family are to slave from five in the morning until ten at night in order to support a gang of inspectors, senior agricultural inspectors, junior agricultural inspectors, poultry officers, creamery officers, and all the rest of the officers who cost £113,000 a year.  That is the agricultural policy of the Government, and the only hope that they can hold out to what they state is the sole industry in the country is money at 6 per cent.  They say: &ldquo;We will give cash at 6 per cent., that is, to one out of every nine of you.  The rest of you can go to the wall.&rdquo;  That is all the hope that we can get from the present Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass alluded a while ago to the policy of the Minister for Justice.  He wondered what way the Minister was going to spend his share of the £7,000,000.  Down in my country there is a chap named Con Healy on the run for the last two years, and seven C.I.D. men are permanently employed hunting him.  They have not caught him yet.  I wonder how much it costs to keep these seven C.I.D. men in permanent pursuit of one individual.  I am sure that it costs more than would keep that individual in comfort, for a few years at any rate.</P>
    <P>But when I turn to another portion of the Minister's Department, public works, I see that the Department of Justice intends winding up when it finishes depopulating the country by spending £4,000 at a little place called Cahirciveen on a Civic Guard barrack. Perhaps that is going to be the last refuge of the Minister for Fisheries when he is driven from his stronghold into the wilds.  He is going to retire into the Civic Guard station on which already £100 has been expended.  The vote this year is for £1,000 and it is the intention to spend another £2,500.  I wonder is it machine guns they are putting in or an 18 pounder to keep foreign trawlers outside the three-mile limit, or, are they afraid Con Healy will come down and wipe them out when he is tired of being hunted <Col N="473" /> around Cork?  It is no wonder we have decided to oppose the granting of £7,000,000 to the Government when we see the manner in which the money is to be spent.  Fancy spending £4,000 on a Civic Guard barrack at Cahirciveen. I cannot get over that when I remember that the farmers, their wives and families will have to provide the £4,000.  The ordinary cottage built on one of the estates that are being divided costs on an average £250.  While £250 is paid for a house for the taxpayer and his family we are to spend £4,000 for a barrack for the Civic Guards.  An Economy Committee was set up under the economist party in the House which joined the ranks of Cumann na nGaedheal last year.  We have not yet seen any report from the Economy Committee. No doubt they are quite satisfied, as all the members of the Committee have, I think, only £1,000 yearly. That satisfies them.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about the division of land, and I heard a statement made here by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries that, to his mind, it was not just to take over an estate in Co. Tipperary, because, presumably, it was wanted by a District Justice.  Apparently that is a good reason why the congests should remain where they are, and why the evicted tenants should still be kept out of their holdings.  I notice another question here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is apparently the definite policy of the Government, and I had to give a few details to illustrate their policy fully.  I like to give illustrations whenever I can, and I think the few I have given absolutely justify our attack on their policy.  The Government has no national policy.  The only policy which the Government has is definitely to instal as the controlling power the Freemason lodges.  That is the present policy of the Government <Col N="474" /> to denationalise the country, and their economy policy is driving 30,000 young men and women out of this country every year, while they spend twenty-six millions yearly to govern the remainder.  The sooner that Government is got rid of the sooner we will have an opportunity of living in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things that I wish to refer to.  The Minister for Finance made very light of the fact that the revenue for the first quarter of the year was one million pounds below the expenditure, and that the receipts were very much less than one would expect, bearing in mind the devices by which the Minister hoped to increase revenue this year.  It will be remembered that in his Budget speech the Minister stated that he would have to find, by various devices, £1,149,000 extra in taxation.  When the resolution for the granting of the money was being discussed in Committee, I pointed out that, although the Minister hoped to get in the year extra sums amounting to £1,100,000 in all, namely, £300,000 by a curtailment of brewer's credit, £150,000 by the collection of Schedule A. income tax, in one instalment, £250,000 by the collection of income tax arrears, £200,000 by an extension of the McKenna Duties, and £200,000 by the increased sugar duty, instead of having an increase in the first quarter a substantial reduction is shown in all the principal items. For example, I pointed out that although the Minister expected £13,889,000 from Customs and Excise, he realised in this quarter only £3,201,000, or £347,000 less than in the same quarter of last year, and that, although he expected £4,200,000 from income tax, property tax and super-tax in the quarter, he only got £687,000, which is £282,000 less than in the same quarter in the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although he expected £250,000 from the Corporation Profits Tax, he only got £25,000 in the quarter.  Having pointed all this out, the Minister for Finance said that we may expect these variations.  &ldquo;I am a long time dealing with these matters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have been watching from month to month and from week to week these Exchequer returns and they do not <Col N="475" /> affect me in any particular way.&rdquo; Since that statement was made, I thought it would be worth while to have made out the figures for the corresponding quarters in other years.  What do we find?  We find, not going back farther than 1925-26, that in the first quarter of that year&mdash;I will not give you the detailed figures so that I may save time&mdash;he got 25.4 per cent. of the total revenue.  In the same quarter of 1926-27 he got 23.7 per cent. of the total revenue; in 1927-28, 25.5 per cent.; and this year he gets 21.7 per cent.  I hold that, unless the Minister can point to some exceptional circumstances, it is fair to compare the first quarter of this year with the corresponding quarters of other years.  If we take this indication, as I think we ought, the Minister's Budget will, certainly, not be balanced this year.  He will not get nearly that revenue which is required to meet what he has himself segregated as normal expenditure.  I might point out also that the balance in the Exchequer was only £1,349,006. That is all that is left, although a loan was raised last year which brought in £6,292,000 and although there were Saving Certificates issued during the first quarter of the year amounting to over a quarter of a million.  If borrowing is to continue at that rate, I, for one, cannot see how we are going to maintain the services we have got.</P>
    <P>Everybody realises that what is happening at the present time is that the producing part of our population is being driven out by emigration.  What would naturally be the producing part of the population&mdash;the young people and the able-bodied people&mdash;are being driven out by emigration, and we have to carry on the service of education to deal with the young people and the service of old age pensions for the older population, and we are, at the same time, diminishing more and more the proportion between the productive part of the population and that part of the population for whom we have to provide social services largely.  We are spending on education, say, 4½ million per year and we must remember that we are doing that largely for the benefit of foreign countries.  We are saving the American people, who get a larger proportion <Col N="476" /> of our young people than other countries, the cost of education that would fall upon them if they had to educate their young citizens.  From their slender resources, the community here are preparing citizens for another country which could very well afford to bear the burden of that social service. It is clear that we will have to change our whole system if we are going to carry on.  That has been evident to us for a very long time.</P>
    <P>Our attitude, when we talked about reduction of salaries and things of that kind, has been completely misunderstood. What is fundamental in our attitude is this: we recognise that we are a comparatively small country, and that we cannot afford to carry on our administrative services here on the same scale as if, for instance, we were a part of the British administrative system&mdash;the centre of an empire.  We, as I tried by an example long ago to point out, had to make the sort of choice that might be open, for instance, to a servant in a big mansion.  If the servant was displeased with the kicks of the young master and wanted to have his freedom he had to make up his mind whether or not he was going to have that freedom, and give up the luxuries of a certain kind which were available to him by being in that mansion.  He had to give up the idea of having around him the cushions and all the rest that a servant in the mansion might have, and the various things that might come from the table of the lord.  He had to forego these in order to get the liberty of living his life in his own way in simpler surroundings.  If a man makes up his mind to go out into a cottage, he must remember that he cannot have in the cottage the luxuries around him which he had when he was bearing the kicks of the master.  That is simple common sense.  If he goes into the cottage, he has to make up his mind to put up with the frugal fare of that cottage.  As far as I am concerned, if I had that choice to make, I would make it quite willingly. I would say: &ldquo;We are prepared to get out of that mansion, to live our lives in our own way, and to live in that frugal manner.&rdquo;  I believe we could have that in this country if we tried to get after it.  But we cannot have the two things.  We cannot carry <Col N="477" /> on administration on an imperial scale here and have a population of the size that this country could maintain.  We believe that there can be maintained on the soil of this country, in comfort, with a proper policy, a population two or three times the size of the present population. But you cannot maintain that population on the standards of administration that have been set here by this Executive.  I put it to the Deputies that they should make up their minds which they want.  If they want the policy of the opposite benches&mdash;&ldquo;efficiency,&rdquo; as they call it, in providing food for export to England&mdash;then they can make up their minds that they are going gradually to develop into being a big ranch, run economically, from the costings point of view, and supplying with the greatest possible economy food for the English people.  The Minister for Agriculture talked about the 500 acres in Canada and the three men and 24 horses&mdash;I forget his exact figures.  Is that what we want to develop into?</P>
    <P>Do we want to develop over here into producing beef and all the rest in the same standard Ford fashion, if I might say so, that they are producing corn in Canada?  As far as we are concerned on these benches, we definitely made up our minds&mdash;it is not to-day or yesterday that most of us made up our minds on the question&mdash; that we do not want that type of thing at all.  The Ministers on the opposite benches spoke some time ago&mdash;I think it was on the Flour Tariff debate&mdash; about trying to introduce straight-run flour here and trying to get the people to change their taste regarding patent flour, and we were asked if we would help them in a campaign of that kind. We will, and we will do it more logically, because we will extend that principle of using straight-run flour right through the whole administration and right through the tissues and the life of the country.  We believe that nothing is being done by the Ministry on the opposite benches but tinkering with the whole problem as they are tinkering with the question of the <Col N="478" /> protection of our industries.  If you tinker with some of these things and half do them you will neither have this nor that.  Deputies on the opposite benches are fond of making the charge against us that we are trying to make the worst of both worlds. That was how Deputy Cooper put it. But they are trying to do two things which are incompatible.  They are trying to reconcile the irreconcilable.  I hold they are guilty, in the most flagrant way, of attempting to reconcile the irreconcilable.  You cannot reconcile the maintenance of a population in this country which the country could support with the policy of having this country, and continuing it, as an out-garden for the British.</P>
    <P>We are dissatisfied not merely, to use Deputy Hogan's words, with the national policy of the Executive&mdash;that is, the relations between this country and England&mdash;but we are profoundly dissatisfied with the policy of the Executive in relation to the economic welfare of the country.  When we speak of setting up an Economic Council or Development Commission, what we really have in mind is a body that would sit down to examine the details and carry out the details of a policy that we have described in one phrase, time after time, in order that it might sink into the minds of the people&mdash;the idea of making the country self-contained economically.  We are repeating that phrase, time after time, because it is the simplest phrase which gives expression to our policy.  If that policy is decided upon, in order to carry it out we must have a body that will be relieved of a lot of the anxiety and daily disturbances that Ministers who are dealing with Executive work have to contend with.</P>
