      <P>In paragraph 47 of the Committee's Report it was recommended that a pension should become payable immediately a former pensioner leaves a Poor Law institution.  I am prepared <Col N="2" /> to give substantial effect to this recommendation, subject to some checks necessary to prevent abuse.</P>
      <P>The recommendation that retrospective effect should be given to second claims for pensions, if allowed, where proof of age had not been produced at first, is unacceptable, as previously stated.</P>
      <P>The recommendation in paragraph 49, that provision should be made for the determination by the High Court of points of law has been accepted.</P>
      <P>The recommendation in paragraph 50 is outside the Committee's terms of reference, but the legislation in course of preparation to give effect to the decisions just stated will include provision for such alteration in the definition of the standard of blindness as will remove the hardships which at present arise in some cases.</P>
      <P>The legislation contemplated will also probably remove some difficulties which have arisen in the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts since the change of Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to state (a) what steps have been taken to repay the subscriptions made to the Dáil Eireann Loan (Internal) 1919/20; (b) the total <Col N="4" /> number of subscriptions which have been repaid to date; (c) the total amount of such repayments (including interest); and (d) the cause of the delay in dealing with applications for repayment which have been before his Department for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately after the passing of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924, a special staff was organised in my Department for the purpose of preparing an authentic Register of Subscribers as a preliminary to the repayment of subscriptions. In the months of February and March, 1925, notices were inserted in the Dublin and Cork daily papers and in 43 provincial weekly newspapers setting forth the relevant provisions of the Act, and inviting subscribers to furnish particulars of their names, addresses and amount of subscriptions, together with the official receipts and applications for repayment.  A separate branch still exists in my Department for dealing exclusively with the repayment of subscriptions to the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, a special form of Saving Certificate was prepared for issue to subscribers to enable repayment to be effected in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, in consultation with my Department made detailed arrangements to enable subscribers to obtain repayment through Post Offices.</P>
      <P>As regards the second and third part of the Deputy's question, authority has already been given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the issue of Saving Certificates to 63,124 subscribers. These certificates represent an amount, including interest, totalling in the aggregate £316,894 18s.  0d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the fourth part, such delay as has arisen in dealing with applications was due to a number of causes, and was, in the circumstances, unavoidable. In the public notices to which I have referred it was stipulated that applications for repayment should reach my Department not later than the 31st March, 1925, but of approximately 140,000 subscribers only 20,000 applied within the time limit with sufficient particulars to enable their claims to be <Col N="5" /> substantiated.  Some 15,000 applications were received from persons who were unable to furnish particulars or evidence which would enable my Department to deal with their claims. In the circumstances, I decided for the time being to waive the time limit fixed for receiving applications, and applications are, in fact, still being received in large numbers.  Since repayment of subscriptions commenced on the 1st June last, which was the date fixed by the Act, there has been a heavy influx of fresh applications; during the last three months of 1927, no less than 35,400 communications were received in connection with the loan.</P>
    <P>Thousands of applications have been received from persons who subscribed in the pre-Truce period to various funds such as the fund for Volunteer Dependents and the Anti-Conscription Fund, in respect of which there is no provision for repayment.  In many of these cases it is only after considerable correspondence that the facts become clear and applications of this kind inevitably retard the process of dealing with applications from persons who in fact subscribed to the Loan.</P>
    <P>Another cause of delay arises from the fact that certain original records prepared by local collectors were not furnished to my Department.  In some cases I am informed that such records are not available, but there are also cases in which persons who would be in a position to assist my Department in connection with the identification of subscriptions have refused to furnish such assistance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to state what amounts of the moneys subscribed to the Dáil Eireann Loan, 1920-21 in the counties (a) Kilkenny, and (b) Carlow have <Col N="6" /> not yet been refunded to the subscribers, and the reasons for the prolonged delay in dealing with applications from these counties, and whether he is taking any steps to expedite the return of these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The compilation of the figures asked for in the first part of the Deputy's question would entail so much time and labour that I do not feel there is sufficient justification for undertaking it.  As regards the second part, there has been no avoidable delay in dealing with applications from the two counties in question or from any other area.  I can assure the Deputy that every possible step is being taken to expedite the repayment of subscriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider two years, a period which is quite common in dealing with these cases, a reasonable period, or does he expect us to believe that that can be termed a period of unavoidable delay? I think that at the very least, the House ought to have some assurance that this work should be concluded in a reasonable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to ask the Minister for Finance whether he would consider the advisability of sending to the subscribers whose names, addresses and receipt numbers are on the books in the office, notification of the unclaimed sums lying to the credit of such subscribers?  The reason I ask this question is that within the last three months I met a man who was going to destroy a receipt for £10.  He did not know it was any value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to consider any suggestion for seeing that the money is returned to individuals, but I would not undertake to take any particular action without having an opportunity of considering whether it might possibly result in the wrong persons being paid.  There is very great difficulty because sometimes <Col N="7" /> there are more persons than one of the same name in a particular townland and the result might be that the wrong person would get the letter and ultimately the money.  Great care has to be taken in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware of the great hardship imposed on litigants, jurors, etc., who, in some cases, are compelled to travel practically <Col N="8" /> fifty miles to the Cork Circuit Court, and whether it is now proposed, in view of the fact that the Bandon Courthouse will be shortly reconstructed, to hold the sittings of the Circuit Court in Bandon, and, if necessary, to amend the Circuit Court Rules to permit of this being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that great hardship is imposed on litigants or jurors by reason of the fact that the Circuit Court does not sit at Bandon, which is within one hour's journey of Cork by train, and as the volume of business arising in Bandon and the adjoining district is not such as would justify the holding of sittings of the Circuit Court in that town, it is not proposed in the Rules of the Circuit Court to prescribe Bandon as one of the places in which the Court shall sit.</P>

Mr. McDermott's estate comprises three tenancies for which a rental schedule has been lodged in the Land Commission to enable the Commissioners to collect from the tenants compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent under the Land Act, 1923, but Thomas Mulvey's holding is not included therein, as the lands being held by him under a fee-farm grant are &ldquo;untenanted lands&rdquo; as defined by the Act.  As they are situate in a congested districts county, they will vest in the Land Commission as untenanted land on the appointed day (unless they come within the exceptions mentioned in Section 24 of the Act), but they may under Section 32 of that Act be resold to him.  The proper course for Thomas Mulvey as owner is to lodge in the Land Commission particulars of the lands as prescribed by Order VIII. of the Rules of the Land Commission dated 5th February, 1924, and in regard to this it is desirable that he should consult a solicitor. There is no power to add the arrears of rent due by an owner of untenanted lands to the purchase money thereof.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say, the facts and circumstances surrounding the shooting of Timothy Coughlan, at Woodpark Lodge, Dartry Road, on the 28th January, 1928.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is probably in the recollection of members of the House that on the date in question this young man, Timothy Coughlan, met his death.  From the evidence of the principal witness examined at the inquest, an Intelligence Officer named Seán Harling, it appears that Coughlan and another man followed up and endeavoured to shoot Harling.  A coroner's jury inquired into the matter, and they brought in the following verdict:</P>
      <P>We find that the said Timothy Coughlan died on the 28th inst. from shock, haemorrhage and laceration of the brain caused by a bullet.  We are of opinion that the circumstances of the case should be a matter of further investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the verdict of the jury, I think it is also a matter of public knowledge that rumours have been circulated around this city and that certain newspaper articles have been written bringing very grave and very serious charges against certain persons. In these circumstances, since these grave charges have been brought against the Guards, and since the jury have brought in this rider to their verdict, I ask the House to consider this a matter of public importance, a matter which should be inquired into, and accordingly I move the motion.  I <Col N="30" /> should say that if this motion is carried here and in the Seanad a tribunal will be set up consisting of three impartial gentlemen to investigate all the facts and circumstances connected with this occurrence.  I think it is right the Dáil should know the nature of the Tribunal we propose to set up.  These three gentlemen will be District Justices, the Chairman being the senior District Justice of the City of Dublin.  He will be assisted by two other District Justices.  That, I submit, will be a perfectly fair and a perfectly impartial tribunal, which will be able to investigate fairly every circumstance connected with this event.  It will be constituted of three trained men, men used to dealing with matters of this nature, men trained to weigh up evidence and to decide upon it.</P>

      <P>That notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Standing Order 71 the proceedings of the Select Committee be open to the Press; that individuals or other interests affected be entitled to be represented by counsel or otherwise; and that the Select Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records;</P>

It is, I submit, an alternative to my motion rather than an amendment to it, and I submit it is not in order.</P>

      <P>The motion on the paper in the name of the Minister is in a common form which, although it does not mention the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, is understood to be directed towards giving the Executive Council power to set up a tribunal under that Act, having the powers conferred on such a tribunal by the Act.  But, on the face of it, the motion is simply a motion for inquiring into the facts and circumstances surrounding the shooting of Timothy Coughlan.  The amendment is a proposal for the setting up of a wholly different kind of tribunal.  I agree with the Minister in that, but it is aimed at an investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the shooting of Timothy Coughlan, and to that extent, therefore, offers an alternative form of inquiry.  I think it is in order.  It might be preferable if such a matter arose on a substantive motion, but on the whole, seeing that the Minister's motion is for the purpose of setting up an inquiry and the amendment also aims at an inquiry into the same facts and circumstances, the amendment is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I would like to emphasise the fact that the facts and circumstances which surrounded the shooting of the late Timothy Coughlan were of such a nature as to arouse very great public suspicion, a suspicion that was reflected in the verdict returned by the Coroner's jury, and which concerns more than the actual circumstances of the shooting itself.  The amendment which appears here advocates the setting up of a Select Committee of the House to investigate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts and circumstances surrounding the incident would include, from my interpretation of them, the methods by which men of the type of Sean Harling are recruited into the police force of the State.  The circumstances of the whole affair undoubtedly gave rise to grave doubts in the minds of the public as to the methods which the Government are adopting to preserve order in the State.  The fact that these doubts and suspicions do exist&mdash;and they certainly exist very <Col N="32" /> strongly in the minds of members of this party&mdash;is likely to cast a similar suspicion on any tribunal which the Government will nominate.  When the motion standing in the name of the Minister was first circulated, I got the impression, and I think most of the Deputies on this side of the House got the impression, that this tribunal was to be a white-washing tribunal and nothing else.  We think that the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of the late Timothy Coughlan are of such a serious nature that a tribunal which may be intended to be a white-washing tribunal, and which certainly might act in that capacity, does not meet the case.  The confidence which it is no doubt the policy of the Government to inspire in the people as to the methods of their administration is of such grave importance that the Government should not hesitate to have the most public investigation possible into these circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In our opinion the most public form of investigation would be by a Select Committee appointed by the House, representative of all sections in the House, and exercising the powers laid down in the terms of the amendment.  It will be within the recollection of Deputies who read the evidence submitted at the inquest that the witnesses who appeared on behalf of the State, the witnesses at any rate who were in State employment, endeavoured to establish that the late Timothy Coughlan was on Dartry Road on that night for the purpose of shooting Mr. Sean Harling. Mr. Sean Harling, we are told, is an Intelligence Officer.  As to what exactly an Intelligence Officer is I am not quite clear.  He refused to answer any question as to his antecedents.  He refused to state when or under what circumstances he became a member of the Intelligence Forces, and that fact in itself raises a subject for inquiry of very considerable importance.  We are particularly interested in the date on which Mr. Sean Harling first became a member of the Intelligence Forces of the State.  It is not so very <Col N="33" /> long ago since this individual sought for and obtained a position in the employment of the Fianna Fáil Organisation. Was he then in the employment of the Intelligence Department of the State?  Was he drawing money which comes out of the taxpayers' pockets for the purpose of political espionage? That is a matter that deserves investigation. The antecedents of the man himself, his own particular record, the record of those with whom he is associated, those who are related to him, and those who are living with him and whose records are no doubt to be found in the records of the police courts, show that there is something wrong with the system by which men of that character are brought in and placed in responsible positions where they have the lives and property of the citizens under their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparing the respective merits of the tribunal suggested by the Minister and the committee which I propose I think it very difficult to know what exactly the tribunal is for that the Minister has in mind.  Its powers are not defined in the motion.  We have been informed now that it will consist of three District Justices.  The purpose of its establishment is not very clear. I think the House would be lacking in its duty to the people who sent Deputies here if they adopted this method of investigation into a matter of such grave public importance as this.  I think that it is in the interest of all concerned that every possible fact relating to that incident should be brought out into the light of day.  It is not too much to ask that there should be no plea of privilege submitted on behalf of any witness.  There should be no attempt to keep from the knowledge of the committee any documents or papers relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry which are at the moment in the custody or under the authority of any Department of the State.  It is only by letting the broadest possible flood of daylight into all the facts that the public confidence, such as did exist in the methods of the police department, may in some measure be restored.  If it is found, as I strongly suspect it will be found, that there are methods in operation in that <Col N="34" /> Department that no decent Government would stand over, then it is the duty of the House to see that some other system of administration is put in its place.  I do not think it is necessary to elaborate any further upon the merits of a committee such as I suggest in preference to the tribunal suggested by the Minister, and therefore I propose the amendment standing in my name.</P>

      <P>I rise to second the amendment.  At the outset I wish to state that when I say I agree that it would be better, in the interest of the public, that in the place of Justices members of this House should form the committee, I do not wish to be misunderstood or to have it thought that I had not sufficient confidence in the Justices themselves.  I can appreciate and understand that they will administer justice from the attitude from which they see it.  But there is this point; these Justices happen to be men of such calibre that they do not believe that there could be such a thing possible as an individual in the police force who would speak any other than the truth.  I believe that these Justices do not realise the partial manner in which the C.I.D. particularly carry out their work, that they cannot understand that they are nothing but a political force, a partisan police force.  I should like also to make it quite clear that when I speak of the police force in this case I disassociate from it the ordinary police force, against whom, personally, I have nothing to say&mdash;the ordinary Guards.  I want to connect up here the political body from which the Civic Guard is formed and the political body known as the C.I.D.&mdash;the Criminal Investigation Department.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not do that on this amendment. I do not want to have to interrupt him later on.  This amendment aims at a particular kind of inquiry, and manifestly when we are undertaking proceedings for giving the investigation into the hands of somebody else we cannot ourselves enter upon the investigation.  Therefore, the Deputy is precluded from establishing his point.  Of course, I will let him illustrate what he wants to say.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling. There is a point, but it also might be ruled out&mdash;that is the attitude of the public in this matter of the mystery surrounding the shooting of Timothy Coughlan.  On the one hand, it looks as if in the case of an impartial inquiry the members of the Force might be on trial.  I believe that one judicial department trying another Department of State would not tend to inspire public confidence as to the absolutely impartial character of that inquiry.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House raised in the last Session the question of the detention of the man named Ned Reilly for a period of twelve months.  It was definitely known that Ned Reilly was an innocent man.  He had his own proofs and an alibi, and yet he was detained.</P>

      <P>I want to bring out the point because the Minister might not be too well versed in it.  We know that his Department does assert a certain amount of rigid control over civilians because they have certain political beliefs and outlook.  Ned Reilly, an innocent man, was detained for twelve months, and in spite of repeated protests, but eventually when he was brought to trial he was discharged. Yet, in that case, we had a member of the Guards trying for two hours to identify this man who he must have known was not the man he was looking for.</P>
      <P>We know of the cases of beatings which have been indulged in of civilians by Guards in Waterford.  The case came to trial.  The civilians went to court and got their decrees against the Guards, and the position now is that they cannot enforce their decrees or get their costs against the Guards who have mysteriously disappeared from the area in which they had been stationed in the service.  The Sheriff cannot find them, and the cost, amounting roughly to £400, cannot be recovered.  I have here before me particulars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is extraordinary that the Army should have in its ranks a man whose records must be known to the Department of Justice and to the Military Authorities, and that this man should be around the neighbourhood on the evening of this shooting.  I submit that for the satisfaction that it will give the public this matter should be thrashed out absolutely impartially, not by the judicial servants of the State but by impartial members of this House representing all sections.  I believe whatever the result will be it will be received and accepted by the public as nearer the truth of the matter than if it were gone on with in a whitewashing manner where possibly only a certain amount of the report will get out. I also submit that in whatever manner the matter is gone on with that this <Col N="37" /> House should also embody a recommendation that a certain sum be granted to the next-of-kin of Timothy Coughlan in order to enable them to be professionally represented at whatever inquiry takes place.  I believe the Minister will see the difficulty that these people will have in being properly represented at the inquiry.  These poor people will have against them the C.I.D. who will have all the resources of the State at their disposal, and I suggest that in whatever motion is passed bringing about the inquiry a recommendation will be embodied giving some assistance to those people to enable them to be properly represented.</P>

      <P>I think there will be general agreement that the Government have taken a wise step in asking the House to set up a tribunal to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the shooting of this young man.  There is no doubt that there have been rumours such as the Minister for Justice referred to, and charges of one kind or another, and also that the evidence as printed in the newspapers was such as to establish the necessity of an inquiry of one kind or another in which the whole circumstances will be brought fully into the light of day.  I think, therefore, the only matter for the House to decide is as to the nature of the tribunal to be set up.  The Minister wishes to set up one form of tribunal.  The amendment moved by Deputy Lemass suggests another.  Now, I must say I am not in favour of a tribunal consisting of Deputies to inquire into a matter of this kind.  I do not think they are the right kind of persons to inquire into it.  I do not think it would be possible for members of this House, to whatever Party they belong, to divest themselves sufficiently of what I may call their political prejudices, to be competent persons to give to the House an independent decision on the facts and circumstances put before them.  But quite apart from that, there is even a stronger argument against such a body &mdash;namely, that the people who hold an inquiry of this kind should be people of legal training.  It is proposed here by Deputy Lemass that a Committee he set up of five Deputies and that the <Col N="38" /> parties concerned have the right to be represented by Counsel.  I can conceive Counsel being engaged on the various sides in the case.  I do not know how many sides may claim to be represented in this case, but with the various Counsel engaged the whole proceedings might develop into a wrangle between Counsel, and it would be necessary for the Chairman of this Committee to have such legal training as would enable him to keep these legal gentlemen in order.  Apart from that, I see strong objection to bringing members of this House directly into a matter of this kind.  I think the amendment is open to very serious objection from many points of view.</P>
      <P>I think that matters into which a Select Committee should inquire should have some relation to or connection with Parliamentary business or should be in some other way connected with the House, or be matters in which members of the House are involved.  In matters of this kind I believe Deputies are not the proper persons to constitute a tribunal.  On the other hand, with regard to the tribunal suggested by the Minister, it does not satisfy me. The appointment of District Justices is open to this objection, that they are under the control of the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>In the Estimates, as far as we have seen them, the moneys were provided by a Vote of this House. In any case I maintain that the person who should be appointed to this position ought to have the status of a High Court Judge.  The matter is of sufficient importance to appoint a man of that status to carry it out.  I suggest that the Chairman should be a High Court Judge and that the other two members constituting the Commission should be men of high legal standing and that one of them at least ought to be appointed by the Government after consultation with the chief Opposition of this House.  I think if that is not done, with all due respect to the Minister and the Government, that these suspicions which he is so anxious to allay will not be allayed.  It is not that we in this House have any particular suspicion that three District Justices would not perhaps give as fair a verdict as any other three men that could be appointed, but if our object is to allay these suspicions I think we should take account of that fact and leave nothing undone to meet even the foolish suspicions of people who will say that if three District Justices constitute the Court they are in fact creatures of the Government and therefore are set up, as has been suggested, as a whitewashing Committee.  I do not say that, but I know it will be said, and I think that we should take steps to see that there will be no grounds for saying it.  Therefore my suggestion for a tribunal is one with a High Court Judge as Chairman with two legal gentlemen of high professional standing.  With regard to the appointment of one of them it should be made after consultation with the chief Opposition in the House.  I believe a tribunal of that kind would give satisfaction. I believe that their verdict, <Col N="40" /> whatever it might be, would be accepted by all parties as the proper, correct and fair one and that there would be no ground for any such suspicions as undoubtedly will arise with regard to the verdict brought in by three District Justices.  I am not prepared, for the reasons I have given, to support the amendment, but unless the Minister for Justice is prepared to give favourable consideration to the suggestion I have made I cannot see my way to support the proposal.  At least in so far as it sets up a tribunal it has my support, but I certainly think he should give consideration to the suggestion I have made and if it is done it will be in the interests of all parties concerned.</P>

We are told by Deputy Briscoe that it is going to be the case here, if three District Justices are appointed on this tribunal, of one Department of the Government trying another and we have Deputy O'Connell falling somewhat into the mistake through this error with regard to salary. Deputy O'Connell is responsible for this mistake himself.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, stated with regard to salaries that the several salaries shall until the end of the financial year ending the 31st of March, 1927, be paid out of moneys annually provided by the Oireachtas and thereafter shall be payable out of the Central Fund and the Deputy was in the House when that was passed.  The District Justices are quite as independent in this State as any other judges.</P>

The Deputy is afraid that this is going to be a whitewashing Committee. I suppose whitewashing in the Deputy's mind will be always applied to anything in which the police are not given a bad name.  Whether the facts are for the police or not, it is going to be a whitewashing inquiry.  The Deputy has little faith in evidence produced before this tribunal.  Personally I am not concerned with alleviating suspicion of any party in the State, Fianna Fáil or any other, but I am concerned with the alleviating of any suspicion there may be in the public mind.  The way to do that is not the matter of the verdict of any tribunal so much as the evidence produced and published in the Press when the inquiry is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Those are the suspicions I want to get at, but when Deputy O'Connell joins that suggestion that when setting up the tribunal one should consult the chief opposition group, then the suspicions that he is seeking to allay are not the suspicions in the public mind but the suspicions in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not care what the Fianna Fáil Party thinks about this.  I am only concerned with what three independent people think, and with the evidence on which they are to found their judgment.  Deputy Briscoe has already tried out the case in his own mind to show them the groove in which his mind was working.  He quoted a lot of other evil things, alleged to be done by police and C.I.D., and makes the astounding suggestion that a sum of money should be given to the relatives of the late Timothy Coughlan so that a defence could be provided and his <Col N="42" /> case properly stated.  If the Fianna Fáil Party are so concerned in this as they pretend to be, why not let them provide the additional sum out of their conscience money fund for getting counsel briefed for Timothy Coughlan's friends, so that his memory may be cleared of every stain that may cast upon it?  I agree with Deputy Lemass and the Minister for Justice that there is a suspicion, a suspicion amounting to a certainty, with regard to a murderous attack made in Dartry Road on that night, and what the tribunal has to find out is all the circumstances connected with that, not that any person is recruited to a force but the circumstances of that night, how that man met his death on that night, and the things immediately concerned with it.</P>

We are not concerned with the antecedents of Seán Harling, we are not concerned with the question of the general conduct of the police; we are concerned only with what kind of inquiry should be held into the circumstances of Timothy Coughlan's death. Deputy Lemass, in moving his amendment, spoke on that, and Deputy O'Connell spoke on that.  Now, I want to keep the Deputies to that subject, and that alone.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, that is the main thing, and the suggestion made here is that it should be a tribunal consisting of three judges.  A question has been put to me with regard to this being a public inquiry, The procedure upon which this resolution is founded ought to be explained to the House.  There is a particular piece of legislation under which a resolution can be brought to both Houses of the Oireachtas asking them to agree that the matter is of urgent public importance. If the resolution be passed, then the instrument appointing the tribunal, as well as determining who is to go on the tribunal also determines that certain powers will be given to that tribunal, and the powers are those possessed by the High Court here, all powers with regard to the production of documents and with regard to the enforcement of the attendance of witnesses, powers which Deputy Lemass's amendment does not give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, in addition, the matter as to publicity.  It is the intention and the aim of the Minister for Justice to have as much publicity as is possible with regard to this matter.  The Minister hopes that the whole matter will be dragged into the light of day, and the Minister believes that the facts can best be looked into and examined by three District Justices.  That appears to be the difficulty in the mind of Deputy O'Connell.  I hope that point has been cleared up with regard to District Justices being in no way inferior to judges of any other court with regard to their independence.  If the Deputy has any other objection to them from the point of view of their work, or from the point of view of the importance of their inquiries let him consider that this type of work is much more in line with what a District Justice does than it is in line with the work of either <Col N="44" /> a Circuit Court Judge or a High Court Judge.  It is for the District Justices to find upon the facts.  That is not the case with regard to the others.  District Justices are marked out for that particular type of work and are the proper people to inquire into the facts.  They have behind them a knowledge of law and of what is evidence, and will be able to confine the inquiry to the point that is agitating the public mind, the point that Deputy Cooney spoke of, that is, on whom was the murderous attack made upon that particular night on Dartry Road.  There is only between the two motions the question of five Deputies or three Judges.  As far as anything else is concerned&mdash;publicity, powers and everything else&mdash;the Minister's motion gives more power than the Deputy's amendment.  It is a matter for this House to consider as between three independent District Justices or five Deputies of the House. I think most of the House will agree at any rate with the Deputy in this, that it is going to be hard to get five Deputies who will treat this as a problem to be dealt with according to the rules of evidence.</P>

I was one of those responsible for a newspaper article, but I made no charge in that newspaper article.  I made the same case as the jury, obviously, had in mind, for an investigation. But it will defeat the purpose the jury had in view when they added that rider to their verdict if the tribunal set up is one that will not command the confidence of every section of the community.  Unfortunately for public order in this country, a large section of the community, whether rightly or wrongly, do not believe that the present administration of justice is impartial.  I do not pass any comment upon that.  It is simply a fact that is known to everyone, and obviously if <Col N="45" /> the Minister for Justice is concerned to remove from the public mind all suspicion which it now attaches to the present conduct of the Criminal Investigation Department, it will only succeed in doing it when it sets up as a tribunal of investigation one in which every section of the community has confidence.  It was stated that the tribunal was to be set up as a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act.  That is precisely one of the things which we find objection to in regard to this tribunal, because under that Act the tribunal would have the option of taking evidence either in public or in private. We want to be certain that the evidence in this case will be taken in public.</P>

    <P>For that reason we feel that the bench suggested by Deputy O'Connell would command more confidence than that proposed by the Minister for Justice; that a tribunal consisting of a Judge of the High Court and two other gentlemen of high legal standing&mdash;one to be appointed after consultation, I assume, with the Opposition Parties in the House, would be a more impartial tribunal and would carry greater authority and greater weight than that proposed.  We on these benches would be prepared to accept the suggestion put forward by Deputy O'Connell.  I do not see any great objection to that tribunal.  I suggest that those who compose such a Committee should be gentlemen of High Court has Surely, a Judge of the High Court has every qualification for adjudicating in cases that can be possessed by a Justice of the District Courts.  Surely, the peculiar qualifications which the Minister for Industry and Commerce set forth as being essential for those who <Col N="46" /> constitute this tribunal can be found elsewhere than amongst District Justices in Ireland.  I submit, therefore, that if the Government wants a full investigation into this matter&mdash;and we want a full investigation&mdash;that investigation will not be found through the medium of the motion of the Minister for Justice.  This is not a simple inquiry. The whole conduct of the Criminal Investigation Department will be under examination.  We want to be certain that if there was an attack upon Seán Harling&mdash;and we do not believe there was&mdash;it was not instigated by those who were in the employment of the C.I.D.  I do not want to go into the record of that man&mdash;it is a very ambiguous one.</P>

I do not want the dice loaded against the man who is dead.  That is the reason why we are asking Deputies to meet us in this impartial manner. We accept the proposal made by Deputy O'Connell.  Let the tribunal be presided over by a Judge of the High Court, a man who will be remote and will not have that healthy appreciation of favours to come of which the more lowly lawyers are sometimes suspected. Let the other men who constitute that tribunal be men who are independent of the Government and of the present administration of justice. One at least should be a man in whom we ourselves shall have trust and confidence. I think that is a very fair approach to the Government in this matter.</P>

      <P>Two things ought to be in the minds of Deputies in this matter.  One is not to hurt the feelings <Col N="48" /> of those who are mourning their dead, and the other is not to pre-judge the issue.  At present, I find myself in a state of considerable doubt, because the views of the Deputies who sit on the opposite benches are becoming successively diversified.  I am conscious that there is a danger in my following Deputy Briscoe in all his arguments.  I might find myself out of order.  But one thing Deputy Briscoe said was in order.  When he referred to the amendment, he said that a Committee of the Dáil would provide an absolutely impartial inquiry.  It was not ever thus. This admiration for the Dáil is newly-born. Hardly more than six months ago, Deputy Briscoe, and the Deputies who surround Deputy Briscoe, were informing us that no good thing could be expected to come out of the Dáil; that in its origin, its conduct and composition it was the worst assembly in the world.  Now, in six months, he has discovered that the verdict of six members of the Dáil would be absolutely impartial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask if Deputy Cooper wishes to make out that all Committees set up by this House in the last session were impartial or that they acted with impartiality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I would say that Deputy Briscoe is suffering under the intoxication of first love. When he has sat on as many Committees as Deputy O'Connell and myself, he will realise that on many subjects Deputies of different Parties have co-operated in the most praiseworthy manner and that there has been an absence of partisanship and partiality. But that partiality cannot be absolutely expelled from human things.  A Committee of the Dáil on a subject such as this, a subject on which a large Party in the State has already expressed its opinion, would find great difficulty in preserving impartiality.  I think I have Deputy O'Connell with me on that point.  If Deputy Briscoe rightly admires our Committees, would he be prepared to accept a majority verdict?  If there were two members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, one Labour member, and two Fianna Fáil Deputies, would he accept a verdict <Col N="49" /> from which his two colleagues dissented? I doubt it.  It is not probable that such a verdict would carry any weight at all.  I do not quite understand whether or not Deputy Briscoe has seconded the amendment moved by Deputy Lemass.  Deputy MacEntee stands up and says that instead of that amendment he is prepared to accept Deputy O'Connell's.  Is the amendment withdrawn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment sets out a different procedure to that suggested by Deputy O'Connell.  If we are to get the kind of tribunal that Deputy O'Connell desires, then the amendment must be defeated or withdrawn. Is it being withdrawn?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No?  Then, let us compare the powers of a Committee of the Dáil such as Deputy Lemass suggests, and a tribunal set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  A Dáil Committee is set up and is empowered by this Dáil to do certain things.  That Committee is given power to send for persons, papers and records. Deputy Lemass proposes to add that the Committee should take evidence on oath.  We have not hitherto&mdash;and I would like Deputy Ruttledge to appreciate this&mdash;made these powers operative. We may send for persons, papers and records, but if the persons refuse to come and the papers and records are not available, we have no power of obtaining them.  Deputies will remember that on more than one occasion the Public Accounts Committee sent for people to give evidence and they did not come.  That could happen in this case, because we have no operative machinery to get witnesses to appear before our Committees.  The Ceann Comhairle cannot issue a subpoena or a warrant.  I believe the Speaker of the House of Commons can.  The Serjeant-at-Arms in the House of Commons has certain powers.  Our Captain of the Guard, in the eyes of the law, is an absolutely ordinary individual; he has not as much operative power in so far as the ordinary citizen is concerned as a judge's tipstaff would have.  If such a Committee as is suggested were set <Col N="50" /> up, and if it were treated with contempt, neither Deputy Lemass nor anybody else would have power without a definite statute to deal with such a situation.  A definite statute would be required conferring power on our officials to make this evidence available. Without such power it would be an illusory inquiry.</P>
      <P>I and Deputy Roddy were members of a tribunal set up under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. It was perhaps a pity that the Minister did not embody that Act in the resolution, as it might have enabled Deputies to inform themselves of its terms.  A tribunal set up under it has the powers of a High Court as regards summoning witnesses and administering oaths, and in the event of there being contempt of any kind&mdash;witnesses refusing to attend or refusing to give evidence&mdash;such witnesses could be brought before the judges of the High Court and could be dealt with there as if they were guilty of contempt of court.  That is a very considerable power, and the Tribunal on Prices found it necessary to exercise it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass laid stress on two points about the Committee being open to the Press and about representation by counsel at the Tribunal of Inquiry. The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, Section 2 (a), sets out that it shall not allow the public to be present unless it is in the public interest to do so.  You have had the assurance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Minister for Justice desires this to be an open inquiry.  I think that ought to satisfy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a matter for the Tribunal.  It worked in the case of the Tribunal on Prices.  We decided our procedure would be to take evidence in public, but where traders held that it would be unfair to them if their evidence were given in public, we sat in private.</P>

    <Col N="51" />
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Minister definitely gave an undertaking before the setting up of the Tribunal, I can imagine the Tribunal would take some account of that.  If we are to start with the assumption that any tribunal set up by the Government is going to be hopelessly biased and is going to commit every crime it can to distort justice, then what is the good of Deputy MacEntee getting up and saying that he is prepared to accept Deputy O'Connell's suggestion?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for the Tribunal to decide.  Also, Section 2 (b) of the same Act gives power to authorise representation by counsel.  In the case of the Tribunal on Prices we thought it well not to have that power.  We allowed them to bring their chartered accountants with them but not counsel.  Both these matters which are considered in Deputy Lemass's amendment are met by the Tribunals of Inquiry Act.  If we are to get the kind of tribunal Deputy O'Connell wants we will first of all have to defeat Deputy Lemass's amendment.</P>
      <P>I have no definite feeling with regard to the personnel of this Committee.  I have always stood for the independence of the District Justices, and I think they have achieved independence. I believe I am right in saying that in last year's Estimates the salaries of the District Justices appear on the Central Fund and not on the Estimates. They are as independent as any other judge.  They have good training for investigating matters of this kind&mdash;just as good a training as any other judge, and they are not quite so over-worked as some of the judges. I would certainly object to any proposal for the appointment of a Circuit Court Judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure we will never get an honest or a satisfactory investigation if it is to be condemned in advance; if it is to go forth from any large party in the State that nothing serious is meant and that this is <Col N="52" /> nothing but whitewashing in order to throw the thing out of the way.  I do not believe that is intended, and I believe suggestions to that effect will prejudice the work of the tribunal and cast an impediment in the path of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me as if certain members of the Party opposite feel the amendment is scarcely defensible, and in proposing the amendment it seemed to me that Deputy Lemass was more interested in the facts and circumstances concerning the life of Seán Harling than in the facts and circumstances concerning the death of Timothy Coughlan.  That is a wrong point of view.  If Deputies want to get any inquiry into police methods generally they can take steps to procure that inquiry, but to make this death the occasion for a general inquiry into police methods is wrong.</P>

If it is proven that there was a murderous attack on Timothy Coughlan and not a murderous attack by Timothy Coughlan, then there will be ground for further inquiry.

      <P>I am not going to inquire into it.  If it appears from the inquiry that there was a murderous attack on Timothy Coughlan, then there would be cause for, perhaps, a further and wider inquiry.  But we have first to see if we can establish what actually did occur on Dartry Road that particular evening.  Deputy Briscoe said that his Party had no concern but the public interest.  I suggest that members of his Party, if a Committee such as is suggested in the amendment were set up, would find it very difficult to act entirely impartially and would bear in mind anything but the public interest, because Deputies of that Party attended the public funeral given to Timothy Coughlan.  If <Col N="53" /> it should be decided that Timothy Coughlan was a would-be murderer and had met a well-deserved fate, then that would be a reflection on these Deputies.</P>

      <P>I would like to make an explanation.  I think the Minister is misinterpreting the amendment.  It is not merely to inquire into the actual shooting of Timothy Coughlan that I suggest the Committee should be set up.  Even if that Committee established that Timothy Coughlan was there for the purpose of shooting Harling, I suggest there is still great ground for investigation as to why he did it.  I submit that as long as men like Harling hold responsible positions in the police force, you are going to have provocation given for the continuance of similar assaults in the future. These are facts and circumstances in connection with the shooting which ought to be investigated.</P>

      <P>I do not think I need say any more with reference to the amendment.  It seems to me that there are probably few people in the House who could approach the thing without some prejudice.  Some Deputies seem to have their minds fully made up and others might have their minds partially made up, but few could, I think, approach it without prejudice.  That seems to me to be a conclusive reason against having a Committee of this House.  With reference to Deputy O'Connell's suggestion, it seems to me that it was thrown out somewhat casually and without having been given full consideration by the Deputy himself. Obviously he had not taken care to inform himself in regard to the facts and in regard to the position of District Justices.  It seems to me that the appointment of members of the Bar to the Commission would not tend to give confidence in it.  It would be alleged that either of them&mdash;whoever was appointed&mdash;was looking for favours to come.  It would be said that perhaps <Col N="55" /> one of them was hoping to be appointed a Judge by this Government, and it would be alleged that if we did consult with the Opposition groups that the other was hoping to be appointed a judge by some other Government.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that a great deal of criticism would be levelled at the Commission if it included practising members of the Bar in view of the political issues that are raised.  I do not think it would be desirable, either, that there should be a suggestion of partisanship in the members appointed.  It seems to me that whatever members are appointed they should be appointed by the Government on its own responsibility, recognising that it is its duty to maintain the good name of the institutions of the State, as well as to maintain its own good name, in matters of administration, and therefore to appoint people who would be impartial.  If one person was appointed as representing one particular side, then the tendency would be to appoint another person as representing another side.  It seems to me to be altogether wrong to suggest that there should be a consultation of political groups about any of the members of the tribunal.  It seems to me that District Justices, as has already been said, are as independent as any other members of the Judiciary.  They are perfectly impartial and they are trained. Their status is not as high as the status of High Court Judges, but the work that is to be done is work which is in line with their ordinary work on the Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of responsibility for murder to be investigated.  Judges of the High Court do not themselves decide on facts in regard to murder. We were advised on a previous occasion &mdash;I am referring now to the Public Safety Act&mdash;that we ought not to ask Judges of the High Court to find facts in regard to murder, or to find facts in a criminal trial.  They preside over the deliberations of a jury.  They see that the evidence is properly given and then they sum up for the jury, but they themselves do not find the facts.  We were advised at the time, with a view to not impairing the efficiency of the <Col N="56" /> High Court Judges and with a view to seeing that no slur could be cast on any of them in the future, that it would be inadvisable to ask Judges of the High Court to deal with the facts in any case that involved the question of murder or in fact in regard to the actual guilt or otherwise of any person who was charged with a criminal offence. It seems to us that it would be undesirable to ask the Judges of the High Court to undertake the type of inquiry here suggested.  The Judges of the High Court might not be willing to undertake it.  They might take the view that our law officers urged on us as a Government on a previous occasion that it was undesirable that High Court Judges should undertake this kind of work.  If the Judges were not willing to do so, there is no means by which the Government could compel them to do it. So far as the District Justices are concerned, we have consulted them and we know that there are District Justices who will be willing to undertake the inquiry.</P>

      <P>We know that there are District Justices who will undertake it.  Deputy MacEntee or some other Deputy, I think, suggested that the tribunal itself might decide to hold the inquiry in private, or part of the inquiry in private.  Undoubtedly under the Act the tribunal itself can so decide, but all we can say is this, that any representative of the Ministry who may appear professionally before the tribunal will urge against any part of the inquiry being heard in private.  In view of that it seems to me inconceivable, and also in view of the fact that other professional representatives who will be there will desire to have it held in public, that the tribunal should decide against all advice and decide to hold the inquiry or any part of it in private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to permitting representation by professional men, everybody knows that all Judges, people who have sat on the Bench, are very anxious to get the assistance of advocates <Col N="57" /> in carrying out inquiries.  Judges greatly dislike any person appearing on his own behalf, and I think it is inconceivable that a tribunal, such as is proposed to be set up, should refuse to allow representation to anybody who is interested.  Here, by setting up this tribunal you can get people who are in no way officially dependent on the Government, who have no favours to get from the Government, who are trained in conducting this sort of investigation, to carry it out.  By no other method can we get such a tribunal.  Certainly the proposal set out in the amendment is preposterous.  If Deputy O'Kelly wants a dog-fight he can have it by this means, but you could not have anything else.</P>

      <P>I am sure that I will not be accused of bias when I state that I claim to be one of those who, like the members of the Coroner's Jury, have not yet made up their minds on this matter.  I think that is the position of the great bulk of the people in the country and it is for that reason I welcome the investigation.  The exact composition of the tribunal does not worry me very much because to my mind the whole question is whether the tribunal is to be conducted in public or in private.  If the tribunal is conducted in public it will be for the public to judge and for the public to return their verdict.  It is not an investigation or trial for murder.  It is, according to the Minister's proposal, an investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the shooting of Timothy Coughlan.  This tribunal whatever it may be, will not be entitled to bring in a verdict of murder. This tribunal, if the evidence be taken in public, can be judged by the public on the verdict they bring in and it will be the public eventually who will be judges both of the tribunal and the Government that set it up.  Therefore I am not particularly concerned as to whether the alternative suggested by Deputy O'Connell, or the method proposed by the Minister for Justice should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say I thought that the latter portion of the argument of the Minister for Finance against asking High Court Judges to take on this onerous work. <Col N="58" /> is equally applicable when asking District Justices to do it.  We have been told over and over again, only as late as this afternoon here, that District Justices are just as much Judges as High Court Judges.  If the argument of the Minister for Finance applies to High Court Judges and if the District Justices are equally Judges, why does not the same argument apply to them! However that may be, what I am concerned with is: will this evidence be taken in public?  Unfortunately according to the Tribunals Act of 1921, as we have been told this afternoon, the option will remain with the tribunal.  If only we could by some means or another instruct the tribunal after setting it up to take the evidence in public, I think that would go a long way to satisfy public sentiment in the matter.  I welcome the statement by the Minister for Finance which is certainly a very solemn pledge on behalf of the Government. That is that any representative of the Ministry who appears before this tribunal will urge against holding the proceedings in private.  I take that as a very serious and solemn undertaking on behalf of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>But solemn as the undertaking is and disinclined as I am to believe that it would be departed from, at the same time it is not the same thing as giving a direct instruction, if that could be done, to this tribunal to have its proceedings in public.  I do not care what the verdict of the tribunal is as long as the evidence is given in public, because the people will be able to decide for themselves. The country will come to a conclusion as to the true facts of the case and then both the tribunal and the Government who set it up will have to stand or fall by the verdict of the country.  As far as the original amendment is concerned, I personally am inclined to believe that it would not be possible to get an impartial committee of five members of this Dáil.  In a committee of five there must be a majority.  Is it to be a Government majority or a Fianna Fáil <Col N="59" /> majority?  In either one case or the other, from my point of view I respectfully say that the majority would not be an impartial one and therefore to select members of the judiciary&mdash; whether they be High Court Judges or District Justices does not concern me&mdash; and to ask them to sit in public upon a matter like this, to hear evidence, to have representation from those concerned, relatives of the parties interested, representation by counsel and otherwise as they so desire, to my mind is the important proposal that we have now to decide.</P>
      <P>If I would be in order in moving an amendment on those lines, namely that the tribunal should sit in public and that representation should be allowed by counsel or otherwise, I would be prepared to do so, but in the event of it not being possible to move such an amendment I think that the House has only one course to take.  Having now got a solemn pledge and undertaking from the Vice-President, backed by his colleague, the Minister for Justice, that every representative of their Ministry will urge, as far as possible, this tribunal to take evidence in public there is only one course for the House to adopt and that is to accept the tribunal. Let the public at large judge what takes place at that tribunal.  Let the public at large see for themselves whether this solemn undertaking is carried out or whether it is not.  If it is not they will have the remedy in their own hands.  If it is, then the investigation will be in public and will throw as much light as possible on the whole circumstances.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Deputy's proposal of an amendment to the motion which would enable the Minister, in appointing the tribunal, to instruct the tribunal to hold all its sittings in public, I am afraid such an amendment, if accepted and passed, would not be effective.  Therefore I would not accept it.  The motion in the name of the Minister for Justice is directed towards giving a Minister power to set up a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act. It is quite plain if the Minister sets up a tribunal under that Act, the tribunal <Col N="60" /> once set up will have to function under that Act and it will not be possible for the Minister, it seems to me, to give that tribunal any instructions which will interfere with the statutory powers conferred on the tribunal.  I think, therefore, the Minister could not, even if the amendment were passed here, give the tribunal an instruction which would be in fact an amendment to the Statute. In other words the Deputy's proposal is to amend the Statute by resolution and a Statute cannot be amended by resolution.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  We are told by the Minister for Justice that a tribunal of impartial gentlemen is going to be set up. This impartial tribunal is to consist of three District Justices who have been placed in their present position by one particular Party and who are dependent on the same political Party for their further advancement.  That is the impartial tribunal.  I fear I may be put down as having a rather suspicious mind, but I do not believe that at the present day you will get an impartial tribunal of any kind in this country. We are concerned with letting in the light of day, as far as possible, on the true facts of the case.  I regret that the inquiry has not a wider scope, because I fear that the public are becoming increasingly alarmed at the number of shooting which are being carried out all over the country by those gentlemen, who apparently are in some manner mentally deranged, and who have the possession of arms and are being paid as the C.I.D. force in this country. <Col N="61" /> We have instances of it all over the country day by day.</P>

I do not think that the public will be satisfied with a tribunal consisting of three District Justices who have been put in their position by one political Party.  I am afraid we cannot keep political bias out of this inquiry, because apparently it is a political crime, whatever way you look at it.  I do not think you can keep political bias out of it, and I do not think you will get an impartial inquiry by three District Justices who were put in their position by a political Party and are dependent for their further advancement on that political Party.  I do not think you will get a fair trial of that description at the present day.  Therefore I think that a Committee of five members of the House, who would inquire into the matter openly, would be far more concerned with bringing all the facts to light, and that, after all, is the principal thing.  They would get all the facts out and let us see where we stand.</P>

      <P>We approached this question from the point of view of certain serious rumours which have been afloat.  In addition to that certain evidence was given at this inquiry that fixes responsibility on certain people.  We do not want to attack this question as if it was a matter that was <i>sub judice,</i> but we want to see that whatever tribunal is set up will be a tribunal that will have the confidence of the people.  A good deal has been said as to the powers of that tribunal. A good deal of whitewashing has been attempted to be done as to what some particular person or Minister on the opposite benches might think that the tribunal should take notice of.  There is nothing like that in the motion or in the rules or powers, as far as I know them.  But that is one of the latest suggestions hopped out across the floor.  We know that under the Tribunals <Col N="62" /> of Inquiry Act whatever tribunal is set up has power to take evidence either in public or in private.  That is the power vested in them, notwithstanding any little suggestion that may be hopped across the few intervening streets or roads between Leinster House and wherever that inquiry is to sit.  We also know that they have power under that Act, no matter what is said here, to try to whitewash or deceive people, to refuse to allow counsel to represent any particular person.  When the question was mentioned here of counsel being assigned to represent any particular person or to appear for particular persons, we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce getting up astonished and astounded that such a preposterous suggestion should be made.  So far as I know the memory of Timothy Coughlan has not so far been stained with the suggestion that he was a criminal or that those people who may require to be represented at the inquiry are criminals.  As the Minister for Justice might inform the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the meanest criminal in the land is entitled to have assigned to him in a criminal court, and it has always been the practice to assign to him, counsel and solicitor to defend him.  However, I give to the Minister for Industry and Commerce whatever value he can take out of his cheap sneer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be suggested that we are, perhaps, a bit too suspicious about this tribunal.  How can we regard it otherwise than with suspicion when we are told by the Vice-President that the members of it are already picked?  It is perhaps in keeping with the practice of people who have got into the position of thinking that they are the end-all and be-all and the dictators in this country.  Just as two or three people may decide on a general election, in the same way they may come with things cut-and-dried to this House and the House must calmly lie under them. In this case, which appears from the Government point of view to be a very small matter, we have the practice pursued and followed up that the three people who are to constitute this tribunal are picked beforehand.  Of <Col N="63" /> course we are told that they are going to be absolutely impartial.  The Minister for Justice knows that there is such a thing as promotion for District Justices, and that there has been promotion for a few.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to prevent a District Justice from being promoted.  If High Court Judges are incapable, or if people on the benches opposite are so careful lest they might in any way dim the halo that hangs around them, or darken it, or in any way lower their prestige, perhaps also they might have regard to the danger of dimming the halo, if it ever existed, of the District Justices.  I heard an argument between Deputy O'Connell and some member on the Government Benches as to District Justices being practically in the same position as High Court Judges.  High Court Judges are incapable, according to the Government view, of acting under the Public Safety Act.  Some of them may have some independence, and, therefore, would be incapable of acting in a partisan and whitewashing inquiry of this sort.  We regard this inquiry as whitewashing; we regard it as a star chamber business; an attempt to get the Government point of view before the people, and nothing else.  If it was any other man except a man with the record of Harling, who is a member of the police force, and against whom statements and charges were made in the progress of the Coroner's inquiry, <Col N="64" /> he would be in jail to-day.  I do not want to go into matters that are <i>sub judice,</i> but the Minister knows that when the Coroner's jury suggested it was a case for a further inquiry, if the Government were sincere about it and did not want to further cloak him, he would be in jail.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  We were told he was impartial. We propose an amendment that seems perfectly fair.  It is criticised from various points of view, but, at any rate, if it was carried, it would provide a body which this House itself had set up.  This House having set it up, and its having received the approval of the House, and consisting of representatives of all Parties in the House, I do not think we could afterwards say it was a whitewashing inquiry, or that anyone could say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to this amendment being put forward, a suggestion was made by Deputy O'Connell that, to our mind, would be a means of elucidating some of the facts which we believe would be otherwise suppressed.  It would be a means by which the public would be able to view the facts that otherwise would be kept out of view.  We welcome it as the next best thing to the amendment we propose, and we are ready to support it.  We are touched with the meticulous accuracy or the technical accuracy of the President as to what exactly we propose or stand for.  We have proposed an amendment. We are ready to deal with the matter not on miserable little points but on the broader aspect&mdash;to set up here a tribunal in which there will be confidence <Col N="65" /> and which will not be regarded, as we regard this tribunal proposed by the Government, as an already picked affair.  It is a Star Chamber affair, already picked and devised for the purpose of whitewashing the direction from the coroner's jury that there should be further inquiry.  If it is set up in that way we believe it will fail to get the respect of anybody, even the Government supporters.  Certainly it will not receive the respect of the people.</P>

      <P>Now, there are two matters before the House &mdash;a motion and an amendment.  There are two alternatives.  The motion is to set up a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act.  I should like to deal with a couple of points which Deputy Redmond made upon that Act. He said, and said, of course, correctly, that the tribunal set up, to be an impartial and independent tribunal, could not be under the control of any Minister.  That is perfectly accurate. It would not be impartial and would not be independent if it were.  But he said that, possibly, this tribunal would decide upon hearing part of the evidence in private.  I would like to call the attention of the House to the section. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A tribunal to which this Act applied as aforesaid shall not refuse to allow the public or any portion of the public to be present at any of the proceedings of the tribunal unless in the opinion of the tribunal it is in the public interest expedient so to do for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> Therefore, unless, in the opinion of the tribunal, it is in the public interest expedient that the inquiry should be held in private, it is to be held in public.  What is there here in the public interest that can possibly lead an impartial, fair-minded tribunal to come to any other conclusion, except that this inquiry should be held in public?  What argument can arise in their minds which would lead them to come to the conclusion that the proceedings should be held in private?  I think the Deputy may take it for certain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister, but the tribunal may not think so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pretty certain the Deputy may have his mind quite at case that this inquiry will be held in public.  He also has our undertaking that if the court does suggest that the inquiry should be held in private whoever represents us will argue as strenuously as possible against that position being taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but may I ask him, if he is so anxious that the proceedings should be held in public, why not scrap the Tribunals Act altogether and set up a tribunal <i>ad hoc</i> with definite instructions from this House that they should hold their inquiry in public and that they should allow counsel to appear before them?  What is the necessity for proceeding under the Tribunals Act at all?  Why not set up a special tribunal here and now, and give that tribunal power similar to those enjoyed by the tribunal the Minister proposes, and as well as those powers, give them instructions that the proceedings shall be in public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to set up such a tribunal it would require a special statute.  It cannot be done by a Resolution of the House, but requires a statute.  This is the only statute under which a tribunal with power to take evidence can be set up. Also to enforce the attendance of witnesses. Now, take the personnel of this tribunal&mdash;three District Justices.  District Justices are persons who are engaged <Col N="67" /> daily in the investigation of crime and charges of crimes.  That is their duty.  That is a part, and a big part, of the business which they have to perform.  Who are better able to decide matters than those persons who are daily conversant and daily dealing with similar matters?  It is said that these three District Justices may be unfair, may be biassed, may be anxious to sin against the light of their own consciences, may be anxious to do wrong in order to curry favour with the Government.  There is nobody in this country, or in the rest of the world, who stands so high but that a certain class of tongue may not be found ready and willing to vilify him. It will not surprise me if the three District Justices who will constitute this court, if this resolution be passed, are attacked and vilified, but none the less their reputation, their honour, and their good name will survive and triumph any cowardly attacks that may be made upon them.  We are told here that they have been already selected, and, therefore, there is something corrupt and queer about the selection of them.  They have been asked to act. Of course they have been asked to act. Here are grave charges brought against the Guards, grave charges indeed.  Is there to be delay or hesitation about the investigation of these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. COONEY Mr. COONEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that it is the charges against the Guards, rather than the death of Timothy Coughlan, that is going to be investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the death of Timothy Coughlan is a question that is going to be investigated, but certain charges have been made against the Guards, and I take it these persons who make these charges against the Guards will endeavour to substantiate them, and certainly those charges are going around, and may go around until they are thoroughly investigated by the tribunal, and it is only fair and just that this tribunal should be set up as quickly as possible.  Therefore, instead of waiting until this was passed and then going around and discovering who is going to be willing to act.  I took such measures as I considered <Col N="68" /> right to discover, first of all, what would be the correct, fair and impartial tribunal, and then see what persons would be willing to act.  Deputy O'Connell has made a suggestion that a tribunal which would be set up under this Act should be a tribunal consisting of a High Court Judge and two barristers, I think he said, or at any rate leaders of the Bar or solicitors.</P>
      <P>We heard it stated that a District Justice cannot be impartial.  Because a District Justice once was promoted from being an Assistant District Justice to a Chief District Justice, therefore his honour is gone for all time. Suppose now that a member of the Irish Bar or a member of the solicitor profession were appointed to this tribunal, would it not be denounced from the benches opposite as being the appointment of place-hunters and all that?  Is not that precisely the attack that would be made?  With regard to the question of a High Court Judge, it has already been stated that High Court Judges have got other work and that they investigate crimes with the aid of a jury, while here they would be investigating without the aid of a jury. Besides, who knows that this inquiry is going to be the end here?  This tribunal will report to the House.  Probably there will be further litigation arising out of this matter.  It will probably come before some of the High Court Judges.  I think it is better that no High Court Judge should be concerned in this preliminary investigation&mdash;an investigation which may lead to a Court of Appeal case, because, as I say, when this report is laid upon the Table it does not by any means end the matter.  What is the alternative and the only alternative before the House?  A Committee of five selected by the Selection Committee.  What you want in an investigation of this kind is an impartial tribunal, a tribunal trained to weigh evidence and, above all things, a tribunal constituted of men who have not made up their minds. Is there anybody on the Fianna Fáil benches at the present moment who has not made up his mind?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what is the use, at the present day, in persisting in those antiquated ideas of compelling any official, in order to get his daily bread, to take a declaration of allegiance.  We were challenged here that we cannot bring forward cases of individual officials who had lost their positions because they would not subscribe to that oath.  If the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has a week to spare I guarantee to him it will take him a full week to go into the cases of individuals who have lost their positions and their daily bread because of their refusal to subscribe to that declaration.  Is it going to be the case that no individual in this country is going to get any situation whatsoever unless he belongs to a particular political Party?  That is the whole question.  I wonder will any Deputy on the opposite benches have the nerve to say that they believe that the compelling of men to make that declaration is going to change their ideas or that it is going to make them more loyal to a particular Party?  Does any member on the opposite benches think that compelling members of this Party to sign a shameful declaration is going to make us any more loyal to King George and to England?  Do they think that it is going to make us accept King George of England as having any claim or any right whatsoever in this country?  Do they think that it will prevent any individual in Ireland, whenever he thinks the opportunity is ripe, from striving to break all connection with England?  Is not all this clearly intended to debase the individual? This is striving to make slaves in an age when freedom should be the watchword and the watchery.  I have known fathers of families who were <Col N="74" /> driven out of their positions, who were dismissed from their employment, because they did not subscribe to this declaration.  I can give cases if required.</P>

      <P>We have a lot of these cases in Cork County.  I could not give you the exact figures, but if the Minister is prepared to give a week in Cork, I will give him a whole lot of them.  I ask again&mdash;What is the use of this declaration at the present day?  Its purpose is only to afford a certain spiteful satisfaction to one political Party and to compel another to bend the knee. That is the sole use of it, and that, I take it, is the sole intention of the Government at the present time in enforcing this test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any other reason that can prevail in the minds of the Government to enforce this declaration on an opposite Party.  They know in their hearts and souls that if they do compel them to bend the knee it is not going to have the slightest effect on that Party any more than if you compel a member of this Party to sign a shameful declaration out there to be loyal to George of England.  It is not going to make us any more loyal, and I think that has been recognised long ago.  Is it going to make them better servants of the State and more efficient to compel them either to starve or bend the knee?  I cannot see how it will. The only test that should be imposed for any public office is a man's efficiency and capability to do the work.  We have so many of these tests, from the <Col N="75" /> man with a spade and shovel up to the man at the head of a Department, that I am surprised at the last General Election the Government did not get a sweeping majority, considering how many individuals are depending for their daily bread on a certain political Party.  A man cannot take a spade and shovel to work on the road unless be belonged at one time to one army. Mind you, that was not the unpaid army, the volunteer army that fought the Tans.  That army was not given preferential treatment in employment. Preferential treatment was narrowed down to a political army.  The same applies to every position of trust at the present day.  I had a case a short time ago before the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and I find that you cannot get a temporary postman's job unless you are connected with a certain political Party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is relevant, because it refers to a political test and the Bill deals with a political test.  Let the Government Party take their whips off and allow members to vote freely; then we will see how many individuals here are in favour of a political test so that a man may earn his daily bread. Leave the matter to the commonsense of the whole House.  Take off the whips and let every Party vote freely. let our Party vote freely and let the matter be tested.  I throw out that challenge.  I suggest they are too much afraid that someone would kick against it.  I consider it an outrage that men who went out believing they were absolutely right, acting on the advice of some of those who put the political test there&mdash;men who fought against the British during the British occupation of this country&mdash;should be subjected to this declaration simply because they continue in the same belief and adhere to the same teachings that were taught them by some of the members opposite.  They are now to be deprived of their daily bread because they will not swallow all their political beliefs <Col N="76" /> and subscribe to the declaration.  It is an outrage and it is showing a very mean spirit among the members of the Executive Council who imposed the test.  There is no commonsense in it. If men remained in the Post Office during the Tan period and subscribed to tests I do not think that that made them anything more loyal to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bait that was held out to these men was that there would be no opposition to their getting an increase of salary if they subscribed to that test declaration. It was put up to every individual who did look for an increase of salary.  The taking of that test declaration decided whether or not a man was entitled to an increase of salary.  The signing of it decided whether he was loyal to the Government&mdash;the signing of his name to a degrading document of that kind, and it was nothing else. I hold that those who were starved out and compelled to sign that declaration were not anything more loyal to the Government because it succeeded in making them subscribe to such a declaration. They would naturally feel that they had been debased, degraded and deprived of their manhood by a test declaration, and also that they would not be any more loyal because of having to sign it, but rather they would feel that they would have satisfaction some day for being obliged to sign it.  That, I suggest, is the frame of mind that the individual would be in who had been degraded by being compelled to take this test declaration. They were degraded into doing so in order to provide the bare necessaries of life for their wives and children.  I suggest that the time has come now to have an end put to these tests and declarations and for these political distinctions between Irishmen.  It is high time that they should be brought to an end.  Is it not an outrage that men who left decent positions during the Tan period and went out to fight when there was no pay for fighting, should now be deprived of the necessaries of life unless they submit to the signing of a test declaration?  If the Government have any confidence in the justice of their <Col N="77" /> case let them take the whips off and have a straight division on this.  These political tests were definitely used for the giving of increases of salaries and promises of that description.  While these promises with regard to increases of salary were being given the people who paid the salaries and the pensions were gradually being starved out of existence.</P>

      <P>In order to preserve, to some extent at least, the sequence of this debate I think it would be well that we should recall for a moment the position with regard to this discussion at the time of the Recess.  As I remember it, Deputy MacEntee had delivered a very powerful and successful appeal to the House in order to prevent by every possible means in his power this Bill becoming law before the Recess.  In making that appeal the Deputy put before the House some powerful and cogent arguments. Let us recall what he said and the circumstances under which he spoke.  We were then within a week or two of the floating of the National Loan.  If the floating of that loan had failed, this country would have been put into a position of financial discredit if not bankruptcy.  Deputy MacEntee warned us as to what was before us if we passed this Bill.  He told us, fairly and squarely, that to-day &ldquo;this Government is in power, but that to-morrow we will be there, and that if we are there we will not honour the commitments of the previous Government.&rdquo; He hoisted once again the flag that was so useful during the last General Election, the flag upon which were emblazoned the words &ldquo;We will pay no debts.&rdquo;  For a moment he reminded me of the words of the Leader of the Opposition, or perhaps I should say one of the leaders of the Opposition, or the leader of one section of the Opposition.  He reminded me of the words of Deputy de Valera who a few weeks previously was asked: &ldquo;Will your Party, if it comes into power, honour the first National Loan?&rdquo; The answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And he was asked: &ldquo;Will your Party, if it comes into power, honour the second National Loan that is now being projected?&rdquo; and the answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  He was <Col N="78" /> asked: &ldquo;Will your Party, if it comes into power, pay as every sane man knows they would have to pay, the mortgages which are a charge on the farm of every man in Ireland for the purchase money he has borrowed?&rdquo;  and Deputy de Valera told us that question &ldquo;requires further consideration.&rdquo; We all understood, when he said that, that he was only giving to the hot-heads of his Party a line of retreat.  Now where are we and who are we?  Which party are we to believe?  Are we to follow and believe in the party led by Deputy MacEntee?  Are we to follow his section or the section of the party led by Deputy de Valera, who says &ldquo;Pay your debts,&rdquo; or are we to follow the party led by Deputy MacEntee, who says &ldquo;Do not pay your debts.&rdquo;  Which are we going to follow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KENNEDY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. What has all this to do with the Bill under consideration&mdash;the payment of debts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the position that Deputy MacEntee put before us. So that I may not misquote him, let me read his words.  He said: &ldquo;We will not accept any responsibility for the commitments entered into by the majority in this House&rdquo;&mdash;that is a plain, straightforward declaration&mdash;&ldquo;and remember that though we are in a minority we inevitably are going to be a majority to-morrow.&rdquo;  Pass the Bill, says Deputy MacEntee, and we will wreck the country.  Ireland will then become financially bankrupt within a fortnight or two and all you have got to do is to pass the Bill.  Is it any wonder that Deputy MacEntee made a strong appeal to the House not to pass the Bill before the Recess&mdash;to postpone the financial crisis until after the Recess, because bankruptcy would inevitably follow once you had floated from this House the banner emblazoned with the words &ldquo;We pay no debts here.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather disappointed with the opening address of Deputy de Valera. His argument was moderately put, as his arguments generally are.  There was very little in it to quarrel with. It was remarkable rather for what he left unsaid than for what he said.  As <Col N="79" /> one of the very few members speaking on behalf of all sides of the House, and who never, prior to coming into the Dáil, took an oath of allegiance to any king or monarch, I was anxious to hear an exposition of the new theology of which Deputy de Valera has accepted the paternity.  I thought we would have an explanation from him on this question&mdash;why, to what extent, and for what period has the operation of the Ten Commandments been suspended? Does the suspension of the operation of the Ten Commandments apply only to members of the Dáil, and why should it not be equally extended to civil servants serving under the Minister for Local Government?  What is the difference?  Yet we were told that it would be a shameful thing to ask servants of the Local Government Department to take a simple declaration, whereas the taking of an oath of allegiance by members of the Opposition was merely an empty formula. Were it not for the assistance of Deputy MacEntee we would be still in the same state of ignorance as we were before Deputy de Valera spoke, for Deputy MacEntee has assured us that the taking of this declaration by any man against his will means nothing? In the name of Heaven, why should Deputy de Valera or Deputy MacEntee keeps us here talking about nothing? If it means nothing what is the objection to it?</P>
    <P>There is a third Party in this House. There is a Party represented by Deputy Corry who tells us that he knows a number of fathers of families who are to-day suffering from want because they would not take this simple declaration.  He has suggested that the Minister for Local Government should go down to Cork and hold an inquiry. We would be very glad to see him there.  He would be always welcome there.  Deputy Corry suggested that the Minister should stay for some weeks there.  I would suggest a longer task that will keep him there for years. Let him come down and inquire into the number of sons of people who have taken the oath of allegiance and who occupy their present positions by reason of the salaries they received <Col N="80" /> having taken the oath of allegiance. The first witness I would produce for him would be Deputy Corry.  Let there be no mistake about who took the oath of allegiance.  I am not in receipt, either through myself or anybody belonging to me, of any pension.</P>

That is the inquiry I want him to hold, and I think I have got one Deputy who will be there to give some very reliable evidence.</P>

      <P>It was indeed suggested by Mr. de Valera that this was a political test, and you were told over and over again by Deputy Corry that it was a political test.  I want to make it clear beyond doubt that this is no political test.  Let there be no humbug about it.  It wants nobody but a man of ordinary intelligence, of very ordinary intelligence at that, to see that it is no political test, that it is a promise by a man to serve no political party, or no section.  It is a promise by the man to serve his employer faithfully.  It is true, apart from the fathers of the many families to whom Deputy Corry referred, that somebody from some <Col N="81" /> bench said during the debate he heard somebody who knew somebody who had heard somebody say he had known a school teacher who had taken the oath.  In other words, I take it that this Bill is to be enlarged and that the Minister for Education of the future will have to send into the country teachers who will teach the young idea how to shoot from behind hedges.  I I take it if the Opposition came into power to-morrow, my friend Deputy Corry would be the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>I was merely suggesting the effect of passing this Bill.  I believe that if it is to become law in the case of the servants of the Local Government Department, there is no logical reason why it should not also become law in the case of teachers.  My point is this, that this declaration is a promise, not made on oath, to serve your employers faithfully and to mind your job.  If any man should object to taking a declaration of that sort he is not fit for that job, whether he is a father or a son, and the sooner he is cleared out of the job the better for the job and the better for the country.  I not only suggest that this declaration should be kept in force, but that it should be more stringently enforced than it is at present.  I would suggest to the Government, taking the case of some of their officers, the case of rate collectors and others, that these officers ought not to act as Government political agents.  I think any rate collector or any other Government official who acts as a Government political agent is not carrying out the spirit of this declaration. I say that against the Government. I do not say for one moment that they have so acted with the knowledge or the cognisance of the Minister for Local Government, but it is right to say that it has been done.  Members on other benches, members on the Labour benches, and I myself, have had to complain.  My appeal to the Government would be not merely to hold to the declaration, but to see that it is <Col N="82" /> observed, and observed in a much more stringent manner than it has been hitherto.  Let a man who takes a job say: &ldquo;I will carry out my duties without fear, favour or affection.  I will not be the servant of any political party. I will be the servant of one country only, and that Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Wolfe and other Deputies who are constantly rattling the financial sabre, that if he and his friends, with all their money bags, cleared out of Ireland, the Irish nation would survive.  This playing on the crass ignorance of the populace about matters financial, and this using of the magic of the black art about money matters is coming to an end very soon, not only here, but all over the world. It was a very good imperial weapon, but it is rusty.  As to this declaration that this Bill is introduced to do away with, if the Ministry are in earnest in their various pleas for unity they will leave this to a free vote of the House and abolish it.  I do not minimise for a moment the declaration or formula that we went through in coming into this House.  It is a degrading thing&mdash; it is even more degrading than this declaration&mdash;but let them begin here and it will be a lever for the bigger thing.  We want to get King George out of this country as much as Big Bill Thompson does in Chicago, and when an Executive pledge their solemn allegiance to it, and say earnestly from platforms that an oath is an oath, and then expect from their servants through the country allegiance to them, they indirectly and deliberately get allegiance to King George.  You cannot serve two masters.  You cannot go down to Beggars Bush Barracks and tell the men secretly there that your ultimate object is a republic and that you are striving for that, and then go out and hob-nob with the big guns of Molesworth Street and dine with them and drink the health of his Majesty and pretend loyalty.  You cannot have the two things.  It is neither healthy for this nation nor good for it, and perhaps if it were done away with we would not have had the tragedy of Tim Coughlan's death and the debate we had this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> In my own county there were two Irish teachers dismissed because they would not comply with this declaration of allegiance.  We profess earnestness about the spreading of the Irish language. As long as that declaration exists these Irish classes will not be a success.  Whatever chance there was of their being a success that declaration killed them, because the teachers who took up the positions have the stigma on them of being blacklegs. The Minister for Local Government asked Deputy Corry how many have been affected.  The number is irrelevant. If it is only one or one hundred and one the fact is there of the evil of that declaration.  The effect on these Irish classes is a very real effect, and they will never be a success until that declaration goes.  The Irish taught in these classes has become known as the King's Irish, where teachers have been dismissed down in County Galway and in these two particular areas in my own county.</P>

It will be the beginning of the end.  I earnestly appeal that this should be left to a free vote of the House.  If, as has been often told us, the people are supreme, let them be supreme, and let them owe allegiance only to an Irish nation.  The matter of the referendum on the question of the oath will be a simple matter if you do away with this declaration, and you will establish that unity which is necessary for any progress to be made in this country&mdash;national unity, which does not exist at present.</P>

      <P>We introduced this Bill not in any party spirit and not for the purpose of stirring up any spirit of disunion, and not certainly in any arrogant way.  We had hopes that the spirit in which it was introduced would be reciprocated perhaps to some little <Col N="84" /> extent.  However extraordinary it would be to expect it in the light of past experience, we had hoped and expected that it would be reciprocated to some little extent in the changed conditions by some at least of the Party opposite.  However, in view of the line along which this debate has proceeded, it would seem that any hope of that must be abandoned and that we will have in this division, as we have experienced all through since we came in here, the Whips put on and the Party spirit rising above anything that may be nationally good or may make for the advancement, as we see it, of the national ideal.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government admitted in his speech at the opening of this debate that this clause was not in the original Bill, but came from the other House that some people call the Upper House, which others call an ascendency, and that we refer to here as the Senate.  Before this clause came from the Senate the Party opposite who had control of the resources and administration of Government by a <i>coup d'état</i> or otherwise&mdash;at any rate hold it by force&mdash;had been acting upon the lines and in the spirit that we see exemplified and portrayed to-day. That spirit was something that we find in the ages long past in France and other places&mdash;<i>L'état, c'est moi</i>&mdash;the State, it is I.  The people on the opposite benches by a <i>coup d'état,</i> and so forth, having succeeded in getting control of the government, having won some little military victory, started out to wipe out any possibility of opposition in the country. For months before that attempts were made to keep people from getting positions&mdash;certain people who local bodies believed were worthy of support, who even Cumann na nGaedheal bodies had believed were worthy of support.  A little body in Dublin constituted as a Government had assigned to itself the position of having all the knowledge, and because those people had shown some tendencies which did not correspond with theirs, decided that they should be denied a livelihood in their own country.  All these things led up to the introduction of this clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Looking up the debates, as already pointed out to this House and in the Senate, so far as we can see no case was made out for the inclusion of the clause.  It was not shown by reference to any details or by any particular case that they were getting control of offices such as this clause in this Act was supposed to provide for or that they were getting these positions and should be cleared out, or that they were getting in in such numbers that they might be a menace to the State. No facts of that sort were brought forward because there were no such facts.  The objective apparently was that, at that time, with depression and so on in the country, certain people holding office who might be expected to apply for the increases in their salaries or emoluments should be deprived of their rights by the Government. The tide of emigration, so far as it was flowing in regard to certain people in the country, was not flowing fast enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, in making his case, tried to emphasise the point that £1,070,000 was paid to the Local Taxation Account.  It would appear from the point of view as he expressed it, and from the point of view he tried to emphasise and to impress it upon the House, that that was a gift from the people opposite to the country.  I do not think it makes the slightest difference whether it is collected by direct or indirect taxation; it is the people's money, and whether it is collected directly from the ratepayers or is sent down to the local bodies from the Taxation Account does not make the slightest difference.  But we have to bear in mind when we hear so much about the will of the people and about the choice of the people that the local bodies are elected by the will of the people, and that those local bodies represent the will of the people more clearly than can be ascribed to the Party opposite.  In the election of those local bodies you have not the same interest taken politically by the Civic Guard and the Army, and so on, as you have at election time on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education tried to emphasise that loyalty to the State was <Col N="86" /> not loyalty to a Party.  No matter how that fact may be emphasised or repeated by the Party opposite it will not efface the effect in the country that the people opposite have got it into their heads that they are the Government, and that they are going to remain and continue as the Government, and that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is the Government of the country.  It has not been regarded otherwise, and I am afraid it cannot be regarded otherwise.  It has been said here with a good deal of insistence that there is a great difference between loyalty to the State now and the loyalty that used to be insisted on years ago.  The Minister for Education has been to some extent challenged in this debate that he encouraged teachers in the past to refuse similar political tests, and rightly so.  The particular tests in the North were opposed.  We here for a somewhat similar reason to that of the Minister for Education, who encouraged them to oppose it and to resist it as far as they could, are endeavouring as far as we can to urge this House to take the same steps and to smash and to resist this political test here.  One can understand, to some extent, the argument put forward in regard to what is described by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture as treason at one time and treason now. That is a very debatable question and raises up a very wide vista.  But I think it can be very easily disposed of if I am to follow on the lines of the Minister for Agriculture when he talks of this Constitution &ldquo;as by law established.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was an Act previous to the Treaty which, I think, also recited the phrase &ldquo;as by law established.&rdquo;  It was a Home Rule Act or something like that.  People were wise enough not to take much notice of it.  It said something about &ldquo;as by law established.&rdquo; It might have been constituted of a different personnel from the later Home Rule Act, or Treaty, which also was &ldquo;by law established&rdquo;&mdash;by British law established.  People do not understand the wonderful difference that is supposed to have arisen.  The Free State is part of the British Empire and it pays tribute to the British Empire.</P>

      <P>I know that this country is bled to the extent of six or seven millions a year.  Deputy Tierney made a long speech about this question also of loyalty.  I can understand Deputy Tierney's interest in having this clause retained.  The Deputy represented North Mayo one time, and he told a Convention in Ballina that he had thousands of applications for jobs.  Almost everyone who voted for him asked him for a job.  In fact he was asked to compound a felony and to do other things by those people who voted for him.  That was the natural result of giving out bags of coal at the election at which he was returned.  I can understand Deputy Tierney, harassed as he was that way for jobs, trying to confine the jobs to the little, narrow coterie of people who support the Party opposite.  That is understandable and reasonable.  I do not want to go into Deputy Tierney's arguments.  I do not think there is anything in them, except that I can understand the necessity he feels of keeping what little jobs there are in the country for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also made a speech in favour of the retention of the clause, but he was reminded that when this matter was before the Dáil on a former occasion he was against it.  Deputy Esmonde said he did not remember.  It <Col N="88" /> is a convenient way to forget&mdash;rather to get out of these things, and apparently if you are a while on the Government Benches, it is not very difficult to get hold of excuses.  He follows up that, and says, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; if he did vote against the retention, he made a very serious lapse.  Perhaps I should hope that as a result of the three months' adjournment, and after a bad winter he might have a serious relapse and vote against its retention. You have the position here, and I do not want to over-emphasise it or go into it in detail, by which the people on the Government Benches seem to be struck with awe at the very idea of not having all these tests and enforcing what they call loyalty to the State and confining people's activities in every possible way towards supporting or buttressing up that State.</P>
    <P>We should remember, after all, that a couple of centuries have not passed with some members opposite when an Act was on the Statute Book, as by law established, which would confer perhaps not altogether as much but some little self-government on the country, and when they were advocating resistance to it by every means possible, by whatever means suited at that time, to get it out of the way and put something better in its place.  That is what we advocate to-day; that is what we on these benches shall always advocate, by whatever means are best at the particular moment.  At the same time we have to bear in mind that the people opposite, when they were calling out for allegiance to the State, were working themselves in enlisting people into a secret organisation, even in the barracks and so on, to work for something else.  They were worthy of a place then on the Government Benches, and we find them to-day with somebody who at that particular time held an opposite view, like Deputy Cooper or somebody else, and we find all those people coming together, including Deputy Wolfe, who would only be too happy to prosecute anybody who seven or eight years ago would say that English law was not the right law and should not be obeyed and enforced.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government sees Aughrim's slopes through Khyber Pass, <Col N="89" /> but it is very difficult for the ordinary person to understand it, and difficult in a debate like this to try to get out what is the real reason if you are to get beyond a position of prejudice for the retention of that law.  There is no reason that could be adduced, no reasonable reason or excuse for its retention. It is kept there purely and simply as an example of the Government's determination to try to drive from the country and prevent their getting a living in the country, people who do not agree with them absolutely. It is the act of a Party, the act of a section of the country who think, although there are people in the country who subscribe to taxation and contribute to the administration of the country, that because they hold different views from them they have no rights in the country.  If the people on the opposite benches had been somewhat consistent, if they had always since the Free State was established shown as much interest in it as they now do openly, and if they had not tried to start I.R.B. organisations in the barracks, we would see some little force in the Minister for Local Government's statement as to the reason for this.  There can be no reason except a political one.  As I said at the beginning, we try to approach this thing dispassionately in the hope that a new and different spirit might obtain in this House and that the people opposite might be prepared to take the view, owing to the changed conditions, that there was no necessity to have these things, which appear to be relics of the disturbed period.</P>
    <P>However, that spirit does not seem to be amongst the people on the Government Benches.  If this House by a majority decides on the retention of this clause we can only hope that the country will rid itself of this test, as it rid itself in the past of other tests, imposed perhaps by different personnels but deriving their powers from very much the same sources.  This test has been imposed by a little paltry clique or faction that calls itself a Government. It is kept there purely as a Party test.  It is not loyalty to the State; it is loyalty to a Party.  It was introduced and passed because it was <Col N="90" /> known that it would affect certain people in the country at a time when the country was disturbed and when the people opposite were in the full flush and heat of having got some temporary military victory and when they thought that they were in a position to stamp out everything that represented republicanism, when they thought perhaps that the tide of the youth of the country in the direction of complete and absolute independence would be stemmed by this.  That was one of the objects of raising this barrier.  I hope that they will see in this vote that they might as well be trying to keep out the tide with a graip, that by tests, coercion, and all other methods that have been tried in the past they cannot prevent the youth and people of the country from thinking in the terms of the complete independence and unity of this country. These political tests will fail and are degrading; they should not be necessary in any country.  If we are told the country is peaceful and is acting on the will of the people and so on, if all those things are supposed to exist and the full will of the people is behind this Government, then why is it necessary to resort to these miserable methods and these British tactics which we find exemplified in this political test?  Take, for example, a man who held a certain position as a clerk to a certain council. Now under this section he was quite entitled to hold on to his position.  But if he applied for an increase of salary, no matter how long he was in it, he would be required to take this political test.  That seems illogical, and certainly seems a very peculiar thing.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any purpose will be served at this stage by going into this matter more fully, because I feel that on the Government Benches, with the Whips on, the members will vote in the machine way they have always voted and that there is no hope, with the front Government Bench having taken up the position that it is going to maintain this test and going to continue those coercionary and repressive measures, that any time I might spend in trying to urge this question would <Col N="91" /> have any effect.  I can only hope if the Whips do remain on in this particular division that the time is not distant when this clause and this repressive measure will <Col N="92" /> go the way all repressive and coercionary measures, all repressive and reactionary bodies, have gone in the past.</P>

      <P>I make my protest. I do not think it is fair to bring us here after such a long adjournment, present us with a few hours' work, and then adjourn for a week.  I think it is hardly good enough.  It is not fair to the public.  I do not say that it is not fair to Deputies.  I am just as liable and anxious to shirk work as anybody else.  That is quite true.  We are all human.  Even Deputy Professor O'Sullivan is human.  I think nobody would enjoy an extra week's holiday more than Deputy O'Sullivan.  He looks like a man who enjoys his holidays.  To be serious for a moment, we have had twelve weeks' holidays.</P>

You gentlemen are not responsible; I take it the gentlemen on the Front Benches are responsible for this, and it is not fair to those who pay.  It is not fair to those who pay all of us for doing the public work.  We are sent here to do that work, and, as the President says, there is a lot of work waiting to be done.  Why can we not do it to-morrow, the next day, and the day after?  After twelve weeks' rest from this kind of public work we ought to be in good form to tackle it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Notice was given to-day of the first readings of three Bills.  These will be in the hands of Deputies before the end of the week. Notice was also given of a number of Supplementary Estimates which will be in Deputies' hands to-morrow.  That comprises the only business for next week.  Deputies will require some time to consider those matters.  On many occasions representations were made to <Col N="95" /> me that we were putting too many things before the Dáil and that there was not sufficient time to consider them.  I am now giving due and proper consideration to the representations made.  I thought I might be complimented, but now I find that no matter what I do I am criticised.  It is the convenience of Deputies I am considering. We were prepared to go on with the business to-morrow; we were prepared to take up the Supplementary Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We had to get permission to introduce them.  I have indicated that they will be in the hands of Deputies to-morrow, and I was anxious that Deputies would have time to consider the Estimates, and that is the reason the adjournment was suggested. It usually occurs at the beginning of a Session that until the necessary permission is given by the Dáil for the introduction of Bills and Supplementary Estimates, delay is inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the only matter that seems to be troubling the President is that we have not business which the Dáil has had sufficient time to consider.  There are four motions on the Order Paper, very important motions which all of us have had at least three months to consider. It is little short of a scandal to bring Deputies from all over the country for one day and then suggest that we adjourn when there is ample business on the Paper.  Irrespective of the business which the President mentioned for next week, there is enough business to keep the House engaged for a fortnight. Two of the motions on the Paper are of great importance.  Two of them are motions distinct from the ordinary business taken in Private Deputies' time.  They are matters of public importance and they might be considered as public rather than private business. I refer to the motions regarding the Tariff Commission and Old Age Pensions. If it were that we had no business except the Estimates and the Second Readings of Bills, then there <Col N="96" /> would be nothing unreasonable in an adjournment for a week in order that Deputies would have an opportunity of considering the Bills and studying the Estimates.</P>
      <P>It is not treating the House fairly to suggest that we should now adjourn as if we had no business to do.  We have enough business on the Paper to occupy us for a fortnight at least, if justice is to be done to the subjects concerned.  I hope the House will not agree to the President's suggestion.  It is unfair.  The President cannot say he was not met by the House in a fair way when he wanted an adjournment so that his Ministers should get an opportunity of doing their Departmental business.  They have had that opportunity, and the Ministry ought now be in a position to go on with the business. I hope the House will refuse this proposal and we should consider the motions to-morrow and on other days.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the statement made by Deputy Morrissey.  There can be no suggestion that we have not had more than ample time to consider these motions on the Order Paper.  It would be of considerable benefit if we could discuss them and dispose of them before next week, when the Bills that are being introduced and the Estimates are brought forward.  I do not know if the President thinks that Deputies are so unused to work that they must get a small dose first, or whether he proposes to pay an official visit to the Isle of Man, or something like that, in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it is unfair to bring up the Deputies from the country without any previous notice as to how long they were to be kept here.  I hope that Deputy Heffernan, the Chairman of the Economy Commission, will take notice of this, and prevent Deputies from being brought up here to adjourn after one day's short sitting, notwithstanding the fact that these motions are on the Order Paper. Deputy Morrissey suggests that there should be general agreement, so that the two motions to which he refers and which are important matters should be discussed, if possible, in Government time.  They are motions of sufficient importance to the nation and to the Deputies to be discussed in public time.  I protest against the adjournment, especially in view of the President's statement, that he intends to confine these motions to Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will bear in mind the fact that we were sitting here for a considerable time in October and November before either of these motions was put down, and there was extraordinary haste to get them in before we adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy possesses a faculty for proclaiming his innocence on all occasions and also for denouncing the Government for adjourning after the first day.  But the Deputy will remember that there is a very considerable list of Supplementary Estimates, the consideration of which would be much upset by the atmosphere which is bound to result from a discussion of some of those items on the Paper.  As far as the first motion is concerned, it has to do with the Budget, and the Budget is a considerable way off.  We are not crowding out the Deputy with regard to that.  There is ample time.  I want to arrive at the point where we can have three-day sittings without interruption.  There is <Col N="98" /> a great deal of pother about adjourning after one day.  Is it not better to have two weeks, with at least three days' sitting each week, than to have two days this week, two days next week and two days the week after?  I would have considered the question of discussing the Estimates to-morrow if any representations had been made by the members of any Party during the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we not discuss other matters?  Why should we be confined to Estimates?  The President has suggested we should spend a week in considering these.  He says there was extraordinary hurry shown in putting in these motions before the adjournment. There was an extraordinary hurry in getting an adjournment in order to prevent these motions being discussed.  There are on the Paper three or four motions, quite sufficient to keep the House occupied to-morrow, and it is a piece of downright impudence on the part of the Government and downright extravagance in spending the money of this country to call us here and then leave us without work to do.  There is work to be done and we are here to do it, and if we do not do this work the responsibility rests on the Ministers.  This is deliberate, lazy extravagance.  There is no other word for it.  Though Ministers may laugh, that word will go further than their laugh.  It is deliberate, lazy extravagance to say that we, responsible business men many of us, should be called up here to contemplate the inefficiency and the ineffectiveness of this Government in getting business before the House.  Either they want to avoid discussing these questions or they want them discussed.  They should be discussed. You have here also a motion in relation to the Seanad.  The Seanad has passed a motion in relation to that to-day, and we ought to be considering that motion if we are going to be in a position to provide some means of sensibly electing the Seanad.  Evidently the Government do not want the work done.  They want this place to be a farce.  They have been trying to make it a farce for years, and they are still continuing in that.  We protest against that, and we will not allow them to make it a farce.  We are prepared to <Col N="99" /> do our work, and there is work here to be done.  If it is not done, the responsibility rests on the Front Bench of the Government.</P>

      <P>What the President has stated only emphasises the necessity for sitting to-morrow.  The fact that there is so much Government business for the House next week is all the more reason why this business, which is termed &ldquo;Private Business,&rdquo; should be taken to-morrow.  I am inclined to go a certain distance with Deputy Flinn.  I think that the President has made a poor case, and I would be inclined to say that it is an insult to the House.</P>

      <P>The President will have to recognise that you cannot hear the truth too often, and if it is necessary to keep on repeating the truth to the President for the next five years, we hope to be in a position to do so.  The President ought to treat the House fairly, and have some recognition of the fact that the House treated him and his Ministers very fairly last October.  If this motion is going to be carried by the President and his Party, I would be sorry to believe that it is an attempt to try to shelve my motion with regard to the old age pensions, but I am afraid I will have to believe that it is an attempt to shelve my motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I say I would be sorry to believe it.  This is an important motion to a lot of the people of <Col N="100" /> this country.  If the President is going to confine this motion to Private Members' time, and if the same thing is done with Deputy Lemass's motion. that means that only three and a half hours will be given to these motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, in reply to Deputy Davin, said that these motions would have to be taken in Private Members' time, if Government time was not available.  Now Government time is available this week, and why not take these motions to-morrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it will be much easier for the Government to get three days for Government business if this motion is got out of the way first? If the President is anxious to get his own business through, why waste two days this week?  The motions are there, and every member of the House has had sufficient time to consider them.  I hope that every Deputy did consider them.  There is no reason whatever why this motion should not be proceeded with to-morrow.  Most of the members are here, and let me say that most of the members of the President's own Party, once they are in Dublin, would prefer to remain over to the week-end and have these motions taken.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  I think that no case has been made out by the Government for this postponement.</P>
