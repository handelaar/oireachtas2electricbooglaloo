      <P>On the adjournment last night I was dealing with certain remarks which Deputy Lemass had made apropos of the Budget.  Inevitably there was dragged in, as we must expect always in any speech from Deputy Lemass, a complaint as to the inadequacy of the tariff on boots.  The tariff on boots can be raised as soon as the boot manufacturers <Col N="570" /> have come to the conclusion that the tariff is inadequate and can make a case that the raising of it will prevent the importation of boots or, better still, will lead to the manufacture of more boots in this country.  If the Minister for Finance wanted revenue and was careless of how he got it, the doubling of the boot tariff would be a very easy way of getting extra revenue. Undoubtedly extra revenue would come in from the raising of the boot tariff, but the raising of the tariff at this moment would be opposed by the boot manufacturers.  When people speak of the failure of that tariff, they might go a little bit deeper and somewhat more below the surface than Deputy Lemass has gone, merely with the complaint that the amount of the tariff is inadequate.  If the tariff were doubled or trebled, it would mean very little advance, say, in the next twelve months in the number of boots manufactured here, for one simple reason. that there are not sufficient skilled hands to be employed in the business at the moment.  It is a slow process getting people trained.  It is a difficulty that the boot manufacturers have come to realise, and it is one of the points that make the boot manufacturers reluctant to press for any increase in the tariff at present.  If we wanted revenue, and were careless as to the tax it was going to put on the people, it would have been very easy to get the revenue this year by doubling the tax. It would only have meant that pretty nearly the same quantity of boots that came in last year would come in this year, and that the revenue would show a very big increase from that tariff. It would be got from the people who have to buy boots brought in from outside, and who would have to buy boots from outside in the main, simply for the reason that there is not immediately any possibility of an expansion in the boot trade to meet such a demand as there would be if the tax were doubled.  The best test of whether or not the tariff is inadequate is the reluctance of the boot manufacturers to make any application to the Tariff Commission for the reconsideration of the amount of that tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee in his speech, <Col N="571" /> which was very nearly being dragged from his attache case too late to be delivered to this House, committed himself only to three points.  He made an analysis of what he called the public debt of this country, and of the moneys that have to leave the country, and committed himself to the statement that it varied from 85 to 90 per cent. of the full total that in fact was drained and that went outside.  He was challenged as to one item, as to whether or not he could place the number of holders of land stock who were in fact living in this country, and failed to give any answer, but just a simple calculation, that because money at one point seems to leave the country it inevitably is spent outside the country and never returns.  He piled up what he called the national debt of the country by talking of the capitalisation of certain items upon which interest charges are now being borne and seems to be under the misapprehension that there is no provision made in this year's Budget, or in the whole financial arrangement upon which it is founded, either for payment of the £250,000 to England, or for the meeting of the £134,000 for certain charges with regard to land annuities, apparently not having read the Estimate which has been passed by this House for the Land Commission and not having understood what were the calculations with regard to the payment of interest upon which the whole Budget was based.  We get the Land Commission annuities talked of as if they were part of the public debt of the country.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a case in that respect, why not go still further and consider the money invested in Guinness's in this country?  There are payments of interest made.  A large number of these payments go outside the country, and that is money that departs from the country.  It is not part of the public debt, and nobody ever considered it as such.  If land annuities are put in that category, why not put in the moneys paid by way of return to stockholders who hold shares in Guinness's, or any concern in the country which has outside money invested in it, and where the payments by way of interest leave the country? <Col N="572" /> Why should they not be put on the same footing as the Deputy put land annuities?  Why should they not be counted in as part of the public debt? If you count them in, we are not going to get merely a change in the amount of the public debt in this country, but a tremendous change in the amount of the public debt in every country.</P>

      <P>A motion put down by Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Deputy MacEntee has made one contribution by way of suggestion as to the reduction of the burdens which press upon this country.  He made a comparison with regard to the police, and said that in England there were so many police to every ten thousand of the population, and that <Col N="573" /> in Scotland there were so many police to every ten thousand of the population, and that here we had a huge figure of 23 police to every ten thousand of the population.  I wonder would Deputy Flinn, who is so inclined to give lessons to people on Finance, when talking to people whom he wants to put capital into this country and when he wants to impress upon them how suitably capital might be lodged in this country viewed from the three tests that it should get a return and that it should have security and be easily convertible, direct the possible investor's attention to the particular fact that Deputy MacEntee has drawn attention to&mdash;that there are in this country 23 police to every ten thousand inhabitants?  And would Deputy Flinn explain what he thinks might be the reason for that, and, again, would he explain what the security for the money lodged in this country, in order to establish industries, would be where such a situation existed as that 23 police were necessary for every ten thousand of the population?  And going beneath the surface and not merely contenting himself with the statement that there were ten or twelve or thirteen police to every ten thousand of the population in England or Scotland and 23 to every ten thousand of the population here, would not any ordinary investor who wished to come here from England or Scotland say to him, &ldquo;What is the necessity for that?&rdquo; Is it not that in England and Scotland the civil population do help the police, and that here Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Flinn belong to a Party who hold that help to and association with the police bring about odium upon people so that they are not going to help the police and that the civil population cannot be counted on as being behind the police?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let him trace the recent history of the country and see if he can give an explanation of why that is so.  Let him find out exactly why the Civic Guards cannot be reduced in numbers.  Let Deputy Flinn argue to any investor that he is a member of a Party which has stated that its particular object, or its particular objective, at any rate, <Col N="574" /> eventually was that it was going to recoup itself for certain ventures and that it had recouped itself in the past for particular ventures, in one single day, when over £100,000 was taken from banks.  Let Deputy Flinn go on and ask the investor would he have such confidence in the Party to which Deputy Flinn belongs that he would believe his money would be readily convertible if put into Irish industry. When the investor talks about the amounts invested and asks as to the communication and accessibility of particular places in which the possible industry is to be founded, let Deputy Flinn take that would-be investor and industrialist to Cork and say: &ldquo;Here is your site and location, and you have easy access to Dublin and to the rest of the country.&rdquo;  Let him bring him along to a particular bridge that forms the link between the South and the rest of the country and say to him: &ldquo;This is the main artery upon which your transport depends.&rdquo;  Again, let him get back into more recent history. After Deputy Flinn has talked to him about his Party and his Party's future, and about recouping itself for a particular adventure and what happened previously&mdash;let him say to that particular investor that upon that particular slender bridge depends your getting your goods to the rest of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>People are very anxious to reduce certain forces in this country.  Their whole anxiety is to cut the Army down and to get the Civic Guard reduced.  If there is definite co-operation and a fairly definite feeling, irrespective of what the past may have shown, if there is a definite feeling with regard to the future as to how the country is going to be run, with regard to the attitude to be taken in respect of majority government and matters of that kind, then undoubtedly the Civic Guard can be reduced, but it is not going to be reduced as long as people who are in prominent positions in a certain party can give a lead and really set a standard towards demoralisation among the ordinary civil population.  There are certain people who can be blamed&mdash;I am not speaking in regard to the past but in regard to the future&mdash;for the Civic Guard having to be retained at a certain strength so long as a certain attitude of mind remains and is fostered in this country. Deputy de Valera thinks that it is very <Col N="576" /> hard to get a clear picture of the financial situation from what the Minister has said and he incidentally thinks that the Budget statement ought to contain a full statement as to local taxation, so that people would get a true picture of the burden which the ordinary citizen has to shoulder.  We are not budgeting for local taxation. Provision is being made here for charges that fall on the central Government and if people want to get a true picture of the situation there are ways and means of getting figures with regard to local taxation.  Deputy de Valera talks about the Budget not being balanced and says it has not been for a number of years.  We get certain total figures and the Deputy expresses a certain belief.  It is belief which sways the Fianna Fáil Party, not argument, conviction but no argument, no figures, no reasons adduced by which we can test the belief and the statement that the Budget has not been balanced by a figure of £721,000, of £357,000, and of £97,000 last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not made explicitly with regard to statements made here, and I withdraw it even in regard to implication or any explicit allusion made here.  We are simply told that the Budget has not been balanced.  There are a great many people who set themselves up as purists in the matter of finance and who agitate themselves about Budget periods. The business men in this State, who at any rate have some appreciation of finance and what sound finance is, have sent deputations to the Minister for Finance year after year and on pretty well every occasion urged him to do what he did do&mdash;namely, pick out and segregate normal from abnormal items, and to see that certain things were going to be met out of ordinary revenue and that other things were going to be funded.  There are people who examined these figures and who stated to the public by means of letters to the Press what their analysis of the financial situation in the country year after year has been.  They have published figures on which they have been able to be examined and on which they found a certain reputation.  These people, putting their cards on the table, have come to the Minister for Finance year after year representing some of the biggest financial interests in the country and asking for certain things, which really required no asking for, because the Minister was ready to do them on his own.  There was, at any rate, that agreement of various minds that there was a suitable thing to be done for this country.  We need not particularise in regard to this country, as it is suitable for any country that abnormal items should be segregated from normal ones.  I could understand people saying that a particular item or items should not be regarded as abnormal and that some arguments could be founded on figures given, but a mere statement that Deputy de Valera <Col N="578" /> finds it difficult to understand that the Budget has been balanced is thrown at this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got to certain points of detail.  He gave us as a guarantee his word and his belief that certain reductions could be effected.  It is a very meagre sort of guarantee we have from the Deputy.  It is not one upon which anybody could proceed to act.  We got statements about the Army and the Civic Guard with which I have dealt. Then we got the statement that there could be a saving, I think of half a million, by a reorganisation of the Civil Service and, having stated that, the Deputy believed that the point was established when he simply said, in regard to the Education Department, that there were three branches and that each of them was organised on the lines of four separate divisions.  Then we had the inevitable thing which we must expect from Deputy de Valera.  After making a few statements he proceeded <Col N="579" /> to say: &ldquo;Surely reorganisation would bring about economy.&rdquo;  Apparently, the Education Department is one which the Deputy has studied with some detail.  He has gone into it and has means of knowing something about it, but we should have heard from him where reorganisation was possible Instead of simply saying that there are three branches in that Department with four divisions in each, he should have taken each section, primary, secondary, and technical and shown how re-organisation could be effected.  There could be various kinds of reorganisations, but he should have shown which kind would lead to certain work being done at the lowest cost.  Was that done?  No.  He finished with that simple statement.  In Deputy de Valera's mind, and I think it is shared by every national school teacher, there is too much inspection.  I wonder do they speak from the same point of view?  Inspection should be cut down. Inspection can be abolished if this House likes to substitute another system.</P>

      <P>I was asked why I was keeping silent on this debate.  I explained that there was very little to answer.  Deputy Lemass seemed to insist that there should be a speech from this side.  I took notes of everything that Deputy de Valera said, and I have notes under 28 paragraphs.  I agree now that my speech might as well not have been delivered or Deputy de Valera's might not have been delivered, but since one was delivered it seems to be demanded that there should be an answer.  I thought I might as well just show up how ineffective the comments were that had been passed in this House.  Deputy de Valera does not often break the silence of this House.</P>

      <P>I agree that Deputy de Valera had not much to say on economies.  He could not point to very much economy and he indicated why.  &ldquo;Because we have not access to Departments, we do not know the working of them, we are only speaking from a surface knowledge.&rdquo;  That is what is called criticism of the Budget.  When the leader of the second largest political Party in the State breaks a silence of many months and concentrates upon this particular thing, he takes away any good in any statement he <Col N="581" /> makes by saying, &ldquo;Remember, in these things we speak only from surface knowledge.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not question the honesty of it, but I question whether there is any effective criticism to be answered when we are only to answer that statement&mdash;speaking only with a surface knowledge of Departments. The Deputy says that he believes that the Department of Education is over-organised, that it is divided into water-tight compartments run on a particular line, and that he believes that economies can be effected by amalgamation. The Deputy does know something about the system of education. The Deputy has had experience of it.  That can be taken as a test case. If the Deputy can make his case on that one point, it would certainly lead people to have much more belief with regard to his statements about other Departments&mdash;if he takes the one thing in which he has experience, analyses it, and shows that there is a waste of even £5,000, but that has not been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The man in the street has no information.  If the matter had been couched in this way, if in the matter of the Civil Service Deputy Lemass had thought of a debate couched in a definite way, one could have dealt definitely with it.  If Deputy Lemass, without making any statement of belief, said that a number of these servants were unnecessary or <Col N="582" /> incapable then surely there would be some case for the Government seeing that the Service does not grow to abnormal proportions.  That would be something to answer but Deputy Lemass has just stated that a half a million can be saved on the reorganisation of this service without giving any proof of that.  Deputy de Valera does not say that an examination might reveal that economies could be made.  He is simply satisfied with a statement that economies can be made.  He speaks of a figure of half a million to be saved by the reorganisation of the Civil Service and having put up that profound statement leaves it for other people here to answer and to show that half a million cannot be saved.  We are told that £4,000 or £5,000 might be saved on the Department of the President.  That at any rate, was a small Department that could have been tackled even on the Budget statement, but we got no information as to how that £4,000 or £5,000 economy might be effected.</P>

      <P>I hope that there will be much more information given when the Estimates are under discussion. We are then simply told that we should proceed to cut down charges by way of taxation on the people because we are to believe from the Deputy's statement that when the Estimates come along his Party are going to show economies of £800,000 on the Army, £500,000 on the Police, half a million in the re-organisation of the Civil Service and £4,000 on the Department of the President.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken cannot apparently recognise two different types of argument.  To say that economies can be effected and to say, as Deputy de Valera says, that there is wasteful expenditure, is one thing.  To say that there is expenditure, no matter how useful, which is a luxury expenditure, in the position in which this State finds itself, is a totally different thing.  We have not that <Col N="583" /> argument put up except in one case, and that was with regard to the case of the Governor-General.  For the rest it has been said that there has been wasteful expenditure and we are apparently asked to provide taxation, less than what the Minister wants, to reduce it by a certain amount in the belief and in the hope that when we come to the Estimates Deputies on the other side will be able to show the reduction of which they have spoken.  I am not sure if the Deputy suggested a tax on patent medicines.  Deputy Lemass did afterwards.  Again we had the sort of comment that is getting far too common in this House, that because a Deputy thinks he knows one or two types of patent medicines that are harmful to the people, the health of the community would be benefited by prohibiting patent medicines generally.</P>
      <P>I wonder would he have the backing of the medical profession for that statement?  Would he have the backing of the medical profession for the statement, as he put it, that it was really the duty of the Minister for Local Government to see that patent medicines did not come into the country? Would he get the backing of the medical profession?  Has he inquired on that point from the medical profession or from members of it?  Has he a statement that it would be for the benefit of the health of the community if patent medicines, as such, were prohibited from entering the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera is very anxious about the Department of External Affairs.  He is particularly anxious about the position of our representatives in Washington.  He draws the conclusion that because the Department of External Affairs, as he has himself said, has been handed over to the Department of Trade and Commerce, that was an indication that the future representatives abroad were only going to be of the trade type.  The Department of External Affairs has not been handed over to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There is a separate Department of External Affairs, and it is a Department which is going to expand, and it is going to expand more definitely on the external affairs side proper than on the trade <Col N="584" /> representative side.  If the representatives who are appointed abroad in future meet with the same success that the present Minister at Washington has met with, then I shall have no hesitation year after year in asking the Dáil for big sums of money for the Department.</P>
    <P>I can quite realise Deputy de Valera's annoyance over the appointment of the Ambassador at Washington. The people in America have had certain points put to them for many years past.  The people in America have not had the eye-opening that the people in Ireland got recently, when they saw what a dazzlingly conspicuous failure Deputy de Valera can be when he came into a place where he could be argued against and where all the theories which he had been promulgating for years past could be dissipated when he would be faced by concrete arguments.</P>

      <P>That statement was made very definitely, and Deputy Boland must realise that the Minister is entitled to give his views about it.  There was a point of order raised.  The Minister is in order.  On a previous occasion I mentioned to <Col N="586" /> Deputies that I hoped when a Deputy on this side of the House was imitating a particular procedure adopted by a Deputy on my right, that he would be listened to in silence.  I think he ought to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement was made that the Embassy at Washington was an appanage of the British Government.  Why did not Deputy de Valera give us one single instance in the whole history of the Embassy at Washington in which it could be shown that there was an Irish point of view that was not adopted; in which it could be shown if there was a time or an incident or an event in which the Ambassador at Washington was coerced by anybody not under the control of this State?  Could Deputy de Valera give any incident or any series of incidents to show that the Ambassador has acted otherwise than on instructions received from home, and when instructions from home went out that those were based purely on what the people of this country thought, and what the people of this country desired?  Before charges are flung about in this casual manner we should have some evidence produced instead of merely having Deputy de Valera, because he is hurt in his monumental vanity, coming home here and proceeding to insult the hard work of a very able representative abroad, simply because that representative is really dissipating a certain amount of the stories which Deputy de Valera and his people had, with some success until recently, attempted to spread in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can imagine Deputy de Valera is angry and annoyed, but one would have thought that the anger and annoyance would not have shown itself, and would not be revealed here in the form of a childish display of temper, without some evidence being given in support of a very grave statement made against a representative of this State&mdash; that he was merely an appanage of the British Empire in Washington.  There was not one item of evidence given. Deputies are merely astonished at being asked for evidence.  That is what I call the superiority complex.  Certain people imagine they can say things: Deputy Lemass is convinced of one <Col N="587" /> thing; Deputy de Valera believes another thing.  Deputy de Valera states, I suppose from looking into his own heart, that the whole world knows that the Ambassador is only an appanage.</P>

      <P>The Deputy apparently thinks it is not a fair thing to be asked to give evidence for a statement even if it is rather defamatory to certain officers, certain individuals of this State, and defamatory in the long run to the State itself.  But Deputy de Valera rises superior in his vanity to all these considerations; he believes, he thinks, he is of opinion, that a certain man is doing wrong. That statement can be made, and there is going to be no evidence given or no evidence produced.  There is nothing upon which anybody can be led to believe that that statement was made with any evidence behind it, that the statement was, in other words, an honest one.  There are reasons known to everybody why Deputy de Valera <Col N="588" /> should be annoyed with the mere establishment of the office at Washington. But we should not have that sort of statement made about that Embassy at Washington or about any other office or appointment made here unless we get some item of evidence to support that particular type of statement made. Deputy Flinn lectured us in his usual way on finance yesterday.  But he prefaced it with what I would like to characterise as a very unworthy comment. He opened up with a statement that the alignment of a certain individual who belongs to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party had been widely advertised through the country and that there was going to be a division in the future between the sort of natives like Deputy Flinn, the Irish natives, and the Cromwellians, the Neo-Cromwellians, and the Seonin-Cromwellians.

      <P>I would like to make a few observations on some of the speeches that have been made on this particular subject.  As Deputy Lemass remarked, we have listened for the last few years to much talk about the upward curves and about the turning of corners.  As Deputy Lemass remarked, the curve has been flattened out, but the corners evidently still remain, and in the statement made by the Minister for Finance, it was perfectly obvious that the Minister now has turned the corner and found himself in a cul-de-sac. He is in a blind alley, with the bog under his feet, and he does not know how to get out of it again.  In Ireland the various members of the Government made the same statement repeatedly&mdash;that this country had turned the corner, and I remember reading that Deputy Esmonde across in England made the same statement, that we had turned the corner.  Of course, the President, not to be beaten, went across to America, after, I suppose, eating a few American apples to get the proper blas, and he told the American people that we had turned the corner.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was talking about what the American people thought of us.  And I wondered, after all this talk about corners, what the American people did think of us.  I can picture the American people thinking that we, or rather that the Government <Col N="590" /> of the Free State, was a sort of futurist painting, that one would not know whether it was a sunset or a fried egg. Again I can picture them thinking that it was something like a geometrical proposition, like the fifth proposition of the first book of Euclid, known as the &ldquo;Pons Asinorum.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Deputy Gorey came along yesterday with the usual Edison-Bell records. He wanted to know could the Fianna Fáil Party give any specific case where there could be reductions made in the cost of Government.  He must have been coming along like Rip Van Winkle because, extraordinary to relate, Deputy Davin rose in his might afterwards, and pointed out that Deputy de Valera had actually given specific cases where expenditure might be reduced.  Deputy Davin pointed that Deputy de Valera had said that there might be a reduction of £800,000 in the Army.  Evidently the only objection that Deputy Davin had to a reduction in the Army was that he was afraid there might be 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000 men thrown on the labour market. Now I do not see Deputy Davin getting very excited over the people throughout the country who are going away week after week, people who have no jobs.  He did not say that the Government should subsidise those people by giving them £1, £2, or £3 a week in order to remain in the country.  To show what depth there actually is in Deputy Davin, let me take the figures as given for the Army.  At a flat rate for 12,000 men, and that I understand is the number in the Free State Army, £3 per week for each of them would cost the country in a year £1,872,000. That is as near the amount expended on the Army as to amount to no matter. That means that the Free State is actually expending £3 per week per man for every man in the Free State Army.  Supposing we were to reduce the Army by 6,000 we should take those 6,000 men out of the Army and that £3 a week that is being paid to them, and we should put them into some employment that would be productive and that would give work in the future to somebody else.  We could take £1 a week off the £3 a week and not alone could be employ these 6,000, but 3,000 men in addition.  We <Col N="591" /> could employ 9,000 men in forestry, in drainage and in maintaining the boreen to Deputy Jasper Wolfe's backdoor or even we could put them making shamrock shovels.</P>
    <P>Can Deputy Davin explain to me by what argument he can convince 3,000 workers of this country that they are far better off starving than they would be if they were earning £2 per week in productive work?  Supposing I was to walk around the highways and byeways of the country and I was to gather along 3,000 out of the 90,000 unemployed and say to them that Deputy Davin is afraid to take these men out of the Army because he is afraid if he does so, they will be thrown on the labour market but if we take 6,000 men out of the Army, 3,000 men can get £2 a week each in productive work.  By what argument would Deputy Davin convince these 3,000 men that they are far better off starving?  Again Deputy Davin referred to the Party on these benches and he spoke of our attitude towards the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>He said we wanted a speeding up, and that if we wanted a speeding up it would cost more money, because there would have to be an addition to the staff.  Let us examine Deputy Davin's logic.  In another portion of his speech he spoke of the railways and the buses. I hold no brief for either the railways or the buses.  I am merely taking the argument he used to use against him.  He told us that in consequence of the bus traffic there were 3,000 unemployed on the railways, whereas only 1,000 men are employed on the buses.  Now we have to take it for granted that people are not going to fall on a man's neck and kill the fatted calf merely because he owns a bus.  They will travel by bus because they are getting value for their money.  We will suppose that.  The buses must be more efficient in some way if they are able to do all that damage to the railways.  With efficiency we are able, from that argument of the Deputy, to reduce 3,000 men to 1,000; where formerly there were 3,000 there are now only 1,000, merely because there is a more efficient service. Where, then, does the Deputy's argument come in, that if we are going to <Col N="592" /> make the Land Commission more efficient it would require a bigger staff? That is the sort of dope we have been listening to for a long time.</P>

      <P>I had an idea when I saw the Minister for Industry and Commerce getting up to speak that there was not very much argument on the part of the Government for their Budget, and that they wanted a little abuse to enter into the debate.  Certainly the Minister succeeded in entering into the debate in as abusive a spirit as possible.  The Minister asked what right had we to say anything about the civil servants of this country, and he went on to give an example to Deputy Lemass.  He said if he were to go to Deputy Lemass' business place and say that some economies could be effected, that some members of the staff were slacking, that something would have to be done, probably Deputy Lemass would not be satisfied. I cannot see any analogy between the two cases.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has no right whatever to interfere in the private business of Deputy Lemass.  That is Deputy Lemass' own business, and he is paying for it or losing on it, as the case may be, but to try to give the impression that the Ministry and the Party <Col N="593" /> behind them own the Civil Service of this country is going a bit too far.  We hold that we are here on behalf of the people and that we have a right to criticise the Civil Service if, as is generally believed, the numbers are too high and that a number of them are overpaid.  It cannot be held by any Minister in any country that he owns the Civil Service and that nobody else has any right to criticise the actions of civil servants.  We come here more or less in the capacity of directors of a company on behalf of the shareholders, and if the people of the country, who are the shareholders, say that the burden is pressing too heavily on them for the running of this country, it is our business to come here and try to relieve that burden.  If we do not do that we are not representing the people as they want us to represent them.  If we come along and say that we believe that the Civil Service is an undue burden on the country, that the numbers are too many and the salaries too high, I think we are within our right in voicing these opinions if, as they have, the people have given us the mandate to come here to try to cut down the expenses of running the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce went on to deal with the question of land annuities and tried to draw a parallel between land annuities and shares in, say, Guinness's brewery. There was never any question that, say, the shares in Guinness's brewery should be interfered with in any way between the two Governments but there was a question, again and again, between the two Governments with regard to land annuities, which is a very different question and one that we have the right to deal with and discuss if we are in order in doing so.  But to deal with a matter like the shares in Guinness's leaving this country and going to English shareholders is none of our business, as long as the law remains as it is with regard to companies. The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows well that in the 1920 Act land annuities were mentioned and the fact&mdash;I do not want to go into the question now&mdash;that they were mentioned in an Act which concerned the Government of this country should be <Col N="594" /> sufficient justification at any rate to differentiate these payments from other payments, such as shares in private or public companies.  To try to shelve the argument about land annuities by saying that we should also go on to deal with shares in companies such as Guinness's is silly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce went on to say that Deputy de Valera spoke of not balancing the National Budget, and that he gave no figures and no proof.  My recollection is that Deputy de Valera did give figures.  I do not see how the proof could be given unless he were to take these Finance Accounts of Saorstát Eireann for instance, read out the figures of normal income on the one side and normal expenditure on the other side, ask Deputies to tot them up for themselves, and then they would see that the Budget was not balanced. If any Deputy was to do that, if he took the Finance Accounts for 1926-27, pages 4 and 5, added up the normal receipts on one side and the normal expenditure on the other side, he would see that the Budget was not balanced to the extent of £1,731,000.  What proof does the Minister for Industry and Commerce want?  Does he want Deputy de Valera to give the figure by which the Budget was not balanced?  Does the Minister want him, at the same time, to put down figures on one side and another, and have a copy sent across to the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  I do not see what else he could do.  Deputy de Valera could not give further proof than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to speak of patent medicines and asked if Deputy Lemass had the support of the medical profession in his plea for a tax on patent medicines.  I am not sure what way the medical profession stands generally on this question but I know that some years ago a British Medical Association&mdash;I am not sure what body, but some authoritative body of the medical men in England&mdash;went to the trouble of having various patent medicines analysed, having the analysis published, and having various varieties of patent medicines condemned, as far as they possibly could do so.  Personally I have been asked by a member of the Pharmaceutical Society in this <Col N="595" /> country to try to have this question raised in this House at an appropriate time.  That is all I can say for the medical profession, as I am not a very prominent member of the profession myself, and I do not want to give any opinion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Budget, there was one item in which I thought I was going to be interested, but it did not turn out as I expected, and that was with regard to the Corporation Profits Tax on foreign companies.  I thought the Minister was going to try by some means to get companies to register in this country, as far as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one item that I might mention on which I have got some information, and that is with regard to the stamps which are used on insurance policies.  I find in these Finance Accounts to which I have already referred that the amount received by the Exchequer for stamps used on insurance policies in this country for that year was only £2,400.  As far as I know from figures supplied from other sources, that would represent only about 8 or 9 per cent. of the total amount of insurance business done in this country.  So that you have the position of big companies in England taking the money out of this country for investment abroad and in British securities, and in other ways helping foreign countries; but in addition to that you have them getting their policies stamped in London, Glasgow, or wherever their headquarters may be, and sending them back not bearing the Free State stamp, and the Free State Exchequer is a loser to that extent.  The only other matter in the Budget in which I was interested in particular was with regard to this tax on imported motors and motor parts, but the Minister for Finance, I think, undertook to reconsider the tax on motor tractors, and we shall await that reconsideration.</P>

      <P>I was surprised and disappointed last night at the statement made by Deputy Lemass with reference to the Irish Glass Bottle Company, which is in the constituency which both of us have the honour to represent&mdash;Dublin South City.  I would suggest to the House that half truths <Col N="596" /> are very much worse than the other thing which, under the rules of Order, we are not allowed to give an emphatic name to in this House.  Deputy Lemass, if I am quoting him correctly, said that they asked £12,500 for an asset that cost them £5,000.  That is not even a half truth.  The facts are that the Irish Glass Bottle Company took over the interests of the Ringsend Bottle Company for £5,000 cash&mdash;there the truth ceases&mdash;and £7,826 in shares, a total consideration of £12,826.  Further than that, it is within my personal knowledge that they had immediately to incur a serious capital outlay in order to get the factory started.  So that the figures, which I am sure Deputy Lemass took in good faith, are about as far from the mark as it would be possible for a person to put them.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the Irish Glass Bottle Company.  If I did not make myself clear I will again go through what I have said.  Deputy Lemass made an attack in this House on the action of the Irish Glass Bottle Company, which is in the constituency we both represent.  Am I still right? It does not matter very much, because I know that I am right.  The assets involved in the Ringsend Bottle Company, not the Irishtown Bottle Company, to which Deputy Lemass referred, but of which I never heard <Col N="597" /> before, are considerably over £20,000, so that his figures are a long way out. Deputy Lemass proceeded to discuss the question of unemployment amongst the bottle-makers, which every Deputy deplores, but in his discussion he wandered into fields of employment in which the bottle-makers in either the Irish Glass Bottle Company or the Ringsend Bottle Company never worked.  He started off by mentioning ink bottles.  I have over twenty-five years' knowledge, some of them of fairly intimate knowledge, of this trade, and I never in that time saw an ink bottle made in either of these factories, nor are they ever likely to be made.  Never in my time was an ink bottle made by a bottle-maker.  I can take Deputy Lemass, and any other Deputy who is interested in the matter, through the history of the bottle trade.</P>

Unfortunately, I am not able to answer at the moment the point that Deputy Lemass makes, but I propose to take the opportunity this afternoon of seeing the ink bottle. I take it that it was made by the Irish Glass Bottle Company or by the Ringsend factory.</P>

      <P>About ten or fifteen years ago a crib bottle manufactory existed in Ringsend, but as far as I know there have been no crib bottles made in Ringsend for the last fifteen years.  Ringsend was the only place where such small bottles could possibly be manufactured economically. The crib bottle trade is easily distinguished from the ordinary bottle trade by the fact that, in the case of the ordinary bottle trade, the bottles are made from a large continuous glass furnace which is heated from the top.  The crib bottle, on the other hand, is made from a pot externally heated, and the machinery required does not involve an enormous capital outlay.  Deputy Lemass saw both classes of bottles in the Ringsend factory and the factory of the Irish Glass Bottle Company. Subsequently, the crib bottle trade was run in Church Street, Dublin, but it has not been in existence for many years.  Deputy Lemass brought before the House a proclamation addressed to all whom it might concern, which was issued by three alleged Scotchmen named Fulham, Bohm and Hughes.  I do not know whether my mouth was open when I heard those names, but I was amazed when I heard three Scotchmen bearing those names quoted in this House as being reliable in this matter.</P>
      <P>It is very unfortunate that a document of that sort which, to my mind, to say the least of it, was very doubtful, if not somewhat fishy, should be brought before the House at a time when the subject of it is to be discussed between the receivers of these two companies and the men involved, including Hughes, Fulham and Bohm, to-morrow morning at 12 o'clock.  I do not see what good could possibly come of introducing such a subject here.  As regards the nationality of these three gentlemen, who, I understand, come from Galloway, in Scotland, I can assure the Deputy that in at least one case he was very far from the mark and was mistaken as to the reliability of the information likely to come from that source.  These gentlemen have made certain statements.  They were brought over to work a phosphorous machine for the manufacture of bottles to be used in the mineral water trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> They made a large quantity of bottles on that machine.  Might I ask Deputy Lemass, if he has any further interest in the matter, to discover what became of those bottles that these men were paid wages for making?  I think he will find, if he makes as careful an investigation as I did, that not one of the bottles they made has ever been sold or was saleable.</P>
    <P>An attack was made in this proclamation on a gentleman for whom I have very great respect.  He is a man who works very hard.  Notwithstanding the fact that he only got to bed at 4 o'clock this morning, I saw him at a very early hour to-day, and put some of these facts before him for the purpose of getting information for the House.  This gentleman asked the directors to arrange to get over experts to work this machine and, unfortunately as far as the directors are concerned, the effort resulted in the getting of these three gentlemen. This gentleman has been attacked, and is defending himself before the receivers to-morrow.  It is a matter that is within my own personal knowledge that this man works day and night for the good of the industry in Ringsend. I wish to give a direct negative, I will not use a stronger term, to the statement that he is a person who would take action such as that suggested in the proclamation read by Deputy Lemass to the House.  He has done everything for industries in Ringsend district.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, the purport of my remarks was to show that there were taking place in the factory and between the receivers and the glass bottle makers incidents of such a nature as to arouse suspicion in everyone's mind as to whether or not the best interests of the industry in Ireland were being served by either party.  Before a remission of the duty was given, there should have been a full investigation of the whole circumstances by a competent body.  Again, may I dispute with Deputy Beckett the location of the factory.  Either on my own behalf, or on behalf of other people, I have been engaged in nine or ten contested elections in that constituency, and I can say that neither <Col N="600" /> factory is in my constituency.  They are both in the County Dublin.</P>

      <P>The debate which we have just listened to on this Budget and the criticisms on it that have been offered from all sides of the House, prove how difficult this Budget is to criticise.  Before I enter on any criticism of this Budget I desire to refer to some remarks made by Deputy Lemass last evening in the course of a rather long and barren speech in which he did not throw much light on the Budget.  In the course of his speech, he had a tilt at the Independent members, and said that the only Independent member in the House was Deputy Gorey and that all the others were elected under false pretences.  I am not very long a member of the House.  I have been here only since last June.  If my recollection serves me, between June and August last, members who are now in the House were holding forth on Burgh Quay against the Oath.

      <P>That is a fair conclusion from your argument.  I have voted against the Government, and I also voted against a change of Government on a particular occasion.  Perhaps that is what Deputy Lemass has in <Col N="601" /> mind.  Coming to the Budget, I think the Budget, to say the least of it, shows a lack of imagination on the part of the Minister, and in some respects a lack of proper appreciation of the economic conditions of the country.  It has really no outstanding features.  We have the McKenna duties on commercial motors and tyres.  I have no great knowledge of the motor business, except that since the Budget was introduced my information is that the duties on commercial chasses will not yield very much revenue, as the country has at present in stock a sufficient number of chasses to meet the requirements for about twelve months.  I do not know whether or not that is due to intelligent anticipation on the part of the motor trade, but I believe it is a fact. The total amount, that is £200,000, may not be yielded in this case.  The Minister says that the tax on telegrams is one that will not hurt anybody.  He has definitely stated that telegrams are only sent by the racing fraternity or by those who send congratulatory messages. I do not agree with that, but I think there have not been many one and sixpences spent on telegrams to the Minister congratulating him on his Budget.  This extra sixpence on telegrams will hit a section of the community who are of great help to the agricultural industry.  Nearly all business in the buying line in markets and fairs in Ireland is conducted by wire.  Representatives of firms, buyers at fairs and markets, are advised by wire what to do and they advise their principals by wire of what they have done.  Anyone who knows anything, and I think some Ministers do not know much, about the way business is conducted in rural Ireland knows that telegrams enter largely into the transactions at fairs and markets.  If this additional impost is put on there is no doubt that the extra sixpence, insignificant as it may appear, will be paid by the farmers from whom produce will be purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sugar, I am sorry the Minister did not discover a better method for finding that £200,000&mdash;in fact it is £150,000&mdash;for the purpose of meeting the increase in the old age pensions than by putting an extra charge on sugar.  I believe had he <Col N="602" /> searched he might have found a better way.  His excuse for putting £200,000 extra on such an important food as sugar is to my mind a very flimsy one. It is put on simply and solely because there is 1d. on it at present, and his argument is that it will cost just the same to collect the 1¼d. as the 1d.  If I were asked to decide between putting the tax on sugar or of giving the increase in the old age pension, I would vote for the tax, as I think the extra shilling in the old age pension is more beneficial to the people generally. Having regard to the manner in which the Minister has cribbed and scraped to balance his Budget, I think he could have cribbed and scraped by other methods to get this £200,000 without putting a tax on sugar.  As an instance of the way in which the Minister strained himself to get his Budget to balance, we have first of all a reduction of credits to the brewers.  That is supposed to yield £300,000.  I do not know whether that is good finance or not, but I do not think it is, for it means taking something from next year in order to make this year's Budget balance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flinn says &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; and let me say I admired one statement by Deputy Flinn, and that is that in budgeting we should keep a generation in mind, and not merely cheesepare to cover the exigencies of this year and leave next year to take care of itself.  The reduction of credit to brewers may seem a small thing.  I am not in touch with the brewing industry, but to my mind the effect of this reduction of credits will, in the case of the smaller brewers, necessitate practically 33 per cent. extra capital.  That extra capital will have to be provided by brewers if their credit is to be curtailed to two instead of three months.  It means we are cribbing a little bit out of next year's Budget in order to balance this year's Budget.  Arrears of income tax are supposed to yield £250,000.  That is a problematical figure, and it may or may not be realised.  Coming to reliefs, we have a relief in taxation of £9,000 as regards racing.  We hear a lot about that £9,000, how the racecourses <Col N="603" /> will benefit by the remission of the tax, and how horse-breeding is supposed to be encouraged as a consequence. I do not think that anyone with commonsense could, by any flight of imagination, suppose that this £9,000 is going to be of any benefit to horse-racing.  It is purely a remitted tax, because if not remitted it would go down to vanishing point, and there would be no return from it next year. I think it was Deputy Shaw who pointed out that the remission of the £9,000 is not going to help in the direction of encouraging horse-breeding. Deputy Beckett made a long speech on the subject of bottles.  I know nothing about bottles, but I do know something about the contents of some of them. On medicine bottles it would appear that the tax is going to be remitted by £12,000.  That is due to the fact that we rushed into tariffs, tariffs that we knew nothing about, tariffs that the Government knew nothing about, as is admitted.  We put a tariff on all glass bottles, and we found that the people whom we wanted to benefit by the tariff asked us to take it off, as they were not making these bottles, and that they would never be able to make them.</P>
      <P>The same applies to a great many other tariffs already put on.  I suppose, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us, if we double or treble the tariff on boots we still will not be able to produce any more boots in the country, as we have not the experts and the skilled hands necessary. I will go further and say that whether it is that we have not the skilled hands, or that we cannot compete with outsiders, the boot tax to my mind has only inflicted a hardship on the purchasing public and has been of no benefit to the boot industry and to employment in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another phase of the Budget which I do not like, and that is, that after taking some of the money that is not due until next year to make up this year's Budget, by curtailing the credit of brewers and by other methods, we resort to borrowing.  The Minister's argument with regard to the sums to be borrowed is rather thin, <Col N="604" /> to say the least of it.  I cannot understand why it is good finance to borrow £300,000, as portion of the estimated Army expenditure, and say that that is a legitimate way to deal with the Budget, and that we must raise the remaining £1,500,000.  If it is sound finance to borrow £300,000 in anticipation of the fact that the Army in the future is only going to cost £1,500,000, it should be also good finance to borrow £800,000 for the purpose and wipe out the sugar tax.  That could be done just as easily.</P>
    <P>There are other items in connection with which we are supposed to borrow that I will deal with later, but one of the things we are to borrow for is to pay for the shares that the Government have subscribed for the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That, to my mind, is the most extraordinary admission that the Minister for Finance can make&mdash;that the State has to go to a bank or somewhere else to borrow the money to subscribe for the shares that are supposed to give credit to agriculture.  The Minister has stated that we must be careful in our criticism of Budget statements, that we must be careful in everything we say, because we are not financing our own domestic affairs, that we have gone outside to get money from the stranger, so to speak.  We have got money in America for our loan.  Hence we must be exceedingly careful in dealing with our Budget and the items in it. What greater reflection could be cast upon the State than the fact that we cannot raise £300,000 to finance the credit of the farmers, who constitute 80 per cent. of the community; that we have to admit failure on that head, that we have to bring that item into our Budget and say that we have to borrow from the banks who have already subscribed&mdash;who have been coerced I may say to subscribe&mdash; £200,000 for the same purpose?  To my mind that shows that the country is not properly financed.  It shows, as this Budget disclosed, that the principal industry in the country is not alone forgotten in the Budget, but in every debate which takes place here.</P>
    <P>What must be the effect of this borrowing of £225,000 for agricultural <Col N="605" /> credit?  What is the history of it?  The Agricultural Credit Act was passed about this time last year.  It was passed before the June election, and should have been in operation before the September election.  It was used in the June election, I will say, as a bait to get votes.  The agricultural community were told of the benefits that were to come from this.  They were told about it again during the September election. The Corporation was to be registered in September.  It was formally registered, but a penny has not gone to the farmers from it yet.</P>

      <P>The fact is that there is no money to finance it.  Why? I solemnly declare that that Act was passed in order to be a failure&mdash; deliberately arranged to be a failure. Why do I say that?  First of all, we have the fact that it is nearly twelve months on the Statute Book. Secondly, we have the fact that there have been two general elections since the Act was passed.  We have the extraordinary delay in putting it into force&mdash;indecent delay, stupid delay, perhaps deliberate delay, showing that the agricultural community are not worth consideration.  But we have a still more extraordinary thing.  The banks have reserved to them under this Act £200,000 worth of shares, which it was optional for them to subscribe for or otherwise.  If they did not subscribe, the Government had to come in and subscribe the full £500,000 capital.  On top of that, this was a gilt-edged security in which not alone the capital but the interest was guaranteed to the shareholders by the Government.  The banks took their complement of shares&mdash; £200,000 worth.  The remaining £300,000 was to be subscribed by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some little experience of the position of the people who have been hungering for this money and who have been waiting for this money for the last twelve months.  I believe there is not a Deputy who has been in touch with his constituents who has not had <Col N="606" /> hundreds of such people inquiring from him when they would get any money from the Credit Corporation.  I do not know, I do not know if anybody knows, how they are to go about getting loans from the Corporation.  I am speaking of individual farmers.  I am not in a position to give them information and I do not think any other Deputy is. Why is that?  There has not been a public statement or announcement made to indicate to the farmers how they are to apply, where they are to apply, or what likelihood there is of their getting any money when they do apply.  How was this Corporation floated?  It was floated as the result of one advertisement in three daily papers.  Of the provincial papers, which are the organs of the agricultural community, not one got the publication of the announcement that this Corporation was being floated.  No attempt was made to get sixpence from the small investor that the Minister for Finance has told us has been the backbone of the National Loan, the small investor that the Minister told us has put £200,000 more into the Post Office this year than last year, and has put £600,000 more into Savings Certificates, which is evidence to the Minister that there is money with the small investor, that there is a certain section, perhaps connected with agriculture, which may have been thrifty and kept its money when the times were good and prices were high, and still has a few shillings to invest.  That section of the community was never asked to put sixpence in the Credit Corporation, was never appealed to in any way.</P>
    <P>What is the result of the flotation of that Corporation?  I heard it stated that only £20,000 was subscribed by the public.  According to the Budget statement there seems to have been £70,000, because £230,000 is to be provided for by loan.  Whatever the amount, the flotation was a failure.  I want to ask the Minister this question: Was that failure deliberate?  Was it the means of getting out of a position in which they had promised this loan and did not want to make good their promise and decided to let the flotation be a failure?  Was it because it was stupidly launched to the public, and that for want of knowledge as to how <Col N="607" /> to deal with a matter of this kind the flotation, so far as the general public are concerned, was a failure?  This country is not in as prosperous a condition as we would like to see it.  There may be a tendency upwards, and there is every indication of it.  But when the Government put on the market a giltedged security, guaranteed by the State as to capital and guaranteed for five per cent. interest, they ought to have taken proper steps to see that the thrifty, up and down the country, should have got an opportunity of subscribing to this loan.  Such a thing has not happened.  I wonder, again, whether this Credit Corporation has been designed to be a success or a failure. If it is designed to be a success, the Government has blundered badly; if it is designed to be a failure, it has succeeded admirably.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the fact that some of the Independent Deputies did not wait to hear his speech.  Speaking for myself, I can say that I attended every meeting of the Dáil since I was elected, and, speaking for myself again, I say that I am heartily sick of sitting here and listening to Deputies on both sides of the House discussing from which hand the blood was dripping more freely, rather than considering the question that the farmers in this country have hardly got enough to buy stock for their land.  They had been promised something supposed to be bread which has turned out to be stone. I emphasise that fact because I feel the farmers and agriculturists have been sadly neglected.  Perhaps I may have painted a picture a little exaggerated for the purpose of making Ministers, and the Opposition as well, realise that there are other people in this country besides bottle-makers and bead manufacturers, and that the farmers are the people who require the first consideration of the State.  This Budget will certainly not bring any hope to the farmers. While the Budget has been an absolute failure for them, I hope some attempt will be made by the Government to put the Agricultural Credit Corporation on such a footing that it will be a help to agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a debate on any <Col N="608" /> economic question, or, indeed, on any other question that arises in this House in which three names are not mentioned. I do not want to make little of industry, in any way, but I want to point out what are the dominant ideas in the minds of the Government and the Opposition&mdash;I put them both in the same boat&mdash;with regard to who are the important people economically to the State.  I am going to mention some names here, and no doubt I shall be told I should mention them with bated breath&mdash;Guinness's Jacob's, Ford's. They are the most important people in the State, more important than the farmers, who are 80 per cent. of the community.  Every bit of legislation is viewed from the angle of how it will affect Guinness's, Jacob's, or Ford's. What is to be the effect on the breweries of the Budget proposals?  If I take Guinness's first, it is because Guinness's is a big concern.  They juggle with millions.  The effect of the curtailment of credit to breweries, generally, is not going to hit Guinness's very hard.  But what about the effect on the smaller breweries?  Does it not place them in an awkward position?</P>
    <P>The small struggling competitive breweries may find it very difficult to find 33 per cent. extra capital to finance this reduction in credit.  Jacob's and all these other industries are important, but I do not like to see them set up as paramount to, and more important than, the farmers of the country.  Jacob's actually figure in a resolution as to varnish.  I would like to know what is the value of the spirit in the varnish that has caused special exemption to be made for Jacob's.  Is it of such great consequence that the great firm of Jacob's could not stand the strain?  On the other hand, if they get special exemption is similar exemption to be given to other people who use this special kind of varnish?  Then we come to Ford.  Here it is a case of &ldquo;Hush.&rdquo;  We are told to say nothing about him.  But Ford seems to think so much about this country that he did not even include it in his itinerary. His every attitude is from the showman point of view and he is getting the cheapest advertisement in the world, all over the world.  But, apparently, in the eyes of some people Ford is of so much <Col N="609" /> importance to this country that we are not to mention his name, good, bad or indifferent.  I wonder, touching upon that point, is there anything in this Budget that we have not seen, or is it the Budget, for the year, or is it going to be heel-tapped later on?  I am strongly of opinion that this colourless Budget is only the beginning of the finding of the revenue for the year. Something may happen, I do not know whether Cork Deputies are in the know or not, but something may happen in Cork in the near future.</P>

      <P>As I say, something may happen in Cork, and possibly that is the reason for the &ldquo;Hush&rdquo; system about Ford.  But other things may happen.  There is a very significant sentence in the Minister's statement which leads me to believe&mdash;I may be over-suspicious&mdash;that something else is going to occur.  The Minister mentioned, in his Budget speech, that he was rather disappointed that he got no help from the Tariff Commission in the matter of anything that they could recommend to bring in revenue.</P>
      <P>That statement, taken on its own, might lead one to believe that we were done with tariffs for this year.  I wonder are we?  I do not think we are.</P>

      <P>What I object to is that, while we may have a cobbledup Budget brought in in April, we are going to have other questions brought up according as they are reported on by the Tariff Commissioners, and we are going to have new tariffs in May, June, July, August and September, at times when they will upset trade and when the introduction of such tariffs between one Budget and another would be a very disturbing element.  The Minister, I think, mentioned something about liquor duties which may have some effect on revenue up to the present and possibly he will reap the reward <Col N="610" /> of that later when he has cleared the air and when there is another tariff.  I object very strongly to tariffs being introduced outside the Budget period.  I am against tariffs on principle, but I am more against them because I think the principle of introducing them between one Budget and another is unsound.  It has a bad effect on trade, and I believe that those industries which have already been investigated by the Tariff Commission, and which are hoping either to get tariffs or not to get them, as the case may be, are cutting down their pay roll as much as they can.  That has been done in years gone by, and last year we had a certain industry closed down, and when it closed down the Tariff Commission put on a tariff.  I refer to the margarine industry.  In industries in which tariffs are introduced, the pay roll is cut down, employment is reduced, so that such tariffs have a very disturbing effect on industry generally. I have nothing further to add, except to express the hope that in the year to come, now that we have started another new financial year, we are finished with the question of who started the war, and whether there are more murderers on one side of the House than the other.  I am sick of that kind of thing.  I want to know which party is going to start the peace, and when proper consideration is going to be given to the unfortunate agricultural community, because amid all the talk of war and murder, the agricultural community is left without a friend here.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Budget statement and I must express regret that the Minister did not make it during the past twelve months. It is now the considered decision of the Executive that there can be no relief in taxation, and that this piece of island with only one industry, namely, agriculture, must continue to find a sum of £24,000,000 for the support of all the drones living on the only industry we have.  I think the Executive should definitely give the people an opportunity of deciding for themselves whether they are going to continue to feed these drones.  No hope is being held out to the agricultural community. Deputy O'Hanlon alluded to the sum of £600,000 for agricultural rates, but that money goes as much to the relief of rates on a mansion with 10,000 acres and supporting one dog, as to the relief of the tillage farmer. There should be differentiation between the farmer who works his land and employs labour, and the other type of farmer, namely, the rancher.  I expected to see some reduction in the Civic Guard Vote, but, judging by the Estimates, the Civic Guard is going to be made a permanent institution and enlarged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see by what other means they can justify an expenditure of £1,500, and up to £4,000, for new Civic Guard barracks in country stations while at the same time, when building houses on estates which are divided, they allow only from £200 to £450 each for these houses.  I do not think that they propose in any case to build a house on such lands at a higher cost than £600.  They ask a farmer to live in a house the building of which has cost from £200 to £600, and they are going to pay £1,550 for a mansion for four Civic Guards, each of whom is drawing £3 10s. 0d. a week, with free lodging and a clothing allowance. There are engineers with a university degree who are employed at £3 a week <Col N="614" /> in the Civil Service, with no extras.  If that is the division that we are going to see, honestly speaking, the sooner we can find a very large reduction in those estimates the better.  I know that in one instance where the Government propose to build a Civic Guard station, costing £1,550, there is at the present moment a Civic Guard station in the same parish.  I do not think the state of the country at present justifies the building of two Civic Guard stations in one parish.  The parish is presided over by a parish priest and a curate already and they look after the peace very well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not a very bad parish, but I think some influence was brought to bear in that particular area by former members.  We had some allusions here to-day as to the reasons why the Civic Guards are still required. I think that the principal reason they are still required is that the Executive are looking round the country to find some means of employing them.  They are not all for enforcing school attendance. They are required, one at the front door and one at the back door, of the local publichouse, enforcing new hours.  That is the job at which the Civic Guards are engaged down in my area.  Seven of them are also employed for the past seventeen months hunting one man, and they have not caught him yet.  The seven of them are permanently employed there with, with extra lodging allowances, hunting one man. The injustice of that case is so glaring that that man has the support of the entire community in evading the Civic Guard.  The action of the Civic Guards is so glaring that one was recommended for promotion for his activities and he was called up to Dublin.  He went back again, and when he arrived at Limerick Junction he fired 48 shots around the station.  He was afterwards conveyed to a lunatic asylum.  These are the sort of individuals we have looking after the peace of the district.</P>

    <P>Then we have a number of inspectors. When we go into the yard in the morning we have one inspector to see that we wash the cows; we have <Col N="615" /> another inspector to license the bull, and a third inspector to reject him after that.  That is the kind of law that is in operation down there.  We also see here a sum of £1,000 for the wear and tear of the Governor-General's motor car.  Deputy O'Hanlon alluded to Henry Ford, but for this allowance Henry Ford would give six motor cars to the Governor-General in the year, one for every two months. Surely, the Governor-General should drive an Irish motor car manufactured by Henry, and he could get six motor cars in the year for the amount shown here for the upkeep of one car.  I happened to be out in the Art Gallery a few days ago, and I saw there some portraits, one of a distinguished member of the Cabinet, and one of a distinguished or extinguished ex-member of the Cabinet.  I heard one old man saying &ldquo;It is no wonder the country is queer when these are the fellows who are at the head of it.&rdquo;  I think the Government would be well advised to remove these portraits from the public gaze as soon as possible.  When we see that we are still paying a war bonus on salaries of £1,700 and £1,800 a year&mdash; such salaries are still carrying a bonus of £200 odd&mdash;and when we see that that money must be provided by imposing a tax of a farthing per lb. on the sugar of the unfortunate man who gets 27s. a week, the maximum wage laid down by the Government, surely there is something rotten in the whole system.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister looking for new tariffs.  I would like to know from him why he did not afford some assistance to the agricultural community. We import into this country foreign malt and barley.  I suggest to him that he should set his eagle eye on that as a source of revenue.  It would be quite feasible for him to do it, and it would afford some relief to the unfortunate farmer growing barley who cannot find a sale for it, owing to the competition of imported barley.  There are also other lines to which I would direct his attention.  I believe that local licensed retailers can make £1 a case more on Scotch whiskey than on Irish whiskey.  I suggest to the Minister <Col N="616" /> that he should turn his eagle eye on that.  Scotch whiskey is also allowed in here 30 degrees under-proof, and the local retailers are prosecuted if they sell Irish whiskey 25 degrees under-proof.</P>

      <P>I do not happen to be a publican and do not understand these things, but these are matters which could be very easily cleared up, when you have this pressing taxation and when you consider where the money is going to be found.  As to the Agricultural Credit Corporation alluded to by Deputy O'Hanlon, the less said about it the better, for by the time an applicant has proved what he is asked to prove and by the time he has found the securities he is asked for, he could get the money from the banks much cheaper.  Money at 6 per cent. is absolutely no use at the present day to the farmer.  I wonder when the Government were raising all this money in America, whether they told the people there that they were going to charge 6 per cent. for it at home.  Did they tell them that we were going to pay £28,000 a year for the luxury of this gentleman whose portrait&mdash;I do not know whether it is a caricature or a portrait&mdash;is in the National Gallery. If the Minister is looking for means of revenue and wants the £200,000 that he is trying to make up by the tax on sugar, let him take this circus round the country and make a charge.  Let him take it down to Cork, where we have a sense of humour, and charge the entertainments tax.  I guarantee that he will get a haul.  If he does not find it feasible to take this circus round and show the people where the money is going to, let him get the indication of appreciation over there to broadcast the speeches with a charge or special rate for listening-in. He would make a good haul.</P>

      <P>I would also like to see in the Budget some different cases made on the duty on beer and spirits manufactured out of purely Irish barley and the duty on beer and spirits manufactured out of imported barley. That would give relief to the farmers of the country who grow barley.  If the barley industry is going to be wiped out, not because of the reduction of trade but through the importation of foreign barley by the brewer, then some steps are absolutely necessary. The Minister for Finance said that protective duties on some articles now show so little revenue that it no longer pays to collect them.  I am very glad that the result of the tariffs on some articles has been such as to prevent their importation here.  I think that is a matter for thankfulness.  Those are matters which, after all, should be carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should <Col N="620" /> definitely give some relief this year to the agricultural community.  It is on the backs of the agricultural community will fall all those taxes that are clapped on and if the farmers have in addition to pay the three million pounds a year which this Government has benevolently voted to John Bull in the shape of land annuities, then I hope the farmers will first of all feed themselves before they pay anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to prolong this debate, but there are still a few questions upon which we would like some information from the Minister.  There is one matter which has not been mentioned so far; that is, in regard to the loans to fishermen.  I think it is not denied that either the Minister or the President made a promise that these loans would be revalued and there are many hundreds of people very anxiously waiting for those promises to be fulfilled.  I think on this occasion, when all the activities of the country are being reviewed, we might have a definite statement as to whether the Government intends to do anything to revalue these loans made to fishermen.  It is significant that in the estimate of assets against National Debt there is no mention of the loans to fishermen.  It may be that the Minister considers them too small, but I was inclined to infer that the Minister does not think them of any use or that there is any likelihood that these loans will be repaid.  That is a question on which we would like a little information from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of other things we would like to deal with.  It appears there is a very extraordinary anomaly going to occur in connection with the commercial vehicles tax.  I will just give an example as to how it will work out.  Take a French chassis coming here direct.  Suppose it is worth £600, the duty here will be £200, and that will bring the figure to £800.  Allow £150 for a body, and that will make £950 altogether.  Let the same chassis come from London&mdash;and there are some French firms that have assembling works in England.  Take it that the selling price is £600, that it gets on a body in England at the same price as the Irish body, £150; that would bring the figure <Col N="621" /> to £750.  It will be admitted that the Imperial preference rate applies, because I think it only takes 25 per cent. of British manufacture to make the article liable to the Imperial preference duty.  The duty at that rate would work out at £166.  You would then have the bus and body complete at £916.  With an Irish body, if the chassis were imported direct from France, it would cost £950.  That does not seem to be a very effective way of encouraging Irish industry.  I am nearly sure that that anomaly&mdash;it has always existed&mdash;has been pointed out to the Government.  It may be that they have overlooked it, but I would like the Minister to deal with it.  There may be some snag in it that I have not seen, but it occurs to me that it would be an extraordinary thing when we have actually a so-called protective duty on commercial vehicle bodies, that that duty under the new arrangement is going to act as a subsidy to British manufacture.</P>
    <P>In connection with that duty we are a bit distrait to know why it is there is such hesitation in giving real protection to Irish coach-building.  Anybody can see that no one would have a big grievance if there was really prohibition against lorry or bus bodies. Nobody can say that it is a thing in which the consumers should be allowed some choice or that they would have a big grievance if they were forced to get their goods in Ireland.  I do think that a country that cannot manufacture lorry bodies does not deserve a Parliament or anything in the way of civilisation.  We all know that we are capable of manufacturing bus bodies as well as any other country can manufacture them.  There is not any likelihood for years of there being any urgency in this country about the manufacture of bus bodies, so that the question of dealing with orders could not arise.  I submit that the Government have not given that industry fair play.  They have been pressed again and again to introduce some effective tariff which would be real protection to the trade.  They have been pressed from both sides of the House, from the side of the capitalists who are engaged in it, and they are pressed by <Col N="622" /> the vehicle-builders, of whom there are 25 per cent. unemployed at present.  It would cost only a stroke of the pen, so to speak, to give that industry genuine protection, and I submit that the House should press for an explanation as to why that protection is not given.</P>
    <P>In connection with tariffs, there are some things that require a lot of explanation. The furniture tariff brings in £45,000.  When that tariff is costed, so to speak, when we examine what it takes to collect that £45,000, I think nobody can be convinced that it is a paying tariff.  First of all, you have three Revenue Commissioners themselves, who get a payment out of it. You have their staffs, who get a certain payment out of it.  You have on your Customs ports men who have to be trained in valuing furniture.  It must not be taken or accepted that the work of a Customs officer of that kind is routine.  He has got to be able to fix a value on each article of furniture as it arrives, and to see whether the invoice price is a correct price or not. He has got to take responsibility, if he thinks the invoice price is not correct, to hold up that article and put a value on it himself.  How can anyone say, then, that that £45,000 revenue on furniture pays for its collection?  We would like to know, then, why it is that we are to have a tariff on furniture at all? What is wrong in saying that there should be prohibition on the importation of furniture?  The President has told us that he has nothing but Irish furniture in his house.  If Irish furniture is good enough for the first citizen of the State, then surely it should be good enough for anybody else.  Is there any reason, then, for imposing what is tantamount to a revenue tariff on furniture, when there should be a total prohibition on the importation of furniture?  If we are not able to make our own tables and chairs and lounges and desks, and so on, we are not capable of much.</P>
    <P>In any case, I am sure that the £45,000 raised from this tariff does not pay the expense of collecting it.  I would like if we would have some explanation of it.  We were told by the Minister for Agriculture in the tariff debate that we were not to talk about retaliation.  If there is no fear of retaliation <Col N="623" /> then there is no need in a case like this of speaking of retaliation.  In the case of confectionery, what is the object merely of putting on a tariff? Why not put on prohibition?  There would be no grievance to any individual in this country if imports of confectionery were totally prohibited. There would be a slight loss in revenue. I would like to know from the Minister if his object in keeping on that tariff is to get revenue from it.  It seems to us that the case is clearly one for total prohibition.  There are many precedents for that.  There is hardly a country in Europe that does not prohibit the importation into it of certain goods.  There was one remark made by the Minister for Finance that struck me as very interesting indeed.  He said, after talking about existing institutions, that undoubtedly if we were starting anew we would not have them as they are at present.  But he said that when you come to reform them you are faced with this, that you have to give compensation for the abolition of vested interests.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that difficulty all right, and I think that anybody who has got an eye on what is happening in other countries must feel that these vested interests are going to be a very big problem in the future for every country.  We see that when Spain attempted&mdash;and not merely attempted, but actually in the matter of these vested interests did establish an oil monopoly&mdash;that it meant very serious relations with France. That was because France at the time was in possession of the oil industry of Spain, and France was not satisfied with the compensation Spain gave to her interests when she decided to get rid of them.  We appreciate that difficulty, and we are wondering why the Minister for Finance is content at looking on at the growth of vested interests in one of the most important departments of the State, vested interests that are going inevitably to cause trouble and that are to be very costly to Ireland to get rid of.  I refer to the vested interests in road transport. Nobody believes that that competition of the different bus services on the roads can continue indefinitely.  Everybody <Col N="624" /> realises that there will have to be order brought into that Department some time.  If to-morrow the Government decide to do it, they will be faced with scores of vested interests there that they have allowed to grow up. Each of these vested interests will demand compensation, and the Government will be faced with a demand for compensation all along the line.  It struck me as curious that while the Minister is conscious of this difficulty about vested interests, he should be content to see these vested interests grow up in the country in that Department of road transport, and probably in a number of other Departments as well.</P>
    <P>We agree entirely with Deputy O'Hanlon that the floating of the Agricultural Credit Corporation was very badly done.  Issuing a prospectus in the daily Press for, I think, one day was not a reasonable attempt to get the money needed for that big venture. Everybody knows that farmers as a rule are not much interested in prospectuses, and we think if it were decided to do the thing in that casual way it would have been very much better to save the expense of issuing a prospectus at all.  As a matter of fact, there are several Deputies here who know individual farmers who would have been quite prepared to invest in the Agricultural Credit Corporation if they had realised that it was good security, if it had been brought home to them, if there had been any little propaganda in connection with it.  But we all know that it was done as a very routine matter, done apparently in the belief that the farmers of Ireland were quite au fait with all the details of the Corporation, with its basis, its guarantees, and so on, and that if any of them had money to invest they would decide to do so on a mere issue of the prospectus in the daily papers.  We think it was a very foolish way of bringing the details to their notice or of attempting to get money for that important venture.</P>
    <P>One thing Deputy O'Hanlon will have to practise..  I suppose every man has his conceit.  Apparently Deputy O'Hanlon's conceit is that he is a farmers' representative and the only farmers' representative in this House. <Col N="625" /> He thinks that by keeping on talking against tariffs that proves him to be essentially a farmers' representative. Some of us who have given it a little attention are satisfied that that is a very erroneous way of proving that he is the farmers' friend.  Looking at the big burden the country is bearing at the moment, realising from the remark of the Minister for Finance in his opening statement that all expense is ultimately borne out of production, we are not satisfied that the farmer is getting a fair chance by having to bear such a huge load.  In advocating industrialism &mdash;because of course tariffs are only a means towards industrialism&mdash;we think we are doing the best service possible to the farmer, because we see no chance that farming is going to be so prosperous, within the next ten years anyhow, that it will be able to bear the big burdens that are being poured on to it, that it will be able to provide all the services that a growing civilisation demands.  We feel that it would be only common justice to the farmer that the burden of carrying a big urban population on his back should be taken off, and that the towns of Ireland, instead of leading a parasitic existence, should contribute a little towards the wealth of the country; in other words, that they should be encouraged to go in for production, thereby taking some of the weight off the farmers' shoulders. Roughly, that is our philosophy of it. We have yet to be convinced, either by Deputy O'Hanlon or anyone else, that that is a wrong view.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk in the debate about the Civil Service and about the necessity for economy and that sort of thing.  I think that that has been disposed of.  It is not a subject that I like talking about in any case, but I think it is necessary to repeat that we have as much regard for the civil servants and are as eager to safeguard their interests as any other party.  The Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;They were forced upon us and there is no reason why we should defend them if they do not deserve defence.&rdquo; Well, if he applies the same reasoning to us, or if the Minister for Industry and Commerce applies the same reasoning. I think he would have seen that <Col N="626" /> we can have no axe to grind in making any charges against civil servants or in giving the opportunity to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to force a wedge between us and the Civil Service. It is not a thing that gains us any votes; it is not a thing that gains us any popularity.  It is a thing, however, on which a number of people are not satisfied that the last word has been said, and in the present desperate circumstances of the country we think that even the feeling that prevails would be a good enough excuse for allowing a really satisfactory inquiry into that source of expenditure.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce says that all we hear is &ldquo;belief of so and so,&rdquo; and &ldquo;my feeling is so and so,&rdquo; he must remember that that is the origin of a number of commissions.  I suppose the Government is at present congratulating itself on the result of the Harling Commission. There you had a commission established which was simply the result of feeling and believing.  The Minister for Finance referred, in reply to some remarks that I made the other evening, to the commission established to inquire into delays on dutiable goods at the ports and said that he found there was no reason for these complaints at all. There was a case where the Government yielded to an assertion, a belief, if you like, and I think I could give a number of other cases.  Again the Minister was altogether unfair and quite unlike himself in other speeches when he accused Deputy Lemass of giving no instance of slackness from his own observation of public departments. That would be a very invidious thing to do and a very wrong thing to do, for one in the position of Deputy Lemass who, while he might have strong grounds for suspicion, might easily be wrong in his suspicion.  What he would observe in a department, while as a public representative he might be well justified in drawing attention to it, might be capable of a very satisfactory explanation.  Again, generally speaking it would not be at all a satisfactory method of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I think when a number of public representatives press for an inquiry and say that they are not satisfied that <Col N="627" /> the fullest economy is being practised, it should be up to the Government to accede to such demand as having some reasonable ground, especially when there are so many difficulties in the way of giving reasons for it.  Personally, I agree with the Minister for Finance when he said that some civil servants are killing themselves.  I know civil servants who, I believe, are working far too hard.  But even if we liked to quote things said to us by civil servants whom we may meet in ordinary social life, it is just possible&mdash;I do not say it is the case&mdash;that we could quote statements that have led us to believe that this is not the general rule and that the injustice to such men is all the greater because of the slackness on the part of other civil servants. I think the fact that we recognise that these things prevail, that at all events certain civil servants are working too hard, shows all the more need for calling for a general inquiry.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would be satisfied if I knew a little more about the method of the working of this Economy Committee. We have never been told what criteria they are adopting in their investigations. Is it the standard of the banks, or of the railways or of general commercial offices?  Is it on the traditions of the Civil Service that they are going, or are they having any regard for what the country can pay for the Civil Service?  Remember, it is not enough to say that men are worth so-and-so: there are plenty of enterprises in Ireland that could do with experts, that could add to their profits immensely if they were at liberty to pay for experts in their business, but they have not got the money to do it, and the man who would propose to them that they should do that sort of thing would only be wasting his time.  If I am running an enterprise and somebody says: &ldquo;I know a man who, if you are prepared to give him £1,500 or £2,000 a year, will do a great deal for your business,&rdquo; and if I cannot afford to pay £1,500 or £2,000 a year there is not much use in talking like that to me.  Similarly with the Civil Service. We would like to know what criteria are being adopted by the Economy <Col N="628" /> Committee and when it is likely to report. But I hope that the effort to drive a wedge between this Party and the Civil Service will not be repeated. It is a very ugly thing to happen.  As Deputy Ryan pointed out, they are as much our civil servants as they are the Government's civil servants, and their honour and their reputation is just as much to us, I venture to say, as it is to the Government Party.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rate on telegrams, I am afraid that I must repeat what Deputy O'Hanlon and other Deputies said.  I believe that the increase will not help in reducing the loss that exists on telegrams, that it certainly will not help to bring about an appreciable reduction in the loss.  It is more likely, I think, that it will add to the loss on telegrams, because the difference between one shilling and one and sixpence will be felt by numbers of people, and it is more than likely that a falling off in the use of telegrams will take place, which will not be compensated for either by the increased amount obtained from telegrams or by the greater use of the telephones.</P>
    <P>There were a couple of other matters that I would have liked the Minister to deal with.  For instance, a number of countries are taking action with regard to the foreign concerns operating within their territories, and are insisting that a certain number of the employees of these concerns shall be natives.  There are concerns operating in the Free State whose staffs are entirely foreign, and we thought that the Minister would have dealt with things like that, that look very objectionable, and that cannot continue.  When the Minister was detailing alternative taxes we would have liked to know why he did not consider a tax, for instance, of 1d. per 1b. on foreign bacon.  That would, I think, bring in about £250,000, would be easy to collect, and would assuredly not mean any increase in the cost of the bacon to the poorer people.  We would like to know why that was not considered as an alternative tax.  My own opinion is that the Minister has not done himself nor his staff justice with this Budget. He has not given any new hope to the <Col N="629" /> country, he has not done anything to relieve the torpor and depression that prevail, and while we may speculate as to the causes that have hampered him, as to why he has not left himself more free, we can only regret at all events that the effect is not going to result in any immediate benefit to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to keep the House very long.  I put to myself one or two questions about the last few years, as to what would likely be the line that the leader of the Opposition, or the members of the Opposition, would take on a Budget, and I found always that the easiest line that appeared to me to be taken was to express disappointment, and the louder the leader expressed it, and the more often he expressed it, the surer it would be that he had paid very little attention to the subject-matter of the Budget. The last speech is perhaps another example of the futility of the discussion on the part of the Opposition in connection with this matter. We had a long statement to the effect that we are not to drive in a wedge between the Party opposite and the civil servants.  My recollection goes back to the last two elections, to those long advertisements which appeared in the daily Press, of the salaries of the Chief Justice&mdash;I do not remember whether His Excellency's was included &mdash;and so on down along, mentioning all the four-figure salaries that there are.  I can recollect all the criticisms that were uttered by these people, who now confess that they know very little, that they have nothing but a surface knowledge of the extraordinary extravagances perpetrated in this country for the last four or five years by the Government.  And now it winds up in the last speech that there is very little hope in this Budget.  Where does the inspiration or the hope come from?  It comes from reading the British Budget. That there is a slavish admiration of the British Budget on those benches over there I am positively certain. It has grown day after day.  No one expressed it, but they were all hoping that someone from some other part of the House would mention it.  To take the leader as an example of the <Col N="630" /> incompetence of the Opposition in this case, we find that he concerned himself with the deficit that occurred during the last four or five years.  Taking 1924-25, my recollection is that he mentioned £721,000; for 1925-26, he mentioned £904,000; for the following year he mentioned £3,218,000, and his figure for 1927-28 was £3,597,000.  Now, the sum total of all this amounts to about £8,400,000.  Deputies, in their leisure, when they are less agitated by the discussions which have taken place here, can correct me if am wrong.</P>
      <P>He went on then to say that the deficit in the previous year was something like £6,800,000.  When we add up all these figures, what do we find? About £15,000,000.</P>
      <P>It would be necessary to go back a little further in order to approximate closely what the National Debt of this country is.  The Minister for Finance has mentioned it as somewhere about £22,000,000, excluding in the first place liabilities to the British Government, in respect of which we are paying £250,000 a year for sixty years, and the Dáil Eireann Loan.  If that is all that the Deputy required, he could easily have learned it.  It would not have been necessary to make a speech about it; the one almost balances the other.  What is the meaning of it?  That is the question.  Is there value for it?  Is there a reason for it? If there be a reason for it there is no necessity for having any more pother about it.  There is the question of compensation; it has been announced on many occasions.  There is the question of excess Army costs in respect of the years 1922-23, 1923-24, and 1924-25. I think I have mentioned the sums&mdash; £7,000,000 the first year, £10,000,000 the second year, and £3,000,000 the third.  The sum total of these three is round about £20,000,000.  The Army cost, which might have been estimated as the normal cost at that time, was £6,000,000&mdash;£2,000,000 per annum.  That is £14,000,000.  The cost in respect of compensation and other items is approximately £8,000,000.  As a matter of fact, it is even more than that.  So that I am sure the Deputy is now far more easy in his mind.</P>

      <P>I was going to wait until the Minister for Finance came back to explain it, because I know that the President has a very happy knack of balancing things sometimes by reading the wrong side of the books. I was also waiting for the Minister for Finance to come along because I see from the Budget statement that he takes any arbitrary figure he wants in order to bring out the balance.  He picked out, as was indicated by Deputy O'Hanlon, £500,000 from the Army and some other sum from somewhere else in order to get it out.  There is a very simple way for testing whether we are balancing our Budget or not, to test at least whether the Minister's statements with regard to it are right or not.  Take, for example, what the Minister said last year as to how much was to be got by borrowing, and let us take how much has been borrowed during the year and see whether the difference is to the good.  If you borrow seven millions and if there are only two millions of abnormal expenditure to be covered by borrowing, then I take it that you ought to have five millions left.  I do not see anything like that in the accounts.</P>

      <P>Might I make the position clear?  The banks have a method of presenting their accounts which anybody who deals with matters of that kind will understand does not represent the true situation.  It is purposely intended to hide the true situation from the public.  Our attitude to these accounts is that they are conceived in the same way.  What we want is to have a detailed statement of the accounts so that we can examine them.  I remember reading on one occasion a statement made by Mr. Leaf, a former Chairman, I think, of the Westminster Bank.  He was speaking to the Governor of the Bank of England and said, &ldquo;There is only one item in these accounts that I can understand.&rdquo;  The other man replied: &ldquo;Are you quite sure that you do understand it?&rdquo; Evidently that is the intention of the Minister for Finance here in giving his Budget statement. This method of taking a sum here and of adding it to some other figure and then referring to some smaller items as included in the total arrived at is not a proper way to present accounts to this assembly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of hiding anything.  I would ask the Deputy to turn to the figures which the Minister for Finance gave on page 4 of the typewritten statement that he read.  The first figure is £8,975,800, National Loan, 1923, and the last figure £3,021,000 Savings Certificates.  These figures refer to the liability of the State.  The figures there give the liability of the State, excluding the £250,000 annual payment for the next 57 years and the Dáil Eireann External Loan.  These items, properly speaking, can be excluded from our consideration for the purpose of making it clear that the Budget has been balanced for the last three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a question of scoring. I am utterly disinterested as regards scoring in this manner.  The Deputy will see further down in that typewritten statement where the credits are.  He will see the statement that, after making allowance for the assets indicated, the liabilities may be put at £13,584,000. The Minister for Finance in his statement said that this was the sum which is comparable with the sum of £12,400,000 given in last year's Budget Statement.  Let us exclude altogether an examination of each individual year's liability and take this as the liabilities and assets for the moment.  The only question now for us is to examine whether or not we were justified in regarding certain items as abnormal.  The items that I have mentioned, such as extra Army expense, for 1922-23, 1923. <Col N="634" /> 24, and 1924-25, alone amount to about £14,000,000, leaving out of account altogether the question of compensation. I hope I have made that point clear, because I am anxious to do so for the benefit of the whole country.  I take it that even Deputies on the benches opposite, with all their intense political feeling on this matter, do really want the country to understand what is the actual state of affairs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures give the Deputy an opportunity of saying that is abnormal expenditure.  I am simply mentioning a few figures. Take the Army alone.  It was £7,000,000 in 1922-23, £10,000,000 in 1923-24, and £3,000,000 in the following year.  That is a total of £20,000,000.  That item alone, taking it that the Army costs £2,000,000 in each of these three years, leaves a balance of £14,000,000.  All we have spent is £13,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter to be disputed.  At any rate we have taken it this way: that somewhere about 1925-26 the Minister for Finance made the statement that £2,000,000 a year might be regarded and would be regarded by him as normal Army expenditure, and anything over that abnormal. I do not think that we were <Col N="635" /> wrong in doing that.  At all events that was the promise.  We went on that, and there is no deceit and no mystification with regard to it.</P>

      <P>That is another question.  Assuming the figures are correct, that is our case, and we are standing over them.  There may be criticism of them, but I think I have made the point clear that our total indebtedness in respect of abnormal costs is £13,500,000.  We are standing over that figure.  I will now deal with Deputy O'Hanlon.  He said we were taking £300,000 off this year which we had no right to take.  It is abnormal cost; that is my answer.  Assuming that is so, our indebtedness in respect of normal and abnormal items after five or six years is only £13,500,000.  The Deputy made a strong case with regard to funding the Agricultural Credit Corporation as an abnormal item.  I put it to him in all seriousness that we would not be justified in regarding it as anything else but an abnormal item.  I It is not an annual liability.  It is something in which an asset is created, assuming the Corporation is going to be a sound business proposition.  If not, and we are going to regard it as a failure, then we should regard the £300,000 which the Minister regarded as abnormal, as expense to be met to-day.  If I consider it advisable to invest say £300 in the Bank of Ireland at the moment I would not be entitled to include that in the expenses of the year.  It is not an expense but an asset which would bring in a dividend in years to come.  It is actually the same with regard to this item.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Flinn's question, the first instalment on the shares which the Government subscribed was paid in the last financial year.  That is really the explanation of the difference.  I would suggest to Deputy de Valera that if he will carefully examine the finance accounts for each year and the Appropriation Accounts, he will have no difficulty in discovering the items of abnormal expenditure and what was paid in respect of each of them.  He will have no difficulty in seeing what amount there is of abnormal expenditure to balance the deficiency which he found between revenue and expenditure, including normal and abnormal expenditure.  We could not deal with it by question and answer, but if the Deputy, having gone into these accounts and having examined them, were unable really to find the information he wanted, I would be prepared to put the departmental machinery at work and get additional information so that he could see it, but my own belief is that if he examines these accounts he will have no difficulty in seeing it. Each year the Budget was balanced, assuming that what we regarded as abnormal was really abnormal.  Of course, if that is not accepted, then it may not have been balanced.  We only balanced it, assuming we were correct in our own segregation of the items between normal and abnormal.  I admit we have reached the stage, and I admitted it in my own Budget statement, where it has become somewhat doubtful as to whether any part of the Army charge should be treated as abnormal, and I am quite clear that this is the last year in which we should be justified in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of the ground has been covered, and it is somewhat difficult for me to fit in remarks, but Deputy de Valera talked of co-ordination, and I think he spoke in a somewhat loose way, because in any organisation you <Col N="639" /> must create divisions of personnel to correspond with the divisions of work. You must have a certain division of labour, and you can only get a limited amount of saving by even bringing divisions together into one building. Take the Department of Education. There are different classes of work given out to different groups of individuals. Even conceive the whole personnel being in one huge single chamber, you would still have to have the work divided, and people would specialise in various things.  I asked somebody&mdash;and I think perhaps this answer was slightly jocular&mdash;what would be the saving accomplished by bringing the Department of Education into one building?  Someone said half the cost of one messenger.  I do not accept that as being correct.  There is convenience and saving in bringing people together, but the saving is not great where you have very distinct divisions of work to be carried out.  I just mention this as an illustration. The Deputy talked of transferring the collection of land annuities to the Department of Finance.  That would not save anything.  All the measures that have to be taken to collect land annuities would still have to be taken, and the same people employed; there would be no saving in doing that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the co-ordination the Deputy has in mind and big businesses is this: you have one factory making, perhaps, the legs of chairs and another factory making the legs of chairs, and perhaps a third factory making the legs of chairs.  You do get a saving if you bring all these together and get big plant employed.  As a matter of fact, if you did away with specialisation in staffs in the Civil Service, you would lose efficiency.  It is recognised that you get better work and better output by specialisation.  In America there is greater specialisation.  A carpenter there specialises.  He has not to do as many classes of work as a carpenter does here.  By specialising in one class of <Col N="640" /> work a better output is obtained.  In the Civil Service you must have a certain amount of specialisation.  You must assign work to a certain class of individuals and you must assign individuals to a certain class of work.  You would gain nothing by doing away with that.  You get order, continuity and all that by specialisation.  I think, as the President said, without making a debating answer, the Deputy did not give as much thought to that matter as he could have given.  It is always possible to make adjustments.  Circumstances change.  You get your machinery perfect at a certain time.  Some new work is thrown upon it which upsets the balance and you find you can improve it.  I have never said the machinery cannot be properly criticised. I have always admitted that improvements can be made.  If to-day we succeeded in making every improvement anybody could suggest, it would not be six months until further adjustments would be required, and until it would be possible for Deputies to say that certain things ought to be done. It will always be possible for them to say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question in relation to this matter?  Does he think it a fair proportion that, under present conditions, £1 should be spent in the administration of every £25 for secondary education&mdash;that £1 should be spent on what I may call &ldquo;headquarters expenses&rdquo; for every £25?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will admit straight off that it is not.  I have another figure here.  Does the Minister consider it a due proportion that there should be a cost of £1 for the administration of every £10 for technical education?  Take the case of secondary education.  I think it should be largely able to administer itself&mdash; with very little staff at the top except examination staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is simply throwing in a very loose statement now, and I could not attempt to answer it because I have not the expert knowledge. Probably the Deputy will have his opportunity of making his case. <Col N="641" /> If he was speaking of a matter which he knows something about&mdash;which he is better qualified perhaps to speak about than a good many of the other matters which he dealt with&mdash;he could have given some particulars.  He could have departed from the general statement. He did not do that.  I could not deal with the matter simply by method of question and answer at the present time.  There were one or two other points mentioned to which I should like to refer.  A deputy asked about the expiry of the betting tax next November.  The betting tax is a permanent tax and will not expire next November.  What does expire next November is the Betting Act, which simply legalises cash betting.  The tax will remain even if the Betting Act should disappear.</P>

      <P>This matter was raised in the House several times and if the Deputy would refer to the records he would see what I then stated.  Part of the difference is due to certain taxes on partially-manufactured parts which is paid on importation here.  How much of the difference could be explained in that way.  I do not know.  It has been <Col N="642" /> alleged on behalf of the Ford people in Cork that the cost of producing machines there is greater than outside. I do not know whether that is so or not. This is a very big matter and would require separate discussion.  Personally I may say that I have never been satisfied that all the difference could be justified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The contractor shall pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour not less favourable than those commonly <Col N="568" /> recognised by employers and trade societies (or, in the absence of such recognised wages and hours, those which in practice prevail amongst good employers) in the trade in the district where the work is carried out.  Where there are no such wages and hours recognised or prevailing in the district, those recognised or prevailing in the nearest district in which the general industrial circumstances are similar shall be adopted.  Further, the conditions of employment generally accepted in the district in the trade concerned shall be taken into account in considering how far the terms of the Fair Wages Clause are being observed, and for this purpose also regard shall be had to the conditions of employment generally, in the contracting firm.  The contractor shall be prohibited from transferring or assigning, directly or indirectly, to any person or persons whatever, any portion of his contract without the written permission of the Department. Sub-letting, other than that which may be customary in the trade concerned, shall be prohibited. The contractor shall be responsible for the observance of the Fair Wages Clause by the sub-contractor.&rdquo;</P>
