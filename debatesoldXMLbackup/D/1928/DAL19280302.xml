      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if the Executive Council have considered the Report of the Unemployment Committee, and, if so, whether he can now state their views on the Committee's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on the Relief of Unemployment have presented two reports to the Executive Council, an interim report and a final report.  The recommendations contained in the interim report deal with&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Road works;</P>
      <P>(b)  Unemployment in the Painting Trade; and</P>
      <P>(c)  Unemployment in the Clothing Trade.</P>
      <P>The Department of Local Government and Public Health has had under constant review the progress of the scheme financed out of the roads fund. The attention of local authorities has on more than one occasion been drawn to the necessity for expediting this work, and local authorities have been invited, in any case where there are obstacles to progress, to consult with the Department with a view to their removal.  In any case where there have been indications of dilatoriness in the carrying out of schemes by contractors they have been called upon to proceed with greater energy.  The Department is satisfied that everything that can be done to expedite the work under these schemes is being done, and the progress made will receive continuous attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> The recommendation of the Committee that internal painting of buildings and premises occupied by Government Departments should be carried out as far as possible during the winter months has been adopted.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are also being made to enable contracts for clothing and equipment to be placed so that the volume of work available for execution during the slack seasons will be as large as possible, having regard to the requirements of the public service.</P>
    <P>The recommendations contained in the final report of the Committee are receiving urgent consideration by the Departments concerned, but the departmental examination has not yet been completed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that extensive flooding takes place annually along the Gweestion, Glore and Yellow Rivers, in County Mayo; and if he can state what steps have been taken up to the present by his Department and by the Mayo County Council to prevent the great losses suffered by the landholders in the districts affected by the flooding of these rivers.</P>

      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to the MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Bourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of three rivers in the district referred to, the Gweestion, Pollagh and Yellow Rivers, have been transmitted to the Commissioners of Public Works by the Mayo County Council.  The Commissioners have had the petitions investigated by an engineer and a valuer, and find that a scheme to afford relief from flooding would cost at least £12,000, and would be quite uneconomic without free <Col N="704" /> grants to the extent of about 65 per cent. of the cost.  The Commissioners accordingly inquired, in April last, whether the County Council were prepared to make a free grant of about 15 per cent. of the cost, to supplement a conditional grant of 50 per cent. from the Government.</P>
      <P>The County Council have deferred consideration of the matter pending a decision on the much larger scheme for the drainage of the River Moy, of which the three rivers referred to are tributaries.  Engineer's and valuer's reports on the Moy scheme are at present before the Commissioners of Public Works, and no avoidable delay will take place in considering them and placing the results before the County Council.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state, with regard to the operation of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in the County Mayo (a) the number of schemes which have been submitted to his Department under the Act by the County Council; (b) the number and location of those which have been reported on to date by the engineers of his Department; (c) the number and location of those which have been approved by his Department, and whether any portion of the cost of such scheme, and, if so, how much is to be provided from Government funds; and (d) the number and location of those schemes (if any) on which work under the Act of 1925 has been executed, or is at present in progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOURKE Mr. BOURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The Commissioners of Public Works have received petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, from the Mayo County Council in respect of eighty-seven schemes, of which forty-eight had been rejected by the County Council.</P>
      <P>(b) Of the thirty-nine schemes approved by the County Council the Commissioners have had thirty-two inspected by their engineer&mdash;nine of these being in the River Robe area and seventeen in that of the River Moy, while four are in the south-west of the county and two in the north-east.  Six of these schemes have been rejected by the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>(c) None of the schemes has reached the stage at which it can be submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation. The Commissioners have received engineers' and valuers' reports on the schemes affecting the areas drained by the Rivers Moy and Robe and have these under consideration. Two other cases (making one joint scheme) have been laid before the County Council with a view to ascertaining whether they will contribute the sum which will be necessary in addition to the Government grant to make the scheme economic, but the County Council have decided to defer consideration of the matter until the larger Moy and Robe schemes are also laid before them.  No avoidable delay will take place in having this done.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if it is a fact that John MacMahon and Thomas Quinn, each aged fourteen years, who were charged at Abbeyfeale with breaking insulators, the property of the contractors of the Shannon Electricity Scheme, have been committed to a reformatory for five years, and that Edmond Quinn, aged eleven years, and Patrick Quinn, aged nine years, charged with the same offence, have been committed to an industrial school for three years; whether the Minister is prepared to review the evidence against these boys, with a view to the remission of the sentences, and whether he will consider the advisability of instituting an inquiry into the punishments prescribed by law for juvenile offenders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that five youths were charged with breaking insulators, the property of the contractors of the Shannon Scheme.  All five were convicted, and sent either to a reformatory or to an industrial school. I have no power to review the evidence in these cases.  Under the Children Act, 1908, the Minister for Education may at any time order a child or youthful <Col N="707" /> offender to be discharged from a certified industrial school or reformatory, as the case may be either absolutely or on prescribed conditions.  If those interested in these young offenders think a case can be made at any time for their absolute or conditional discharge, the proper course is to present a petition to the Minister for Education.  On the question of the punishments prescribed by law for youthful offenders, I would refer the Deputy to Sections 57, 58 and 65 of the Children Act, 1908.  It will be found that these sections provide for a very wide discretion in the committing justice, and I do not see what improvement could be effected.  For further information on the matter, I would refer the Deputy to the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>I do not know the whole facts and circumstances of the case at all.  All I know is that insulators were broken, and, of course, if boys in that neighbourhood start breaking insulators when the scheme gets into working, it would be a terrible thing; it would endanger human life.  I do not know the circumstances surrounding the case of these boys at all, or as to what sort of control their parents exercise over them.</P>

      <P>I am aware that seventeen of the employees of this firm went on strike on the 21st of January last.  My Department immediately communicated with representatives of the parties suggesting that a joint conference be held with a view to bringing about an amicable settlement of the matters in dispute.  This suggestion was agreed to and a joint conference was held on the 30th January, 1928. It was found impossible to reach an agreement and the meeting was adjourned on an understanding that the conference would be resumed if there appeared any prospect of agreement being reached.  My Department has kept in touch with the parties but has no information to show that a resumption of the conference would yet lead to any different result.</P>

      <P>Decisions on a small number of appeals have been unavoidably delayed owing to the other engagements of the Department's Medical Inspector specially assigned for this work.  He will, however, visit County Kerry this month, when an opportunity will be afforded to claimants for blind pensions whose cases are at present on appeal to submit themselves for ophthalmic examination.  In cases of doubt it is necessary that claimants for blind pensions should be examined by a Medical Inspector of the Department specially qualified for this work.

      <P>This is really a token vote.  It is a vote for £10 in order to close a very old chapter in the experiments of tobacco-growing.  The position is as follows: An arrangement was made with Sir Nugent Everard, who is a re-handler of Irish tobacco, that he was to grow an area of about 114 acres per annum or 1,140 acres in <Col N="729" /> ten years at a subsidy of £25 per acre. He had to make arrangements with other growers for subsidies and so forth.  The subsidy of £25 per acre would be £28,000.  The war intervened, however, and he failed to get the acreage. He only got an acreage of 665 acres which would entitle him to a subsidy of £16,000.  He made considerable losses during the whole period, and in order to meet that situation a rather novel proposal was made, agreed to, and carried out.  He was to get a subsidy of £25 an acre on all the tobacco he grew on the 665 acres and a subsidy of £8 per acre in connection with the balance.  In that way he got about £27,000.  We decided to wind up this experiments a few years ago.  It was necessary to go into the accounts.  Sir Nugent Everard furnished the accounts to the Minister for Finance, and he is at a loss of something like £17,000.  It was rather difficult to examine the accounts and get all the items vouched in view of the fact that the transactions were going on a long time and that it was never thought likely that there would be losses.  While the Department of Finance could not say definitely that the losses amounted to such a figure as £17,000, nevertheless they are satisfied on an examination of the accounts that the losses are round about that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a very early stage Sir Nugent Everard was lent £8,000 to put up barns for his growers and to buy equipment.  He paid the interest on that for a number of years, but a certain amount of interest got into arrears, and now the principal, plus the interest, amounting to about £11,000, is due, so that the situation is that he has made a loss of £17,000 and owes the Department of Finance something like £11,000.  He put in a claim for £17,000. It could be examined, and it would be for us here to come to a conclusion as to what the equitable thing to do would be.  Undoubtedly Sir Nugent Everard took up the matter in the national interest and made a genuine attempt to establish what he regarded&mdash;whatever other opinions there may be about it&mdash; as a sound semi-agricultural industry. With that object he went into the matter and put most of his time, all his <Col N="730" /> ability, as well as a lot of money, into it, and it looks as if he has lost £17,000. As I say, he owes the Ministry of Finance £11,000.  He has made a claim for £17,000, and a proposal has been agreed to by the Minister for Finance to which we wish to draw the attention of the Dáil.  It has been agreed by Sir Nugent Everard to waive his claim to the losses and that we waive our claim to the £11,000.  It is for that purpose that we introduce this token Vote.  No money passes by this arrangement, but it was considered right to draw the attention of the Dáil to the matter.</P>

      <P>It is not our intention to oppose this Vote.  I suppose the losses incurred by Sir Nugent Everard arose mainly through want of proper consideration being given to the scheme and also through want of sympathy by the Department in question. The tobacco industry is one which many people believe could be developed to a very high pitch.  It could become a very important industry, and proof of that can be given, if necessary, in its history.  The British Government, for their own purposes, at times encouraged the development of the industry, while at other times they took steps to stamp it out.  As all the Deputies here may not understand or may never have taken any interest in the question of tobacco growing&mdash;I know there are a good many here who since the establishment of the Free State have heard this subject discussed&mdash;I think it would be useful for everyone to know a little of the ups and downs of the history of this industry and the position into which an alien Government has put it.  It will convince them that because of that opposition there must be some real economic value in tobacco growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tobacco-growing was introduced by Sir Walter Raleigh along with potatoes, and I understand he made his first trial in County Cork.  His potatoes were successful, and his tobacco would also have been successful but for the fact that it seemed to interfere with the policy of the British Government. Charles II. was the first monarch in England who objected to the growing of tobacco here.  He wanted to develop the industry in America, and later, <Col N="731" /> when the American Colonies fell out with the British Government, the latter encouraged tobacco-growing in Ireland. It was grown here very successfully up to the year 1830.  County Wexford had numerous factories, and up to that time there was every prospect that the industry was going to be successful, but the British Government immediately stamped it out.  They appointed a Commission, and at that Commission it was proved by manufacturers in London that, if they allowed the leaf to be grown in Ireland, the Irish manufacturers would be able to compete with them and, eventually, would be able to capture the market.  Consequently strict laws were passed and the growing of tobacco in Ireland was completely abolished.</P>
    <P>In Co. Cavan a gentleman was prosecuted and fined £60 for growing a few plants in his garden.  Schemes were started about 1898.  The Government evidently repented.  The schemes were started on a rather small scale, merely experimental.  Some time afterwards, about the year 1914, another scheme was started.  There was a grant of £75,000 for that.  It was while this scheme was in operation that Sir Nugent Everard took up tobacco-growing. That project failed, owing to war conditions, I suppose.  It was found more profitable to grow foodstuffs than to grow tobacco.  The climax came when the Colonial preferential tariff was introduced into England. Countries like India, which had supplies on hand for three or four years, flooded the English market, with the result that the Irish suppliers were not able to compete.  The tobacco was put into bond and remained there.  When the Free State came into existence it got something like about one-third of the £75,000 grant.  It was then that the rehandling scheme was introduced. Sir Nugent Everard and Lord Dunraven erected certain machines.  These were bought in the United States of America, and were made to deal with a produce of about one thousand acres, but neither Sir Nugent Everard nor Lord Dunraven had that number of acres to deal with, and, therefore, the overhead charges would seem to be very much against the cost of production, <Col N="732" /> and it did not seem to be economic. However, no smaller machines were made.  Lord Dunraven was rather lucky, as he had his machine insured, and it was destroyed by fire, so that he was paid for it.  Sir Nugent Everard was not so lucky, with the result we have now.  The scheme might have been successful but for the difficulties that were put up, especially by the Revenue Department.  That Department did not hold out any hopes, and did not give sympathetic consideration to the matter.  The conditions they put up regarding the collection of revenue were rather complicated, and almost impossible for growers to comply with. A special committee was set up to inquire into those conditions, but unfortunately the terms of reference were rather narrow.  The committee was only empowered to inquire into the question of revenue.  It was unable to go into the question of the possibilities in the development of tobacco-growing, and it recommended that a commission should be set up to inquire into that question.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance at that time seemed to have great hopes for the industry.  He spoke of planting its roots firmly, and in that I believe he was perfectly right.  It has a future, and is a very important branch of agriculture. It is an industry which, according to the statistics of the Department of Agriculture, gives the greatest number of hours of employment. Tobacco-growing per acre gives 748 hours' employment; potatoes, the next highest, 309 hours, and sugar-beet about 270 hours.  The tobacco crop is a quick-growing one.  By September it can be cleared off the land and preparations for another crop can be made.  It is a crop which affords profitable employment to the sons and daughters of the small farmers.  If wheat is sown after the tobacco crop it gives a very excellent yield.  It is a cash crop, and the farmer by September or October should be able to have his money out of it.  That puts him in the position of being able to get a proper price for his produce.  Tobacco is grown in the Colonies to a very large extent.  The market in England takes something like 299,000,000 lbs., and in Ireland we take something like <Col N="733" /> 7,000,000 or 8,000,000 lbs. of tobacco. Tobacco-growing is successful in the Colonies and in Denmark.  In South America it is a most successful crop, but they work under conditions quite different to what we do here, as in most cases the home market is free from duty.  That would seem an impossible proposition to the Revenue Department in this country, but I do not believe the growing of tobacco could be completely successful except under those conditions.  I understand that in Denmark only one-third of the revenue is charged.  The whole question, I suppose, cannot be decided except the Government sets up another committee to inquire not so much into the question of duty as to the possibilities of developing the industry, which has never been placed on anything like a commercial or businesslike basis.  It was purely and simply experimental, and for that reason it was impossible to get a uniform type of tobacco grown.</P>
    <P>And from the moment that the growers had gained sufficient experience to grow the crop successfully the scheme fell through, so that we have never had, perhaps, reasonable proof given as to whether the crop could be grown or not.  I can safely say that the men who have grown it up to the present have quite successfully grown it.  I have myself within the last month seen a leaf that is very suitable as a covering leaf for cigars.  It is very fine, without any stalk, and is as good as I have seen grown in the Bahia, the famous place of John Player and Sons.  I am not an expert but, to my mind, it is quite as good, and just as high in quality, so that I believe there is no reason why the industry could not be developed here, and there is no reason why the leaf could not be grown.  It has been tried here in different classes of land.  It is not a case that the County Meath might be suitable and others not suitable. That is not the case, because it has been grown all over Ireland and grown very successfully.</P>
    <P>The yield per acre, in 1921, on the average, was something like 900 lbs. It gives a very good return.  It was certainly successful in that year.  However, <Col N="734" /> from that year it gradually fell. In 1923 they turned out 721 lbs. to the acre.  In 1924 it fell to 411 lbs. to the acre, but there were other reasons for that.  The growers, I suppose, had lost confidence and they did not give the crop the attention it required and, I suppose, climatic conditions were not favourable.  But in all agricultural countries, and in the agricultural industry in general, I do not think it can be said that the conditions are favourable all the time throughout the year. There is no agricultural country in the world which has not difficulties to surmount, and most agricultural countries surmount the difficulties through proper scientific examination of the different questions with which they are confronted.  Of course, the weather is one thing that can only be got over to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>There are certain classes of seeds and crops which will survive against either great drought or too much rain, and if they are adopted, and proper methods of selection are followed, these difficulties can be partially got over.  The tobacco-growing industry could be profitably run if the revenue did not interfere with it so much.  People would be in a position to meet a couple of bad years when they had one or two good years as well.  After all, the agricultural industry in general will have one or two good years with a couple of middling, and one or two bad years. You cannot expect every year to be a good year and the same thing arises with the question of tobacco-growing. It gives an average price of about £130 per acre.  The fattening of cattle, and the raising of store cattle, in any particular year, would not give more.  The highest amount would be about £3 per acre, with labour expenditure of, say, 12/- or 14/-, so that tobacco-growing would be much more profitable.</P>
    <P>The point I have in my mind in speaking on this question of tobacco-growing is that I believe, after all the time that has been spent on it and the installations that have been made, it would be a great loss to allow the industry to die out without making some further effort, or making some inquiry, so as to be in a position to know whether it was possible to maintain the industry, or whether it was better to let it go by <Col N="735" /> the board.  That is simply my object in making these few remarks.  Like other people, I believe that the industry has a future, provided it gets the sympathetic consideration of a Government. Now that we have a national Government I suppose it is not out of place to ask at least sympathetic consideration for this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has given us a distinctly interesting and extremely comprehensive statement of the whole position, so that there is very little left for any other Deputy to say.  When Deputy O'Reilly began with Sir Walter Raleigh, I got a bit alarmed and I thought it would be a long time before we got to the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, but the Deputy gave us a brief synopsis of the history and did not keep us too long.  He skipped over the reign of James I, who regarded tobacco as a foul and stinking weed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regret that the Minister has found it necessary to introduce this estimate, but he is only carrying out a pledge given to this House by the Minister for Finance during one of the discussions that took place in the Dáil two years ago with regard to the reduction of the duty on home-grown tobacco. The Minister has taken a long time to carry out that pledge, but I am glad it is being carried out at last.  I hope, however, that the Minister for Agriculture will take to heart what Deputy O'Reilly has said and that he will not lose sight of the possibility of tobacco-growing in the country.  The present experiment, which has been going on for twenty years, does not seem to have been a success and it is now being wound up.  That is unfortunate, because it is likely to make it more difficult for anybody else to start a further experiment on these lines at a future date.  The Minister seems to be rather prejudiced against the growing of tobacco and he likened it on one occasion to the growing of tea in this country, forgetting the fact that about 100 years ago the greater part of the tobacco consumed in England was grown in Ireland.  I hope the Minister will not lose sight of this question and that if at any future time other people <Col N="736" /> decide to start this industry or to make experiments on more modern and more suitable lines, the Minister will give it his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. LAW Mr. LAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire in a few words, to join in the appeal that has been made to the Minister.  I do not pretend for an instant to be an expert in the matter, or to have given the subject the deep study which Deputy O'Reilly has evidently given to it, the fruits of which he allowed us to share to-day. If I may say so, his speech was one of the best that, in a long parliamentary experience, I have ever heard in this or any other Parliament. I have had occasion to study this question in the way that members must study many matters.  I have given a good many years to its consideration. People of my generation will probably associate with this business the name of an old friend, Mr. William Archer Redmond, who was one of the protagonists of the industry in the old days.  I recently had occasion to revive my acquaintance with the matter. Without, as I say, pretending in any way to have an expert knowledge of it, such study as I have been able to give it has left me very strongly with the feeling that we ought not to close this industry down and simply label it as a failure.  I feel that the conditions under which the former Committee of Inquiry sat were such as did not enable them to make a really full and sufficient survey of the question, and I think there is a clear case for a further inquiry.  I hope that one result of the debate will be that that inquiry will be ordered.  Now, it ought not to go out&mdash; though Deputy O'Reilly in his opening remarks, without intending it, may have conveyed such an impression&mdash;that there had been a failure, and that the failure was due to a misunderstanding on the part of the growers and re-handlers. I do not really know, but I imagine that is not so.  At all events, I am certain that it is not by any means the whole of the story.  As I understand it, the real fact is this that the industry was enabled for a good number of years to root itself, and to give, in proportion to its extent, a vast amount of employment.  Deputy O'Reilly said, I think, that it gave a <Col N="737" /> great deal of employment directly and indirectly, and that within a limited sphere it met with a considerable measure of success up to the time when all economic conditions were over-set during and after the Great War.</P>
      <P>One of the curious things to which we shall have to refer later in another debate is that the ruin of the Irish tobacco industry for the time being is apparently brought about by what appears to be a measure of protection&mdash; that is to say, by an extension of Imperial preference.  I do not want to go into that now.  I hope the House will have no hesitation in passing this, because I think it ought to be borne in mind that whatever losses have been met by Sir Nugent Everard they have been very considerable, and will be very considerable even if this is passed. They were incurred not by reason of any attempt to make a private profit for himself, but in large measure on behalf of the people of the locality.  A very large part of the liabilities that he assumed, he assumed, not on account of himself but, as Deputy O'Reilly has pointed out, on account of other growers in the County Meath.  I hope that the House will pass this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of the industry which perhaps deserves consideration.  In my neighbourhood a few years ago a gentleman started the growing of tobacco, out of which he manufactured nicotine sheep-dip. In this country we import considerable quantities of sheep-dip.  This foreign sheep-dip has practically driven everything else in that line out of the market.  I think it would be well if experiments were carried out to see whether it would be possible to manufacture a sheep-dip from tobacco grown in this country.  The idea is one well worthy of consideration.  Apart from the benefits that would be conferred by the growing of the tobacco, it would be very useful indeed to have the sheep-dip that we require manufactured here. The foreign manufactured sheep-dip at present used in the country contains, I understand, poison and arsenic, but the sheep-dip manufactured by this gentleman in my neighbourhood was non-poisonous.  I think it would be desirable for many reasons that non-poisonous <Col N="738" /> sheep-dip, if it could be made as effective by means of experiments as a poisonous sheep-dip, should be used here.  At present I understand the non-poisonous dips are not as effective as the others, but many grave reasons could be advanced as to why their use should be favoured.  If experiments could be carried out with a view to having manufactured here an effective non-poisonous sheep-dip, that undoubtedly would be a good thing for the country.  It would mean that the large sums of money at present going out of the country for the foreign manufactured dip would be retained here, and that as a result of the development of the industry considerable employment would be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MATTHEWS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join in the appeal of other Deputies to have further inquiries made as to the suitability of tobacco as a crop in this country.  The first experiment was started at a most unfortunate time.  I believe the principal cause of its comparative failure was the economic condition that arose during the Great War. It was started under certain conditions with a subsidy in 1912 or 1913, but the point is that the produce of other crops up to 1916 and 1917 became more profitable than tobacco.  The subsidy was not increased with the increased cost of production.  Labour became scarce and dear, and there were many other causes, with which Deputies are familiar, that led to a smaller area being devoted to the growing of the crop.  The growing of the crop was more or less dropped.  I live in the district where this experiment was carried out, and although in the first year or two Sir Nugent Everard got fairly easily a large acreage to be grown&mdash;an acreage that was fairly up to the amount contemplated by the scheme&mdash;afterwards because of labour conditions and other circumstances to which I have referred that arose during the Great War, the farmers dropped the growing of it, and Sir Nugent Everard did not get the acreage he required.  For that reason I think that, in normal times, a Committee of Inquiry should be set up to see would it be feasible to restore the industry, because acre for acre it gives <Col N="739" /> more employment than any other crop that one could possibly grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join in the appeal that has been made by other Deputies, but at the same time I would not have much confidence in an ad misericordiam appeal to the Minister at the moment.</P>
      <P>I have seen instructions issued through the Revenue Commissioners with the authority of the Minister for Finance to people who have grown this plant and stored it for the year 1925-26, and these people have been instructed &mdash;I think they have got notice&mdash;to have it consumed or destroyed by fire on the 24th December last.  I do not know if those instructions have been carried out, but I am aware that those instructions have been issued by the Revenue Commissioners, and in view of some of the recommendations made by a committee set up to inquire into this matter, I think those instructions are not in keeping with the sentiments of other Deputies on this Commission.  That Commission reported, and amongst other things recommended, that the tobacco now on hands should be used up, and if it were not suitable for a proper smoking mixture, it should be mixed in some ratio with foreign raw material and converted into some mild smoking mixture.  That would be all right, but those recommendations have not been considered and perhaps have been disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the case which has not been put to the House. You have three parties in this transaction&mdash;you have Sir Nugent Everard, the Minister for Agriculture and the growers.  I also understand some people grew this plant in 1918-19 and previous to that, but from 1821 they only got part payment for the amount sent to the re-handlers.  They only got something less than half.  For 1922-23 they have got nothing and the crop for 1924-25, and I think 1926, they have on hands and they are paying duty on it for keeping it in the sheds, in the hope sometime that they will get a sale for it. Now that the Minister for Finance has issued these instructions, the plant must <Col N="740" /> be destroyed.  It appears strange that such instructions should have been issued through the Revenue Commissioners. Above all, I do not know how the Minister for Finance can issue such instructions.  We have had sufficient combustion in this country, as he alleges, for some time, and it is not right for a Government Department to be consuming by fire stuff that people have grown by their own labour.  They have put up the sheds for storage, and will not be allowed to continue to hold the stuff any longer.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how far these people are to be taken consideration in the distribution of this Vote.  It appears to be a Vote for recoupment to the Minister for Finance for moneys advanced to Sir Nugent Everard on this experiment. Now that a third party comes into it, I would like to see some provision made if the experiment is to be discontinued.  If this expenditure is to go by the board, these people who have grown it in this area, who have stored it and spent time working for it, should be taken into consideration, and should get some compensation in proportion to the compensation awarded by this Vote to Sir Nugent Everard&mdash;a recoupment from the Minister for Agriculture.  I think they should at least be considered, and that the material they have on hands should be taken over and utilised for some purpose.  They should get out of the transaction in some equitable way.  In view of the statements made by other Deputies, I hope I am not sounding a despairing note, but I do not think any representations have been made or due consideration given, but in any case I would only be too glad to advocate that the experiment should not be discontinued, that it should get another chance, and that the Government should consider the question and do what they can to foster this industry.  As regards the recommendations issued by a committee of this House&mdash;I think it was to inquire into it&mdash;we have not been informed officially that those recommendations have been rejected or not, so I would ask the Minister, in replying, to state how far he is going to go to recoup the growers, who are small farmers and to what extent he is going to compensate them for out-of-pocket losses.</P>

      <P>When a reference was made by one of the Deputies who spoke on this matter to a nicotine sheep dip I observed a smile of incredulity on the faces of certain Deputies.  It might be information to them to know that in 1921 the Cork County Council, under the compulsory Dipping Order, purchased Irish manufactured nicotine dip. I believe it was from Stewart's of Waterford. It was used all over the county, and not alone was that dip effective for the purpose for which dip is ordinarily used, but on the statement of the farmers and wool buyers the wool was at least 20 per cent. better in quality than the wool of sheep which were dipped in the poisonous arsenical article.  That should be taken into consideration by the Minister for Agriculture. The one objection, of course, is the price, but if tobacco were manufactured here to a greater extent than it was a few years ago the price would go down, and thus it would not be necessary to import foreign sheep dip.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Law that Sir Nugent Everard entered into this in an impersonal way, in the interests of the country, as he thought.  But in regard to those losses on behalf of others it will be found that the growers got back portion of the subsidy I mentioned at the outset.  I disagree with Deputy O'Reilly that these experiments failed for want of attention.  It got the most <Col N="742" /> practicable of all forms of attention. The soil and climate might not be suitable, but we certainly fertilised the land on the taxpayers' money.  Experiments were going on during the war. It was not the ideal period to carry out experiments, but they continued after the war, and the subsidy was increased indirectly by the Government.  It was £25 per acre.  The greater part was passed on to the growers and amounted to something in respect to the acreage not grown which was very small.  In addition to that there was a rebate of duty.  There was a preference given against Imperial tobacco and all other tobacco.  While I have not the exact figures before me, I think I am not far wrong in saying that the subsidy for the last three years of the experiment was something like £100 an acre, one way or another.</P>

      <P>It started with £25 an acre, but the Deputy can take it that the subsidy, whether rebate or otherwise, would run to about £100 an acre. That is what it comes to.  That is a simple calculation.  If you compare the taxation on Irish-grown tobacco with the taxation on either Imperial tobacco or foreign tobacco you will find that it gets a preference which amounted to something like £100 an acre.  It failed notwithstanding that.  How can it be said that this crop could come to anything in that state of affairs?  It is said that there is a by-product in sheep-dip, but if there is a valuable by-product it merely helps the grower to sell his crop.  It merely helps him to get a better price.  With all these advantages in favour of it, with a by-product for which there was a big demand in the country and with a huge subsidy against foreign and Imperial-grown tobacco, nevertheless the crop could not be sold at a price which would cover the cost of production.  I do not see there is any answer to these figures. <Col N="743" /> Tobacco can be grown in this country. Even tea can be grown in this country, excellent tea.  Tomatoes can be grown here.  Wheat can be grown.  I do not want to draw a parallel between the growing of wheat and tobacco, but the same fallacy underlies the two arguments. All these things could be grown here I agree.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Reilly that we could grow tobacco in this country probably for the purpose of cigars and for cigar-coverings, the outside leaf of which would be as good as the tobacco grown in South America or wherever the best tobacco is grown.  That is so, but at what price?  You cannot buy the climate of South America even at £100 an acre, and we cannot grow tobacco, even to buy it at that price, to compare with the tobacco grown in Kentucky and other places like that.  You cannot do that, but if £100 is not enough you can pay £200 an acre, and if £200 is not enough you can pay £300. On those lines you could grow any crop, but to agriculturists I would say that if the taxpayer can afford to pay £100 an acre then why not give something for potatoes, something for mangolds or turnips, something for the commoner garden crops that nobody ever thinks about&mdash;oats, and so on?  As regards tobacco, you may call me prejudiced, but I do hold that there is no future in this country for tobacco-growing except by a subsidy, which would be a complete robbery of the taxpayer and would show a complete extravagance and want of perspective in case of the Government which would enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, is a book-keeping transaction.  The Minister for Finance is getting nothing out of it.  It is simply empowering the Minister for Finance to waive a claim which he has against Sir Nugent Everard.  I think, in all equity, that that should be done.  There is no doubt Sir Nugent Everard and the grower made a genuine attempt to establish an industry here.  Sir Nugent Everard took over most of the responsibility for handling the tobacco.  He put all his time and energy into it in a completely impersonal way, without looking for anything for himself and <Col N="744" /> in the hope that when finished a tobacco industry would be established in the country.  It is due to him that we should treat him, I will not say generously, but fairly.  We are not treating him generously.  It is an equitable bargain in all the circumstances.  On the one side of the picture you have that claim of £17,000.  We have not been able to go into that.  On the other side, the Minister for Finance claimed £11,000, and the proposal is to stand back to back and leave it so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="746" /> This is the first occasion on which a Supplementary Vote for this purpose has been asked for although there was a deficiency of income since 1st May, 1925, when the first half-yearly payment to the Land Bond Fund fell due for interest on the Land Bonds issued for the purchase of untenanted land.  On 1st May, 1925, and the two subsequent half-years the Land Commission made good this deficiency by temporarily borrowing from other funds under their control.  The total of such borrowing up to 1st May was £21,611 11s. 2d. The Minister for Finance when sanctioning the temporary borrowing required to meet the half-yearly payment to the Land Bond Fund directed that an estimate should be introduced to make provision for the repayment of the £21,611 11s. 2d. and to meet a possible deficency in the half-year to the 1st November, 1927.  This deficiency should be divided under three heads&mdash;first of all arrears.  As soon as practicable after the acquisition of land, the lands are divided amongst suitable allottees who are required to sign either an undertaking to purchase parcels or an agreement for temporary convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In either case the allottees have to pay 4¾ per cent. interest on the purchase price of their parcels by half-yearly payments on the gale days, 1st November and 1st May.  In all half-yearly payments to the Land Commission there is always a certain amount not paid punctually, and in the case of land purchase annuities the amount of arrears due to unpunctual payments is temporarily advanced from the Guarantee Fund.  But in the case of these half-yearly interest payments by allottees of untenanted land the Guarantee Fund is not drawn on, and the Land Commission have to provide for the temporary arrears in some other way, and that is a big factor in the total amount of the deficiency.  The second reason for the deficiency is two months' interest in advance.  The payments to the Land Bond Fund from bonds issued for the purchase of estates must provide interest calculated up to the dividend days the 1st January and the 1st July, while the payments due by the tenants provide interest up to the gale <Col N="747" /> days, the 1st November and 1st May. There is consequently a gap of two months to be bridged.</P>
    <P>Under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1923, each tenant purchaser of a tenanted holding subject to a standard purchase annuity is obliged to pay this two months' interest in advance on his first annuity payment.  The Land Commission has to provide this two months' interest on bonds issued for the purchase of untenanted land, which accounts for £15,000 of the total deficiency. This two months' interest is recouped to the Land Commission when the lands become vested in the allottees as tenant purchasers, subject to tenant purchasers' annuities.  The third reason for the deficiency is rates, herds' wages, and other estate outgoings that the Commission has to bear.  During the time between the purchase of the untenanted land by the Land Commission and its subsequent division amongst allottees, the Land Commission becomes liable for rates, herds' wages, and other estate outgoings of various kinds, in addition to the 4¾ per cent. interest on the purchase money, and it is not possible in many cases to secure an income from these lands by making temporary lettings for grazing or in conacre, or by taking in cattle for grazing, at prices sufficiently high to cover all these liabilities.  It is difficult to regulate the proceedings for the purchase and re-sale of land so that re-sale schemes can be put into operation simultaneously with the taking possession of the lands by the Land Commission. It sometimes happens, for instance, that at the last moment approved allottees decline to sign agreements to purchase, or the temporary convenience agreements.  Proposed migrants refuse to migrate, or exchange arrangements are not completed, and sometimes perhaps the selected tenants refuse to sign the agreements because they may be dissatisfied, for instance, with the striping arrangements, and so on.  Various other circumstances arise which necessitate the retention of the land in the hands of the Commission, and naturally involve loss of income.</P>
    <P>I have stated already that £15,000 of this money will be recouped to the <Col N="748" /> Land Commission when the lands are finally vested in the allottees as tenant purchasers.  The arrears due to the non-payment of letting and grazing rents amount to nearly £9,000, so that you can assume that the approximate total net loss will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of £10,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given us the headings under which this £35,000 is made up, and I am glad to know that it is not all because of interest due on land lying on the hands of the Land Commission, as we are having various complaints from all over the country of the great delay on the part of the Land Commission in the distribution of land.  First of all there is the delay from the time they take over the estate until the people are put into possession, and, second, the delay in vesting.  I am inclined to think that a good portion of this £15,000 is due to the fact that land is lying in the hands of the Land Commission without being allotted.  There may be a difficulty at times, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, in getting allottees to sign, but I think the difficulty is very often on the other side, that the allottees are quite prepared to sign but that the Land Commission will not ask them to sign, and I think that the Land Commission have themselves to blame in most cases where this land is lying on their hands.  If £15,000 out of this amount is due for interest, as I understand the Parliamentary Secretary said, for the land lying on their hands, that would mean, at 4¾ per cent., that there would be something like £400,000 worth of land on their hands waiting to be distributed. I know that on a Supplementary Vote of this sort it would be impossible&mdash;in any case, to-day&mdash;to go into all the faults of the Land Commission, but at any rate, as it does appear unsatisfactory that a Vote of this sort should be coming up and that it is quite evidently due to the delay of the Land Commission in dealing with cases that should be dealt with more expeditiously, I think that we cannot allow this Vote to go through without opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the remarks of Deputy Ryan, I would like to bring before the House a case which I think it has heard of before.  It has been admitted&mdash;at least, we can assume so from the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that a considerable proportion of this Vote is necessitated by the fact that the Land Commission in certain cases has been slow to come to terms with allottees in cases where the latter disputed the fairness of the division or the fairness of the annuity it was proposed to set on the land.  I have in mind a case in relation to the Ging estate in County Dublin.  If my information is correct that estate was purchased in September, 1924.  It is now March, 1928.  The estate has not yet been divided, and if my information as to the price paid for the estate is correct, the amount of the accumulated interest due on that estate, interest which would normally have been paid by the tenants, is now something in the nature of £1,400, amounting, I think, to almost 12 per cent. of the total arrears of interest which have accumulated in this way, and due to this cause.  At any rate, it was April, 1926, before the Land Commission had completed its scheme for the division of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the applicants to whom the lands were to be allotted had an opportunity of inspecting the lands and of hearing the terms upon which they were to get them, they considered that these terms were inequitable, and appointed a committee to deal with the Land Commission in the matter.  The Commission was high and mighty, on occasions was too proud even to answer letters, and it refused to meet this committee. Several T.D's for the constituency, including members of the Government Party, and even a member of the Government, were brought in, and ultimately the Land Commission, which had refused to meet the allottees' committee <Col N="750" /> in June, 1927, intimated to the Minister for External Affairs, as he then was&mdash;the present Minister for Defence&mdash;that they were considering the whole of their proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in June, 1927.  Nothing further has been heard of the matter by the tenants, and so far as we know, and I suppose so far as the past records of the Commission would indicate, nothing further will be heard until this time twelve months.</P>
      <P>At any rate, one of the points which I think the House ought to consider is this, that here was a case where ultimately, after a considerable amount of pressure, the Land Commission admitted that there were grounds for reconsideration. But on the 10th January of last year, an official of the Land Commission addressed a letter of this description to the tenants:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You are requested to attend at Calliagnstown on the 18th instant, at 12 o'clock, for the purpose of taking over possession of the parcel of land on above estate, which was pointed out to you some time ago.  (It was pointed out to him about nine months before that).</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You have already been informed of the price, and you are to understand there will be no reduction in same.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Failing your acceptance on the date mentioned of their offer, the Land Commission will make other arrangements to dispose of the parcel, and any application from you for land at any future time will not be entertained.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely that was a letter designed to intimidate the applicants in this case, in which I repeat the Land Commission has already admitted there are grounds for reconsideration.  If it is the case that there are grounds for such reconsideration, then a letter of that sort could not properly be written by the Land Commission.  The point I want to make is this: We have to pass a Supplementary Vote to-day, a large portion of which is represented by arrears accumulated owing to the fact that the Land Commission has been <Col N="751" /> unable in a number of cases to come to terms with the proposed allottees to the land.  Here is a case which has been dragging on now for almost four years, a case where, after over twelve months' negotiations, the Commission itself admitted there were grounds for reconsideration, and yet, after having made that admission, nothing has been done to indicate to the allottees' committee that that reconsideration had in fact taken place, and that the situation, after reconsideration, was any different from what it was before, because before that the allottees were convinced that they could not accept the land on the terms suggested by the Land Commission, and that if they did accept it they would be unable to meet the annuities.  I am not a farmer and I am not familiar with agricultural conditions, but I have placed the facts in this case before members of our Party who are practical farmers, and they agree with me that the annuities proposed in this particular case are certainly well above the average, and are such as would make it a very doubtful proposition for any man to accept.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the matter any further, but I certainly think the facts I have submitted call for speedy investigation into this matter, and if possible for speedy settlement.  The people are not unreasonable.  They want the land, but they want it at a price which will enable them to make a livelihood out of it and enable them to meet the liabilities which its acceptance will impose on them.  I think that is a fair way to meet them.  They appointed a committee to deal with the Land Commission in a businesslike way.  The Commission refused to deal with them, but afterwards, I think through the intervention of a member of the Government, the Land Commission reconsidered that attitude, and did ultimately deal with one particular member of the committee.  I think this is a case where, instead of the Land Commission continuing to ride the high horse, it ought to come down to the ordinary level of the man-in-the-street, meet these representatives, and have a settlement of the case, instead <Col N="752" /> of permitting these arrears to accumulate as a charge on the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>One is always placed in rather a difficult position when one has to resume a speech after the lapse of a week.  I had endeavoured to deal with Deputy Lemass's motion and some of the arguments that were put forward by those who support it, but I propose to be merciful; I do not propose even to summarise the arguments I put forward last week.  I think that in the arguments for Deputy Lemass's motion there are one or two points, before I finally come to Deputy O'Connell's amendment, with which I would like to deal.  In view of the fact that Deputy Flinn was unable to complete his argument it would be wrong to refer to it at length, but the picture Deputy Flinn drew of the relation of higher civil servants with Ministers was a most fantastic and a most unreal one.  He used, and I think reiterated, the phrase that civil servants hold their positions at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council, and he argued that they could not be suitable for the Tariff Commission for that reason. Technically he is right, but in practice the relations of civil servants to Ministers is not that of the adoring slave to the commanding despot, as Deputy Flinn suggested.</P>

      <P>Sometimes, I agree. I am very glad that my point is taken <Col N="755" /> up by Deputy O'Kelly.  But it is not the case that three higher civil servants sitting as a Commission are necessarily under the thumb of Ministers to such an extent as to rob them of all freedom of action or of all independence of action. As Deputy Flinn is not here, I will not pursue that point further, but I wanted to point out that the inference drawn was a wrong one.</P>
      <P>We might consider what type of men you do need on a commission of this kind.  I am not going into the subject of judicial functions, but I would say that for ripe judgement on a commission of this kind you need men who can see both sides of a question, and that faculty does not necessarily attach to persons who have knowledge of agricultural and industrial conditions.  I have known more than one business man who made a great success of his business, simply because he only saw one side of the question, and that was his own side.  You will not, going among business men, necessarily find that faculty for forming judgement, for deciding between two opposite courses. On the other hand, you will find it among people of legal training and among civil servants, particularly in the higher grades, who have been accustomed to giving decisions on matters in connection with which they get a mass of papers and minutes which they have to disentangle in order to form a judgement.  Another advantage attaching to the civil servant is the fact that he is disinterested in so far as anybody can be; or if he is interested at all, it is from the point of view of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Business has many reactions.  Very often men whose principal line would be one particular business are, nevertheless, directors or shareholders in other businesses.  It would be very hard to find five business men who had no connection, direct or indirect, with any of the industries for which tariffs might be demanded.  I think that is common knowledge.  They might be interested even in a carrying company, and a great many people are railway shareholders.  It would not be fair, for instance, to ask Deputy Good to form an opinion on builders' materials.  He <Col N="756" /> would be directly interested, and he would not have that detached judgment that is necessary and that it is possible for a civil servant to have. That is why I think the existing system is better than the system which Deputy Lemass seeks to substitute.</P>
    <P>I come now to Deputy O'Connell.  So far as I can gather from his amendment, it seeks to maintain the present Commission, and endeavours to make it a full-time Commission.  I am sure that neither Deputy O'Connell nor any member of his Party would stand for victimisation.  I presume the Commissioners, therefore, would retain the salaries they now have with whatever pensionable rights they may enjoy.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Good pointed out, the amount of work possible for a Tariff Commission would be limited and if the present members of the Commission were on a full-time basis, as is suggested in the amendment, big changes would be necessary. It would mean in practice that you would have to promote three new civil servants to do the work previously done by these gentlemen.  You are thereby adding to the salary roll and the pension roll and you are also depriving the State of the services of three efficient officials.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Corish would read the amendment, which says that the members of the Commission are to investigate the position of any industry and the possibilities of fostering such industry or protecting it against foreign competition. Is all that to be done within twelve months in connection with industries which we have not got now but which we may foster?  Is all that to be done inside twelve months?  I wish I could get the minds of the Labour Party on this subject.  I hope Deputy Davin or Deputy Corish will speak after me and then I will know.  As far as I can see, it is intended to relieve the three present Tariff Commissioners from their positions.  Their posts will have to be filled, particularly in regard to the Stationery Office and the Secretaryship to the Minister for Finance.  These posts will have to be filled.  Are these men to go back to their posts and displace the people who hold them, or are we to have a new head of the Stationery Office and a new Secretary to the Minister for Finance?  I should say anything that involved the loss to the State of these officers, and particulary of one, would be a great misfortune. Those of us who have been studying the Estimates for years know that there is no department in which there was such a fall as in the Stationery Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one portion of the amendment for which I have nothing but praise, and that is paragraph 2&mdash;&ldquo;to report on the probable effect of methods of assisting and protecting any industry by methods other than Customs duties.&rdquo;  I think, when the time comes for a Tariff Commission Act, that might very well be embodied. There is a preference which, I think, is already given in Government purchases. It should certainly be open to the Tariff Commissioners to recommend that a preference of eight or ten per cent. in all Government purchases might be given in order to establish and promote industry.  I would go further than Deputy O'Connell, and I would extend the powers of the Commission recommending the revocation of any tariff that, after five or six years' working, does not seem to have justified <Col N="758" /> itself.  So far I am with Deputy O'Connell, but where I part company with him is where he has included the words: &ldquo;That the Commission... should have power... on its own initiative to investigate the position of any industry and the possibility of fostering such industry...&rdquo;  On its own initiative!  That gives a roving commission to these three Commissioners to go into any industry, whether it wants protection or not, and say: &ldquo;We think you ought to have it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You are not, as Deputy Good said last Friday, going to promote or encourage industry by that method.  You are not going to bring capital into the country and interest industrialists in the country.  I know one industry in which it would have the effect of inducing the firm, which has a branch factory across the water, to transfer its activities to that branch factory and so cause unemployment in the city of Dublin.  Capital is a very shy bird indeed, and it will not be encouraged to invest its money in a country where Tariff Commissioners would be permitted to make investigations and say: &ldquo;We have decided that you have to get a tariff whether you want it or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that the real matter is if the people want a tariff. We all know from these Benches that what people want is what the Fianna Fáil Party want; they interpret themselves from the point of view of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>While I thank Deputy Lemass for his compliment, might I say that the House was rather empty before I began.  Another point that has to be taken into consideration is, if the Tariff Commission is to have powers on its own initiative to investigate as to what industries might require a tariff, if they are given that power, they will have to produce evidence, and they will require a very considerable staff, which is another and a different matter.  The preparation of a case is very often a matter in which a considerable amount of time and very often, too, a considerable amount of money would have to be spent.  If the Tariff Commission is to be given this initiative, and if they are to establish that there is a case for protection in a particular industry, they will have to make investigations not only here but in other countries where the competing industries are, and they will require a staff of accountants and examiners, and people who will have to get information.  That proposal is going to involve the State in an expenditure of a very substantial sum of money which might or might not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But apart from that matter, the third and final objection is that if you set up a permanent Tariff Commission, as I infer from Deputy O'Connell's amendment&mdash;and I will be glad to hear further from the Deputy on that point &mdash;that Tariff Commission is going to be a very great power in this State, a power that may interfere with the supreme authority of the Dáil.  It is very useful, I think, to have a Tariff Commission to investigate and take evidence and make recommendations, but the ultimate authority in matters of finance must rest here, and nowhere else, or the whole fabric of democracy totters.  A permanent Tariff Commission with greater knowledge and acquiring experience might become a <Col N="760" /> dangerous rival to the Dáil.  The people might look upon it as a greater authority and a greater power in the land, with more influence and with more power to promote industry and give employment than the Dáil.  For that reason, I think, the existing arrangement of a Tariff Commission, consisting of servants of the State who, when their work on the Tariff Commission is done, will return to their ordinary work, is the best solution, the most democratic solution, and certainly the most economical solution.</P>

      <P>While supporting Deputy Lemass's motion with reference to Deputy O'Connell's amendment, in paragraph No. 3 there is a matter which I think he left out, but without its insertion you would have an evil that exists in Australia and other countries where tariffs are in operation, namely, the inflationary process which occurs when you go about insuring a satisfactory standard of working conditions for employees.

    <P>That is quite compatable, I submit, with No. 3.  The only other thing I have to say is this that Deputy Good in his speech opposing the motion referred to the disturbance the setting up of a Tariff Commission would create. He spoke of trade disturbance.  I submit that Deputy Good represents the distributive trade in this country, the <Col N="761" /> distributive trade of English manufacturers, and that that was his motive in saying that.  That trade would certainly be disturbed because the business would be taken from them.  Deputy Cooper spoke about capital being a shy bird and a kind of hot-house plant.  There would be no harm to give it a good Irish wilting and there would be no harm if Deputy Cooper and Deputy Good and the rest did realise this fact that if all these people who claim to be the custodians of capital in Ireland cleared out of this country that Irish industry and Ireland itself would progress.  When the Czars and the Princes and the rest of them cleared out of Russia, the next morning we were told that the whole Russian population fell dead from starvation, but Russia lives.  In America, after the War of Independence, when people sailed from New York Harbour, when the people who took the side of England in that war left, America went on and thrived&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I submit they should not use duress or threats against the setting up of this Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite correct to say that when the Minister for Finance was justifying the Tariff Commission Act in this House on a previous occasion he gave an undertaking or expressed an opinion that if in his opinion it became desirable to make the Commission a permanent body, or if the necessity for such a course arose he would be prepared to go that far or to remove the Commissioners at any rate from the position which Civil servants occupy, to remove them temporarily from the positions so as to enable them to do the work of the Tariff Commission as expeditiously as possible.  The whole cause of this motion is that in the opinion of Deputy Lemass and his Party, the Tariff Commission, as at present constituted, is unsuitable for dealing expeditiously with applications they receive for the imposition of tariffs.</P>
      <P>I think a case has been made for these reasons, and the question that arises now is whether the individuals who would be required to carry on this very important work on behalf of the nation should be drawn from the Civil Service or from individuals outside who might, and probably would, be interested parties.  Personally I held the view, when the Tariff Commission was being set up, that it would have been better if we had a chairman who was a non-civil servant, an outsider sitting with two civil servants.  I agree with Deputy Cooper that it would be absolutely impossible in the present state of affairs in this country to get five outsiders, non-civil servants, who would be absolutely detached and who would be capable of undertaking work of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise merely for the purpose of dealing with what Deputy Cooper said. Apparently he is alarmed because he feels that civil servants, able men, as we all know, who compose the present Tariff Commission, would be withdrawn permanently from the positions they occupy in the Civil Service and <Col N="763" /> be put on permanent work in connection with the Tariff Commission.  I submit, if such a position arises and if, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance and the Executive Council, it would be desirable and necessary to appoint certain civil servants to such a Commission for a stated period, it would be for the Ministry alone to judge as to whether men occupying positions on the Tariff Commission would be more useful in carrying on that work than in retaining the positions they occupy.  I believe that one or two men who are on the present Tariff Commission are perhaps the ablest civil servants in this State, and are as good as, if not better than, civil servants in any other States.  I say that in so far as the Chairman of the Commission is concerned, and I wonder if many Deputies know the amount of work which this particular individual has to do in the civil service.  The wonder is how he can carry on all the work he is called on to do.  I am of opinion that there is sufficient work before the Tariff Commission, no matter who may be the individuals who compose that body, for a number of years to come which will justify the Ministry asking those who make up that body to do that work as a whole-time job.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Minister for Finance has yet come to that conclusion, but, if not, perhaps he will justify the delay that takes place in dealing with applications that have already been made to the Tariff Commission. Deputy Good talks about the additional expense and perhaps, pensions that would be involved in appointing higher civil servants to carry on in a permanent way the work of such a Commission, and at the same time removing them from their ordinary positions in the Civil Service.  I suggest that whatever may be the salaries of men who would be called on to carry out the work of such a Commission, it would be well worth paying what this House would be willing to pay if the industries of the country are to be developed in the way in which the people of the country expect they should.</P>
    <P>The inquiries that should be made which would lead up to the development of industries should be carried <Col N="764" /> out by men who have an intimate knowledge of the administrative services of the State and the salary, even though it might be the highest salary to be attached to any position in the Civil Service, would be well worth paying to the men who would be called on to perform that work.  Deputy Cooper talked about Deputy Good's statement. We know that if Deputy Good had his way there would be no tariffs and no Tariff Commission.  We can assume from what he has said in the House already that he would be against any Tariff Commission being given work of the kind set out in the motion of Deputy Lemass and in Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  I want to know from Deputy Lemass before he replies whether he or his Party accept item 3 in the amendment of Deputy O'Connell. I gathered from Deputy Lemass, when moving his motion, that he took the view that it would be unfair to insist that an industry that would get safeguards, protection, or bounties should be called on by the State, or by the people who give that assistance, to see that proper safeguards and working conditions were given to people employed in those industries.</P>

I hope that the Deputy will deal at length with that matter and make the position of his Party clear when he replies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HANLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose the motion of Deputy Lemass, and, with equal force, Deputy O'Connell's amendment. I do so not because I am in any way in favour of the constitution of the present Tariff Commission.  I think the Minister for Finance will agree that tariffs have a large bearing on the cost of living. that they have, in fact, increased the cost of living, and one of my objections to the constitution of the present Tariff Commission is that we <Col N="765" /> have on it three civil servants whose salary and bonus depend on the cost of living.  I do not say anything against the honour of the men who compose the present Commission, but I say that it is wrong for the Government to put three civil servants as judges in their own cause as to what they are to get under the cost of living bonus.  I hold that the constitution of the present Commission is wrong, that you might as well ask a judge of the High Court to deal with a case in which he himself is financially interested as to ask three civil servants to deal with the question of tariffs when that question affects them in their own salaries.  For that reason I am totally opposed to the present constitution of the Tariff Commission.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Lemass or Deputy O'Connell had put down a motion to abolish the present Tariff Commission I would be heart and soul with them, because I do not want tariffs.  I think the Government were quite wrong and, if I were here when that Commission was first appointed, I would have pointed out that these men were not proper persons to deal with the question of tariffs.  I think I would be out of order if I touched on tariffs in a general way.  I am confined entirely to the constitution of the Tariff Commission.  I have nothing further to add except to say that the present Tariff Commission is not fair to the people of the country and it is not fair to the men who compose it to ask them to be appointed by the Government to be judges in their own cause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CARNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a note of a couple of points mentioned during the discussion on the motion.  Deputy Cooper said preference was given in the case of army purchases.  In question No. 8 on the Order Paper to-day the Minister for Finance was asked if he was aware that there were 100 farriers unemployed in Dublin as a direct result of the importation of foreign-made horse shoes, but the Minister evidently did not know there were farriers unemployed in Dublin.  He would not consider the advisability of putting a tariff on imported horse shoes, for he said that was a question that should come up in the ordinary way before the Tariff Commission.  It was to deal with cases such as that&mdash;men who are unable <Col N="766" /> to put their case before the present Tariff Commission&mdash;it is proposed to change the composition of the Commission. Again, in question No. 15, the Minister for Defence was asked whether he was aware that army horses were being shod with imported machine-made shoes.  When the Free State Army was being established it was the rule to purchase as far as possible Irish-made materials.  To give one case in point, 40,000 pairs of American boots were offered to the army at 5/- per pair, but the offer was not accepted because it was held that the boots should be of Irish manufacture.  Evidently it is getting out of fashion to hold that view now, for every galloping major in the Free State Army must have his horse shod with English-made shoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question, of course, tariffs and Tariff Commissions are like red rags to Deputy Cooper.  That Deputy tried, if I may use a colloquialism, to put the breeze up us by telling us that the whole fabric of democracy was tottering.  I did not know whether we should buy steel helmets or running shoes when I heard that.  Deputy O'Hanlon said he objected to the presence of Civil Servants on the Tariff Commission, because he held that tariffs affected the salaries and bonuses of civil servants, and consequently they could not be held to be unbiased in their decisions.  That suggestion was made, though not in quite the same words, from these benches, and, of course, the whole fabric of the opposite benches fell on top of us.  I am not saying whether it was democracy or not.  We were accused of terrible things because we made that suggestion, but now we have it coming from Deputy O'Hanlon.  Strange to say, the opposite view is held by Deputy Cooper who claims these civil servants are absolutely unbiased because he knew of cases where higher civil servants had as much authority as Cabinet Ministers. As a matter of fact, it was a toss-up with him whether the dog wagged the tail, or the tail wagged the dog.  It is strange to have Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Cooper disagreeing on this question of tariffs.  I do not see why there should be such a divergence of opinion on these matters.  It is obvious, <Col N="767" /> from the instance I have quoted with regard to horse shoes, that certain people would benefit materially by tariffs, and that the present Tariff Commission does not cater for these people. It was in order to cater for people who do not ordinarily come within the scope of the present Tariff Commission that Deputy Lemass brought forward his motion.  To any person who gives the matter a little thought it will be perfectly clear that the Tariff Commission as at present constituted does not cater for all classes of trades and tradespeople. It it were differently constituted, and its functions were outlined in some other manner and given wider scope these people could be catered for, and it is for that reason Deputy Lemass brought forward his motion.</P>

If interested parties were to sit in judgment on their own interests fair play could not be expected. Civil servants would be disinterested in giving judgment on questions that come before the Commission.  We must have confidence in our civil servants. It seems to me that a fellow-countryman of mine was right when he said it is impossible to get unbiased men to act where there are conflicting interests. In my opinion it is best to have the Tariff Commission composed of civil servants, independent men, men whom Deputy J. J. Byrne described a little while ago as not having their equals in the country, a description which was re-echoed by the Labour Party.  We certainly can expect fair-play from civil servants on a Tariff Commission, and I congratulate the Government in setting up a Commission composed of such able, energetic and disinterested men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very appropriate this debate should be linked up with the debate on the old age pensions, for they both have a big bearing on each other.  Yesterday we decided by a narrow majority that the production of the country at present would not enable us to pay so much as 10/- <Col N="768" /> per week to every old age pensioner over 70 years of age.  Nearly everyone in the House expressed regret that such was so.  Well, here is a debate in which those who regretted it so much are afforded the opportunity of showing they so desire to increase production that at least 10/- per week will be soon possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember that in this we are not discussing, practically speaking, a contentious question.  Except perhaps for Deputy O'Hanlon and half a dozen others.  I think the House generally agrees that tariffs are a means of stimulating production.  The President has said that &ldquo;frankly, we are a protectionist Party.&rdquo;  One would be almost driven to the conclusion that that statement was, like the statement in regard to prosperity, intended largely for export, but when it came to the test as regards sharing the prosperity with the old people, it was not found possible to justify it.  I am afraid the statement that &ldquo;frankly, we are a protectionist Party&rdquo; has also to be modified.  In fact, it is to be forgotten as quickly as possible.  Some very extraordinary arguments have been advanced against the motion of Deputy Lemass.  The Minister for Justice started with the most amazing statement of all, that this was hasty legislation.  I think he repeated that statement more than once.  It looks curious that a motion to increase the personnel of the Tariff Commission from three to five, to make them whole-time instead of part-time, instead of the Chairman of the Commission having to attend the Tariff Commission after he has acted as Secretary to the Department of Finance, or after he has acted as a member of the Currency Commission, or as a member of the Economy Committee and several other things as well, should be described as hasty legislation. Yet the statement was accepted by several Deputies on the opposite side of the House.  Deputy Bennett, of Limerick, I remember, repeated it, while Deputy Cooper crowned it by calling it &ldquo;Stop Press legislation.&rdquo; One wonders what meaning words have at all.  I believe there was a poet once who said that, under the influence of spiritual exaltation, men realise that <Col N="769" /> things are not what they seem.  I would not like to assert that all the Deputies who spoke from the other side of the House were labouring under spiritual exaltation, but there must be some explanation for it.  We believe, and, we are quite satisfied, that the opinion of the world that tariffs are a means of stimulating production is a sane opinion.  We do not think we are such superior people that we have found better methods than they have found, but we have brought forward this motion with the honest motive of speeding up the work of enforcing protection.</P>
    <P>I happen to know that influential supporters of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have been active in endeavouring to get the Whips taken off in this debate.  One of them told me that he was endeavouring to do it and had got good support for it, and hoped it would be brought about. Well, evidently there are reasons against it, and the Whips are not being taken off.  That is a big surprise. Apart from the old age pensions debate or anything else, the evidence that exists that the towns in the Saorstát are in a shocking condition of poverty and decay, that they are doing nothing to justify their existence, and that the farmers are unable to carry the burden of the towns on their shoulders at the present time, is known to everyone. The amazing thing is that a body of farmers should meet, as they did recently at the Farmers' Union, and congratulate themselves that they have been influential in stopping what they called the &ldquo;tariff ramp&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, that they have been influential in preventing the towns from doing something that would justify their existence, and something to contribute to the social services that the towns themselves are making such a demand for and which cost so much.  The amazing thing is that the farmers, while bewailing their own sad lot and the bad conditions that exist for them, set out to congratulate themselves on having been able to achieve such a position.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the importer elements in this country are so very influential and have got such a tremendous command of the Press that they <Col N="770" /> have been able to carry on propaganda that has blinded very many thousands of people and so dulled the minds of the members of the Farmers' Union that these men contradict themselves every time they speak on this subject. There are other industries that need protection at the present time.  In some cases they are industries of very great importance to the farmer.  Though it is not a pleasant thing to name an individual firm, I happen to know that the firm of Goulding, Limited, have been applying to the Government for some help for their industry, although they are not prepared to go before the Tariff Commission.  I wonder will Deputy Heffernan and his colleagues applaud this if some day it is announced in the newspapers that that big firm, which is so essential to the farming community, has closed down?  Only within the past month another very old firm in the same business has closed down.  It is well known, or at least it ought to be well known, to the leaders of the farming community that that firm is in great difficulties.</P>
    <P>This motion has been put down with a view to meeting cases like that.  The existence of that firm is of as much importance to the humblest man in the country as it is to the directors of the firm, and therein lies our big fault with the present Tariff Commission.  We hold that the people working in that industry have at least as much interest, in many cases more interest, in seeing that the industry is maintained in a prosperous condition as those who are directing it.  There are several other examples that could be quoted.  It may not be known in the House, but I can tell Deputies, that at a commercial exhibition in London last November, a vehicle exhibition, the rumour went out that there was to be an immediate tariff imposed on motor bus bodies. Immediately that rumour went out, some people connected with the coach-building industry in this country who happened to be present at the exhibition were surrounded by agents for commercial vehicles, giving them orders. The whole difficulty was: &ldquo;When will you be able to deliver?&rdquo; One man who was present booked thousands of pounds' worth of orders, but before the exhibition was over word arrived <Col N="771" /> that the Dáil had adjourned.  These people were safe then for another three months, and every one of the orders was cancelled.  Deputy Heffernan is in the happy position to-day that the biggest town in his constituency has, according to the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; the other day, over seven hundred men and their families starving, while they could have had, if the Government were really serious on this tariff question, a turnover in that town in wages of between ten thousand and fifteen thousand pounds a month.  That is going on all along the line.</P>
    <P>Nobody in Ireland who thinks on the subject, and happily there are many who think on it, is satisfied with the present constitution or functioning of the Tariff Commission.  At their present rate of progress it will take them a good many life times before they reach the number of fairly substantial industries that are in existence at the present time.  Is that satisfactory, I wonder?  We have had all sorts of ridiculous arguments put up against us on this motion.  We were told that we attacked the civil servants on the Tariff Commission.  There was nothing farther from our minds than to do that.  So far as we know these men, we can say that we have respect for them; we have as much respect for them as any Deputy sitting on the opposite Benches. There is nothing in Deputy Lemass's motion to prevent civil servants from sharing in the new Commission, and with regard to the trifling that Deputy Cooper indulged in about the difficulty of getting farmers acquainted with agricultural conditions in the country to serve on the Commission, well, if the Deputy means that to be constructive I am afraid he will never be of very much help in dealing with a vital matter like this.</P>
    <P>It is very easy, notwithstanding anything which Deputy Cooper has said, to get men who have a good general knowledge of agricultural conditions. One of the Deputy's arguments seemed to suggest that the only man who could look at things impartially was the man who had not a knowledge of agricultural or industrial conditions.  At least that is what I inferred from his argument. There are many thousands of men in <Col N="772" /> Ireland, there are at least hundreds of men of great value in the country, capable of being great captains of industry, who, for the past five or six years have been waiting anxiously to see whether the things they hoped for from self-government would fructify, whether the country would get a chance of building up its own industrial life and of making the fullest use of its resources.  Are these men to be told, as a result of this debate, that all this tariff machinery was only so much window-dressing, that they had better not worry but put up with things as they are, as there is nothing to be done for them?</P>
    <P>We have not brought forward this motion as a party matter.  We would be glad if it was discussed in a non-party spirit.  It was a great disappointment to us, and it does not reflect a lot of credit on the other side, that a University Deputy had to be put up to make puerile efforts to sneer at a question like this that vitally affects production and the lives of the humblest as well as the most important people of the country.  I urge the Government even yet to reconsider their attitude, to admit that even if Deputy Lemass's motion has defects there are things that need to be done in connection with the Tariff Commission to make it effective and to do the work it was intended to do.</P>

      <P>Behind this motion and the amendment to the motion there seems to be an idea that avoidable delay has taken place in dealing with applications made to the Tariff Commission.  Now, that is not the case.  I stated in this House, and other Ministers stated, that if it were necessary we would make changes in the membership of the Tariff Commission, or relieve the members of the Commission of other work, in order that no delay might take place in dealing with the applications that came before that body.  The idea seems to be that if we appointed a body which was whole-time, with somewhat different terms of reference, business would be greatly expedited.  If anybody examines the working of the American Tariff Commission, he will see that that is not necessarily so.  In America, there is a <Col N="773" /> Tariff Commission of six members appointed by the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  They hold office, after a transition period, for twelve years.  No member shall engage actively in any other business, partnership or employment.  A member may only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty or misfeasance in office.  Yet, the work of that Commission has not proceeded at all with the rapidity that Deputies here seem to expect would result from the adoption of this motion or amendment.</P>
      <P>I have before me the periods occupied in considering certain applications. One was an application in regard to fabric gloves.  It took the Tariff Commission of the United States, with its whole-time members and large staff, and with all the resources that it could ask for the purpose of doing its duty, two years and five months to deal with the application in respect of fabric gloves.  There was another application in respect of paint-brush handles.  That would seem to be a matter that should not be more difficult than the application with regard to Rosary beads here. The application in regard to paint-brush handles took three years and six months to dispose of.  An application in respect to sewed straw hats took two years and five months, and the shortest one, in regard to sugar, took one year and four months.  That shows that it does not necessarily follow that you get through these matters with greater rapidity because you have whole-time members.  I shall give some details in regard to the applications made here.</P>

      <P>The investigation was ordered on the 16th January, 1923, and the report was made on 12th June, 1925.  Now, take the case of flour.  That is one of the two highly-important applications that have come before the Tariff Commission.  The application was referred to the Tariff Commission on the 13th March; the fee was paid on the 22nd March.  Public sittings to hear evidence were held on the 7th April <Col N="774" /> and the 12th April, and again on the 2nd, 3rd and 15th June and 20th December.  In camera, the Commission sat for the hearing of confidential evidence on the 1st, 2nd and 29th of June and on the 1st December and 17th January.  The sittings were spread over these lengthy periods because important witnesses were often not available and applications were made to the Commission for postponement in order that the witnesses might be heard.  This was the sort of case in which the Commission felt they could not dispense with any witnesses of importance.  In addition to hearings on these particular days, the Commission visited the premises of various milling companies. They visited the Dublin Port Milling Company and the Merchants Warehousing premises on the 14th September; the mills at Bagenalstown in Carlow on the 20th September; Liverpool and Birkenhead on the 30th September and 1st October; mills at Skipton, Oxfordshire, Surrey, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire on the 26th and 27th January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, owing to matters that arose in the Dáil here, and certain views taken by the Flour Millers' Association, the proceedings were interrupted on the 11th November.  During all that time the work of the Commission was not held up by the members not being available to deal with it.  It was held up by other causes&mdash;delays in seeking out information, examining information and examining accounts.  In other cases there were intervals which I shall indicate.  Take the second important application&mdash;that for a tariff on woollens and worsteds.  The application was referred to the Tariff Commission by the Minister for Finance on the 25th February, 1927.  Now, the detailed case was not lodged by the applicants until the 3rd May.  There was an interval of over two months, for which the Tariff Commission was in no way responsible.  The fee was paid by the applicants on the 21st May.  The application was announced in the Press on the 27th May.  The statements of the opponents were lodged with the Commission on the 22nd and 28th June. Then the applicants and the opponents jointly asked the Commission not to fix an earlier date than the last week of September <Col N="775" /> or the first week of October for the hearing of the case.  That application was heard on the 3rd August.  The application, for some reason, was a little later than that.  It was in the beginning of November.  The hearing of the application was on the 8th and 9th November.  During the interval the detailed case and documents submitted had been considered very carefully and on frequent occasions by the members of the Tariff Commission.  As a matter of fact, Deputies may be aware that the Commissioners were publicly complimented for the way they studied the documents, and for the knowledge they showed of the case when the matter came up for public hearing.  A public hearing of opponents came on the 22nd and 23rd of November.  There was an in-camera hearing for the parties on the 10th January.  At these hearings both applicants and opponents undertook to submit further information. The applicants submitted that information on the 11th February.  The opponents have promised to submit their information not later than the 3rd March, but there again there was not the slightest delay for which the Commission could be held responsible. There could not have been further expedition if you had no other duty for the Commissioners.  I would not say you might not have had a day's delay occasionally, but there was no appreciable delay.  If you, perhaps, had Commissioners with nothing to do they might have heard the matter on Saturday instead of Monday.</P>
    <P>Take a more glaring case&mdash;the coach and motor bodies.  There was an application in respect to a tariff on those. The application was referred to the Commission on the 31st January, 1927. The detailed case was lodged by the applicants on the 31st March, exactly two months after the application had been referred to the Tariff Commission. On the 22nd April they were notified by the Commission of the amount of the fee.  The fee was paid on the 6th August.  That is to say, the applicant sat down and did nothing from the 22nd April until the 6th August, and we hear it assumed by everybody that the reason this tariff was not put on coach and motor bodies was that the <Col N="776" /> Tariff Commission was not doing its business.  The stamp form on which the fee was paid was not returned to the Commission until the 23rd August. You had from the 22nd April to the 23rd August before the applicants took the step they were asked to.  The application was announced in the Press, and in the interval the scope of the application was modified by the applicant. Between the 23rd August and the 4th November they modified the application.  It was announced in the Press on the 4th November, and on the 14th December a letter was received from the opponents counter-signed by Mr. John P. O'Gorman, on behalf of the applicants, stating that they had agreed to postponing the matter, and it was not until the 22nd January that the agreement was withdrawn and the Tariff Commission was enabled to proceed with the case.  So here we have in the case of motor bodies a delay of a year all but four days without any progress made, and that delay solely and entirely due to the applicants, not one day of it due to the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>Take another case, down quilts, which was referred to the Commission on the 26th February.  The detailed case was received from the applicants on the 15th October, so that they again sat still from the 26th February until the 15th October.  On the 15th October the detailed case was received.  The fee was paid on the 29th November and on the 16th December an announcement was made in the Press.  Then notice of opposition was received from certain people who submitted a statement of evidence on the 16th January.</P>
    <P>Take the case of fish barrels.  That was referred to the Commission on the 7th March, 1927.  The detailed case was lodged by the applicants on the 4th October.  The fee was paid on the 2nd December, and then an announcement was made in the Press.  Take again, the question of maize products. An application was referred to the Commission on the 1st April last.  On the 12th April applicants were requested to submit their detailed case. They have not yet done so.  I do not think the Tariff Commission can be blamed there.  A Deputy inveighed against the Tariff Commission because <Col N="777" /> nothing had been done in respect of leather and talked about the tanneries which had gone out of operation.  There was an application in respect of sole, insole and harness leather, referred to the Tariff Commission on the 16th June. The applicants were requested on the 20th June to submit their detailed case and have not yet done so.</P>
    <P>Other cases where there may have been delays have been more recently referred to the Tariff Commission, but what I have said gives a fair picture of what the Tariff Commission has to contend with.  A lot of people who decided to make application have really very little notion of the case they can make.  They make no preliminary preparation; so when the Tariff Commission applies for the detailed case they begin to do the work they should have been doing long before they made their approach at all.  If we had whole-time Commissioners they would have nothing at all to do on the present basis.  If they had a roving Commission to inquire into matters themselves, no doubt they could have made work for themselves. But on the basis that this Tariff Commission is set up of considering applications, if we had whole-time men on this work they would have nothing to do, so the occasion has not yet arisen for making any of the adjustments the Government promised to make if it became necessary in order to see that applications coming before the Tariff Commission were expeditiously dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass's motion is to the effect that a Tariff Commission as at present constituted is unsuitable for dealing expeditiously with the applications received for the imposition of a tariff.  I suggest that what I have said disposes of that much of it so far as no different constitution of the Committee would enable it to deal more expeditiously with an application received for the imposition of tariffs.  If we like to go into matters which seem to be implied in the motion, that, apart from the question of expedition altogether, it is unsuitable, I do not think it is unsuitable.  This Commission is not a judicial body.  It does not decide on tariffs.  The decision rests with the Executive, which will make propositions to this House.  This House will <Col N="778" /> decide on the propositions.  The Tariff Commission is not bound by their Act to recommend either for or against a tariff.  It is simply required to make reports on certain aspects in respect to certain applications received; it may easily report that such a tariff is necessary to establish an industry, that the cost of the article would be seriously increased, that the cost of living would be raised, that the revenue coming in would be so much, that the employment given would be so much, and leave it there, and leave the Government and the House to make their decision.  The Tariff Commission has chosen to make definite recommendations in each case, but it is not required to do that; it is required to ascertain the facts, and, in a large part, its recommendations and conclusions will be on evidence which was given publicly, but we had to recognise, when we were setting up this body, that all the information could not be given publicly.  The various concerns would damage themselves if they stated some of their difficulties in public.  Consequently we had to allow the Tariff Commission to take certain evidence, when requested, in camera, and the only thing we have to reply on is that they reflect honestly in their report the effect of the evidence given in camera.</P>
    <P>I think it was not a good thing that Deputies raised in the way they did the fact that civil servants hold office at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council, because here they are acting in a capacity different from the way in which they act departmentally. A civil servant in any Department writes: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister to say so and so.&rdquo;  A civil servant must do in his Department what the Minister tells him in the last resort. His personal feelings, his personal honour, or his personal views do not come into the matter at all, but when you appoint a civil servant on a Commission he is placed on the Commission in the same capacity as anybody outside. He is there, not to act on the instructions of anybody, but to do his own work and to give his own views, and I think it is very unfair to suggest that because a man is in the Civil Service he will not report honourably and honestly as he is required to report in <Col N="779" /> the Tariff Commission.  No civil servant is obliged to act on the Tariff Commission.  If any of the civil servants on the Commission said tomorrow that he did not desire to act any further he would be relieved.  We simply selected various civil servants who we thought would be the most impartial-minded we could find.  We asked them if they would act, and they agreed to act.  They do their work on the Commission without any direction of any kind from Ministers.  So far as we are concerned, we do not care what the effect of the report.  We only want to know the truth and act as well as we can about the matters about which they report, and we will think out our course.  But the civil servants are absolutely independent in doing their work on the Tariff Commission, and no different effects would be got in that respect from appointing other people.</P>
    <P>When we were setting up the Commission we were pressed from many quarters to put at least one non-civil servant on the Commission.  We examined that proposal, and we came to the conclusion that it would be very hard to get anybody from outside who would be unprejudiced and who would be willing to take the knocks he would get from various sides, no matter how he decided.  Business men outside would be subject to pressure by friends and associates and would find it much more difficult to act impartially than any civil servant.  The ordinary civil servant has got a training which enables him to look at both sides of the question more easily than people outside, and he can decide as he wishes on the facts put before him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that at another point, but I will deal with it now.  I think it is not the sort of application to deal with which we set up the Tariff Commission, for this reason: that the question of marketing, <Col N="780" /> the question of prices, in the ordinary way does not come into it.  It is a simpler question than any of the questions put before the Tariff Commission. I presume it is simply a question of what the additional cost, if any, will be, and how that additional cost, if any, is to be reflected under the Railway Act in railway charges, and what the employment given will be.  That could be raised in a variety of ways. It cannot come before the Tariff Commission, but it could be raised by the shareholders of railways if they choose to raise it.  That is the sort of matter that should be examined specially if there was a case made for that examination. When the Tariff Commission was being set up, I indicated that it would deal with the ordinary run of cases.  I said somewhere in the course of the debate on the Tariff Commission Bill that we recognised that in certain cases ad hoc Committees would have to be set up to examine certain problems. I gave as an instance the sugar-beet subsidy, and I said that in any work like that it would be possible to have an ad hoc Committee to examine it, but the Tariff Commission can deal with all ordinary questions which come before it.</P>
      <P>A question was also raised during the debate as to agricultural produce, and applications for a tariff on agricultural produce.  The Minister for Finance has to be satisfied that the people making an application are reasonably representative of the industry before he is obliged to refer the application to the Tariff Commission. I can say that I would be prepared to give a liberal interpretation to that section if an application were made for a tariff in respect of any agricultural product, but the only application in respect to agricultural produce that I have had was one from a body calling itself the Irish Farmers' Protectionist Union, and which applied for a tariff on agricultural produce. Another was from the County Kerry Committee of Agriculture, which also applied for a tariff on agricultural produce. I took the view that both applications were much too vague, apart from the fact that the bodies making them were not representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> I might illustrate the view I would take on certain applications.  If two or three county committees from the barley-growing counties submitted an application for a tariff on barley I would consider them sufficiently representative to allow their application to go to the Tariff Commission.  I would take a liberal view of their representative character, provided that they made a definite application for a tariff on one article or on a group of articles.  But a broad general application for the protection of agricultural products I would not entertain, any more than I would entertain such an application for the protection of manufactured goods.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us by what means an application for a tariff or for the prohibition of the importation of foreign malt could be brought before the Tariff Commission, seeing that the brewing industry, which is apparently the only industry concerned, is not likely to bring it forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points in that.  I do not know whether the Deputy is wondering whether an agricultural committee, or any body like that, could make an application.  I would consider that.  Certainly, maltsters could apply.  As a matter of fact, I would be prepared to consider whether a committee representing the barley growers might not apply.  On the question of prohibition, the Commission would be entitled to say that the only thing that would be effective would be a tariff of such an amount as was clearly a prohibitive amount.  In the case of margarine, for instance, they recommended a tariff which they said would be sufficient to give the whole market to home manufacturers, and although the Tariff Commission is not asked to deal with the question of prohibition, it could easily provide for it in that way by recommending a tariff that would be in effect a prohibition, or it could in its incidental remarks say that it thought that prohibition, or some method other than a tariff, would be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not ask the Tariff Commission to go into the question of prohibitions or subsidies, but there is <Col N="782" /> nothing at all to prevent the Commission, if it feels that something ought to be done in that direction, and that a tariff is not a satisfactory way of dealing with it, to state in its general remarks, which it is asked for in the final paragraph of the Schedule, that it feels that some method other than a tariff should be resorted to.</P>

      <P>I am not in the witness box just at the moment, Dealing with the question of the scope of the Commission, I do not think that you would expedite the work of the Commission&mdash;and that is what most Deputies seem to have in mind&mdash;by adding to the matters into which it must or may inquire.  I believe, in the first instance, that the change such as seems to be in the minds of both the mover of the amendment and the mover of the motion, that the members should be whole-time, would cause delays.  We have a certain body of civil servants who have time for the work at present and who are able to do the work.  They have got certain knowledge and certain experience.  It may be necessary to change them later on, but until it is necessary to change them any disturbance would only delay the consideration of proposals.  New people coming in would have something to learn and would not be able to get on as quickly as the present members.  For the work that is available we could not consider the advisability of taking any of the members of the Commission off their other duties.  We would be taking them away from highly urgent and highly important work, and we would be leaving them to do something that would not occupy anything like nearly their whole time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had better sit down, and speak when his turn comes.  The motion suggests that one of the people should be a qualified accountant.  The Tariff Commission can employ experts; there is nothing to be gained by having a chartered accountant, or somebody like that, a member of the Commission.  The qualifications <Col N="783" /> of a chartered accountant might be desirable for a commissioner, but they are by no means necessary. If you have people with ordinary intelligence to deal with accounts, they can, with the assistance of professional accountants, consider matters just as well as if they were qualified accountants themselves.</P>
      <P>According to the motion, the Commission should have power to investigate conditions existing in any industry in regard to its need for protection against foreign competition.  My belief is that a Commission could not in any reasonable time investigate the conditions of any industry if the people conducting the industry were not anxious to have them investigated.  It would simply be a question of outsiders trying to understand the conditions of a business without the full co-operation of the people actually conducting the business.  I believe that they could only get reasonably satisfactory results after the expenditure of a great deal more time and a great deal more labour than Deputies contemplate.</P>
      <P>
        <b>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</b> took the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>If you have the co-operation of the people conducting an industry you may understand the conditions fairly well in five or six months; if you have not their co-operation you may spend five or six years, and not get anything like as good an understanding of the difficulties under which they labour.  I believe that under this proposal the Commission would frequently be following false trails.  It would spend a great deal of time and a great deal of the taxpayers' money in investigating conditions in industries that were not worthy of investigation. In respect of the main industries of the country, those conducting them have been willing to come forward, and until they have been dealt with I think it is undesirable to diverge into industries in respect of which applications will not be made.  In certain cases where people actually conducting or owning industries are not willing to apply, people who are prepared to come in are willing to apply, and one such application has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> I also think it would be undesirable that the Commission should make recommendations to the Executive Council as to how the benefits derived from the measure of protection afforded to any trade could be shared by the consumers.  That is an entirely different question.  That could be dealt with, if it must be dealt with, by a different body.  That question is not distinct from the question of dealing with profiteering in any industry.  If we are going to deal with profiteering we can deal with it all-round.  If we are going to deal with it only in respect of these tariffed industries, then we are applying a special scrutiny to them; we are throwing special obstacles in the way of people who are prepared to come in and carry on under tariffs. The result would be tariffs without industries.</P>
    <P>Even when we agree to a tariff, often a very considerable time elapses before the results one would expect from a tariff ensue.  I think it is practically four years now since the tariff on soaps was imposed, but it has only just been within the last few months that there have been big extensions in the plants for manufacturing soaps carried out here.  In respect of a number of other industries as much as a year has elapsed after the imposition of tariffs before anybody moved.  That was because the prospects were not so clearly seen.  If you are going to control their prices, to examine them specially as distinct from those of other people, to see that they are not profiteering; if you are going to make special inquiries into what they are paying their workers and what their conditions are, the effect will simply be that the tariffs will not produce the results in industries that they are expected to produce. My view is that if we feel that an industry requires a tariff in order to live, we should give it that tariff, but that we should not put it under special disabilities as compared with other industries; we should not ask it to comply with other requirements that other industries are not asked to comply with.  If we are imposing tariffs at all we are doing so for the purpose of producing results and getting industries set up, and we will not be able to do that if allow the <Col N="785" /> Tariff Commission to wander into these  other matters, and especially to discriminate against these particular industries in ways that do not apply to other industries.</P>
    <P>I will deal with one matter that was mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon about civil servants judging their own case. As a matter of fact, the matter does not affect civil servants.  The rise and fall of the cost of living affects civil servants in the same way as it affects other people outside.  So far as higher civil servants are concerned, it has practically no effect on their bonus. In conclusion, I want to say that it is my belief that, if the motion or amendment were passed, the work of dealing with applications for a tariff would be impeded rather than expedited.  I believe costs would be run up, and that the objects Deputies have in mind would not be served.  The Tariff Commission has only got fairly started on its work.  It has a considerable number of applications before it now in such a form that they can be considered. If the work increases, changes in personnel may be made.  If the work does not substantially increase no changes in personnel are necessary.  If Ministers find that there are many industries in respect of which they believe protection should be afforded, and if there are no applications made from the people conducting these industries, then we can consider whether or not it would be a good thing to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture power to submit proposals to the Tariff Commission. The Government has already indicated that in certain circumstances they would be prepared to amend the Act so as to give these Ministers that power. But the position at present is this, that these Ministers have no cases which they feel they want to submit to the Commission.  If in the course of time that position alters, then we can alter the Act.  To alter the Act at present would do no good whatever to the people who want a tariff, because it would delay matters.  It would not improve matters from the point of view of those who want things fairly and impartially considered, because here, I believe, we have a body which is more impartial <Col N="786" /> than any other body we could possibly get.  I think both the motion and the amendment are brought forward under a misapprehension of the actual facts. Because reports have not been forthcoming in considerable numbers from the Tariff Commission up to the present time, the idea has got abroad that the delays are due to some default on the part of the Commission.  I think if anyone considers fairly the details I gave in respect of applications which have been before the Commission, that impression will go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew there was a mistake.  Then he is not a farmer.  It is the prevailing opinion largely throughout the area I represent that this Commission has absolutely failed in the purpose for which it was set up. Notwithstanding the facts and figures given by the Minister for Finance, we know that there has been considerable delay in bringing to any kind of fruition the so-called labours of this Commission. One portion of Deputy O'Connell's amendment gives me more concern than other portions of it.  I refer to the clause in it dealing with working conditions for employees in any industry which may in the future seek a tariff.  Another clause suggests that there are other methods besides a tariff by which an industry might be fostered or encouraged.  Whilst believing that in many cases tariffs are necessary, I am not at the same time blinding myself to the fact that there are many industries in this country which would <Col N="787" /> be the better for the introduction of good management, improved machinery and methods.  Another clause in the amendment seeks to give power to the Commission on its own initiative to investigate the position of any industry. We know that there are certain industrialists or so-called industrialists in this country who are not really producers at all.  They are merely distributors for foreign manufacturers, and in many cases we find these opposed to a tariff, because to them as individuals it is a far better paying proposition to act as agents or distributors for foreign manufacturers.  The portion of the amendment with which I am more intimately concerned is that which would ensure that those engaged in protected industries would get a decent living, have good working conditions, and receive wages sufficient at any rate to give themselves and their families a decent livelihood, and something beyond that, so as to enable them to enjoy some of the educational and cultural advantages which are now the prerogative of the moneyed few.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I said a couple of days ago, when we were speaking about old age pensions, that in my view it was not a Party question.  I should say the same to-day of this.  There are such things as Party questions.  There are great principles which divide us here. There is primarily the great question of the Treaty, one which involves deep questions of policy and principle, questions on which I, at least, see no possibility of compromise.  I am confirmed in my view by the speech that was made by Deputy Moore, that here we are really one at principle, and are only divided, so far as we are divided, on a matter not of principle, but merely of procedure and method.  I think this is an example of the great advantage which this country has obtained by the coming in of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We hear no more in this House, as we heard a good deal in the country, about the imposition of tariffs wholesale without inquiry.  The Fianna Fáil Party, if I understood Deputy Moore aright&mdash;and I presume he speaks with authority&mdash;like the Party of <Col N="788" /> Cumann na nGaedheal, stands not for whole-hog protection, but for selective protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the only question as I see really between us is the method by which protection is to be applied.  I am glad that it should be so, and I am glad also that there should be here again no suggestion made such as was made, I know, in the country during the elections; such as I have seen made occasionally in the local newspapers, that those who are not prepared without inquiry of the most careful kind to make up their minds to enforce protection upon industries of every kind must be animated not by regard for Irish interests but by regard for English interests. For that suggestion there are no grounds and I am very glad to notice that it is a suggestion that has not been made here now.  The whole question between us is how our fiscal policy shall be shaped in such a manner as that we may do the maximum of good, and, if possible, to do it without doing any harm at all.  It is common to us both that this is a matter in which expedition is proper.  It is not a matter in which there should be any avoidable delay.  I am going to confess to the House that until I heard the speech of the Minister for Finance just now, there was just that one point of doubt in my mind.  I confess I had some doubt in my mind as to whether a body of civil servants such as compose the present Tariff Commission was, in fact, the best body for dealing expeditiously as well as impartially with this matter. I had no doubt about its impartially myself, but I had about its expedition. I confess there was some possible doubt in my mind about the latter.  But these doubts, so far as I am concerned, have been removed by the speech to which we have listened from the Minister for Finance.  I shall await with very great interest the answer which I am sure will be forthcoming from the opposite benches to that speech, but to my mind it does seem to me that the Minister made a complete case as showing on the one hand that by experience in the United States the method of appointing a whole-time Commission did not necessarily result in any extraordinary expedition; and on the other hand, it <Col N="789" /> is quite a fact that our own Commission was one in which there had been no delay on the part of the Commission, but it does appear that there had been very considerable delay on the part of the parties who were themselves interested in getting these tariffs.  I have said there is very little between us on this matter, but I do find this: that there is a difference of opinion as to methods, and there is something, perhaps, rather more important, and that is put not as a point of view but as a point of fact.  I was reading to-day the speeches made on last Friday by some of the various Deputies. Amongst many others I came across the speech made by Deputy Derrig, and I find this:&mdash;&ldquo;It was expected by the national element,&rdquo; he is speaking, I gather, of the time at which the Tariff Commission was being set up, and he says: &ldquo;It was expected by the national element.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that by the national element, he means himself and his friends.  The rest of us do not count.  &ldquo;That it would be a Commission independent of political influence which would calmly and judiciously examine the whole problem of the industries of the country.&rdquo; That, I conceive it is: that it is an impartial Commission, it is judiciously examining the whole problem.  The real complaint about the Commission is that it does proceed with a judicial calm. He goes on to say &ldquo;and take as its foundation a definite programme for the prevention, as far as possible, of the importation of foreign articles into this country; not that the tribunal or Commission would take as its basis that the British fiscal system still existed here; that we were only going to depart from it in certain exceptional circumstances and that any industry which sought protection would have to be put upon its trial in public, would have to prove its case as an isolated industry before it could get assistance.  As a matter of fact, the Tariff Commission themselves have said quite recently that it is impossible for isolated industries to put up a case, that the whole industry and agriculture of the country is interdependent, and in the words of Mr. Whelehan, one of the members of the Tariff Commission, &lsquo;you do not know where one industry ends and another <Col N="790" /> begins.&rsquo;&rdquo; I do not know whether that is seriously disputed.  It seems a perfectly self-evident, obvious fact.  He then proceeded, &ldquo;All the more reason for knowing definitely what was the policy behind this Tariff Commission, what was the Government's idea, were they definitely out to accept the protectionist idea or were they simply establishing a stop-gap which they are now modifying because the altered circumstances in the country and the presence of this party in the House have made them advance from experimental to what they call selective protection. Selective protection we are all in favour of.  It has never, I think, been contended by anybody that protection should cover raw materials or that a tariff should be put upon them.  But what we are interested in is to know what is the policy which these civil servants, this Tariff Commission, must have in mind and which must considerably influence them.  What is the exact policy of the Government?  Does it stand for protection or does it not?&rdquo; That appears to me an entirely wrong way of approaching the whole problem. The conception here is that the Commission is to approach the consideration of whether putting on a tariff on this or that or any industry and this and that and the other product is desirable in the interests of the country.  They are to approach the examination of the evidence which they are bound to take and they are to come to their conclusion not on that evidence, but in accordance with some pre-conceived notion, as to whether in a general way protection or free trade will bring to you the true light of the Gospel.  I suggest that that is an entirely wrong way of approaching the matter.  People who think in that fashion make no allowance at all for the extraordinary complexity of these problems. It is a matter of the most obvious fact that you do not know, you certainly cannot tell without the most careful inquiry where one industry ends and another begins You have therefore to examine and to judge the case not only on its own individual merits but to ask will the carrying of a tariff imposition in the case of this particular article enable the manufacturers to employ so many more people, but you have to ask yourself what is going to be the effect <Col N="791" /> of that upon kindred manufacturers and upon the community as a whole.  And you have got to take the whole of that in relation with the others.  In judging this question you have got to take that in relation to the whole of your financial and social policy.  The idea that you should rush as a bull in a china shop into expedition in this matter is entirely false.  Let me illustrate that by a couple of cases that have recently come into my own purview.  A little earlier in the day we were considering the fate of the tobacco industry in this country and I remember being astonished when a gentleman who is much interested in the establishment of that industry told me that he attributed the partial failure of the industry under which he had himself suffered so grievously to the fact of the putting of an imperial preference duty on tobacco.  I mean to say the giving to this country of the imperial preference since this country shared in that preference.  You would assume that having a high rate of duty against other countries within the ring would have enabled Irish tobacco to flourish.  Yet, so strongly complex is this, so many wheels are there within wheels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. LAW Mr. LAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>It is actually the fact that in this instance the imposition of a higher duty, even though a preference was given, had the effect of injuring rather than aiding the very industry in relation to which the tariff had been imposed.  Here is another instance.  I got a letter only the other day from one of a firm of bakers in a part of my own county complaining bitterly that certain firms in the Six Counties were sending large quantities of bread into County Donegal, thereby destroying the old-established trade of himself and his family.  He put it to me very naturally that if only these people&mdash;these foreigners, he said&mdash;could be prevented from sending bread from the Six Counties into the Saorstát, he would be able once more to employ a larger number of men.  It is not suggested in those Benches that you should apply a tariff to foodstuffs, at any rate to such <Col N="792" /> a commodity as bread.  But then, why not?  If there is a tariff on flour, why not on bread?  You put it that flour is raw material, and bread is the finished product.  Let us examine that a little bit more.  Flour is the finished product of the miller.  It is baked into bread, and bread is the finished product of the baker.  But one might almost say that it is the raw material which is nourishing the agricultural labourer, and so you go round and round.  Curiously enough, it was only to-day when I came into the House I met someone from my constituency.  She said: &ldquo;What is on in the House?&rdquo; and I said that we had a great tariff controversy on.  She asked: &ldquo;Is it barrels?&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;Not exactly barrels, but we may incidentally refer to barrels.&rdquo;  I said to her: &ldquo;Are you in favour of a tariff on barrels?&rdquo; and she said: &ldquo;Nothing less; it would ruin us.  I said &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with Question 10 on the Order Paper, I wish to state, for the information of the Deputies here, that an examination for the position of Clerk to the Dundalk District Court was held sometime in September, 1927, and after a lapse of a few weeks there were summoned here to Dublin, by the members of the Civil Service Appointments Commission, several of the candidates who sat for that examination.  I submit that the natural inference from that fact alone should be that at least one of those candidates should have been selected for the position.  There is another very significant fact in connection with this appointment.  The Civil Service Appointments Commission did not make known the result of the examination, which was held in September, 1927, until February, 1928, a lapse of exactly six months.  What is puzzling the people of Louth at the present moment is why this long delay was necessary in making this appointment. Again, the people of Louth feel that, in accordance with the terms governing this appointment, preference should have been given to those candidates who reside in the locality.  They have, naturally, been disappointed on finding that the present occupant of the position hails from Arklow, Co. Wicklow, and I have yet to learn when Arklow became part and parcel of County Louth, according to the terms of the advertisement.  Definite information has been given to me that the person appointed is an ex-member of the Civic Guard and, incidentally, I venture to remark that I am not imbued with any animus against members of the Civic Guard obtaining any public appointment. I have a special regard for the members of the Civic Guard in general. It has further been stated to me that while he was a member of the Civic Guard he received an injury which necessitated his retirement from the force.  I am not giving this information as being definite, but I am giving it, and I hope the Minister for Justice <Col N="794" /> will be able to say whether it is accurate or otherwise, and, if it is not accurate, I will at once withdraw the accusation.</P>
      <P>I felt great satisfaction at the fact that the Civil Service Appointments Commissioners thought fit to make it one of the conditions governing this appointment that candidates should reside in the locality.  I felt that from a human point of view.  Fathers and mothers who raise boys to the age of twenty and twenty-one naturally do not like them to be compelled to leave the town or village in which they were born to seek a living elsewhere, even in their own country.  They like to have them close to them, so that they will be under their ever-watchful eye.  Consequently the people of Louth in general, were gratified that condition was inserted in the notice governing the appointment, but, to their consternation, after a lapse of six months they found that the person appointed not only did not comply with the terms governing the appointment, but actually at the time of his appointment resided in Arklow, Co. Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is further stated by several candidates who took part in that examination&mdash;I am giving the statement for what it is worth&mdash;that the person who occupies the position did not sit for his examination in the same room as the other candidates from County Louth. Several candidates who sat for the examination have twenty-five years' experience of legal work.  One candidate in particular, as I mentioned in a supplementary question to the Minister for Justice, took a very high place in the examination for solicitors' apprentices, and I am convinced, as one who has received some sort of education and passed through the Intermediate in all its stages, that it would be an intellectual impossibility for an ex-member of the Civic Guard to obtain higher marks than this particular candidate in that examination.  Consequently I ask the Minister for Justice to decide that the person who has been appointed to this position is not permanently appointed, and that he will, in the near future, if he is to restore the confidence of the people of the Saorstát in the equity and impartiality of those who constitute the <Col N="795" /> Civil Service Commission, re-advertise the position of Clerk to the Dundalk District Court.</P>

      <P>The facts of the case, so far as I am concerned, are as follows:&mdash;The Civil Service Commissioners carried out the duties which are imposed upon them by statute and sent forward to me the name of the candidate for this position whom they considered to be the most suitable to occupy it.  His qualifications are as follows:&mdash;He completed a secondary school course and was awarded a prize as the result of a Middle Grade examination.  In 1923 he entered the Gárda Síochána and was promoted a sergeant at the end of the year.  Subsequently he sat for the superintendent's examination and secured third place.  He resigned from the Gárda Síochána owing to the fact that an injury to his knee necessitated the amputation of the lower limb.  He now has an artificial limb and can walk fairly well.  Since his recovery he has been employed in Wicklow as a teacher of Irish under the Gaelic League.  He has excellent knowledge of police duties and court procedure.  That is the report I received from the Appointments Commissioners.</P>

He is a young man of ability, and he is the man who the Civil Service Commissioners, taking everything into consideration, say was most suited to the position.  The Deputy said that this man did not comply with the terms of the advertisement.  It was not made compulsory that an applicant for this position should, at the time of the examination, be residing in the country.

So far as I am concerned, the Civil Service Commissioners sent on the name of the person to me, and I am perfectly satisfied that he is suitable to fill that position.  Accordingly he has been appointed, and I am satisfied that it was the correct thing to do.</P>

This particular man sat for the qualifying examination in connection with another District Court clerkship and passed it.

      <P>The previous appointment was one in connection with which he would have to do a good deal of cycling.  His name was submitted by the Civil Service Commissioners on a previous occasion, but the late Minister for Justice held that if it were a case where much cycling would not be required he would be quite suitable, but not where there was a good deal of cycling required to be done.  He requested the Civil Service Commissioners to reconsider the matter and submit another name.  On that occasion the Civil Service Commissioners submitted the name of the man second on the list.  For the present appointment the Minister for Justice did not think that the artificial limb was an impediment which would prevent the man being selected.  He previously sat at the qualifying examination, which was purely qualifying, and when that was passed the order in which the men passed did not matter.  The other qualifications and their age and general experience were taken into account.  This man was put at the top of the list, and the Minister saw no reason why he should urge the Civil Service Commissioners to put the name of the second man on the list before him.  With reference to the pension, I do not know whether he has one or not, but I presume he has not.  If he has a pension it would be suspended during his tenure of the position, so that question does not affect the matter at all.  I think Deputy Coburn has laboured under a misapprehension.  The Minister for Justice has stated the position, that a preference for local candidates means other things being equal a local candidate would be appointed.  I expressed the opinion that when the salary is as high as it is for this position&mdash;£375&mdash; there should be no preference given to local candidates.  That preference should be given only where the salary is much smaller, and where it might be desirable for a man to have another appointment.  What was in the advertisement, and no more than that, should <Col N="798" /> be read into it, where men are equal in their ability to do the work preference would be given to the local candidate. The person who received the appointment is highly qualified, and for the second time has been recommended for one of these posts.  I thought on the previous occasion it was extremely hard luck that he was turned down after being recommended.  Now, where you have a position where there are urban courts, and the difficulty of getting around not so great, I think it would be a crying shame if he was not appointed.</P>

      <P>A point arising out of that is that the Civil Service Commissioners are not, as we were lead to understand, an independent body.  In other words, they can be influenced by the Minister as to whom they recommend for a position.</P>

      <P>This was supposed to be a qualifying examination.  When an examination is held by the Civil Service Commissioners the ordinary man, the man in the street, understands it is to be an honest competitive examination, and that the names will be submitted of those who have passed that examination and who got the highest number of marks.  Now it has emerged that the Minister can be influenced as to the names to be sent forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister appoints on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commissioners.  If Deputy O'Hanlon had been longer in the Dáil he would remember there was a discussion here with reference to an appointment in a wireless station.  A name was recommended to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but he refused to make the appointment.  The Civil Service Commissioners were not prepared to make a second recommendation, for they did not see the Minister had any reason for refusing to make the appointment.  The position remained vacant for over a year.  The matter was the subject of debate here. The Minister could get no other name, and finally he had to fill the position by appointing the person recommended <Col N="799" /> by the Civil Service Commissioners. With regard to the previous appointment, for which Molloy applied and was recommended, the late Minister for Justice declined to make the appointment recommended by the Civil Service Commissioners, and he stated to them his reason for doing so&mdash;that the man was unable to do the work owing to the difficulties he would have in cycling in connection with his work, as he suffered from the disadvantage of having an artificial limb, and he asked that another recommendation should be made to him.  The Civil Service Commissioners considered the Minister's objection to the appointment, and they thought in that case, unlike the case of the Postmaster-General, the Minister had reason in his objection, and they submitted a second name to him.  That is all that happened.  It was within the discretion of the Civil Service Commissioners to submit another name or not as they chose.  When they saw reason in the Minister's argument they agreed to submit a second name.  It would be open to them if they choose to select two names instead of one.  On at least one occasion I had two names submitted to me for an appointment by the Civil Service Commissioners, as they regarded the men nearly equal and they put them in the order of preference. I took the first recommended, but as two were submitted I could have appointed either.  As far as that was concerned, no influence was exercised on the Civil Service Commissioners. With regard to the question of a qualifying or competitive examination, if an examination is competitive the person who gets most marks must be appointed.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy realise in that case it was not a competitive examination but a qualifying one, the qualifying point being 50 per cent. of the marks, and it did not matter how many more marks a person got than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination was solely a qualifying examination and the appointment <Col N="800" /> was by means of selection.  There are many cases in which you have appointments by selection without any examination at all.  Probably if you had only a couple of candidates here they would not go to the trouble of having a qualifying examination but would test their educational efficiency in some other way. But the qualifying examination was resorted to.  Therefore, the whole thing was absolutely normal, regular and above board and such that nobody has any proper grounds for cavilling about it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong.  He should not work up these suspicions without some good grounds.  The Civil Service Commissioners did not select the candidates themselves.  They appointed a Selection Board.  The Selection Board for different appointmens is differently constituted, and this man came up again before a different Selection Board and was recommended first to the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
