    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether there is any alternative to the system by which, when important and complicated amendments are made to a Bill dealt with in the Seanad, these amendments are merely submitted here for examination on one day.  My point is as to whether there is any Standing Order or other rule by which a Bill like this should go through more than one stage?  In this case the amendments are of a most complicated and radical character and if adopted they would practically constitute a new Bill. Under the circumstances it would be strange if the Dáil considered them only for an hour or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The system is that when a Bill is passed by the Dáil it is sent to the Seanad, and if the Seanad amends it the amendments come before us and, under Standing Orders, are considered in Committee. They are open to relevant amendment and are again considered on Report, so that in important cases there would really be two stages here, but the discussion is necessarily confined to the amendments inserted by the other House.  The Deputy's point as to a Bill being practically a new one is a very important one which I have not considered, but there are, in fact, two stages.  In practice there is only one stage, but if the matter is of sufficient importance there can be two stages.  I do not know that there is any alternative system which we could adopt, because we must keep to the discussion of the Seanad amendments.  The wider they are the wider is the range of discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be in order in helping the Deputy in regard to the extent of the amendment coming before the Dáil?  There is nothing in the elaborate amendment except this, that where we deal with the question of bogs we recognise that a permanent improvement is not made to a bog by drainage in the same way as to land, and it contemplates that the period of <Col N="1257" /> time over which the money that is spent on the improvement, and which has to be collected, should be brought into relation with the period of time that benefit will be taken from the bog.  We deal with the matter by having a turbary assessment running in the same way as a drainage assessment.  It is simply a scheme for turbary assessment, parallel to a scheme for a land assessment, but they have to be put in separately because they deal with a matter that has to be dealt with over a different period of time to the drainage assessment.</P>

    <Title>LOCAL AUTHORITIES (MUTUAL ASSURANCE) BILL, 1928&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be remembered that in 1926, arising out of the desire of the local bodies in the country expressed through the General Council of County Councils, an Act was introduced here which subsequently became the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act, 1926 and which enabled local bodies to be members of an insurance company of a particular kind for the purpose of dealing with their fire insurance and insurance arising out of employers' liability.  In view of the fact that this was not the formation of an insurance company for ordinary profit and that only members of local bodies were to be members&mdash;only members of the local bodies who were themselves insurers in the company would be the company&mdash;arrangements were made that the deposit of £20,000 required under the Insurance Companies Act of 1909 would not be required.  The purpose of the company was for the mutual insurance of its members as set out in Clause 2.  A law case has arisen in which a decision has been given that the present company does not carry out mutual insurance within the terms of the Insurance Companies Act of 1909 and the present Bill purports to make <Col N="1258" /> clear the definition of mutual insurance for the purpose of this particular Act, and to legalise the position of the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company from the time it was founded and for the future and to see that the intention of the original Act will be legally secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public bodies are the biggest organised insurance class in the country. They have to insure a very big amount of property on which there is a very low rate and they should be in a position to get a more satisfactory rate of insurance than they were getting up to the time of the formation of this company. In spite of the fact that a large number of local bodies had commitments to continue their insurance for a period of years with the companies with which they were dealing before this company was formed, nevertheless up to the present fourteen county councils, eighteen boards of health, eleven mental hospital committees, twenty-three urban district councils and town commissioners, and a number of other miscellaneous public bodies are members of the company.  They have been enabled through this company to reduce substantially the insurance rates they pay and we have had evidence that they have been effective in creating a situation by which other insurance companies have reduced the rate which they quote to other public bodies with a view to holding this very satisfactory type of insurance.  As I say, the rates that public bodies pay for fire insurance should be much lower than they have been because of the valuable type of property insured and the low rate of loss that characterises that particular type of property.  This company has been formed in order that the members may at the present moment pay a lower rate than they have been paying and to see that by degrees they arrive at building up their own company so that they will not have to re-insure and, as well, that they will arrive at a lower and more just rate of insurance than has been obtained up to the present from outside companies or that they are even able to give themselves under the present system when they have not sufficient experience to know what further reduction they can make in the rates <Col N="1259" /> and still adequately cover their insurance. A large amount of ratepayers' money is involved in this matter and it is the desire of the Government that as much as possible of that money should be saved to the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Bill has a purpose to indemnify the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited against the loss that they might suffer, or to regularise their position in respect to the Principal Act, we have no difficulty, but we think that this Bill ought to have a wider scope.  We are very anxious about this whole question of insurance and we think that public bodies ought to be the centre of a big national scheme, and that here is the proper starting point.  There are, of course, two ways in which the question of insurance could be tackled.  First of all, it can be tackled in the sense in which it has been tackled here, namely that of pooling the policies like a central purchasing board, and making economies in that particular way.  We ought to go much further than that. An effort has been made in the Principal Act and by the company to go somewhat farther, but we would like to be satisfied that they have gone in that direction as far as they could go.  It is obvious that profit is being divided by the companies in this insurance business and we think that the profits that are made should be retained in the country.  It is of course a question finally for detailed examination of the replaceable value of the property insured; of the amount that is ordinarily covered, the risk, and the rate of loss, at least the rate that comes back in covering these risks.  A proportion of the premium paid comes back in the way of payment of claims.  All that requires a good deal of detailed examination. Figures are necessary and we think that this particular position that arises now ought to be made the occasion by the Local Government Department for a complete examination into that whole question, to see, for example, if re-insurance is necessary at all in the early stages, aiming ultimately at bringing into a compulsory scheme the whole of the public bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A remark just made by the Minister <Col N="1260" /> indicates a difficulty which might operate for a few years, the difficulty of previous contracts.  If the Local Government Department were in favour of a general national scheme, there should be a warning issued at once that no further contracts should be entered into for a period of time; that is if they are not prepared to take action, or if the conditions are such that contracts have been entered into and that they are holding them up from a general scheme for a number of years.  We would like to be satisfied that no larger proportion of the risk is being reinsured than is absolutely necessary. For example, we think that by another device re-insurance might possibly be saved altogether.  I am not certain of that because, as I say, one requires to have detailed figures in order to be perfectly satisfied.  But the idea of the State ultimately being a re-insurer might be considered.  The assumption is that the re-insuring companies are not working at a loss, that there is a profit, and that the profit which is made outside the country ought to be preserved for the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the scheme fully, because I believe it would be more or less going outside the scope of this Bill, but I think that the occasion of the introduction of this Bill ought to be taken by the Local Government Department to consider the whole question of national insurance, and to see whether a big national scheme might not be evolved around this nucleus of mutual insurance of public bodies.  The extent, for example, to which public bodies could be made really mutual could be considered.  I do not think it is considered here.  As far as I understand, it is here largely a pooling of the premiums in order to get better rates and to have less losses than before.  I think that ought to be only the primary step and that the ultimate goal at which we ought to aim, and aim to reach as quickly as possible, ought to be one of complete mutuality, with possibly the State as a re-insurer to meet what might be called exceptional and altogether abnormal risks.  You can, of course, from analysis of the figures of the past, from statistics generally, arrive roughly at an average for the risk, and to arrange to cover that risk I think would not be <Col N="1261" /> a very heavy strain on the rates, even in the case of complete mutuality.  But to meet the case of very abnormal risks, which could not be met in the earlier stages, at any rate, by the reserve that would be built up&mdash;the whole question of being prepared to meet that by a State guarantee would be very valuable. For example, State property as far as I know is not insured as a rule&mdash;I do not know if it is insured at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that State property is not insured?  The reason that suggests itself to me is that the State is prepared to keep for itself, so to speak, and for the community any profits that might arise and to meet any damage done by means of loans or otherwise, to treat it as an abnormal thing to be dealt with either by an increase in taxation for the particular period or by means of loan.  As it would be abnormal, of course, the more natural way of dealing with it would be by means of loan.  If the same idea were to be used in connection with local authorities, I think that we would have there not merely something of general advantage to the community with respect to public bodies, but a nucleus around which a larger scheme could be built.  As I say, we do not wish to do more than indicate what our views on that matter are and to see whether this opportunity might not be taken by the Local Government Department to have that matter very carefully examined by experts and the whole question threshed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the Second Reading of the Bill because we believe the principle is a good one and because we supported strongly the original Act.  I agree with most of what Deputy de Valera has said about this Bill and about insurance in general.  I hope that no time will be lost by the Government in giving to the House proposals arising out of the Insurance Commission's Report.  The essence of this scheme seems to me to be a general scheme for the public good and not for any private profit or interest.  This was originally set going by the General Council of County <Col N="1262" /> Councils representing the public bodies in Ireland.  I do not wish to say anything, at the moment, as to the attacks that were made on this company, when it was set up, by some of the other Irish companies except to say that it seems to me that if some of the other Irish companies showed as much energy and enthusiasm in trying to get the business that is now got by the foreign companies, as they did to try to get business that would normally come to this company and to take from this company some of the business that it did get, there would be less money in insurance going out of the country than does unfortunately go out of it at the moment.  So far as the Labour Party is concerned it will give this measure every support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one or two questions, certainly not in opposition to the principle underlying this Bill. There are certain details that I think assurance might be given on that would lead to satisfaction.  In the first place, I would ask whether in the event of any considerable fires taking place of the property of any of the insured he considers there would be adequate security with the company for the recovery of the loss due to the insured. Secondly, in reference to Section 3 of the Bill does he not think it is really very like saying that for the purpose of this Act black means white?  It seems to be almost a contradiction in terms to have this definition of the term &ldquo;mutual.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the last remark of Deputy Thrift.  I think it is an extraordinary precedent to create, to attempt to put a meaning on words that the words themselves according to the ordinary use do not convey.  Further I would like to know from the Minister whether other methods of meeting the same problem have been considered; whether it was ever put to the Local Authorities that it would be an advantage to them and to the country, as a whole, if this could not be made a matter of mutual contract.  I think a threepenny rate on the valuation of the Twenty-Six Counties would realise about £141,000. If that guarantee could be obtained <Col N="1263" /> from the local bodies there would not be much reason for their paying premiums and going to the trouble of re-insuring. Of course, at the present time, practically, all the insurance money leaves the country whether directly or indirectly.  There is a good deal to be said in favour of the State accepting such reinsurance. I think it has been pointed out from the Government Benches several times that there is practically no difference so far as the State is concerned between the position of the Local Authorities and the position of the central Government.  One is part of the State and the other is the whole State.  It is a curious thing that in this matter we should draw a line of demarcation, and treat a part of the State as if it was a private concern that the whole could take no responsibility for.  Seeing the great expense it is to the country and eventually the big amount of money it means taken out of the country every year I think the Local Government Department might have attempted to solve the question on much more radical lines than they have done.  However, the Minister may have a lot more to say. While not opposing this Bill we on this side of the House are not satisfied that it is sufficiently strong to meet the position that prevails with regard to local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been indicated, as regards the principle of the Bill there is no objection from these benches, but I would like the Minister to make clear, in his reply, this point. In making this a Statutory Company, and in putting in a definition of the words &ldquo;mutual insurance,&rdquo; which the Courts could not take out of the ordinary meaning of them, does it mean that the ratepayers of each of the public bodies who insure through this Mutual Society are in any way even contingent guarantors for liability in case of big loss?  If that were so it would seem to be the wrong way of going about it.  I am sure the Minister will make that clear. It is not clear.  There has been a lot of discussion and nobody outside seems to know whether it is so or otherwise. <Col N="1264" /> I would also like to know if the Minister could indicate whether it would be possible to consider in the near future bringing about something on the lines suggested by Deputy Moore, that is to say, to bring all public bodies&mdash;compulsorily, if necessary&mdash;into a common insurance bond arrangement.  If that were done there would be a great saving in the country.  It is generally admitted that the sum paid under the Public Bodies fire losses amounted to only about 7 per cent. of the total premiums collected.  That is an indication which shows that it would pay the Minister to do something to save the difference between that 7 per cent. and the 100 per cent. of premiums leaving the country.  If it could be done it would be a step in the right direction towards the nationalisation of insurance generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies on this side, I am in favour of saving the rates as far as possible.  I am also in favour of mutually insuring public bodies.  As regards this amending Bill, I think there are defects in it which ought to be remedied.  I think there are dangers in it which may lead to the need for further legislation if they are not seen to.  The drafting of this Bill strikes me as being extraordinary. Section 2 is wide enough to take the company out of all Acts covering insurance at present.  Of course, the purpose of it, I presume, is to reverse Judge Davitt's decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the wording of sub-section (2) is extraordinary.  It says that the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited shall be deemed always to have been and shall continue to be a company to which the <Col N="1265" /> Principal Act applies and to be exempt from such of the provisions of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, etc.  I do not know that we can retrospectively deem a thing to be what it was not or that deeming a thing here to comply with the meaning of certain technical terms in insurance will make them have that signification.  There is a reference here to the Companies Acts of 1908 and 1924.  I would be thankful to the Minister if he would tell us what Act in 1924 is referred to.  I have read a fair amount about insurance and the last Act that I know of was in 1917; that was the Companies Act referring to insurance. I do not know the exact meaning of sub-section (4) of Section 2:&mdash;&ldquo;If the said Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited at any time after the passing of this Act alters in any respect its Memorandum of Association it shall forthwith cease to be by virtue of this section a company to which the Principal Act applies and cease to be exempted by virtue of this section from the said provisions of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909...&rdquo; There is no power, apparently, to alter a word there and would it be necessary, if the Government desire to give further powers to this company or make it strictly mutual, to bring in new legislation? I think sub-section (4) should have been drafted in some such terms as that, &ldquo;no provision dealing with deposits should apply to the company.&rdquo; I think it would make it clearer and it would be safer wording so as to avoid further legislation or, perhaps, further litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that these premiums from bodies insured would be sufficient to keep the companies going and I would advocate such insurance should be compulsory on the public bodies, but that it should be mutual.  As suggested by Deputy de Valera, that is an important matter.  We do not want, of course, to prevent an indemnity being given to the public bodies for what has been done, and for things that have happened which were not in accordance with the Act, or prejudice their position or the security they have if a conflagration takes place.  But that might be effected by a temporary measure.  Premiums to foreign insurance companies going out of this country <Col N="1266" /> are a great drain on the national resource and I suggest the whole matter should be examined carefully and deliberately now.  There are a few Deputies here who are experts on insurance. I do not know if anybody would call himself an expert.  I happen to know a little about it, but I do not consider myself an expert.  There are a few Deputies, I think, who could pronounce themselves as experts.</P>

      <P>It is a very technical business and I think a Committee should be set up to examine into the whole question and report to the Dáil or the Minister for Local Government and have legislation drafted accordingly. There are many alternatives to the scheme as outlined in this Bill. Nationalisation of insurance would be one.  Of course that is a very big problem which could not be tackled immediately. Another would be the strictly mutual assurance of public bodies, and in that case the State might be the re-insurer or make the rates liable.  In the case of a big claim in the early years a loan <i>ad hoc</i> might be raised by the State if the reserve funds were not sufficient to meet it.  I gave the matter some consideration, and I drafted an alternative scheme in the rough, and I do not know if I would be in order in putting it briefly before the House.</P>

    <P>I suggest as an alternative that the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act, 1926, might be repealed.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce could, of course, invoke the assistance of the existing law for the liquidation of that company.  I have no animus against that company.  Of course I am in a rather peculiar position.  Somebody mentioned that I happened to be on the board of an Irish insurance company.  The scheme I suggest would take away from the company with which I am connected the insurance of 93 public bodies, so I will be taken as being disinterested in the scheme that I am putting forward.  Perhaps it would be in the interests of the country and the public bodies, and the rates that <Col N="1267" /> all these public bodies pay, that they should be mutually insured.  A Bill might be introduced called the Local Authorities (Protection of Property) Bill, containing some such provisions as these:&mdash;It would be obligatory on all local authorities to insure under that scheme.  The scheme might possibly include Government property.  I would have worked it out in more detail had I been able to get the figures I asked for in a question on Wednesday&mdash;to find the replacement value of the premiums paid, and so on, of all the local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A further suggestion is protection of property to be defined so as to cover the following risks:&mdash;Damage to property by fire from whatever cause arising&mdash;that is, an extension of the insurance definition which excludes riot, civil commotion, &amp;c.; to include boiler explosions, gas engines, motors and other vehicles; driving accidents and third party liability; public liability, personal accidents to servants, authorities' and employers' liability, fidelity guarantee and livestock. For the first five years after the passing of the Act every authority to which the Act applied should strike a protection of property rate of 1d. in the £; one halfpenny rate might possibly do, but 1d. would certainly leave a good margin.  The rateable value of the Dublin Corporation, for instance, is £1,207,895.  I believe a rate of one farthing would cover premiums in Dublin.  In Cork City a rate of .61 of a penny would cover the thing even at the existing rates.  Provision might be made in the Act for the re-examination of compulsory levies at the end of the first five years in the light of the accumulated funds, the claims experienced over the period and the total value of the property risk.  For the first year after the Act came into force levies on the authorities might be made as follows:&mdash;One-tenth of the total annual levy to be paid within the first month, two-tenths within three months, three-tenths within six months, and four-tenths in nine months.  At the end of nine months there would be sufficient to meet the average risk of claims.  For subsequent years the levy might be one-fourth on the 30th June and one-fourth <Col N="1268" /> on the 30th September, 31st December and 31st March, respectively.</P>
    <P>The contributions from the local bodies would be paid into a central reserve fund under the control of the Local Government Department.  It might be dealt with as follows:&mdash;Ten per cent. of the total annual levy would be placed in banks on deposit account in the name of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  That amount would be sufficient to meet claims and management expenses ordinarily. The balance of the annual levy would be invested in Irish trustee securities in the name of the Accountant-General of the Supreme Court.  The interest in invested funds plus any excess of the ten per cent. deposit which experience proves not to be required for claims and to provide the expenses of management would be reinvested in trustee securities.  The central reserve fund would continue to accumulate until it equalled one and a half times the total property risk. When the reserve fund had reached that figure the Act would provide for the method of ascertaining what rate should be struck to meet the annual claims and expenses of management.  It would only be necessary then to meet current expenditure until such time as the accumulated funds equalled twice the property risks.  The interest on the fund should then be adequate for the service of the annual claims and expenses. The Act would provide for a valuation of the property of the local authorities, the fixing of insurance values, and the settlement of claims through the usual channel.  There would then be the employment of valuers and claims' assessors, as at present employed by the insurance companies. It should be remembered that the total shown in insurance claims includes the fees of solicitors, doctors, etc.  That is just a rough outline of this scheme, which might be an alternative to the present Act.  It seems to me there are grave dangers even in the Amending Bill, which would leave many doors open for further litigation which would do no good to the public bodies nor to the company which has their present insurance.</P>

      <P>The general <Col N="1269" /> question of insurance is, no doubt, very much in the minds of Deputies, as can be understood from their remarks here. Deputy Briscoe speaks of the nationalisation of insurance, and Deputy Fahy now gives us a different kind of scheme entirely under which the local authorities might work and into which the State property might be brought as a kind of helping out to the general scheme.  There are other people who think that in the proper development of Irish insurance business the local authority's property might be held as a general help to the scheme.  I do not want now to go into the whole question of insurance.  It does not arise at present. The going out of big amounts of public money out of this country in insurance is a matter that must be taken very serious cognisance of by all interests in the country, and the matter has been engaging the attention of the, Executive Council for quite a long time.  But what the Minister for Local Government here and the Department of Local Government have had to consider in this particular matter was that at the time when there was no proper examination of the provision with regard to insurance generally, certain purely Irish companies in which different public bodies had, over a long period, shown very great interest, in their desire to help Irish insurance, were being gradually bought out by outside companies. The time came when the local bodies themselves decided that they would organise either a mutual or co-operative insurance society of their own which would put them in the position of being independent of outside bodies in time and in the position of keeping their money in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter the Local Government Department is simply helping the local bodies and those on local bodies who had given a considerable amount of thought and taken a deep interest in insurance work generally.  We introduced legislation that helped them to carry out the scheme they thought was the best scheme in the circumstances at the time to get ahead with.  Now this scheme as is generally appreciated has brought about certain advantages and is on the road to bringing about more. The purpose of this particular Bill is <Col N="1270" /> to retain the company as it is in its present formation doing its present good work and not allowing any set back to be given to that company.  If in a further examination of the general insurance position, or an examination of the local bodies and the insurance of their own property, any developments are shown, either by making it compulsory for local bodies to insure in any particular way or in this particular society or this particular society remodelled, the ground will have been kept more solid and the work of preparation will have been greater by reason of the fact that this body has been working and that by the legislation we are introducing here now we are solidifying and holding that ground and not allowing any set back in the present position of insurance which has the confidence of a large number of local bodies.  There is nothing in the present Bill that prejudices in any way a more desirable development, because there are no shareholders other than the local bodies interested in the present company and naturally if a better scheme, a scheme that would be better for the ratepayers and better nationally, can be devised, the persons who were so interested in the matter nationally and from the point of view of the ratepayer, as to bring about the formation of the present company, will only be too pleased to co-operate and travel in any new direction that may be pointed out.</P>
    <P>But as far as the Department of Local Government is concerned they do not want to suggest to the local bodies at the present time that they might change their business in any way, because we have not the knowledge of the general position with regard to insurance in the country and what might be done in a general way to improve the insurance situation nationally to warrant us doing that. But we have given every help we can to these local bodies who have ideas and who are interested in the matter, to do what they consider best at the present time.  It is satisfactory to know that this company, having been formed in 1926, has earned the confidence of a large number of local bodies and that it has won general popular approval for the success that up to the present has <Col N="1271" /> attended its efforts.  Deputy Thrift asked whether in the case of any considerable fire I consider that the present company would be adequate to cover the ratepayers.  I certainly have the greatest possible confidence in the General Council of County Councils and in the local bodies that are members of this particular company to see that they carry out their work in such a way as will leave no risk to the ratepayers.  I do not think there has been any substantial criticism at all of the way in which this body does its work.  In so far as I am concerned in the matter I am not called upon to defend at the present stage, at any rate, the way in which this body was carrying out its work because for this body departmentally or otherwise I have no responsibility. But personally I have full confidence in the management of the business because of my confidence in the people who have initiated it and are working it.  If there is any weakness in the situation, the names of the county councils and the other bodies who are involved in the matter would be sufficient to assure us that this weakness will be got over.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thrift and others objected to the definition &ldquo;mutual insurance&rdquo; in this Bill.  From the terms of the original Act it was quite plain that there was no mutual liability, except to the extent of £10, on any one body in case of losses by others.  As far as I am informed, the expression &ldquo;mutual insurance,&rdquo; as applied to the intention of the original Act, and what is expressed there, is an interpretation that has been accepted for years in the insurance world and, I understand, in the working of certain insurance companies in Britain, so that we have simply the question of a general acceptance which has come about, and has been fairly well established now in a legal way, being overthrown, and overthrown, no doubt, on solid legal grounds.  I do not see that it will help to persuade anyone in a legal way that black is white when, for the purposes of the work that this body wants to do for local bodies, we put in this clause:</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;mutual insurance&rdquo; where it occurs in the Principal Act shall mean insurance by a <Col N="1272" /> company in which all the holders of policies issued by such company and no other persons are members of such company whether any liability does or does not exist between such members, each to and with the others in respect of claims under such policies.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister would let me put a point to him.  It is not for the purpose of interrupting. If there is a certain interpretation of the word &ldquo;mutual&rdquo; held by British companies, if this company does, as it will have to do, a considerable amount of re-insurance, and supposing 80 per cent. of a certain premium is re-insured with a British company, if a fire occurs and the British company holds that the word &ldquo;mutual&rdquo; had a wrong interpretation, that it is ultra vires, where would the public body stand? I wonder has the Minister taken into consideration that there is a possible danger of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the opinion of the legal advisers to the Government that no insuring authority will be liable for more than £10 in the event of the company failing to re-insure to the extent that might be necessary to meet any loss that might occur?  Is it the opinion of the legal advisers that each insurer will not be liable for more than £10?</P>

      <P>The simplest way to deal with this matter is to get at the original Act and change the definition of the word used there.  If you could get another word to express the meaning more accurately than mutual appears to do, why not tackle it at the source and make the change where it ought to be made?</P>

If Deputies have any amendments that they think would meet the matter in a more satisfactory way they will receive consideration.  But it has appeared to my advisers quite sufficient for the purposes we are seeking here and involving no liability or danger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a real danger. Under the 1909 Act a deposit was necessary in order to give security to the policy holders.  In a mutual company the security for the policy holders is the other policy holders.  We are told that this is not a mutual company, so that there is not that security in this company.  The 1909 Act provided that insurance companies trading, not as mutual companies but as ordinary companies, were to make a deposit of £20,000 to ensure that insurers would have their risks covered.</P>

You are in this extraordinary position&mdash;I do not want to make a speech, but I want the Dáil to realise what is happening&mdash; you are insuring local authorities.  You have twenty-four million pounds revenue, and you have five million pounds rate revenue.  The twenty four million pounds revenue is relieving your five million pounds rate revenue. The two things are inter-connected definitely by the relief given from national taxation to local taxation. If the £20,000 is put up it must be put up first in some way as a charge on the rates, and eventually as a charge on the revenue.  The Dáil will have to provide the money directly or indirectly.</P>

      <P>To my mind this Bill is sufficient to deal with the matter satisfactorily, but if Deputy Flinn considers that anything ought to <Col N="1278" /> be put into it on the lines he suggests, let us see an amendment from him and let us have the merits of that amendment discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely friendly to this thing, and I think everybody on this side also is.  We are not resisting this Bill, we are only trying to understand it and we are criticising it for the purpose of improving it.  The point is this, that on the face of it there does not seem to be security for anything in the nature of a catastrophe risk, even a limited catastrophe.  We suggest that in order that this may be part of a developing scheme of sound Irish insurance, the one portion which we are tackling should be actuarially sound from the beginning, and we suggest that the way to do that is for the State immediately to tackle re-insurances or, failing that, that there should be included in this Bill something to make it actuarially sound from the beginning.  It could be made actuarially sound, because you are dealing with solvent insurances; you are dealing with insurances about which you have in your possession every single bit of information that you require.  Will the Minister facilitate us in grafting on to this Bill a means that will make these risks actuarially sound?  It might mean practically withdrawing the Bill.</P>

      <P>Our interest in the matter is to see that the work is carried out satisfactorily in the interests of the ratepayers, to see that they are fully protected, and to see that they get the benefits of cheap insurance, and if any amendments are brought forward that will help better to secure these things they will get the <Col N="1279" /> fullest and the most sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>But we have not heard any suggestion to the effect that the State should make itself liable in any way.  It has been pointed out indirectly that if steps are taken here which throw a burden on the ratepayers, in fact that burden will come from State funds, because large amounts of money are contributed to the ratepayers out of State funds.  I do not know that a Deputy would be out of order in introducing an amendment that threw a burden on State funds in that indirect way.</P>

      <P>No amendment could be introduced to this Bill which would mean putting a liability on State funds.  There is no doubt at all about that.  But whether an amendment could be put into the Bill to put a burden on the rates is a wholly different question, which I could not now decide.  You cannot bring into this Bill in Committee any principle which would place a burden upon State funds.  The Minister could not do it. In Committee on this Bill the Minister could not introduce a principle which would place a burden upon State funds. If a burden is to be placed on State funds that principle must be affirmed by the House on the Second Reading of the Bill, and even a member of the Executive Council could not, in Committee on a Bill, introduce a proposal that the State should bear certain liabilities, if there was not already something in the Bill dealing with State liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite fair to the Minister, but my point is this, that I am not satisfied that the rights of insurers are being protected by this Bill.  In other words, I do not think that there is adequate cover to meet liabilities.  I am anxious that the Minister should look into that aspect of the question and satisfy himself on it before he proceeds further with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>Several points occur in connection with this Bill.  The immediate purpose of the Bill is to deal with the recent decision of the courts. That is a very limited and narrow objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>But a very important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important one, I admit, from the point of view that it affects the whole idea of cooperation in the matter of public bodies insurance.  That is a problem that ought to be dealt with in a satisfactory way.  I daresay it would be easy enough for us to deal with that particular aspect of it on the Committee Stage.  But then other questions of a much broader character are immediately suggested by this Bill.  There are, for instance, the questions put by Deputy Good with reference to the original Act.  The effect of what the Deputy suggested would be to make the original Act sounder than it is.  I think that anyone who considers the matter at all will be satisfied that the original Act, as it is, is very unsound, and therefore the question arises as to whether a much wider scope could not be given to this Bill. All that the Minister is proposing to do now is to deal with the question of the decision in the courts.  I suggest, if that is going to be done at all, that the still broader questions should be <Col N="1281" /> considered.  If the Executive Council have been considering the whole question of insurance generally and the amount of Irish money that is leaving the country, they ought surely to be in a position at this stage to deal with the facts and figures before them and to arrive at a decision.  Speaking for the majority on these Benches, we would prefer to see the big question settled. If that big question is not going to be tackled, and if the proposal here be that we are only to deal with the position arising out of the decision given in the courts, then we are simply leaving still to stand the difficulties that have been indicated in the original Act.</P>
      <P>I think that we ought to deal with this whole question in such a way that the objection which Deputy Thrift indicated would not lie in this.  It seems to me to be a very simple matter.  You would have to change the name of the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance&mdash; I think that title would have to go&mdash;and give a name to this particular type of co-operation in insurance, and that this company should adopt that name.  There may be some difficulties and disadvantages in that course.  I can see immediately one or two, but I would say that they are relatively minor compared with the disadvantages and dangers that there will be in appearing to give a definition through this Act to mutuality in insurance.  This may be quoted in some way outside the Principal Act to which it refers, but it seems to me to be a very complicated way.  It also seems to me to be a very dangerous way for dealing with what in our opinion here appears to be a comparatively simple matter.  I am afraid that the legal advisers have taken a very narrow view of this.  They are only concerned with a narrow legal technicality of making the thing fit in, without having clear to their minds at all the large consequences that will flow from it as has been indicated by Deputy Thrift, and by I think some Deputies on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that as far as we are concerned the difficulty is this: We will have to vote either for or against the Second Reading of this Bill.  The question will then be, after we have voted, what is the principle that we <Col N="1282" /> have voted for?  As far as I am concerned I am not going to vote for the Second Reading simply from the point of view of getting the opportunity in Committee to deal with the technical difficulties and the narrow question of the decision of the courts in another manner.  Whether we will be able to do that in Committee is a question which I am in difficulties about.  I do not know to what extent we will be bound by the Second Reading of this Bill.  I think it would be much safer, and I would prefer it myself, if this Bill were withdrawn and all the matters that have been suggested here were taken into consideration.  There is no question of danger of the company suffering.  I think every member of the House is fairly well satisfied that the difficulty that arose was one that arose through inadvertence, and that there was no deliberate attempt to do damage or fraud or anything of that kind.  As far as we are concerned we would be prepared to do all that we could to settle the situation as far as the company is concerned, but I suggest that the Minister should reconsider this matter before we are asked to vote for something which may tie our hands afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>In some of the speeches that have been made I have been asked to deal with a very much wider subject than is intended by this Bill.  Deputy Fahy has put up one scheme before us while other Deputies have spoken on certain aspects of the Bill.  I would like to consider these points and see how far along the lines indicated development might take place. I think, however, that if an examination of a scheme such as Deputy Fahy has suggested is to take place it cannot very well be done now.  At the moment we are dealing with an immediate difficulty from the point of view of a company that is entitled to carry on business. <Col N="1283" /> The business of that company is prejudiced by the decision that was given recently in the courts, and what we are proposing to do is to rectify that position in a simple way.  It is on such lines that I would desire a Bill to deal with that matter.  We propose dealing with the matter on simple lines like that.  Deputies will have the opportunity of introducing further things into this Bill on the Committee Stage. If, on the Committee Stage, they are not satisfied as regards what they want to get into the Bill then it will be quite open to them to oppose the Bill on that Stage and also on the Report Stage, and thereby relieve themselves of any responsibility by defeating the Bill if necessary.  I would suggest, after the discussion that has taken place, that the Bill be given a Second Reading so that opportunity may be given on the Committee Stage for the purpose of dealing with amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with Deputy Good's question, I think it would be as reasonable to ask the Minister to inquire into the position of other insurance companies with whom local bodies are dealing.  The Minister has stated definitely that no insurer will be liable for more than £10 in the event of a loss occurring either through want of reserves or through re-insurance.  I have already mentioned that on the Second Reading debate on the Principal Act that statement was contradicted by Professor Magennis, who gave two very definite cases that had been decided in England to refute that. <Col N="1284" /> When we come to the Committee Stage we will want to know what is the position, on the advice of the law advisers of this country.  It seems to me we cannot get on in the Committee Stage unless we have that.  It would be important when we reach the Committee Stage to know the total value of property that may be insured under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the larger question looked into by the Minister, if he would be good enough to do so.  I am not satisfied, as I have said before, that there is security here to meet the liability.  In this matter we should not allow any company to carry on under this Act if we are not satisfied it has securities to meet its liabilities.  That is the principal point I am concerned about in the interests of insurance.  I want that point inquired into carefully by the Minister before the next stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is that the Bill be read a Second Time.  With regard to the situation that has arisen on the Bill, the Second Stage is a time when questions larger than those on the Bill may be raised.  That is why I allowed Deputy de Valera to discuss the question of nationalisation of insurance and Deputy Fahy to put up a scheme quite different to that in the amending Bill or in the Principal Act.  If the Bill is narrow, then the questions which would arise in Committee must also necessarily be narrow and the scope for amending will, of course, be as narrow as the scope of the Bill itself.  I do not want any misapprehensions.  If the House generally wants, as it appears to, a discussion on a question of this kind, there will be no difficulty in finding an opportunity for such a discussion, but I am not clear that the opportunity will come on the Committee Stage of this Bill, and still less so on the Fourth and Fifth Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this subject last I was interrupted by reason of the adjournment of this debate.  I mentioned the qualifications of a certain engineer.  I had shown that throughout his university and intermediate courses he took first place, gold medals and exhibitions in practically every year throughout his course. I think it will be admitted that we could not possibly get a better qualified engineer in this country than this particular man.  I was going on to say that there were three vacancies for the position of assistant surveyors in County Limerick in 1926, and three men were appointed to them, including this man.  In the meantime, before the appointments were ratified, this Principal Act came into force and the positions had to be again re-advertised. Those men were brought up before the Selection Board for interview.  The other two men were appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners, <Col N="1286" /> but for some reason this man was not. Shortly afterwards this man made application for a position in County Monaghan, and again he was not appointed. In the beginning of this year there was a vacancy in County Donegal for which he applied, and again he was not appointed. I know what I have said so far is true, that is as regards his qualifications, and I am informed, but I do not know if this is true, that the men appointed to these three positions were not nearly as well qualified as he was, that is, they had only pass degrees in each case.  Deputy Hennessy spoke a good deal about university training and high degrees.  What are we to learn from this case, where you have an engineer who got first class honours, first place in his degree examination, who got the B.Sc. and qualified for teaching in Irish in Ring College, and took the Higher Diploma in Education in the National University&mdash;that might not be of much use for measuring stones on a road-side but it should broaden his education&mdash;if a man of that high academic distinction cannot get the post of assistant surveyor, worth £160 a year, in his native county or some other county?  What then, is the use of all these academic distinctions?  Either university training and these degrees are a farce or there is the other alternative that the Local Appointments Commissioners are a fraud.  It might be said that this man has no experience, but as a matter of fact he had two years' experience under the Revenue Commissioners and under the Public Works Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us, perhaps, might not think very much about a man who got his experience in the Public Works Department but, at any rate, the Local Appointments Commissioners should have respect for that institution and should accept experience in that Department, just as they would in the case of a county council where a man works under a county surveyor.  I know that in two of the three cases the men who were appointed in preference to him had less than one year's experience of practical work, so that even from the <Col N="1287" /> point of view of experience this man had more experience than the others and there is no doubt about his qualifications. I might be asked to suggest some reason why he was not appointed. I am going to suggest a reason.  His father was once a trusted nominee of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in a certain position and he resigned that position because Cumann na nGaedheal took a line of action with which he did not agree.  That is the only reason I can suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case is mentioned, that of a clerk appointed in Enniscorthy. I do not know if there is any defence for that.  It is freely reported, at any rate, that the man who got that position only got fifth place. Somebody may ask me, as the Minister for Agriculture asked Deputy de Valera the other day, to produce proofs about the charges of corruption.  That, I think, is a rather hard thing to do. If we were permitted to go in and examine the minute book and correspondence kept by the Local Appointments Commissioners and if, further, we are perfectly satisfied that these are the correct and original minutes and correspondence, we might be able to produce proofs or we might not.  If, however, more than five men go for a position, as happened in the case in Enniscorthy, if it is freely reported afterwards that the fifth man got the appointment, if it is freely admitted on all sides that in all probability this man would only get fifth place in the examination, and if it is quite well known that one man had the Fáinne as a qualification in Irish and the man who got the appointment did not do the Irish examination at all, then I say that there is ground in that case for saying that there is irregularity. But how can we give further proof?  We are not in a position to do so.  If, of course, seeing how the appointments went, we became suspicious, then there is only one way which I could suggest of allaying our fears. Suppose we were to get a full list of the appointments made since the Government came into office, not only in local bodies, but in Government Departments, and not only appointments but promotions, and if we were to go through that list, some of us knowing the men on the <Col N="1288" /> Government Benches and those who would likely have influence with them, relatives and so on, we might be then in a position to judge whether there was any favouritism or corruption or whatever you like to call it.  I would say that if the Government have a good case in this matter and have nothing to hide they ought to supply that list, and put us in the wrong if they can, and prove to us that there is nothing in what we say and that the relatives and friends of the Government Party did not get more than their proper proportion of whatever jobs and promotions were going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COBURN</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill that has been introduced by Deputy de Valera, because I think the original Act did not give complete satisfaction.  I would much prefer that the Bill had been treated on its merits, and that the members of the Executive Council had not thought fit, more or less, to consider it their duty to make a massed attack upon the Bill.  There can be no denying the fact that there is great dissatisfaction in the Saorstát, not alone amongst those who are politically opposed to the present Government, but also amongst some of the strongest supporters of the Government and amongst that very large section of the people who are attached to neither party.  I do not like the idea of referring to matters that are ancient history, but. owing to the attitude taken up on this debate by members of the Front Bench in particular, I, as one who is dissatisfied with the way in which appointments have been made by the Appointments Commissioners, am convinced that there has been corruption, if I may use the word, in regard to certain appointments that were made in the past.  I am convinced that the decisions of the Appointments Commissioners have got to be ratified by the Minister who is over the Department to which the appointment has been made.  That admission has been made here by no less a personage than the Minister for Finance on the question of the Clerkship of the Dundalk District Court.  I presume that the Minister was more or less under the impression that I was an innocent class of man, that anything could be said to me, and that it did not matter what answer was made on that occasion.  The <Col N="1289" /> Minister for Justice, in his reply to my question, gave as one of his principal reasons that he as Minister had absolutely no control over the Appointments Commissioners, and the Minister for Finance immediately afterwards informed the House that the person who is at present in the position of Clerk to the Dundalk District Court had already been turned down.</P>

      <P>I brought up the question here, anyhow.  It is a question affecting the suspicion that seems to exist amongst a very large section of the people of my constituency, that public appointments are not given on merit or have not been given on merit. <Col N="1290" /> That is why I rise to support the Bill introduced by Deputy de Valera.  I am still convinced that there is something very suspicious about the whole question of appointments in the Free State.  I have specific knowledge of another appointment in my constituency. Here again I would be very slow to refer to this appointment were it not for the fact that an attempt was made on the part of Ministers in particular to create the impression in this House that every appointment that had been made in the past was made on merit.  There was an appointment made lately in my constituency.  Five or six candidates sat for an examination, and not one of these candidates passed that examination.  They all failed, and yet one of the number was appointed.  So much for examinations. I believe that the public bodies of this country are not as corrupt as they have been made out to be in this House.  The common people of the Free State have elected the public bodies of the Free State, and the same people who elect public bodies elect the members of this House.  Therefore, if the public bodies are dishonest, we also are dishonest, and I do not think it is right or fair that this charge of wholesome corruption and bribery should be levelled against public bodies.  I myself am a member of a public body, the members of which would add dignity to this House.  They are men who have proved their worth in the economic, industrial and professional life of their native county.  I do not think that these charges should have been levelled against the public bodies in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, instead of wholesale charges being made, Ministers and the members of the Government Party had accepted this Bill as introduced by Deputy de Valera or intimated, as they themselves intimated to the Leader of the Labour Party regarding the amendment, that they were prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the Bill, I believe that the Bill would have been withdrawn and the amendment, as introduced by the Leader of the Labour Party, would have been accepted unanimously by all parties in the House.  Instead of that, there was, as I say, a massed attack made on the Bill.  Thus, we see very <Col N="1291" /> valuable time spent on the discussion of this Bill and the amendment, the waste of which could have been obviated altogether.  I maintain still, and a very big section of the people in the constituency which I represent have the same opinion, that fair play has not been shown in the making of appointments in general throughout the Free State.  So convinced am I that that feeling is general that I am quite prepared to test that feeling in my own constituency at any time in the near future.  There is no use in getting up in this House and maintaining that this Bill is the result of political propaganda. It is the firm conviction of sincere, honest people throughout the Free State that appointments made in the past were not made according to merit in many instances.  For that reason I welcome the Bill as introduced by the Leader of the Opposition Party, to make some amendments in the Act of 1926, but as I said before, if this Bill were treated in a sympathetic manner, I am sure that the amendment, as introduced by the Leader of the Labour Party, would have been accepted unanimously by all parties in the House.</P>

      <P>I do not think many will question my bona fides in speaking on a Bill such as this.  When one comes to read the Bill one finds that it is founded on the argument which was put up by me against the original Act, and that it is, practically speaking, based on that argument.  The principle is to send down a panel instead of sending down one name.  That was the argument I put up.  Perhaps it seems peculiar for me to criticise the new Bill, but I do criticise it.  Arguments have been put forward here that public bodies are not dishonest and are not corrupt.  I am very sorry that a year and a half ago I could not make use of the same arguments that are made use of by the Opposition now. Public bodies as a whole are not dishonest, but, unfortunately, we find some few counties where that cannot be said.  These counties we find particularly on the borders of the Shannon.</P>

Whether it was the peculiar atmosphere of the Shannon mud that was responsible for it or not I do not know, but so it was anyhow.  Before the war, when money was not as plenty as it was later on, it took £750 to £800 to get a doctor elected in Limerick.  Anybody who had not that amount was out of it. That was supposed to be the market price at that time.  I have this from personal friends of my own who went up there to be elected, and from a man whom I brought down from Limerick and got elected in Kilkenny.</P>

In these particular counties the public representatives felt insulted, and I do not blame them, but the fact that in some counties there were public bodies who were dishonest, who were out for what Deputy Anthony calls &ldquo;backsheesh,&rdquo; justified the original Act.  When you come up against an argument like that you cannot meet it.  It may be that the present Appointments Commission are not doing their duty properly, but that is not the fault of the system.  When we are dealing with a Bill to amend the Act it is the system that is involved. Has the system proved to be wrong? It seems to me that some of the promoters of this Bill do not believe in it&mdash; I do not think they do.  If they do accept the principle of competitive examination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

His exact words were that where the local authority wanted a competitive examination they would not oppose it.  They wanted the panel of three sent down, but if any local authority wished to have one name sent down they would not oppose it.  These were his exact words.  It seems to me that, instead of having belief in the Bill, it is an effort to get all the disgruntled individuals in the community into their own political Irish stew-pot&mdash;all the ingredients are welcome.</P>

      <P>Inquiry is another matter.  If there was an inquiry, and if some of the confidential files were available, I have no doubt that it would be found that there were sufficient reasons actuating the Commissioners in coming to their decisions&mdash;reasons that it might not be good for some of the applicants to have published.  The poor man's son has been referred to.  If there is one thing more abused than another it is the name of the poor man's son. More capital is being made out of it than anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It appeared to me from some of the arguments used that the idea is that if a candidate is a poor man's son the Commission should be made aware of the fact and he should get special treatment.  The fact that a person gets an appointment means that he came up to a certain standard and was appointed on merit.  He deserves no more and should get no special treatment, whether he is a poor man's son or not.  When you ensure that there is fair play you have given all that is necessary, whether the candidate is a poor man's son or otherwise. Deputy O'Kelly said that if they had a representative on the Appointments <Col N="1295" /> Commission they would have been for it.  In other words, if one of the political parties here had a representative on the Commission they would be satisfied. Then all that is necessary is to have a representative on it from each party &mdash;one from Cumann na nGaedheal, one from Fianna Fáil, and, if it could be arranged, another for the National Party, the Labour Party and the rest; or otherwise have them put on by proportional representation.  The idea of political parties being represented on the Appointments Commission and carrying politics into the Commission is about the most peculiar suggestion I have ever heard from a responsible public man.  That is their solution of the whole question.  I think they would be there for inquiring into the politics of candidates rather than their qualifications. In 1921 or 1922 I remember having to deal with public appointments in County Kilkenny.  We were dealing at that time with the formation of a central authority to replace the several authorities which existed all over the county.  We had all the existing officers of the several authorities at our disposal, and I frankly admit that, with the rest, I voted on political grounds; that we put aside good officers that were there already and put in new men who had not experience. Fortunately we got some very good officers, although they had no experience, who have given entire satisfaction since.  But I voted on political grounds; I voted for the people who had identified themselves with the Sinn Féin movement as against the Black and Tans.  I make no secret of that. Every other man voted on the same lines, and will again, except something is done to prevent local bodies voting on political and private grounds.  I make no apology for that.  I do not think it was corruption in any sense&mdash; it may have been doing a job, but if it was I frankly admit having done it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I am on rather delicate ground, having opposed the original Act.  I believe still that it would be a good thing, and perhaps restore a sense of dignity to local authorities, if there were a panel sent down, and if the standard were raised sufficiently high to ensure that you would have <Col N="1296" /> absolute competence.  I believe it would restore that dignity to local bodies that they think they have lost. But, as in my opinion this Bill is brought forward to try to get the people who are disgruntled about local appointments, the people who do not want to pay their annuities, the people who want to evade debts of one description or another, the people who do not want to work, into this political stew pot, I oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. WOLFE Mr. G. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>When the original Bill was before the Dáil, I gave it my most hearty support, because from my experience, extending over 30 years on end of two systems, both devised by the British, I got a good idea of the working of local affairs, and I found human nature very much the same under both systems.  During that time I do not suppose I would be wrong in saying there were hundreds of appointments in which I took part.  I can remember some of them very vividly and I always thought there was a vital necessity for having some change made in the system of appointments.  It threw too much responsibility on the local people and sometimes brought about very unpleasant feelings about appointments that took place and which it took years to mollify.  I particularly remember one case a very long time ago. It was an appointment that was one of the plums of the county.  The person that occupied the position made a very large fortune.  He was a dispensary doctor and he was more or less the friend of everybody, high and low, in the county.  When he died there was a very great desire to get this position and the very keenest interest was displayed by different people to get their own friend appointed.  In fact, when the appointment came to be made there was a sort of Donnybrook Fair outside the place where it was made.  The very bad feeling that was brought about by this appointment went on for years.  A sort of vendetta went on and lasted for a very long time; in fact, I do not think it ever died out.  That was a very long time ago.  Still human nature I think is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember another appointment which took place many years ago. <Col N="1297" /> There were two candidates.  One of the candidates held views stronger even than Deputy de Valera's so far as I understood him.  Nevertheless, he had the greatest ability and was a man of the kindest possible disposition.  People high and low, even the most extreme Tories, backed him.  He was most popular in the district.  There was very keen opposition against him by a person who had very great local influence and used it to the utmost.  The people of the district wanted to have this man of the extreme views, and I am bound to say, in my opinion, he should have been appointed, because I thought the people of the district had a right to choose whoever they thought was the best man for this appointment and I tried to help him to get it because they were practically unanimous upon it. In spite of that, however, it was no use. When the appointment came on the qualifications of the two men were read out.  One was quite a young inexperienced man, but his qualifications were good.  The other was a man highly qualified and the people of the district wanted him.  Their representatives did everything they could to get him appointed but it was no use.  If the Archangel Michael came down from Heaven, and used his influence, it would be of no avail.  Here was a local appointment; there was no doubt about this man's qualifications; the people of the district, high and low, of every creed and class, wanted him, and yet, in spite of that, he was turned down.</P>
    <P>After that I determined that if ever I had a chance of helping to have some system of appointment devised that would ensure that the man who was best qualified for the post and that was acceptable to the people should be appointed, as far as possible, I would do my best to help that.  When the Act came on, which this Bills seeks to amend, I supported it to the utmost.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who was then Minister for Local Government, said quite rightly that he was content to let his reputation rest upon that Act.  I think he was quite safe in saying that, because I think it will always stand to his credit as one of the best Acts that ever passed in this House.  There is <Col N="1298" /> no system perfect; there is nothing perfect. I think it is the fairest system to have an Appointments Commission, as far away as possible from any influence that can touch it.  That Commission can consider the qualifications of each of the candidates far better in a detached atmosphere than the local people could who are swayed by jealousies and other things&mdash;I do not say corruption, because I do not think corruption comes into it.  It is undue influence and human nature.  I should be very sorry to see any change made. As I said nothing is perfect, but in time and with experience of the working of the Act, it may be improved.  The system is quite wrong.  I am convinced of that.  I am convinced that, on the whole, the Act is fairest.  And it is the best system that has hitherto been devised. If a better system can be shown to me, then I will support it to the best of my ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. HASLETT Mr. HASLETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have followed with the greatest interest the debate on this Bill, which is described as an Amendment Bill.  The original Bill was one in which, as a member of the public, I took a great interest as a step in the right direction, and when this Amendment Bill came on I read it as carefully as I could.  It may be the fault of my intelligence, but I rather think it is the fault of the Bill.  In reality the Bill is not doing what it proposes to do. This debate, as I conceive it, has taken the wrong turn.  It has been a comparison between the old system and the new, not a comparison between the Act of 1926 and this Bill proposing to amend it, which is proposed by Deputy de Valera.  I think that with very few exceptions there is general agreement that there ought to be such an Act in principle as the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  We must remember when this Act was first passed it was an experiment, an experiment which I do not think even the Minister who brought it in would say was altogether perfect.  Now there has been some time during which that Act has been working.  The Bill introduced by Deputy de Valera should be directed to removing the things in the original Act that were not working well.  This Bill, as I understand it, is <Col N="1299" /> not based on the faulty parts of the original Act, because it proposes certain things which came in the original administering of the first Bill.  It proposes certain things which were introduced, and which I say should be abandoned now as unworkable. I refer to Section 7 of Deputy de Valera's Bill, which states that there should be at least three names sent down from the Appointments Commissioners to the local body. Now I submit that is where the crux of the whole situation lies.  So long as you have more than one name sent down to the local bodies you will have a wrangle.  If there were a dozen names sent down, in the end the wrangle would be about two, and you do not take away the local influence and you do not remedy that part of the existing Act at all.</P>
      <P>If the Appointments Commissioners are any use, as we believe they are&mdash; and I say the Act is on the right lines and I back up the principle&mdash;it is for them to select the very best candidate and send down his name and then let that person be appointed.  It has been mentioned here that there were cases where three or four names were sent down and the very best candidate was not selected.  If this Dáil sets out for getting the very best talent in the country and putting a premium on industry and excellence it is surely a simple matter, if we have an independent authority examining the candidates, that he should select the best and let the local board appoint that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 3&mdash;I am proceeding backwards in criticising this&mdash;it shortens the list of the persons who would be appointed through the Commissioners, and it leaves out appointments which, I think, are far more important than the ones it keeps in.  There is no word here about medical officers, about matrons of hospitals or other individuals on whom the lives of the people depend.  For that reason I think that is not an improvement.  Deputy Coburn started off by saying that he was supporting the Bill and, like a number of others, he said he was willing to let it be tried in his own constituency, not between this Bill and the original Act, but between the original Act and the <Col N="1300" /> method by which the local bodies formerly made the appointments.  It is within our recollection the wrangles and pulls and influences that were once in operation.  To my own personal knowledge I have known a county council election to be fought simply on the issue of who was going to be secretary to the county council.</P>
    <P>The Appointments Commissioners take away all that&mdash;at least I hope they do.  It surely goes a long way towards preventing the prostitution of the interests of the community for the individual. If Deputy de Valera, in introducing the amending Bill, had directed his attention to what has been the failure of the Act, I would have great pleasure in supporting him.  If he had put his finger on where there should be no such thing as a local board being the examining authority, I would have great pleasure in supporting him then. As I have said before, it is not fair to the board and it is not fair to the candidate.</P>
    <P>There is on record, I believe, the declaration of an important judge on one occasion that it was very good evidence that a man had been drinking if you saw him coming out of a publichouse wiping his mouth with his handkerchief. It was suspicious.  If you bring the local board down to examine the local candidates it is very hard to remove the suspicion from that board. If that amendment had been in the Bill I would have great pleasure in supporting it.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, I do not see that it can serve any useful purpose, because it does not remove the anomalies of the Act, and it does not improve the Act, and I do not think it would work out to our satisfaction.  I was very interested, naturally, in the speech delivered by my colleague on the opposite benches.  I do not know that it is fair to say that he is a colleague, but he is, at least, a Deputy from the same constituency. I do not think it was a very consistent argument to use.  He said there were certain instances where it was purely a wangle on behalf of the big party in this House to get appointments made.  Then he went on to criticise how another appointment was made, and he drew the distinction himself, and he even quoted a letter from <Col N="1301" /> a distinguished clergyman in this country in support of that, that no person of a particular denomination should have been elected.</P>
    <P>Placing these things together, I do not think there is any consistency in it. It is not for the making of appointments on merits.  If a particular person had been appointed it was all right. It was not on the merits of the case&mdash; it was not to get the best candidate.  I say that in the Local Appointments Commissioners the aim is to get the very best, and it is for this House to ensure by some means and by some amendment that all suspicion of the local boards is taken away, and that they will get the very best candidates for the position.  If so, the views of men who are working for appointing people on merit will prevail, and then we will have gone a long way towards settling this everlasting wrangle about all these appointments.</P>

      <P>In February and March, 1925, a public notice was inserted in the Dublin and provincial Press inviting applications for repayment from persons claiming to have subscribed to the loan. Formal minutes were issued by me on the 19th December, 1925; 15th October, 1926, and 30th March, 1927, in pursuance of Section 4 of the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924, prescribing conditions and evidence upon which persons claiming to have subscribed should be entered in the register.  The effect of the first-mentioned minute is that the name of any person (whether the original subscriber or his legal personal representative) who submitted an application in writing before the 31st March, 1925, and furnished particulars corresponding with entries in the records of the Department of Finance, might be entered in the authentic register.  The minute of the 15th October, 1926, waived the condition as to the time-limit for lodging applications.  The minute of the 30th March, 1927, primarily covers cases in which there is no record of the subscription in the Department of Finance and enables me to authorise the entry of such cases in the authentic register, with a view to the issue of a Savings Certificate, where I am satisfied that the evidence produced is sufficient to warrant that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of subscribers is <Col N="1303" /> estimated to be approximately 140,000, but, owing to the circumstances in which the Loan was raised, only 120,000 names are recorded in the primary register, which was compiled at the time the Loan was raised or almost immediately afterwards.  Efforts are being made to obtain particulars from collectors where such particulars have not yet been furnished, but in many cases the original collectors are not now available, while in others difficulty arises from the fact that the lists received cannot be reconciled with the individual applications received from the area in question.  Sometimes even conflicting lists are received in respect of subscriptions in a particular area. In accordance with the conditions originally laid down and promulgated in the public notice referred to above, subscribers were required to lodge their applications not later than the 31st March, 1925.  Only 35,200 applications, however, were received by that date, and I subsequently decided, for the time being at any rate, to waive the time limit.  No further time limit for making applications has yet been fixed.  Repayment has, up to the present, been authorised in 70,615 cases, representing approximately £342,000, including principal and interest.</P>
    <P>The amount still outstanding (including principal and interest) is approximately £188,000.  I am confident that by the end of the present financial year repayment will have been authorised in all cases in which particulars of the subscription are recorded in my Department, and application has been made for repayment, and also in cases in which, though the particulars were not recorded, satisfactory evidence in support of the claim has been submitted to the Department of Finance.  In certain cases, however, considerable correspondence and investigation may be entailed by reason of the fact that sufficient evidence in support of the claim is not forthcoming.  The situation is further complicated by the fact that applications are being received in large numbers from persons who subscribed to various funds for national purposes about the time that the Loan was raised and who now think they are entitled to obtain repayment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> Requests are frequently received in the Department of Finance for lists showing the names and addresses of subscribers and amounts subscribed in particular areas, but there are serious objections to furnishing lists of that kind.  It should particularly be borne in mind that owing to the circumstances in which the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan was raised, the fact that the Department of Finance has not, through the payment of periodical dividends or otherwise, been kept in touch with individual subscribers and the imperfections generally of the records which have been compiled, it is essential to insist that individual subscribers should apply in writing for repayment. It is equally essential, in the interests of the subscribers themselves as well as in the interests of the Exchequer, that the Department of Finance should not take any step which would facilitate fraud.</P>
    <P>There may be several persons bearing the same name in any particular locality and if lists of subscriptions were furnished there would obviously be grave danger that claims might be submitted from persons other than the actual subscriber who would be in a position, as the result of the furnishing of lists, to submit full particulars of the subscriptions in respect of which they apply.  This risk would, in fact, arise even in cases in which there were not persons bearing the same name, and the possibility of substantiating a claim would be increased in cases in which the original subscriber died or emigrated since the loan was raised.  It may be stated here that a number of claims have already been submitted which there is every reason to suspect, and in at least one case a prosecution has been ordered.</P>
    <P>Finally, it must be recognised that if a list were furnished to one person in respect of a particular area it would frequently be found that others could with equal justice claim to be furnished with a copy of the same list, and it is obvious that the making of lists of this kind in large numbers would seriously retard the progress which is being made with the task of authorising repayment of subscribers generally.</P>
    <P>It is consistent with the refusal to furnish such lists to refuse also to reply <Col N="1305" /> to the direct question.  &ldquo;Is the name of A. B. on the list on the primary register of subscribers?&rdquo; At the same time it is less objectionable to reply to such an inquiry than to furnish a list of subscribers with particulars of their subscriptions. If the subscriber concerned has applied for repayment before the inquiry is made, his application will be dealt with in the ordinary way, and if his name is on the primary register it does not matter whether an inquirer is so informed or not.  If his name is not on the register he will generally be informed in a very short time by the Department of Finance that there is no record of his subscription, and he will be asked to furnish any evidence he can, such as a receipt, a paid cheque or a statement from the collector in support of his application.  If, on the other hand, the subscriber has not applied before the inquiry is made he gains nothing by being informed that his name is or is not on the list of subscribers. The fact that an inquiry is made about A. B. in particular justifies, <i>prima facie</i>, an assumption that A. B. has subscribed to the loan, and obviously he ought to apply for repayment whether his name is on the primary register or not.  The important point, of course, is that no information should be given as to what amount is recorded in the register as the subscription of A. B. and this information cannot in any circumstances be given.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, convenient to take this opportunity of saying that Deputies have recently begun to make it a practice to make inquiries by personal application at the Department of Finance or by way of Parliamentary Question, about large batches of individual cases.  The Department is naturally anxious to furnish Deputies with the fullest information consistently with the considerations indicated above, but Deputies must recognise that inquiries of this kind about large numbers of individual cases divert the energies of the staff from their normal duties and thus delay the work of repayment generally, while accomplishing little for individuals on whose behalf the inquiries are made.  All claims are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible, and it is accordingly <Col N="1306" /> suggested that Deputies should in future restrict their inquiries to an absolute minimum.  Special attention can always be given to a particular case in which it is alleged that the delay in authorising repayment has been unduly prolonged or is entailing hardship, but it must not be overlooked that subscribers themselves are in some measure responsible for the delay in making repayment by reason of their failure to send in their applications when originally invited to do so by public notice.  I would suggest, also, that Deputies should make their inquiries about Dáil Loan subscriptions by letters addressed to me or to my Department rather than by Parliamentary Question or by personal application. No useful purpose can be served by making inquiries about cases in which no application has been made for repayment, as application must be made in writing by any person claiming to be entitled to repayment.  In general, I think that inquiries by Deputies should be confined to ascertaining the progress made towards authorising repayment in individual cases which, by reason of hardship or exceptional circumstances, appear to merit special investigation.  I may say that in any case in which particulars are furnished, in support of an application which corresponds with the particulars on record in the Department of Finance, the period which elapses before payment is authorised does not normally exceed two months.  In cases, however, in which inquiries are necessary the delay entailed must depend largely on the promptitude with which applicants reply to the inquiries addressed to them and the nature of the replies received.  As a matter of administrative convenience in the Department of Finance and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the practice has been adopted of authorising payment in batches of cases numbering from 2,000 to 6,000 at intervals of about two months.</P>
    <P>In certain cases subscriptions were collected for the Loan, but full particulars of the names of the subscribers and the amounts individually subscribed were not furnished to the Dáil Department of Finance.  These cases <Col N="1307" /> present some difficulty, and it is obvious that applications for repayment in cases where there is no record of the subscription must be carefully scrutinised. In general, however, the subscriber in such a case should be in a position to produce satisfactory evidence, whether in the form of a receipt from a local collector or otherwise, and a considerable number of applications have, in fact, already been admitted on the strength of such evidence.  It has been suggested that a tribunal might be established to deal with applications in this particular category, but it does not appear that such a tribunal is at present necessary.  The existing machinery is sufficient to enable the Department of Finance to deal with all applications so far as can be foreseen, but if the necessity for taking any special measures to complete the task of repayment should hereafter become apparent the question of establishing a tribunal, or taking other appropriate steps, will be considered as and when the occasion seems to require.  It has been suggested that in cases in which repayment has not already been authorised, interest on the amount of the subscription should be allowed as from the 1st June, 1927, to the date of repayment.  In reply to this, however, it must be urged that in most of the cases which would be affected by this suggestion application for repayment was not made when such applications were invited.  The delay on the part of the subscribers concerned has, in fact, proved a source of considerable embarrassment to the Department of Finance, and there would be no justification for making the Exchequer liable for additional interest in cases in which the delay was the responsibility of the subscribers themselves. There may be a small proportion of cases in which, as a matter of equity, there would be ground for the admission of a claim to interest, but the number of such cases is comparatively very small, and their examination and the calculation of the appropriate amount of interest would inevitably retard to some extent the task of repaying subscribers generally.  Moreover, legislation would be necessary to enable the Department of Finance to make any <Col N="1308" /> payment beyond that provided for in the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924, and, while the possibility of framing such legislation is not entirely ruled out, it is felt that at present, at any rate, there is not sufficient justification for promoting it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Finance a few questions regarding the repayment of this loan.  Is it some of the permanent staff of the Department of Finance is dealing with repayments, or is it a temporary staff?  What amount of business has been dealt with from January 1st?  The Minister stated that the normal period for repayment was two months from the time the application was sent in.  I can give the Minister particulars of a case where the receipt has been sent in six months, and where there has been a card received acknowledging its receipt but no repayment.</P>

      <P>What I said with reference to the normal period of two months was where the subscriber was one of the 120,000 whose names were on the primary register; those whose names we had on record.  It did not apply to the very considerable number of other persons whose names we have not got.</P>

      <P>I know a number of subscribers whose money was sent up at the one time.  I speak with a fairly intimate knowledge of the question, because I was director of the loan in Westmeath.  A batch of subscriptions was sent up at the same time.  Some of the subscribers applied for repayment six months ago and some applied four months ago.  People who applied four months ago have been paid but the others have not.  It would strike an outsider as if there is a lack of system in dealing with this matter.  During the Black-and-Tan period a number of people burned their receipts.  The Minister spoke about a tribunal, but I think some sort of an interview should <Col N="1309" /> take place between the people who were concerned with the collection of the loan in each county and the Minister for Finance.  That would speed up matters.  These could be looked upon as reliable people, and they would indicate who subscribed and who did not. I know of a particular sum of money that was handed in to the Department of Finance in October, 1920.  The individual who handed in the money did not take the risk, apparently, of bringing the list of names with him.  He got a temporary receipt.  Such a list could be proved by taking into consultation the particular officers that carried out the collection of the loan in the county. I am glad the Minister made this statement, because there is a belief in the country that it is the staff is holding up the work; that they are temporary people who want to knock as much as they can out of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to mention a case something like the one Deputy Kennedy mentioned, where no list was sent in.  I met a person in Castlerea last week who held all the money for a particular area.  Those who subscribed there have only got the ordinary postcard acknowledgment of their application for repayment.  The person I was speaking to is getting very uneasy about the matter.  I tried to reassure him, and I told him that the Minister was going to make a statement. I am perfectly satisfied that that man handed in the money, but his neighbours are becoming suspicious, seeing that so many other people have been repaid.  In the interests of that collector and others like him, the Minister should consider the adoption of some method of making it clear to people who have had to wait, whose names were not on the register, that the money was handed in.  It may be difficult to do so, as maybe three or four areas combined and that the money was handed in by one person.  I know there is a difficulty.  In the case that I referred to, I told the man that we were expecting a statement from the Minister and I thought it might cover such a case.  If there was some individual guarantee from the Minister, or at any rate an acknowledgment, that the money given the collector was paid in it would clear up the matter.  If people <Col N="1310" /> like the man I speak of had that assurrance it would be a guarantee that they handed in the money, and a lot of trouble would be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what the Minister would regard as satisfactory evidence, in the absence of the actual official receipt signed by the late General Collins, because I know that in certain districts, in Mayo especially, there are people who hold receipts given to them by the original collectors. They were not official in the sense, I take it, in which the Minister speaks of official receipts&mdash;they were not certificates, in other words.  These receipts have been asked for in several cases, but I do not know if anybody who produced such a receipt, whose name was not on the primary register, has been paid&mdash;whether that receipt has been accepted as sufficient evidence of having subscribed.  I can bear out what Deputy Kennedy said.  There are districts in Mayo where the money was handed in on behalf of a number of subscribers, and no list of them is apparently available.  Some of the collectors are dead, and some have emigrated, and there is very great difficulty in compiling authentic lists now.  I think that it will be necessary to take special steps to investigate cases where the money was handed in in a lump sum, but without lists being sent in.  I think that it would be well for the Minister to give an indication of what he would regard as satisfactory evidence, in the absence of the actual certificate or in a case where the name is not on the primary register.  I think the Minister said that the number of subscribers was 120,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement will clear the air in this matter, and I think it was about time that such a statement was made.  I am not much concerned with those on the primary register, except that I think there has been unjustifiable delay in paying the people who applied a year or six <Col N="1311" /> months ago and who gave their numbers on the register.  But I am not satisfied that the steps the Minister is going to take in regard to the people who are not registered will be sufficient. People whom I know in County Mayo applied for payment, and they got the usual card stating that the matter was receiving attention.  A few months ago I found out that these people were not registered at all.  If there is to be a delay of that kind in notifying individuals after a year that they are not registered, and if these individuals have to go to the collectors to get some proof that they did pay, I think that will be a very slow and slipshod method.  In County Mayo I know of large areas where the people were not registered.  If the Minister would accept a suggestion, I could give him the names of about four responsible people in north, south, east and west Mayo who were more or less primarily responsible for the collection of the loan there, and if he would take them into his confidence he could give them areas from which sums of money are credited in the Department of Finance, but from which there are no names, and they could get lists from the local collectors, in addition to the proof required, and the Minister would get whole areas registered.  That would be much better than waiting for every individual to prove his claim.  It would settle it in a much more satisfactory manner, and, I think, in a better and a cheaper manner, than by having to communicate with every single subscriber, or with everyone who claims he subscribed, and it would certainly save the Department a lot of work.</P>

      <P>I have just one suggestion to put to the Minister in reference to legal representatives.  The Minister spoke of &ldquo;the subscriber or his legal representative.&rdquo;  In many cases, especially in the case of those who could least afford it, the subscriptions were small&mdash;say £1&mdash;and proving that one is a legal representative of somebody might entail the cost of a few pounds.  I would like to know what proof exactly is required in the Department that one is the legal representative of a subscriber, because I think a <Col N="1312" /> letter from a parish priest or a teacher should suffice.  The Minister is, of course, aware that among the farming community administration is not always taken out.  A farmer's son generally carries on <i>de son fort;</i> he does not bother about letters of administration, or anything else, and there should be some simple method in such cases of proving that the son is the legal representative of the father.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if a man applies for £15, and that only £6 is due to him, he is entitled to get the £6?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point I would like to deal with when I am replying to the debate.  The primary register was not very carefully compiled and is not reliable.  The Deputy himself knows the circumstances in which it was compiled.  The corroboration which we seek is that a person applying will give his name and address for the exact amount on the primary register. That corroboration of the primary register enables us to pay.  But if, for instance, there is a certain name down for a subscription of £10, and that someone from the same district applies for a different amount from the amount on the register, we cannot say whether <Col N="1313" /> he may not be someone of the same name who knew that his neighbour had subscribed and was merely chancing his arm.  If he applied for the exact amount we would say that we believed this is the man, and we would pay it, but if he made application for a different sum, then we would say that we could not pay in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the man very well.  I know that he made application and did not get his money, and that it would have been very easy to find out whether there was any mistake on his part or not.  In any event, I do not want to make any charge, but I think, as Deputy Kennedy says, there is some lack of organisation in the office and that some reorganisation is required to meet difficulties of that kind.  It is quite possible a man may make a mistake. He may think he subscribed £15 where he had only subscribed £12. There is a set of cases in Waterford which require to be dealt with specially.  I might say that this is not a Party matter.  It is one in which Deputies on both sides of the House are involved.  What happened was this: that the original receipts were signed, but the names of the persons subscribing were not filled in owing to the circumstances of the time.  The individual responsible signed these receipts, but then he left them aside when things got hot in the neighbourhood.  The collector there, apparently, did not send in the names relating to the individual cases in which receipts had been issued. Several of these cases have been sent to me.  The position is that there is a whole set of cases in Waterford which, I think, will have to be dealt with specially.  There is a third class of case to which I would like to refer.  It was where public meetings were held and subscriptions taken in for the fund. These were cases where people subscribed £1 or £2, but there does not seem to be any record of the individuals who subscribed.  I imagine that <Col N="1314" /> in the long run the Department of Finance will have to send down inspectors to make inquiries into these cases. What I think will have to be done is this: advertisements will have to be published notifying that an inspector is going down to make inquiries so as to enable local people to make their claims.  I am afraid that until something like that is done Deputies will continue to receive complaints in connection with these cases.  We do not know what the machinery is that the Minister is making use of at present, but I do not think it is sufficiently adequate to deal with all the difficulties arising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister made his statement on this matter to-day.  The correspondence which Deputies receive is mainly made up of applications dealing with the Dáil Eireann Loan.  I feel that we will be all only too ready to co-operate with the Minister and his Department in the way that he has suggested, namely, that in future when we receive correspondence in connection with this particular loan that we in turn will correspond with him in the ordinary way instead of adopting the practice of making personal visits to the Department, except, as the Minister himself has stated, in exceptional cases.  I at least want to pay a tribute to the officials in the Department who deal with these cases. I did not know the gentleman in charge of it until I became a member here.  I found him and the other civil servants in the Department most courteous and indeed very helpful on all occasions. I am afraid that a good deal of the delay that has taken place in connection with these cases is due to lack of attention to detail and of perhaps business capacity on the part of the thousands of people who subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose my own experience as regards these cases was that of many other Deputies in the House.  We went to the Department to make inquiries, having only very meagre details as far as subscriptions to the loan were concerned. I went to the Department to make inquiries on behalf of one of my constituents.  He made the statement to me that he had subscribed so much to the loan.  When I went to the Department <Col N="1315" /> we could not get a trace of his name on the list.  At least there was no name corresponding to the name of the person about whom I was making the inquiries.  It transpired afterwards that he had subscribed £10 in four moieties of £2 10s. each.  The result anyway was this: that I felt that in making inquiries into his case I had held up the business of the Department for at least three quarters of an hour.  Of course I did not do it intentionally, but the fact remains anyway that I held up the business of the Department while these inquiries were being made for that period, and I suppose the same has happened as regards other Deputies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not wonder that there is a little disorganisation in the Department due, as I have said, not to any inefficiency or want of business capacity on the part of civil servants, but really to the want of attention to detail on the part of our own people in many cases in not complying with the conditions.  I would make this suggestion to the Minister: that a summary of the statement which he has made should be printed in leaflet form and displayed at all the post offices and Gárda Síochána barracks in the State. I think that the circulation of the information contained in the Minister's statement in the particular form that I am suggesting would be a great help in dealing with these cases.  The Minister in his statement stressed the two words &ldquo;exceptional cases.&rdquo;  I am prepared to co-operate with the Minister by not making application in person, but as he stated exceptional cases will arise in which, perhaps, it may be necessary to make a personal visit.  I have in mind the case of a Cork shopkeeper who has fallen on evil days.  A number of writs are pending against him.  He has made application to the Department for payment of the amount he subscribed, and as far as I know he has complied with all the necessary conditions.  So far, however, he has not been paid the amount he subscribed which was, I think, about £20.  I would like if the Minister would let us know whether he would consider that case comes under the heading of exceptional cases, because if so I intend to pay another visit <Col N="1316" /> to the Department.  There are other exceptional cases.  For instance, there are people who are about to emigrate and who are anxious to get their money.  There are also the cases of the next of kin of deceased subscribers.  I understand they can secure a return of the money if they get a letter from the parish priest vouching for it that they are the next of kin.  That is a matter that should be extensively advertised. Many do not know the method by which relatives of deceased subscribers can secure the money that would be due to them in these cases.  I suggest that the Minister should issue a pamphlet or leaflet giving instructions that would be helpful to the people concerned and that would eventually prove an advantage to the Department concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony's experience coincides with mine as regards the particular department that has been referred to.  I have an objection to going around to departments, for, as Deputy Anthony says, it generally means holding up the department for a certain time.  For instance, if one Deputy holds it up for fifteen minutes, and there are one hundred and fifty-two other Deputies who are entitled to do the same thing, it would mean a serious hold up.  My usual practice is to write to the department concerned, but in order to show there is some screw loose in this sub-department of the Department of Finance, I will quote the following letter from the Department&mdash;&ldquo;With reference to your letter transmitting a list of names of persons who are stated to be subscribers to the Dáil Eireann Loan Fund, I am directed by the Minister for Finance to inform you that every subscriber who desires to have his or her name entered on the authentic register which is being prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Dáil Eireann Loan and Funds Act of 1924, should make individual application in writing to the Secretary of the Department of Finance, Government Buildings, Dublin. Each applicant should state fully the name and address of the subscriber, and the amount of the subscription should be accompanied by a receipt for the amount subscribed.&rdquo;  These particular <Col N="1317" /> cases I refer to were recorded, I presume, on the register.  When I went to the Department in connection with the cases of people who had eighteen months before that got postcards in reply to their applications from the Department, I found that their names and addresses and the amount they had subscribed were entered in the register. I was supplied with the numbers of these people on the register, and they got their money.  Why these sums could not have been sent to the people seventeen or eighteen months before is a thing that puzzles me.  They had kept on applying, and received postcard after postcard, but when I went to the Department and wasted some of their time, these people were paid the money to which they were entitled. The letter which I received stated:&mdash;&ldquo;Each applicant should state fully the name and address of the subscriber and the amount subscribed should be accompanied by a receipt for the amount subscribed.&rdquo;  As the Minister ought to know, it was impossible to get or keep receipts, especially in the North, during the Black and Tan War.  To my knowledge, in Fermanagh no receipts were issued, and in any case it would be dangerous to keep them. When people who have not got receipts make application and give the address at which they were living when they subscribed and the amount they subscribed, if that is entered on the register, I do not see why they should not be paid.</P>

      <P>In the cases I have mentioned I cannot understand why when the names and other particulars were on the register payment was not made on application.

      <P>There is only one matter I wish to mention, and it is an important one, and that is in connection with loans to the fund obtained through Sinn Fein cumainn.  These subscriptions were sent on on behalf of a parish and not in the names of individuals. The Minister has not indicated any decision with regard to subscriptions of that kind.  In my opinion, in such cases the parish priest of the district is entitled to get back these subscriptions for some purpose or other.  As it is obvious no individual can get them, I think they should go to the parishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with other Deputies as to trouble experienced regarding some of these subscriptions. One-fifth or one-sixth of the total amount subscribed came from Limerick. I have had occasion to make visits to the office in connection with cases, and I fully realise the difficulties of the officials.  For instance, take the case of a widow who had subscribed, often she would be mentioned as Mrs. Catherine so-and-so and other times she would be referred to as Mrs. so-and-so.  In such case, if she had made application, there would be a difficulty.  In some townlands there might be dozens of people with the same name.  Where difficulty arises in getting the money the fault lies, not with the subscribers or the officials, but with the collector of the money.  I suggest the Minister might take into consideration the question of allowing interest at the rate of 5 per cent. to subscribers from the 1st June, 1927, until payment is made.  I do not think that would entail any great amount of trouble to the Department. The calculation in any particular case should not take more than a minute. There are the cases of people who are not registered, next-of-kin of deceased subscribers.  There is a suspense list, and I understand it is the collectors <Col N="1319" /> who have to do with that, but it would take years before it is complete.</P>

      <P>That has been my experience. If that is so we could tell the people to go to them and get their money and they would not have to trouble us.  I went to the Department a few months ago and got the numbers. I sent away a list and asked why none of these people got their money. I got a similar document to that of Deputy Carney.  It is nonsense to send out a document of this kind at this time as it is only making fools of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Holt I may say that there is no distinction made between Deputies in this matter nor is there any distinction made between applicants.  Deputy Carney referred to certain cases, but I cannot reply to his point at present as it would require investigation.  I would be glad, however, if he furnished me with names so that I could make inquiries because there must have been some reason for delay.  In the ordinary way, if an applicant applies and if the particulars he gives correspond with the information on the register, there is no delay in authorising repayment. At an early stage we had not got an alphabetical index, consequently for some time those who could give numbers were given preference as they were easy to trace and their cases were dealt with.  There is an alphabetical index now and any particular applicant can be traced and his case dealt with quickly whether he gives a number or not.  The principle on which all applications were dealt with was to deal with all straightforward cases first where repayment could be made without much investigation.  The more difficult cases were postponed, the object being to get the largest number of people repaid at the earliest possible <Col N="1320" /> moment.  There is in certain cases, perhaps, more delay than if we took the cases as they came, but on the other hand more money has been paid than if we had not postponed the more difficult cases and dealt with the simpler ones.  It may be argued that we should deal with cases as they come and let the staff deal with the more difficult, cases at the same time as they deal with the simple ones.  We believe that what is being done is more satisfactory on the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy asked about the staff.  There are a certain number of temporary staff employed, but most of the staff are permanent, and there is nothing in the suggestion made by the Deputy.  Deputy Boland asked about the case of a collector who was embarrassed because people whose money he took had not been paid.  If I got the name of that collector from the Deputy I would see what could be done in that particular case or cases like it.  We might not be able to insert the names of the people he would give us on the authentic register, or on the other hand we might, but we would take steps to see that no individual was open to the suggestion that he had not paid over the money.  Deputy O'Connell asked what evidence will be taken.  Provided no snag arose, we would take the receipt given at the time as evidence.  A list furnished by the collector at present would be evidence.  If it was a large subscription paid by cheque the cheque would be evidence, but it is hard to say in any individual case what would be taken as sufficient evidence, though any one of these things may be sufficient. If a list was supplied by a collector and it tallied with the records from the district and did not conflict with the particulars of any application that came in&mdash;some on the list might not have applied and others might&mdash; and if the statement tallied with the individual applications we would accept that list as evidence and insert the names in the register.  We have been doing that.  We have cases in which two or three collectors certified a list and we inserted the names on the register. In reference to Deputy Clery's query, I may say that if such people would furnish us with the names of the <Col N="1321" /> collectors we would apply to these collectors and would receive from them a list which might not be regarded as conclusive evidence in itself, but it would be regarded as being conclusive if it tallied with the other information in our possession.</P>
    <P>Someone pointed out that we do not insist on letters of administration where the amounts are small.  We would accept a certificate from a parish priest plus a letter of indemnity from the person receiving the money, promising to repay it to the Exchequer in case another claim had to be admitted. Deputy Anthony asked whether we would regard certain cases as being exceptional on the grounds of urgency. We would.  Where there is urgency and where the circumstances would not justify any additional delay that might be caused through special inquiries having to be instituted, we would regard such cases as urgent.  I have dealt with Deputy Carney's case, and I would ask him to supply me with particulars so that we might look into the matter.  The case of subscriptions sent us by a cumann or group, to which Deputy Moore referred, and in which no individual would be entitled to payment, is a matter which I would like to consider further.  Perhaps Deputy Moore would put down a question, and I could then deal with the matter. <Col N="1322" /> Finally, I would only say that we have dealt with a very substantial number of cases.  They are being dealt with at a fairly rapid rate at present, and nearly all cases that can be dealt with by the present procedure will be disposed of by the end of the present year. When we see what residue remains and what the problem then is, we can decide what the machinery will be.  We can decide whether a tribunal or some system of local investigations will be necessary.  There is, however, a large number that can be dealt with by the present machinery, and the only thing we can do is to hasten them.  We will deal with the remainder when we have exhausted our present resources in whatever way seems to be necessary.</P>
