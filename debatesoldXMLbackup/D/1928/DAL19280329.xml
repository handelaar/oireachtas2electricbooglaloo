      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what amount of the Unemployed Relief Grant has been allotted to the City of Dublin; whether he is aware that the grants to Dublin are almost expended, whilst many hundreds, whose applications for relief work have not yet been dealt with, are unemployed; and if, in view of the circumstances prevailing in the city, he will take immediate steps for the making of a grant to continue the work undertaken by the City Commissioners for the relief of the unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £22,150 was allocated from the Relief Scheme Vote for expenditure on relief works in the county borough of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Although it is expected that practically the whole of this amount will be expended by the 31st instant, the works undertaken by the City Commissioners, which consist of the development of housing sites, will not be discontinued, and it is expected will not be completed for some five or six months.  Further, as the men become no longer required on the works already commenced, it is hoped that most of them will be absorbed on other works as the building season opens up in the new financial year.</P>
      <P>Out of the total expenditure of £70,000 to £80,000 which it is estimated will be required for the works towards which a grant is being made from the Relief Schemes Vote, from £40,000 to £50,000 will probably remain unexpended on the 31st instant.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the depressed state of agriculture and the small remuneration for feeding cattle for the past two years, with the uncertainty <Col N="2000" /> of the coming season, steps can be taken to reduce the rate of interest proposed by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to five per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of interest to be charged for advances by the Agricultural Credit Corporation has been the subject of careful consideration by the Board.  Having regard to all the circumstances, and particularly to the rate at which the Corporation can itself borrow, to the absence of any reserve against bad debts or other unfavourable contingencies, and to the administrative expenses to be covered on a relatively small working capital, it is clear that the Corporation could not lend at the rate of interest suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that prior to the passing of the Betting Act, 1926 (a) each of the eight meetings of the Naas Race Company, Ltd., was a financial success; (b) that since the passing of the Act, each of the nine meetings held showed a substantial loss; (c) that the company has given over £5,000 in stakes each year since its formation; (d) that the Government has received over £3,000 in entertainment and other taxes; (e) that the company paid over £1,000 per annum in wages, and that as a result of excessive taxation the company is now unable to carry on, and has discharged all its employees, the racecourse being at present in charge of a caretaker, and whether he intends to abolish or reduce taxation in respect of race companies sufficiently to enable them to recoup losses.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Naas Race Company, Ltd., furnished certain returns relating to their financial condition to the Committee which I appointed to inquire into the present position of Irish racing, and that these returns show that the Naas Race Company, in common with most other race executives, suffered considerable losses in the year 1927.  I am not in a position, however, to state to what extent the losses may be ascribed to the betting duty or to other causes.  The matter is receiving my earnest consideration, and I shall announce the Government's intentions as regards Irish racing at the earliest opportunity.  I understand that the figures referred to by the Deputy are substantially correct.</P>

Marsh's, approved by the Department for the selection of bulls for premiums under the Department's Live Stock Schemes, only such bulls as are passed by the Department's inspectors at the sale as suitable for licensing for breeding purposes are permitted to be offered by auction.  The 16 bulls in question were regarded by the Department's inspectors at the sale as being unsuitable for breeding in any part of the country.

Their standard cannot be kept absolutely uniform, but I am prepared, at the same time, to accept their recommendations and to give licences to bulls which they recommend.  If any bulls, on the other hand, are taken to shows such as those of Messrs.  Marsh or the Royal Dublin Society, and if any senior inspector of the Department, seeing the bulls and examining them for premiums, decides, even though they were passed by one of the inspectors temporarily employed for that purpose through the country, that they are not up to standard for a licence, it is open to the inspector to make a recommendation that the licence should be withdrawn, and there is power in me to withdraw such licence.</P>

The point is we would have no objection to bulls on the border line remaining in the district, but we object to bringing them to first-class shows, and, having been purchased by farmers at high prices, sending them to other parts of the country as first-class premium bulls.  We give them the benefit of the doubt if the owner leaves them in the district, but if he brings them to first-class shows, where a farmer is likely to buy them as first-class premium bulls and to take them away thinking that he is going to improve the stock in his part of the country, we withdraw the licence altogether.</P>

      <P>There is no townland named Summerhill in the official list of townlands for County Mayo, but proceedings were instituted under the Land Act, 1923, for the acquisition of the lands of Rathfran, County Mayo, containing 297a. 2r. 0p., on the estate of James E. McCormack.  These lands were published in a provisional list of lands which, if not excluded in consequence of a valid objection, would become vested in the Land Commission on the appointed day.  These lands are subject to a Land Purchase Annuity, and the owner has required the Land Commission to provide him with a suitable holding of not less value than his present holding under the provisions of Section 24 (41) (b) of the Land Act, 1923.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an mBille seo, atá fé dhíosbóireacht againn, dubhairt an t-Uachtarán indé go bhfuil dlúth-bhaint aige le tuarasgabháil Choímisiún ua Gaéltachta.  Má tá, is dócha go bhfuil de chead agam-sa tagairt ghairid a dhéunamh don Choímisiún san.  Thainig an Coimisiún san le chéile i dtosach Mí Márta, 1925, <Col N="2016" /> agus tar éis a lán oibre a dhéunamh&mdash; obair mhaith freisin&mdash;chuireadar tuarasgabháil amach i Mí Iúl, 1926.  Níor cualathas a thuille fén nGaéltacht go dti go bhfuaireamar an Páipéar Bán tuairim is trí seachtaine ó shoin.  Bhí síol maith sa Tuarasgabháil, acht ba fuar fliuch clochmhar an talamh ar ar thuit an síol san.  Masla agus tarcuisne don Choimisiún is eadh an Páipéar Bán. Ba mhaith liom tuairim chomhaltai an Choimisiún a chloisint sa scéal so.  Tá cur síos ann ar mholtaí an Choimisiún ina gceann agus i na gceann.  Is beag ceann acu go gcuirtear ina choinnibh acht tá earball le n-a bhfurmhór agus cealg san earball san.  Ní mian liom an scéal a scagadh go mion anois; is leor a rádh go bhfuil an focal &ldquo;indeunta&rdquo; nó &ldquo;ró-dheacair&rdquo; curtha le fiche moladh diobh ar a luighead.  Is truagh nár tugadh cead don Dáil an scéal a phéidhe sar ar cuireadh an Bille seo ós ár gcomhair, i dtreo is go gceapfaí scéim a shásóchadh na Teachtaí ar gach taoibh.  Is fíor go bhfuil rian cáinte sa tairiscint atá curtha isteach agam óir is é mo thuairim agus tuairim a lán daoine a chuireanns suim sa Ghaéltacht go bhfuil an cáineadh san tuilte go maith ag an Rialtas.  Acht tá níos mó ná san ann.  Is mian linne, ar an dtaoibh seo, cuidiú leis an Rialtas chun an Ghaéltacht do shábháil agus gan sceul páirtidhe a dhéunamh de.  Is léir, ámh, nach bhfuil dá dheunamh le dhá bhliain, anuas acht an scéal a chur ar an mhéir fhada, agus gur mithid tabhairt fén obair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admhuighmíd go bhfuil deacracht mhór ag baint leis an scéal, acht, dá dheacracht é, caithfear réidhteach fhághail go luath, má is maith linn an teanga náisiúnta do choiméad beo.  Má's toil linn é dhéunamh, tig linn é dhéunamh.  Mar a dubhairt an file Rómhánach fadó <i>&ldquo;Possunt quia posse videntur.&rdquo;</i> Ní fheadar an bhfuilimíd dá ríríbh san obair seo na Gaeltachta?  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil laigheas le fághail sa phlean so atá ceaptha ag an Rialtas.  Is fíor go mbaineann scéal na Gaeltachta le gach roinn den Rialtas, acht ní measa aon roinn díobh ná Aireacht na hIascaireachta do chur i mbun na h-oibre.  Ní gábhadh dhomhsa a innsint don Dáil cionnus ar éirigh leis an Aireacht san an iascaireacht do chur <Col N="2017" /> chun cinn le cúig bhliain anuas.  Ní déarfainn gur ar an Aire atá a locht san ar fad, óir is beag an méid airgid a tugadh don Aireacht san.</P>
    <P>De réir an scéil do léigheas ar phaipeur nuachta an lae indiu, tá Aire an Airgid in eudóchas i dtaoibh na h-iascaireachta, go mór mhór fé éisc a mbharbhadh sa bhfairrge mhóir i gcéin. Muna gcabhruightear leis an iascaireacht, cad tá i ndán do na Gaélgeoirí a bhaineanns slighe bheathadh as an gcéird sin?  Nár bhféidir bád a cheapadh mar standard, bád a oirfeadh don fhairrge mhóir agus roinnt diobh fhaghail.  Nár bhféidir luach na mbád agus na líonta, agus na n-eangacha agus an ghleus iascaidh atá ag an Aireacht cheana do aith-mheas agus an luach nó an praigheus a laghdú, i dtreo is go gcuirfí ag obair iad agus gan leigint dóibh bheith dá lóbhadh fé mar atáid i nGaillimh fá láthair?</P>

Deurfar liom nach bhfuil iascairí oilte ann a bheadh toiltheannach claoidhe leis an iascaireacht ar an aigéan nó leanamhaint di ar feadh na bliana.  Bfhéidir gur fíor an sceul san acht nach fhfuil leigheas ann-na hógánaigh orra a oileamhaint, scór nó dá scór aca do chur go dti an Iorruaidh nó go dtí tír iasachta eile go ceann cúpla bliain leis an gcéird d'fhoghluim agus do chleachtadh.</P>

Ba chóir an margadh sa mbaile a chur i dtreo ar dtús.  Ba chóir gleus a sholáthair i naice na gcuanta chun iasc a chur ar salann agus a leasú. Ní iocfadh an scéim sin as féin ar dtúis acht thabharfadh sé obair do na hiascairí atá scurtha diamhaoin fá láthair.  Chun na Gaedhilge do shábháil, ní fuláir a chur ar chumas na nGaedhilgeoiri fanacht in Éirinn. <Col N="2018" /> Feudfaí bheith ag dul ar aghaidh leis an obair sin le roinnt bhlianta anuas, acht níor tugadh fé.

Tuigim go maith nach féidir dul ar aghaidh go tapaidh san obair sin acht feudfaí dul níos tapaidhe go mór.  Na moltaí atá ar leathanaigh a 26 agus a 27 den Pháireur Bán, táid siad go maith, acht cé an chaoi a cuirfear i ngníomh iad ag Aireacht na hIascaireachta Cé an gleus a bhéas acu?  Nach le hAireacht Tionnscail agus Tráchtála a bhaíneanns siad?  Dála an scéil, is é mo bharamhail nach leor na daoine oilte úd ar a dtugtar na &ldquo;experts&rdquo; fhághail&mdash;caithfear daoine cliste fhághail go bhfuil taithighe acu ar cúrsaí gnótha.</P>

Ní fuláir faireoir éigin a bheith ann chun na hAireachtaí eile do spreagadh so ghnó so.</P>
    <P>Rud eile dhe, ba mhaith linn fhios a bheith againn an bhfuil aon tsuim airgid leaghtha amach i gcóir na Gaéltachta. Muna bhfuil, is eagal liom gurab é an sean scéal a bheas ann, &ldquo;mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhaidh tú féar&rdquo; agus go leagfar do fhíortobar na Gaedhilge dul i ndísc.</P>
    <P>Sa leitir a scríobh an t-Uachtarán go dtí an Coimisiún, 4/3/'25, dubhairt sé go mbeadh &ldquo;an phoiblíocht ag faire go géar ar obair agus ar thora an fhiosrúcháin a dhéanfa sibh, agus ní miste bheith ag brath ortha chun cuidíú le haon phlean ciall mhar réasúnta is féidir a chur i ngníomh chun an Ghaelig do chosaint mar theangain teaghlaigh agus chun saol economíochta na ndaoine a labhrann í mar ghnáththeangain agus mar phríomh-urlabhra eatorra féin do dhaingniú i bhfeabhas.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On méid atá ráite ag an Teachta atá díreach tar éis suidhe síos, do cheapfadh éinne ná raibh le déanamh ag duine ach a lámh do chur anáirde agus go mbeadh gach ní sa cheart.  Dubhairt an Teachta go raibh furmhór na Dála i bhfabhar Tuarasgabháil Choimisiún na Gaeltachta. Pé scéim tháchtach a thógfadh an Rialtas idir lámha ar son na Gaeltachta bheadh furmhór na dTeachtaí atá ar na bínsí sin thall ina coinnibh.  Do bheidís i gcoinnibh éinní a mholfadh an Rialtas.  Dubhairt an Teachta ná raibh aon Roinn chó mí-oirúnach don obair seo leis an Roinn Iascaigh.  Nílim chun mé féin a chosaint ach déarfad, maidir le gach ní a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht, go bhfuil níos mó eolais ina thaobh sa Roinn Iascaigh ná in aon Roinn eile, mar isiad daoine atá sa Roinn sin ná na daoine a bhí ag obair fén sean C.D.B. agus fén Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Cheárd-Oideachais.  Tá eolas acu san ar na cúrsaí a bhaineann le ceist an iascaigh san Iarthar, le ceist na talmhan san Iarthar agus le ceist na ndéantús san Iarthar.  Siné an chúis gur cuireadh déantúisí fé nRoinn seo o thosach&mdash;mar isé duine a bhí i gcúram na Roinne Iascaigh ná an fear go raibh baint aige leis an C.D.B. ar feadh breis agus 25 bliana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dubhairt an Teachta nár dineadh na báid d'ath-mheasú.  Thugamar aire don cheist sin timpeal bliana a shoin. Tá orainn Bille do thabhairt isteach ina thaobh.  Tabharfar an Bille os cóir na Dála i gcionn mí no mar sin.  Ach táimid ag obair sarar tugadh an Bille isteach in aon chor fé is dá mbeadh an Bille rithte ag an Oireachtas.  Tá an ath-mheasú á dhéanamh fé is dá mbeadh cead fachta againn ón Oireachtas.  Tá a fhios againn go maith nách scéim economiceach í seo&mdash;ní fheadar-sa an bhfuil aon téarma eile ann don bhfocal san &ldquo;economic.&rdquo; Siné an chúis go raibh Coimisiún na Gaeltachta againn agus go bhfuil an Páipeur Bán againn.  Tá a fhios againn ná fuil an scéim economiceach. Siné an chúis go bhfuilimíd ag plé na <Col N="2020" /> ceiste anois.  Tá a fhios agam-sa chó maith agus tá a fhios ag Teachtaí eile go bhfuil iascaireacht san Iarthar neamh-economiceach fé láthair; sí an teist ná an gcuirfeadh daoine a gcuid airgid inti.  An gcuirfeadh na daoine a íocann cáin sa tír a gcuid airgid intí? Siní an cheist&mdash;siní an fhadhb.</P>
    <P>Do thrácht an Teachta ar central depot.  Sin ní a bhí ar aigne againn ar feadh tamaill mhaith.  Is dó liom gur mé féin an chéad duine a mhol central depot do chur ar bun.  Bhí san ar áigne agam ón am a chuadhas isteach sa Roinn den chéad uaír.  Bhí a fhios agam go maith ná féadfadh obair na gcailíní sna buidheanta agus ar na déantúisí seo dul ar aghaidh mara bhféadfaimís marga d'fháil dá gcuid earraí.  Níl ach cúpla mí o shoin ann o fuaireamair cigire i gcóir na ndéantús so.  Chaith sé tamall éigin í dTír Chonaill.  Tá sé fé láthair ad' iarraidh áit oiriúnach d'fháil i mBaile Atha Cliath a bheadh mar central depot d'earraí na mbuidhean so agus na ndéantús so.</P>
    <P>Probably more foolishness can be talked on this than on any other matter that would come before the Dáil. As a matter of fact, a Chinn Comhairle, you probably know, from past experience here of the Estimates, that it leaves scope for more nonsense to be talked than probably any other subject that comes before the Dáil.  Deputy Fahy, I will say, spoke, to a certain extent, sense.  He spoke of matters which have been receiving attention and which are receiving attention.  He spoke also, rather ridiculously, about some things.  He spoke of the promised revaluation of boats, or, to be more accurate, of the re-casting of loans, as if that were a matter that prevented the fishermen from fishing.  If the Deputy does not know, I can assure him that that is not the case.  The re-casting of loans, so far, has not been made legal, but in effect the Department has been acting as if it were legal.  In fact the scheme for re-casting approved by the Department of Finance has been made operative.  The Department's call on them has taken cognisance of the fact that this scheme is going to be approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat what I said in Irish as the explanation of the Department of Fisheries being given the responsibility for Gaeltacht services. The Department of Fisheries more or less inherited the functions of the Congested Districts Board and of the Fisheries Department of the D.A.T.I.  The officials of the present Department of Fisheries are officials who were concerned with fisheries in the C.D.B. and in the D.A.T.I.  The present permanent head of the Department of Fisheries was Chief Clerk of the C.D.B.  He was concerned with fisheries for about 15 or 16 years of his career in the C.D.B., and had an intimate association with the working of the rural industries in the congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was, as a matter of fact, the person who looked after their accounts and who helped by way of advice the girls engaged in the classes, and so on. That was the reason why rural industries, instead of being given to the Department of Industry and Commerce, where you would imagine they would naturally belong, were given to the Department of Fisheries.  In fact, one might say that I was put in the position that the Minister for Agriculture last night deprecated his Department being put in&mdash;I was put in the position of being in charge of practically every uneconomic proposition.  The Minister for Agriculture said last night, perfectly correctly, that he was not in charge of a Department to deal out philanthropy.  Unfortunately, I have <Col N="2022" /> been put in charge of a Department which is supposed to be entirely philanthropic. Most of these things have to be subsidised&mdash;fisheries, rural industries, and so on.</P>

      <P>All right; I will be prepared to meet you.  That is the reason why the Department of Fisheries was asked to take charge of the functions concerned with the Gaeltacht.  We have already taken steps in connection with many of the suggestions made in the White Paper. There was a suggestion, for instance, that there should be co-ordination of the Departments which had any functions in the Gaeltacht&mdash;Departments concerned with housing, education, and so on.  Such meetings have already been held of the heads of the Departments, and further meetings will be held.  They have made certain reports Certain other recommendations are being dealt with by way of a Bill, for instance, for the branding of mackerel, which is with the draughtsman.  Certain recommendations with regard to small harbours are being dealt with by putting up money for these minor marine works.  Mention is made in one place of the kelp industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations are in progress with a view to establishing an iodine factory. I do not want to say that is going to solve the kelp question in the west entirely, but it will at least stabilise the matter to a certain extent.  It will <Col N="2023" /> cater for a number of tons each year at least, in addition to what they already are able to dispose of.  The factory, as a matter of fact, would deal with about 1,200 tons of kelp with a maximum of 2,000, perhaps.  Negotiations are in progress in connection with that matter.  We are hoping to give effect to that in the near future, so as to deal with this year's May kelp.  As I have already said in Irish, we are dealing with the question of a central depot.  The organiser recently appointed for rural industries having investigated the home-spun business in Donegal and made a tour of the little classes that we carry on in Mayo and Galway, is now in Dublin and is devoting his time to finding a suitable place and investigating the possibilities of getting a central depot for marketing established almost immediately.  As I said, the case can be made that the Department of Fisheries and its officials are the best persons to deal with the question of the Gaeltacht, because most of them have had all their training in dealing with Gaeltacht problems during all their Civil Service career, which in many cases extends over twenty years.</P>

    <P>In opposing this Bill I want to impress, as far as I can see it, how undesirable it is that one of the most important branches of the Government service&mdash;that is the Land Commission&mdash; should be put under the charge of the Ministry of Fisheries.  You certainly do want a &ldquo;live wire&rdquo; in charge of the Land Commission, and there is no Deputy but will have to admit that the one Department which for the past five years has not justified its existence is the Department of Fisheries.  The House is now asked seriously to place the most important Department in the State as regards the requirements of the people in charge of that Ministry. If it was to justify the Minister's existence there might be some excuse for it. but everyone knows that for five years the Minister for Fisheries has done nothing only, as Deputy Carney said last night, to write &ldquo;A Chara, I am making inquiries,&rdquo; and finish up with &ldquo;Mise le meas.&rdquo; He did nothing else for the past five years regarding the <Col N="2025" /> fishermen in the West of Ireland.  He has not even stimulated any hope amongst the fishermen that they will get relief at some future date.  There has been no effort made to organise the fishermen, to help them to co-operate amongst themselves.  They have been thrown at the mercy of the waves.  Even the terrible tragedy which took place some months ago did not urge the Minister or his Department into any activity.  Because of his inactivity, and because he made no effort to organise his own Department, you had, I submit, that terrible tragedy, and the Minister must shoulder his responsibility for having fishermen thrown at the mercy of the waves and the storm in curraghs. I have here information for the Minister which, according to what he said in Irish, he has probably already.</P>

      <P>This Bill is the alternative, I understand, to a suggestion in the Gaeltacht Commission Report about a certain kind of Commission for the co-ordination of services. I think that is what was stated. This Bill sets up a certain piece of administrative machinery and the question at issue is whether that administrative machinery is the correct kind of machinery.  The question whether an individual Minister is or is not a good Minister does not come into it at all.  The Deputy wants to discuss now <Col N="2026" /> questions that will arise properly and are bound to arise, and my experience is that will arise widely, deeply and vaguely on the Fisheries Estimate.</P>

I take it that the President in saying that this was the Government's alternative to a Bill implementing the Gaeltacht Commission was, as far as he could go, opening up the ground for such a discussion as is now being raised.</P>

Now, with the motion on the Paper, which I suppose will be reached &mdash;the motion dealing with the Gaeltacht Commission Report&mdash;it would be absurd to attempt the whole discussion of the subject on this Bill.  But what I think is completely out of order is a discussion on the Department of Fisheries and its administration during the past five years, which is relevant neither to the Bill nor, as far as I can see, to the motion.</P>

I am going to give the Minister for Fisheries something that will be of interest to him and not out of order about the fishermen who repeatedly asked him for some assistance and who at the same time are pleading with the Land Commission for some assistance.

      <P>I know, but we cannot ignore the fact that we are handing over the most important service with regard to the Gaeltacht to the Minister for Fisheries at the present time, and, because of that, I think it should be taken in a more serious light by Ministers themselves.  They are absolutely closing the door as far as the Gaeltacht Commission and the White Paper is concerned by this Bill.  They leave no option afterwards except by repeal of this, unless after hearing a discussion on the Gaeltacht Commission an arrangement is come to by which something could be done, apart from the White Paper, for the Gaeltacht.  This Bill is here, and the Department that will carry on the work of the Gaeltacht will be the Ministry of Fisheries.  There is no justification for the existence of the Ministry of Fisheries whatsoever. How can the President claim that it is the best thing in the interests of the people that the Land Commission should be handed over to the Department of Fisheries?  If it is an excuse for the existence of the Department of Fisheries we might even accept that <Col N="2028" /> excuse, but first, before they can prove it is wise to hand the Land Commission over to the Department of Fisheries, they should prove the justice of the existence of the Ministry of Fisheries for the past five years.  The Minister himself, or his Department, has not done that.  In his reply he wisely avoided saying anything that related to his Department that dealt directly with the Gaeltacht.</P>

I put it to the House that the Minister for Fisheries has been in that area a few times, and Deputy Tierney has been in that area.  He had been there with some of his advance agents in 1925 distributing dry bread to the people of that area, both in the school, and out of the school, in order that the people of that area might take him to their bosoms as the feeder of the flocks.</P>

      <P>I am convinced of that. There is no necessity at all to tell it to the House.  I submit that when you have this Ministry of Fisheries, of which Mr. Lynch is supposed to be in charge, acting in that way, there is need for a change.  There you have conditions so very serious that they have to write to Dublin in order to get flour on which to exist, you have a condition of affairs which requires to be remedied.  Mr. Lynch has been Minister <Col N="2029" /> for Fisheries for the last five years, and this condition of things has gone on.  That is one of the reasons why Deputies on the opposite Benches should consider well before they hand over the Land Commission to the Department of Fisheries.  It is not out of place to repeat what I said here before about the drama, &ldquo;The Drone.&rdquo; I think if Mr. Lynch took Deputy Tierney into the play it would not be out of place at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughALaw" hpid="Mr. LAW Mr. LAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I was one of those who brought themselves with some reluctance to accept the present proposals of the Government with regard to the administration of the Gaeltacht. And I say that, not for the reasons which have been stated to the House by the last speaker&mdash;on the grounds of the alleged incapacity on the part of the Minister for Fisheries&mdash; but because I was myself a member of the old Congested Districts Board.  I have always thought that that body has received less than justice.  I should say quite frankly that I would myself be prepared and better pleased to see some such body as that now set up if the Government could see their way to do it.  However, as that was not to be, then I do not know that there was any other alternative but what the Government has done.  There is a very great deal to be said for placing the administration of land purchase under one single Department.  If that were to be done there was, as the Minister for Fisheries has pointed out, a great deal to be said for combining the work relating to the Gaeltacht under the Department, the head and officials of which had always a great deal of experience of work in the congested districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only doubt is this&mdash;whether the Minister for Fisheries will, in fact, be able to give enough time to the special economic needs of the Gaeltacht.  I confess that that is a point on which <Col N="2030" /> we must only await experience.  The Minister himself has charge of the fisheries in all parts of the country.  If our fisheries are to be developed as they should be, it is a very heavy job in itself to develop them.  I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary is in charge of the work relating to the Land Commission in all parts of the country.  He is in charge for the whole Saorstát and not for the congested districts only.  I should myself have thought that it is not only a whole-time job but a very heavy one.  I do not want to say any more about that at the present moment except to say that we shall await with interest and not altogether without anxiety to see how these proposals will, in fact, work out.  We will await that with interest, not at all with a hostile interest.  There is one other point which I should like to urge upon the House.  I think myself that the complaints and the blame which have been cast upon the Department of Fisheries come not from any incapacity, not from any laziness certainly, and not from any ill-will on the part of the Minister and his officials, but by reason of the fact that when you are dealing with communities in the Gaeltacht the existing machinery seems to me to lack that elasticity which the old machinery of the Congested Districts Board had.</P>
    <P>It is not so much a question of making available very large sums of money.  It is much more a question of how the money is spent and a question of seeing that the money is spent quickly and at the right time.  You are not only justified, it seems to me, in making experiments, but you are bound to make experiments when you are dealing with communities such as we have in the West.  I would go so far as to say that you are not only justified in making experiments, but you are justified in losing money on experiments. You are justified in making experiments the very suggestion of which would probably turn grey the hair on the heads of some officials of the Department of Finance and of my friend, Deputy Cooper, the ex-Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  I saw that that Committee in their last report have, no doubt very properly from their point of view, taken exception to <Col N="2031" /> a particular transaction, but a transaction which I consider a very right one. It was a matter of the advancing of money to enable certain machines in connection with the homespun industry to be bought.  At that time, owing to some complicated financial rules, the money could not be found in the ordinary way, and the Public Accounts Committee naturally found exception to the manner in which it was found.  Personally I think it was a perfectly reasonable transaction, and one for which the Ministry should not be blamed.  I am aware that it is the kind of thing that was done in the old days quite freely, for which nobody was one penny the worse, but these things afforded amusing copy to a popular novelist.  I think on the whole that money was well spent.</P>
    <P>I will not say anything further on that now, but at the appropriate moment I will refer to it again.  I would urge upon the Government to consider whether this is not a case in which, when we come to consider more closely the finance of the scheme in the Gaeltacht, portion of the money should be given to the Ministry of Fisheries for economical development in the Gaeltacht by way of a grant in aid.  The advantage of that would be that it would escape the eagle eye of Deputy Cooper.  It would also escape what I consider to be the too severe control by the Department of Finance.  When you are dealing with a community such as that in the Gaeltacht, the less red tape you have the better, and it is not a bad thing at all to be able to close your eyes to what sometimes may be a financial irregularity or which may not be altogether in accordance with the rules of red tape.  I am not urging that there should be extravagance or the foolish expenditure of public money, but I do quite seriously suggest that it would be in the best interests of the Gaeltacht and that it would facilitate enormously the work of the Ministry of Fisheries itself.  if it were able to spend money from time to time in a manner which would not perhaps be altogether justified if it were spent in relation to other and more prosperous parts of the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>In aineóin a n-duairt Aire um Iasgach i dtaobh na hoibré atá deanta ag a Aireacht nílimíd sásta leis an mBille seo.  What I am not sure about is what course the Government propose to adopt to solve the question of the Gaeltacht.  If what has been mentioned in the course of the debate is the line they are going to follow, then I think it makes the resolution before the House useless, because, apparently, if it is the considered scheme of the Government, any suggestions we could make will be of no avail. The question is really a very serious one for those of us who believe in the Irish nation as the most important question of all.</P>
      <P>I happen to be in touch with a portion of the Gaeltacht, and it is only a matter of a comparatively few years until the Irish nation, so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, will be finished. I am in touch with portion of the coast where fishermen have to strive for a bare existence, and they are using boats and gear just the same as their ancestors were using practically 200 years ago. They are always on the starvation line. The young people will not stand it and they are clearing out as fast as they can.  Such conditions should open the Irish mind to the importance of this question.</P>
      <P>The Department of Fisheries has got hit pretty hard for the past hour or so, and I do not want to be too hard on it. Unless greater resources are placed at the disposal of this Department, I am afraid it will fail to accomplish the object we all have so much at heart. Granted that the new Department has the greatest desire possible to further the interests of the Gaeltacht, I do not think it can do that unless it gets a considerably larger amount of money. If one takes into account the amount of money the people of Denmark spend on fisheries alone, one will observe that it is far in excess of the amount available for development here.  In proportion to sums granted in other directions, the amount in question is very small indeed, but perhaps I am not quite in order in dealing with that matter.</P>

      <P>It is really the point on which the whole matter hinges.  It does not matter how you combine these Departments; if you do not place greater resources at the disposal of this Department, you will fail to accomplish what you are out to accomplish and the work of the Gaeltacht Commission will have been practically wasted.  This is a matter that calls for immediate and vital treatment and it must be dealt with on a very generous scale.  If we cannot see our way to give greater scope to the Department by giving a larger amount of money, then we must allow matters to remain as they are, and things are in a very bad way at the moment.  I do not want to criticise the Department of Fisheries. I just want to say that it does not matter how we look at it, the belief in the country is that the Department has not justified its existence and that some change is necessary.  I am not blaming the Minister and I am not blaming the officials, but we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that the Department has not been a success, and what we are afraid of is that if we are content to go on as we have been going for the last five years, we will fail absolutely, and that is what we are anxious to avoid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach this discussion in a sympathetic spirit. I do not know if the Deputies opposite imagine that I am actuated by apparent hostility to the Irish language, but, if so, I would like to assure them that is not the case.  About 20 years ago I bought my first book of O'Growney, and as long as Deputies will confine their arguments to young cows and old cows, red cows and yellow cows, I will be able to follow them fairly well; but I regret to say that, through lack of encouragement more than anything else, my studies did not get further than that.  While I reserve my opinion as to the compulsory teaching of Irish in the primary <Col N="2034" /> schools being the best method of promoting the language, I am anxious that it should not die out in the Gaeltacht.  I am anxious that we should foster and encourage it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Law suggested that there should be a substantial amount of public money expended in the Gaeltacht and I gathered the inference that it should be expended in Donegal in particular, where the needs appeared to him to be greatest.  He mentioned an amount of public money which should not be accountable to the Department of Finance or to the Public Accounts Committee.  Within limits that is quite a desirable thing.  It may be desirable, if you have a backward district in the country, to set aside some definite, specified sum for development outside the ordinary bounds of Government finance, but it must be very clearly defined and very clearly specified, because having had, during four years on the Public Accounts Committee, some experience of the methods of finance adopted by the Department of Fisheries as heirs of the Congested Districts Board, I think it is necessary that there should be something definite and specified.  Though I agree with the Minister for Lands and Agriculture that the Congested Districts Board did good work, it was exempt from all the normal processes of accountancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that some of the experiments undertaken by the Ministry in succession to the Board&mdash;they were only carrying it on as a legacy&mdash;were not at all satisfactory from the point of view of the taxpayer.  There was, for instance, the subsidising of a factory for toys which were to supplant those made in Germany.  That was not a satisfactory transaction, because when the war was over the Germans again sent in toys.  The factory had not time to develop.  I do not think it had the expert skill either, because the Germans are toy-makers by heredity; their children carve wooden toys when they are very small.  This factory had not sufficient expert skill and did not develop sufficiently to supplant the German toys.  There were other reasons, but I will not trouble to mention them now.  Therefore, while a grant in aid <Col N="2035" /> which would be unaccountable to the Department of Finance and the Dáil may be justified, I think the Dáil should scrutinise the account very carefully and should be satisfied that the money is applied wisely.</P>
    <P>This Bill is making a comparatively small administrative change.  It is, I understand, an instalment on the report of the Gaeltacht Commission. It is not the whole action to be taken. Some of that action has already been taken through Departments.  This Bill definitely sets up the Ministry of Fisheries as the Ministry for the Gaeltacht, but not only for the Gaeltacht&mdash;a Ministry whose primary concern will be for the Gaeltacht and which will have to consider the economic and cultural aspects of the Gaeltacht but also a Ministry concerned for the rest of Ireland.  In fact when we reach the Committee Stage I am seriously considering whether the official title laid down in the Bill should not be altered, and instead of talking of the Minister for Lands and Fisheries we should talk of the Minister for Lands and Seas.  It is a very old title which the present occupant will, no doubt, worthily enjoy.  There is some advantage in this proposal over that contained in the report of the Gaeltacht Commission.  It is more comprehensive.  For instance, there is one loophole from the economic point of view in the report of the Gaeltacht Commission.  That deals with what are generally known as congested districts.  Portion of them is Irish-speaking, or partly Irish-speaking, but there is one county, part of the congested districts, which is neither Irish-speaking nor partly Irish-speaking, yet great distress exists there, that is, County Leitrim.  It is a very poor county but it does not appear at a recent period to have been Irish-speaking, yet any measures adopted for relief in Donegal, Mayo or Kerry should also apply to Leitrim, because the economic need is as great there.  There are poor men there without any resources such as fishing.  This Bill makes it possible for the Department of Lands and Fisheries to deal with and assist that county as it can deal with and assist Donegal, Mayo or Kerry.  That is one advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> We tried an experiment since the beginning of the last Dáil and it seems to have worked well.  I do not think there is any criticism of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Fisheries who is dealing with the work of the Land Commission.  That experiment seems to be working well, but Deputy Lemass yesterday put forward a criticism that the Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Land Commission ought to be dealt with by the same individual.  I admit that that argument has the charm of an old song to me because I think I remember saying the same thing myself in 1923, but experience here has convinced me and has convinced Ministers and, possibly, four years' experience will convince Deputy Lemass, that it is not a workable arrangement.  The work of the Land Commission is work of intense detail.  It is a whole-time job for one individual.  It might be a possible arrangement to have the Departments of Fisheries and Agriculture under one Minister with a Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the details of the Land Commission.  If the work of the Ministry of Agriculture were going to be what I may describe as static, if it were going to be regular routine work such as exists in the Department of Justice, for instance, or in the Department of Defence, where there are standing bodies, armed or otherwise, to be administered, it might be all right, but the Department of Agriculture ought to be progressive.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have leisure to study agricultural development overseas. and possibly in this country&mdash;the cultivation of beet sugar, for instance. That would be difficult for a Minister with an abundance of details on his shoulders.  The improvement of our products and the increase of production are matters which a Minister with leisure should investigate for himself. I am proud to welcome Deputy Lemass as a disciple, but I am afraid I must discard the mantle of prophet and say that experience has taught me that it is better to have separate Ministries for these.  The Ministry of Fisheries will have great scope.  The Land Commission, for twenty or thirty years, will have an enormous amount of detail work which cannot be dealt with on a <Col N="2037" /> broad and general scale but in reference to every single case.  The Department of Agriculture ought to be progressive, a Department free from the trammels of answering an enormous number of questions dealing with matters of detail.  It ought to be free to investigate and make scientific researches and develop our production so as better to be able to meet the demands of the State.  Thus agriculture may in time&mdash;it must be a slow process &mdash;become more prosperous.</P>

      <P>I take it that in bringing forward this Bill the President had no intention of announcing it as a Government alternative to the whole Report of the Gaeltacht Commission. It is intended.  I take it, to be the Government's alternative to two clauses in that report.  One, in the nature of a minority report, recommended that a special Commission on the lines of the old Congested Districts Board should be set up to deal with Gaeltacht matters.  The other, which was signed by the majority of members, recommended rather that a Commission with a watching brief should be set up without financial powers but with powers to supervise and co-ordinate the work of the various Departments which have business in the Gaeltacht.  I take it that the Government proposal in this Bill is a third means of dealing with the difficulties which those two proposals were intended to solve, and that the Government proposal is only one way of making it easier to carry out in detail the recommendations of the Commission. We are not, therefore, discussing the report of the Gaeltacht Commission, and there is nothing in this Bill to prevent, us discussing that report and the White Paper which deals with it at the proper time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a matter like this there is no room for complete and absolute optimism. Our attitude towards any measures that could be taken for the improvement of the Gaeltacht, whether from the point of view of the language or the economic condition, must be, as Deputy Hugh Law has said, an attitude of much anxiety rather than optimism, because <Col N="2038" /> everyone who knows anything about the condition of the language and the economic condition of the Gaeltacht must admit that both are very bad and that the condition of the language, in particular, is so bad and getting so rapidly worse that it will take every effort that can be put forward by the Dáil, or anyone in the country interested in the matter, to save the language in the Gaeltacht.  There is no room for optimism, and I do not think that any scheme that can be put forward is likely to solve the whole question in a day or likely to do more than give us a fairly anxious time for a large number of years.  We must wait and see how such measures as this would work out, and we must be prepared to keep a sharp look out for their working, and change them if they are not working satisfactorily.  Personally, I signed the majority report of this Commission in regard to this special matter not with any great enthusiasm and with a considerable bias in my mind in favour of the report of the minority.  I believe that Deputy Hugh Law touched on what is really the kernel of the whole matter in his remarks.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the third means which the Government has proposed is perhaps a better means than either of the two set out in the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission, for this reason: that the means that the Government has proposed, this means of setting up a special Ministry to deal with all the problems together, will give us all here an opportunity every year of going into the problems connected with the Gaeltacht in the utmost detail and of seeing whether the measures being carried out by the Government are working satisfactorily.  The measures the Government proposes will establish the authority and power of investigation of the Dáil over that work in a better way than would have been possible by either of the two proposals the Commission recommends in the report. Of course, as I say, it is not a perfect scheme.  No scheme can be perfect in dealing with the Gaeltacht.  No scheme can guarantee perfection, but this scheme gives the members of the Dáil who are interested an opportunity og keeping themselves in touch, from <Col N="2039" /> year to year, with the work of this Ministry, and of ensuring that if in any respect the work of the Ministry is not up to the mark it can be improved and the full light of debate in the Dáil can be shed on it.</P>
    <P>To come back to what Deputy Law said, and to what I consider the most helpful suggestion made in the debate, he pointed out that the great difficulty that the Minister for Fisheries had in setting up any scheme for dealing with the Gaeltacht is that it is unlikely to be an economic scheme, and that you must be prepared in a great many cases to lose money or to allow money to lie out for a number of years without being absolutely certain whether you will get a return for it or not.  As a matter of fact, the Congested Districts Board, nearly forty years ago, was founded for that very reason.  It was founded in order that it might be possible for the British Treasury, as it was at the time, to allow money to be handled more easily and to lie out for a longer time than would be possible under the ordinary rules of the British Treasury.  That was the reason for the founding of the Congested Districts Board, and it was on that principle it worked.  It had a kind of grant-in-aid from the British Treasury and it was not responsible to the British Treasury for that.  Anyone who will read the history of the Congested Districts Board by its Secretary will see that that note of freedom from Treasury control runs through the whole history. That was the dominant idea in the minds of those who founded it and that was the principal idea its promoters kept in their minds all along.</P>
    <P>If we proceed to set up a Ministry in order to deal with the Gaeltacht, I agree with Deputy Law that there is a considerable danger that we will find a tightening-up of expenditure in the Gaeltacht in a way that will not be advantageous to the public or to the Gaeltacht, that we will have not only a tightening-up, but a process of red-tape introduced into the expenditure in connection with the Gaeltacht, which may not be either an advantage to the Gaeltacht or in any real way an advantage to the public at large.  I think the suggestion that Deputy Law threw out <Col N="2040" /> should be explored a little bit further. It seems to me that the real villain of the piece is not so much the Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. The real villain of the piece in this case is the Ministry of Finance.  It is not so much because the Ministry of Finance is at bottom an essentially evil organisation or a force which is always trying to do the biggest amount of harm it can in every direction, but because the system of financial control which we have adopted in this country makes it necessary and inevitable that the Ministry of Finance should undertake and arrogate to itself the position of being expert in everything.  Those familiar with the working of other Departments know that in a great many cases in the past schemes of the utmost utility have been held up for a long time purely because some official in the Ministry had to be persuaded that they were proper schemes, although the experts had decided on them long before.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that Deputy Law, in touching on that point, has touched upon a question to which the fullest attention should be given by the Dáil.  I am not very familiar with the process of controlling public money, but it would seem to me that we could arrange in some carefully defined and narrowly limited way, if you like, that funds under the control of the new Ministry should be accounted for, not to the Ministry of Finance, but directly to the Committee on Public Accounts. It seems to me that in that way you would protect the public interest and you would see that the Dáil would be well acquainted with the means by which these moneys were expended. At the same time you would allow the experts in the Ministry of Fisheries, the only experts who should have a say in the matter, the fullest latitude in expending these moneys as they thought best.  I do not know whether that suggestion is workable, but I do think in certain respects, in respects carefully defined and laid down by the Dáil, that the finances of this new Ministry should be by way of a grant-in-aid rather than by way of an ordinary Vote in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is one great reason which to my mind justifies the setting up of a Ministry <Col N="2041" /> such as this.  That is that the work of trying to improve the Gaeltacht is not a work that lies along one straight line. It is a work that cuts across the work of every other Ministry in the State.  As soon as you begin to talk about the Gaeltacht you come up against questions concerning the division of land, the development of fisheries, rural industries and so on.  That being so it seems to me that a Ministry, like this Ministry which is being set up, is perhaps the best means of co-ordinating all these works.  It seems to me to be a good thing rather than a bad thing that the Ministry which is responsible for the division of lands all over the country should also be in charge of the division of land in the Gaeltacht.  It is recommended in the Gaeltacht Commission's Report for instance&mdash;I do not know whether it is workable or not&mdash; that some alleviation of conditions in the Gaeltacht would be possible by way of migration out of the Gaeltacht to lands in other parts of the country.  If that is found possible&mdash;I do not say it will be found possible&mdash;the only Ministry which could deal with it is the Ministry which has to do with the whole question of distributing land all over the country.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to fisheries.  I hold that the problem of developing the fisheries in the Gaeltacht is not by any means the same problem as the problem of developing the fisheries in the nation as a whole.  I hold that the small type of fisherman who works a small holding along the west coast of Ireland has little or nothing in common with the type of fisherman you have in Howth or in Arklow.  He has still less in common with the fisherman in the English centres where fishing is organised on a large industrial scale with immense capital resources, huge boats, and so on.</P>
    <P>No matter what improvement we have in fishing conditions, there is a resemblance between the type of fishing that is carried on in the Gaeltacht and that must be carried on there, and the general fishing problem of the country, which makes it desirable that the work of looking after both types should be coordinated by the one Department.  It seems to me that in those two respects, at any rate, a very good case exists for <Col N="2042" /> putting the work of the Gaeltacht in charge of the Department that has to do with the distribution of land and the fishery question of the country as a whole.  The third aspect of development in the Gaeltacht, which is concerned with small industries, is, perhaps, on a slightly different footing.  Deputy Fahy suggested that perhaps it would be better that that work should be put in charge of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There might be something to be said for that, but it would have the disadvantage that you would take away from the Ministry which had very large functions in the Gaeltacht already a kind of work which is more important and needs more urgently to be developed in the Gaeltacht than anywhere else.  I do not know that a Ministry which has to do with such a thing as unemployment insurance all over the country, with the Trades Loan Guarantee Act, the Geological Survey&mdash; perhaps there may be a weakness in respect of the Geological Survey&mdash;and matters that make up the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce, has very much in common with the problem of the small rural industries in the Gaeltacht. That is a problem which can very well be looked after by the Ministry that looks after the division of lands and the question of fisheries.  It seems to me that it can best be looked after in the manner indicated by the Minister, by the creation of some sort of central depot in Dublin which will be looked after not by one organiser but by three or four officials who will attend not only to the organising of the industry in Ireland but will also look after the purchasing of materials, the various changes that take place in fashions, and who will make contact between the little factories and the markets.  I have more hope for an improvement in the Gaeltacht in the development of small rural industries, if the matter could be taken up energetically and if it were put under the control of a properly organised central depot, than in either the development of fisheries or the further division of land.  I think, for all these reasons, that the case for setting up this Ministry which the Bill indicates is a very strong one and that the work will probably&mdash;I say probably <Col N="2043" /> advisedly, because in this case we cannot be too optimistic&mdash;be better done by that kind of Ministry, which will co-ordinate all these various activities, than it could be done by the sort of Commission that we recommended in the Gaeltacht Report, or by the revival of the Congested Districts Board.  I think Deputies should make up their minds on that question.</P>
    <P>While I have every respect for Deputy Hugh Law, and while I agree that the Congested Districts Board did immense work for the poor in the congested districts in Ireland, I believe that the problem that faces our State in this respect is one that can best be solved by other methods than those employed by the Congested Districts Board.  I would almost go so far as to say that part of the difficulty that we have to face in the Gaeltacht is the legacy that was left by the C.D.B.  The Congested Districts Board had to deal with a terrifically difficult problem.  It dealt with it fairly successfully, but in dealing with it, it could not avoid, and nobody could avoid, to some extent, creating new problems.  Some of these problems are amongst the worst that have to be faced in dealing with this question of the Gaeltacht.  One of them was indicated, perhaps unconsciously, by Deputy Clery; that is the idea that the people of the Gaeltacht are always looking for doles or bribes of some kind, whether it is in the form of an accusation against another party, or whether it is in the form of an appeal for pity.  That is, perhaps, not the fault of the Congested Districts Board, but may be party due to the psychology of the people.  It is one of the heritages left to us from the period of the Congested Districts Board.  It is one of the things that we must get rid of if we are going to make anything of this Gaeltacht problem.  We must teach the people in the Gaeltacht to stand on their own feet and not to expect that money will be spent for which they cannot give a return, and not to expect that they will be for ever the paupers of the country.  That kind of problem is one that cannot be dealt with by an organisation on the lines of the old Congested Districts Board.  It would only perpetuate some of the evils which, not <Col N="2044" /> through the fault of the Congested Districts Board, but owing to many circumstances, grew up while the Congested Districts Board was in office. For that reason, I think that a Ministry which will work in conjunction with the Dáil, and whose work will be subject to the constant scrutiny and examination of the Dáil, and that will be financed by the Dáil and financed, I hope, in a way somewhat different from the other Ministries, will be likely to do the best that can be done for the Gaeltacht.  I propose to vote for the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tierney devoted a certain part of his observations to explaining the origin of, to him, the apparently painful psychology of the poor people in the West of Ireland.  He seems to <Col N="2045" /> think that it is an extraordinary thing that down there they have the cheek to ask for special treatment.  He seems to suggest to the Dáil that that is in the nature of a slight on the national character, and that it is a defect that ought to be remedied as soon as possible. If we are to bring these people up to the level that Deputy Tierney would like, we must eradicate these bad habits of looking for money from the National Government.  Surely the people of the West of Ireland have as much right to look for money for special works in the West as have the people in any other part of the country to look for money for their areas.  When the Congested Districts Board was there it may have been used for political purposes, but I do not agree with Deputy Tierney that it left a bad legacy.  I say that it left a good legacy and did a lot of good work in its time, and that the nearer we get to the Congested Districts Board under whatever plans are eventually formulated here, the better for the country.</P>
    <P>I am not very much concerned with Deputy Cooper's difficulty as to how the expenditure on special schemes in the Gaeltacht will be watched and scrutinised.  We will have an opportunity of discussing the matter on the annual Estimates, and the Public Accounts Committee, I am sure, will give a certain amount of latitude. What I do want to point out, however, is that it does not really matter what sort of Commission, Department or Ministry we set on foot, if they are not going to have money to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister for Fisheries is doing his best.  He says he is not getting enough money to develop the fisheries of Ireland properly.  But we have this Ministry, and undoubtedly it is an unpopular Ministry.  People down the country, fishermen especially, feel that it is not doing its best for them. When the Minister for Finance, who, it has been suggested, is the bad boy of the piece, can come along and say that he has no confidence, or something like that, in fishery development in this country, that he does not like sea fisheries, and apparently is not prepared to spend money on them, there is no use going to the trouble of setting <Col N="2046" /> up machinery&mdash;that is, if we are not going to have money available for this purpose.  What I said in Irish was that we are spending money in other parts of the country which, perhaps, do not want it quite so badly.  We are spending money on drainage, housing and roads.  It is well known to the Deputies from Galway, for example, that the amount that was spent on roads in that constituency was very small, for some reason or another, compared with what was spent in other constituencies.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to all the other social services.  It would be just as natural for Deputy Tierney to attack the Labour Party for asking for special privileges for the old, the blind and the poor, as to get up and say there is something bad in the character of the people of the West of Ireland when they ask for these things. I do not wish to follow Deputy Tierney into the personal matters he talked about, but I would like to refer to the point Deputy Law raised about the machines that were supplied.  These machines were supplied in the 1925 by-election, when Deputy Tierney was a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate for North Mayo.  They were supplied to the people in this poor district who are living at the present time on flour that is supplied by some charitable person in Dublin.  I have been in their houses.  I do not know whether Deputy Tierney has or not, but I know that immediately after his election for North Mayo there were whole townlands in which people had not alone flour or any foodstuffs, but where they had not a bed to sleep on, a chair to sit on, or a pot in which to boil something to eat.  These people were given machines during Deputy Tierney's election, and the machines, according to the parish priest, Canon Howley, were put into a hall.  After the election there was to be a motor sent down in order to start some kind of little factory.  Well, the motor has not come there since, and it is quite natural that the people down there should feel aggrieved.  I submit that instead of Deputy Tierney having a grievance against us or against those people that these poor people have a very legitimate grievance against him and his associates.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to tell us what he is going to do.  We are not so much interested in the machinery.  We would like to have the management of the services of the Gaeltacht as independent as possible, as free from Governmental control as possible.  We do not want to see those officials who we are told have special experience in the Gaeltacht and congested districts held up in their work by red tape regulations and by the schemes and activities connected with other areas.  If they have special knowledge of the special problems of these districts we would like them to devote their whole time to them, and to evolve some kind of decent policy.  I submit that the present Bill is simply going to effect a change in the machinery, but that there is not going to be any change in policy. You cannot have a decent policy unless you have money.  A definite sum was asked for by Mr. Moriarty in this report&mdash;£100,000. In 1925, and I think the conditions are very much worse now than they were then, the Government spent £600,000 on relief schemes throughout the country.  Of course there were nine by-elections in that year and most of the £600,000 went into those constituencies where there were by-elections.  I think in County Leitrim alone £40,000 was spent that year.  Therefore it is not too much to ask that in connection with the setting up of this machinery we should have an assurance of some definite policy in connection with afforestation and reclamation&mdash;things that will give definite and regular employment, such as the old Congested Districts Board used to give, large schemes that will embrace large areas, not small schemes such as the Minister for Agriculture is carrying out; not a couple of hundred acres but a couple of thousand acres. To do that you would want money.  I hope the Minister for Finance who, I know, takes a special interest in this matter, will soften his heart and grant at least £100,000 to enable a definite <Col N="2048" /> step forward to be taken for the amelioration of conditions in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fahy, in speaking to this particular Bill, wondered whether we, and by we I suppose he took in the whole of us, were serious with regard to this question of the Gaeltacht.  As far as anything we have heard from the opposite benches this evening, or up to this evening, is concerned, I feel that if a clear suggestion, helpful thought, is to be taken as an index of seriousness, the Party opposite are not serious with regard to the Gaeltacht. I feel that the speeches made this evening indicate that neither the Gaeltacht Commission Report nor the Government White Paper has been read for the purpose of seeing how the Party opposite can help in any way in trying to get down to hard facts in connection with the matter. Deputy Clery said it would be better for the Gaeltacht if this Bill had been kept back until the Gaeltacht report was discussed.  What was to prevent that report being discussed?  The report was issued about August, 1926, many months more than a year ago. The Deputies who have spoken have been in this House since August last year, and what was to prevent them discussing that report?  What was to prevent them discussing the report from the point of view of forcing the Government to put the terms of the report into operation or from the point of view of criticising the delay on the part of the Government in saying what their intentions were in connection with it?</P>

In so far as the Government deserve criticism <Col N="2050" /> for anything they say in that White Paper, they have handed themselves over bodily to their critics, because they have put down in clear, plain words, under every suggestion, what their proposal is, and the critics have been given the position in the clearest and most explicit way.  There is no attempt made to take the Gaeltacht Commission Report and to write in a kind of general report on it. Everything is put down in serial form and in the plainest and simplest possible way, so that there is no excuse on the part of any party in the country, or any group of people, particularly the people who do not trust the Government and the political party connected with it, not to take the Commission's Report and formulate their own policies with regard to it and make them public.  The White Paper has been issued for a sufficiently long space of time to have that explicit criticism.  As I say, I feel from what we have heard here that the Report has not been read and that the White Paper has not been read, in so far as it refers to the particular aspect of the Gaeltacht Commission Report that is involved in this Bill. If the Deputies would look at the Gaeltacht Commission Report, paragraph 185 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Many witnesses have urged the necessity for setting up a special Ministry to look after all matters connected with the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>After very careful consideration the Gaeltacht Commission decided that it would not be right or helpful to withdraw from the Gaeltacht districts the services of the fully-fledged and individual Ministries, and they suggested the special type of Commission recommended in the next paragraph&mdash;a Commission with inspectorial general capacity and co-ordinating capacity. What is being done in this Bill is that this special Ministry that many witnesses asked for to deal with the Gaeltacht is actually being provided to deal with these particular matters that can be dealt with by a special Minister without taking away&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest that when Deputy Fahy's motion comes along Deputy Derrig will have an opportunity of speaking on the White Paper, and I look for point-blank criticism that will show any weaknesses in the Government's case if it is going to help the Gaeltacht.  I am dealing closely with the Bill and pointing out that many witnesses urged the setting up of a special Ministry to look after all matters connected with the Gaeltacht. And after the consideration of that proposal, which appealed to some extent to many members of the Commission, they suggested a Commission of an inspectorial, general, and a co-ordinating sort.  Now what are you offered instead?  You are offered, in matters which may be specially dealt with in the Gaeltacht, without depriving the Gaeltacht of any of the fuller powers or resources or the bigger machinery of the fully-fledged Ministries&mdash;in matters connected with land purchase and division, fisheries and rural industries, which cater especially for the economic needs of the congested districts in the <Col N="2052" /> Gaeltacht area, a special Ministry. That is one thing.  You are offered as well, according to the White Paper, when Deputies read that White Paper, an arrangement of this nature supplemented by a scheme of close co-ordination with the various Departments responsible for education, agricultural instruction, housing, public health, etc., which will provide the special attention and co-ordination which is necessary, and will at the same time be free from certain disabilities which would be unavoidably associated with the setting up of special machinery.</P>

You see it is a matter of reading the White Paper and realising what it implies. You are offered a special Ministry dealing with rural industries and that kind of thing.</P>

If Deputies will not take the trouble to read the report itself, in so far as it deals with a <Col N="2053" /> special commission, and will not read the White Paper, so far as it deals with it, we cannot expect them to give the contribution to the discussion that we might expect.  I would particularly refer to Deputy Fahy's opposition to the proposal here.  Let me translate that portion of the Gaelic League evidence in regard to the economic life of these districts.  It is very brief.  Under the heading &ldquo;Livelihood&rdquo; in paragraph 23 of the statement put up by the Gaelic League as evidence to the Gaeltacht Commission it says: Parapragh 23 &ldquo;Land&mdash;When land is being distributed in any area preference should be given to Irish speakers who want it.  It should be put as a responsibility on the Land Commission to put the scheme together to transfer settlements of Irish speakers to lands internal in Ireland and to see that preference is made in such a way that the new area will remain a truly Irish area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Home Industry&rdquo; paragraph 24, &ldquo;Work can be provided for the people of the Gaeltacht, planting trees, making roads, making quays and drainage schemes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Equipment and education should be provided for fishermen so that they can get the greatest benefit out of their calling.&rdquo;</P>

There is not a single one of these things that does not come in under either the Land Commission or the old Ministry of Fisheries, and these aspects of life of the people in these districts are being concentrated under a Ministry, so that you will have <Col N="2055" /> a Minister here in this House challengeable upon every aspect of these things. And this is the machinery that the Bill offers you here, dealing with the economic life of the people, and so far as there is any bigger aspect of their economic life that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce could deal with or any other Department could deal with, the co-operation promised on page 30 of the White Paper covers that.</P>

So that in so far as money is a solution of the problem, and without money a big part of the problem cannot be solved, there is no use getting money without having your machinery to use it.  If there is one thing that can do more damage than anything else, it is the use of money by men not capable of using it.  What Deputies on the far side of the House are doing is: they are opposing the creation of machinery confined to the needs that immediately touch the economic life of the people in the Gaeltacht and that many witnesses, according to the report, have recommended.</P>

I live in the Gaeltacht and I probably know as much about it as any Deputy in this House.

I think any Deputy from Galway, no matter what Party he belongs to, who is not agreeable to have this question postponed for at least six weeks, until we have discussed the report of the Gaeltacht Commission and the White Paper, has not the welfare of the Gaeltacht at heart.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who was in the Gaeltacht, will agree that if the report of the Gaeltacht Commission and the White Paper and all were discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Before you appoint a man in charge of the Gaeltacht, I would ask you to consider the conditions of the Gaeltacht and do not allow yourselves to be placed in the position of appointing a man in charge of a very big scheme, as Deputy Tierney has admitted&mdash;a very big and difficult task&mdash;who will be looked upon as inefficient in the Gaeltacht.</P>

I know that within my own memory the line from Galway to Clifden that was an Irish-speaking area is now practically an English-speaking area.  I know that the Irish language is dying every day in the Gaeltacht.  I do not think it is any use starting a new Gaeltacht until you look after the old Gaeltacht first. When you see nearly fifty young boys and girls leaving a parish at least every fortnight, going to America, persons who have had Irish from their childhood, and persons who know Irish that nobody in this House could ever learn, it gives you some idea of the conditions that exist there, and it goes to bear out what I say about the Gaeltacht.  We should look after these people and decide on a policy for the Gaeltacht. Then it will be time enough to discuss the machinery, and who will be put in charge.</P>

He gave that report that we issued very careful consideration.  He worked on that report very hard, and it was mainly due to his efforts that the report is such a valuable document as it is.  I freely concede all that.  The Commission said definitely that a special Commission be set up charged with the duty of seeing that all Departments carry out in detail the Government's policy with regard to the language in the Gaeltacht.  But we find here in this White Paper that there is to be a co-ordinating Ministry, that the Land Commission is to be transferred to the Ministry of Fisheries, and that it will act as a co-ordinating authority in the Gaeltacht in future.  How will the Minister for Fisheries see that the policy of the Government with regard to the language in the Gaeltacht, so far as it concerns the other services, are carried into effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister for Local Government asked me to do is to try to get into the Government's secrets and know what they intend to do.  Candidly I am afraid that I will never succeed in that.  The Government will never tell me what they intend to do regarding the Gaeltacht or anything else.  I can only read what is expressly contained in the White Paper.  I would like to ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health how that Ministry will carry out what the Commission of which he was Chair-recommended? How will that Ministry see that no English-speaking Gárdaí are sent into Connemara or to Clifden or to any other portion of the Gaeltacht? How will that Minister see that English speaking Post Office officials, Customs and Excise officials, and even officials of his own Department itself who are English speakers are not sent into the district?  How will he endeavour to find out all these things so that the Executive Council will see that their policy with regard to the language is carried into effect?  It is surely a position too big for the Minister for Lands and Fisheries to undertake and it surely is a reasonable proposition that we should postpone this until such time as the Dáil has a full opportunity of discussing the pros and cons of the Gaeltacht Commission in connection with the White Paper issued by the Government.  I believe that is a very reasonable proposition. <Col N="2061" /> It is no use to taunt Deputies on the opposite benches or Deputies on any other benches and ask what is their policy.  That is no use.  That is not the way to tackle a problem that is of very great seriousness.  It is the Government that is charged with the salvation of the Gaeltacht and with the salvation and preservation of the Irish language.  It is on the present Government that a great deal of responsibility rests and taunting with &ldquo;What is your policy&rdquo; is no use.  The policy the Government have put forward should be examined in relation to the Report that the Gaeltacht Commission has presented and it should be examined minutely&mdash;there should be a minute examination of this question in the parts of Ireland where the Irish is a living language. We waited for many months while we were promised the Government's policy and after waiting for a long time we are now told that we cannot wait for another fortnight or three weeks so that we can have a full discussion on the matter.  I am not prepared to say that the Ministry of Fisheries because it is the Ministry of Fisheries is not fit to carry out very special and very good work in the Gaeltacht. I am not prepared to refer to any Ministry as a Ministry that is incapable of doing any good in the Gaeltacht.  What I am prepared to say is this, and I say it with responsibility as one who has signed that Report, that the proposals in this White Paper are not in consonance with the suggestions we made in our recommendations.   I submit that we should be given an opportunity here of examining the two&mdash; the policy of the Government and the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission Report.  That is the reason that I am suggesting that the introduction of this Bill should be delayed until we have an opportunity of discussing the matter in full.</P>

      <P>The passage of this Bill will dispose of certain matters that might arise in a discussion on the Gaeltacht Commission Report and on the White Paper, but it will not dispose of very many of them, and it seems to me that it will not at all dispose of any discussion or anything that might arise with regard to the Special Commission <Col N="2062" /> which the Gaeltacht Commission recommended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it not prejudice entirely the Minority Report, which recommended that a Special Commission or Department be set up to deal with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I was coming to that.  It will not prejudice any position with regard to the Special Commission which the majority recommended. The passing of this Bill means definitely the turning down of the Minority Report.  It turns down definitely the suggestion that we have in some form a reconstitution of the Congested Districts Board, either in a modified form or almost as it was before, and that much, in dealing with this Bill, the Dáil must decide.  Matters relating purely to the language do not arise in connection with this Bill and I do not think it necessary that we should have the whole matter before us before we come to a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies will realise that while the preservation of the language will be affected by what we do economically for the Gaeltacht, it does not follow at all that an economic improvement in the Gaeltacht would, of itself, stop the decay of the language.  It may be, and I am quite prepared to grant it, that the decay of the language cannot be stopped if we cannot do something economically for the Irish-speaking districts; but I do not think that the other proposition holds.  To some extent the suggestion that all Gaeltacht services should be put under either a Board or an individual who would deal solely with the Gaeltacht has been disposed of.  It is quite clear if we take the question of land division, that no Minister or Board, dealing solely with the Gaeltacht, could deal with that problem in the Gaeltacht.  In one or two districts lands have been taken in the Gaeltacht and are being divided up. That is, substantial holdings have been taken from those who were in possession of them before and they are being divided up.  The people who had that land have found holdings outside the Gaeltacht, and if we are to do anything in the matter of land division in the <Col N="2063" /> Gaeltacht it is necessary that what is proposed in this Bill should be adopted.</P>
    <P>Either the Board or the Ministry dealing with land division in the Gaeltacht should deal with land division all over the country. I do not believe that the suggestions that were made in the Majority Report of the Gaeltacht Commission about mass migration could possibly be carried out.  I believe that you would not find large groups of people who would be willing to go great distances from their old homes and, if you did take them, you would meet with great opposition.  There would probably be local unpopularity, and you might find, perhaps, that they would be living under police protection.  They would find different kinds of land and different conditions of farming as compared with those they were used to.  I believe that the suggestion of mass migration has to be entirely abandoned. I think in one of the Minority Reports that is suggested to be done and the Government, having gone into the matter with the Minister for Lands and others, are of that opinion.</P>
    <P>What they believe can be done to help the Gaeltacht in the matter of land division is to remove people who have comparatively large holdings of land and to accommodate them elsewhere and to use their land to increase the holdings of their neighbours who have not sufficient land.  By that means a good deal can be done but only by getting control of land distribution all over the country.  That is one of the arguments against a Ministry dealing with the Gaeltacht and nothing else.  As regards the matter of fisheries, it is very desirable that we should not have some special authority dealing with fisheries in the Gaeltacht.  The fishery problem, as I said yesterday in the Seanad, is a very difficult one.  An extensive development of fisheries is something that will be very difficult for us to achieve, and we will not improve the prospects of the fishermen either in the Gaeltacht or outside it by having two authorities and splitting up the control of fisheries.  I believe, therefore, that the suggestion which has been made of having some special Board or <Col N="2064" /> separate Ministry, a board or individual, dealing solely with the Gaeltacht should not be adopted.  There is no doubt that the fishery problem is very largely but not entirely a Gaeltacht problem, and the interests of fishermen outside the Gaeltacht would have to be provided for somehow.  I do not think that we are going to gain anything by dividing this particular problem between two authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>What about afforstation and mineral resources?  Afforestation is under the Ministry of Lands and the development of mineral resources, as Deputy Tierney pointed out, is under still another Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was referring to afforestation.  Again, I do not know whether we will get better results by dividing up the forestry service. It may be that certain afforestation operations may be carried out by the Land Commission.  It may be that the planting of small shelter beds, or something like that, could be carried out, but whether large schemes could be carried out I do not know.  That would be rather a matter of detail.  If it were found desirable to have the Land Commission dealing with afforestation in the Gaeltacht I think it could be arranged, but there is a mistaken idea in regard to afforestation. We always hear about the planting of waste land, but you cannot plant waste land, as land must be of certain value and quality if it is to be worth planting at all.  It is probable that nothing like the amount of afforestation which is commonly suggested could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provision of a sum of £100,000, that matter is not quite as simple as some Deputies seem to think.  At present, in regard to the expenditure of various departments like the Department of Agriculture. the Gaeltacht gets more than it would be entitled to, having regard, for instance, to its population or area of arable land.  There are special works and special schemes for the Gaeltacht and there is special consideration for it.  More is done for the people of those areas than for people in other areas who do not need it so much.  This <Col N="2065" /> is the point of view I have taken, that if we decided to carry out all the services of the State on a level and to treat the people everywhere exactly the same, and if we allowed, say, £100,000 to do something extra for the people of the Gaeltacht, the result might be that the people there would be worse rather than better off, because it might turn out that through the special considerations which are being given through various departments they are getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps another speaker can give them later on.  I am not the person who gave them in the House before or who prepared them for the House, and, consequently, I have only just a general recollection in regard to them.  I think it was Deputy Law who said that some special arrangement would be necessary in regard to financing the work of this Ministry.  I am not at all sure that that is so.  I am not sure that there is any need to have anything in the nature of a development fund or a grant-in-aid. It may be that the Department should be given greater discretion in regard to expenditure than it has had in the past.  There are Departments which have more freedom in their expenditure than others.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, being regarded as a business department, is not required to seek sanction for expenditure to the same extent as other departments, but in no department do occasions for expenditure often arise so suddenly that sanction could not be sought and ordinary procedure observed. One year presents very much the same problems as another, and a department, which has been in existence for some time and dealing with the problems which the Department of Fisheries would have to face, would be able to foresee its requirements in advance, submit schemes, and get money for them in good time to carry on its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to industries, it may be that the system we have followed has been a little too rigid, but that is a matter that I think can be administratively rectified.  Deputy Fahy said that he believed that it was by increasing expenditure on those industries that we could do most.  I agree with Deputy Fahy.  I believe that progress with land reclamation or with the finding of holdings for those who have insufficient land at present, by the removal of others, will be a comparatively slow progress, and that there are limits to what can be done.  In regard to fisheries, I also feel that there are very great difficulties, from the point of view of the Gaeltacht.  Remember, if you make these men whole-time fishermen, who will follow fish and go wherever fish are to be found, you will probably <Col N="2067" /> make them cease in present conditions to be Irish speakers.  While you are going to increase the productivity of the country and to find a livelihood for many by doing that, you are not necessarily helping the Irish language.  I do not say that you should refrain in any way from trying to do that, but you will only help the Irish language in present conditions and for some years ahead by helping the people who are really part-time fishermen.  In that matter I think that only a limited amount of progress can be made.  We can get results by loans and by a certain amount of expenditure.  If you expend beyond that you do not get good results, because you are beginning to do something like giving doles, and the efforts of the people themselves would be slackened.</P>
    <P>While something can be done to help those fishermen, I personally believe that only a limited amount can be done.  I believe that the greatest progress can be made by extending our activities in the matter of the rural industries.  I think that we have to look at the whole Gaeltacht problem in a special way because of the language.  If it were not that the people of these districts were the repositories of the language, if it were not for the fact that a reservoir is there from which the language must flow out again, I personally would look at the problem in a different way.  If it were not for the language I would try to clear the district altogether, try to reduce the population to one-quarter and remove the people elsewhere, but we cannot do that without destroying the language.  Consequently I feel that in order that this national policy which has been adopted and has the adherence of the vast majority of the people may be carried to success, you must contemplate the people staying there.  If they are to stay there we must do something to help them.  Remember, it must be to help them.  It is not merely to lavish money.  We could spend a great deal and still do nothing for them.  You must not spend in the way of giving doles, because the people will be corrupted and will slacken their efforts if you give them money in that way.  We must help them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter; that is all the more reason why something should be done.  I was proceeding to say that by the development of rural industries most help can be given.  It is on industries that most money should be expended. I was saying that I feel that while in many cases industries which may be started can hardly hope ever to become fully economic and fully self-supporting, I believe that it would be a good policy to start them, to contemplate them making an annual loss and to make up the difference between the working costs and the returns, from the Exchequer for a long period of years.  I think that in a great number of cases industries which may be started cannot hope to be fully economic, as they are situated in remote places.  The transport charges are heavy and great delays are involved owing to the remoteness of these districts. They are certainly handicapped and it may be that the difficulties that have existed in the past of not adapting patterns to changing fashions and so forth, may be overcome.  Nevertheless, industries of that sort will find a difficulty in becoming economic.  It <Col N="2069" /> was asked that money would be provided. Some Deputies say that it is no use providing machinery unless money is provided.  I quite accept that.  We will not do anything for the Gaeltacht simply by altering machinery.  We must provide money to make the machinery run, but I do not believe that we ought to face up to it, in the way of setting aside some set sum and saying, &ldquo;Here is a special figure for the Gaeltacht, apart from this figure nothing else will be done.&rdquo;  I believe that we must contemplate now a much bigger expenditure on the rural industries.</P>
      <P>So far as land reclamation is concerned certain work has begun.  It is intended to do more.  I think in that respect everything that is possible should be done.  We are expending a great deal of money on improvement works through the country.  I think the amount of the estimates this year is something like £300,000.  It is probable that a good proportion of that is already in the Gaeltacht areas.  It is desirable that there should be, so far as possible, preference for the Gaeltacht areas in expenditure under these heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody suggested that the industries should be handed over to the Department of Industry and Commerce, but that Department does not undertake the running of industries, and it is perhaps not particularly desirable that that Department should be the one which should control these industries, even if we had not the fact that the Department of Fisheries, especially as reorganised under this Bill, will have a great proportion of its staffs in the Gaeltacht who will be concerned mainly with the Gaeltacht problem.  As the actual running of industries has nothing to do with the existing functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce, it seems to me that we would be bringing in a second Department without necessity.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is not running industries elsewhere.  It has nothing whatever to do with them at the present time.  It would only be turning that function over to another department, and I think nothing would be gained.  So far as the Gaeltacht is concerned I think you must link up the <Col N="2070" /> question of fisheries, land division and reclamation, and rural industries.  It is necessary that whatever can be done in these three ways should be done, and that there should be co-ordination.  A decision in regard to the Gaeltacht Commission was not arrived at hurriedly; there were a great many conferences held and decisions arrived at before the White Paper was finally issued.  But comparatively early in the consideration of the Report we came to the conclusion that the setting up of a Congested Districts Board or the setting up of a Ministry for the Gaeltacht was not the right way and that what is proposed in this Bill was the best way to proceed.  I think it is not necessary to discuss the Gaeltacht Report generally&mdash;I think it is in order to refer to the economic part of the Report-to arrive at a decision as to the machinery that will be adopted for giving additional help to the people to find a better livelihood in the districts where they are at present.</P>
    <P>We have simply transferred the Land Commission to the Department of Fisheries, but there has not been the co-ordination that will take place when this Bill becomes law, if it receives the approval of the Dáil.  Under the new circumstances there will be a Civil Service head of the Department who will be in control both of the fisheries and rural industries side, and of the Land Commission side, and we will have complete co-ordination in regard to all the functions that exist in the Department.  As I have already told the Dáil, we contemplate that there shall be additional expenditure, and proposals will be laid before the Dáil for additional expenditure.  I am not prepared to state the amount, nor can I see any method by which we could fix the sum that would be required. What we fancied might be more than sufficient, having regard to the preparations made for using it, might be less than would be sufficient. What I think is necessary is that, having had this report of the Gaeltacht, and consideration given it, and the policy of the Government announced, we set up the machinery, that put it into operation, that as proposals come forward they be considered <Col N="2071" /> on their merits, and that provision be made for the work it is proposed to do.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  What is it proposed that the Government will do for rural industries?  You are taunting us with not being able to state our policy.  Will you state your policy with regard to rural industries, and what you are going to do for them?  You state in the White Paper that facilities exist under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act. Therefore the Government is not going to do any more.  Under that Act a person must apply for at least £5,000, I believe, and that is altogether beyond the capacity of the small people who are carrying on these industries.  That shows that the whole thing is hypocrisy and humbug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are rural industries in which the Department already takes an interest.  There are classes run by the Department.  I believe, for instance, that these classes should be increased.  They are working in many districts, and I have had evidence that they have done exceedingly useful work.  Greater work can be done by them.  There is the provision of a central depot, provision for inspectors, and for arranging that the proper kind and pattern of articles be supplied.  There is no doubt that in the past one of the greatest obstacles to the success of these industries was that they were not able to change as fashions changed.  Very often you found an industry going on extremely well, and then it found that it was unable to sell its goods.  It continued making the goods, but they became more unsaleable, and finally it was realised that for that particular class or type of article there was no longer a market.  If proper steps had been taken it would have been possible to warn those running the industry that there was no use continuing to manufacture along such lines, and that something new should be attempted.  I believe that where you have an industry it should be possible to give it the greatest possible help, instruction and assistance.  That that is what it wants. <Col N="2072" /> A great deal could be done in that way.  Different industries must be dealt with differently.  I say that the Government is prepared to do everything it can to find markets and to do everything it can in the way of providing instructions to keep an industry alive, and as to what it should do in the way of providing patterns.  The difficulty I see in connection with the Trade Loans Guarantee Act is that the procedure, while it is all right for large sums, is complicated for smaller ones. In the ways I have indicated it is possible to give an industry assistance which is equivalent to a very substantial subsidy, if you were counting up all the expenditure and the value of that expenditure to the industry.</P>

      <P>I think the speeches that have been made here to-day by Ministers have made an excellent case for postponing consideration of this Bill until the resolution on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Fahy has been discussed.  Every moment during the debate on this Bill we were up against the point that we did not know exactly what was the Government's policy on the Gaeltacht.  Since we came here we have been pressing the Government in every possible way to speed up whatever steps they intend to take to save the Gaeltacht.  We have been taunted here to-day that we did nothing.  About ten Questions were asked regarding the Government's policy for the Gaeltacht, and every time a Question was asked as to when they intended putting the Report of the Commission into effect we were told: &ldquo;Wait until the White Paper comes out.&rdquo;  That went on for many months.  Then the White Paper was issued, and anybody who honestly wanted to know what the Government intended to do could not find out from the White Paper.  Deputy Hogan to-day pointed out that we would have to go outside the White Paper, that we would have to get into the Government's mind in order to find out the secret of their intentions regarding the Gaeltacht.  A number of the clauses of the White Paper refer to the Report of the Technical Education Commission, and it is only a very few days since the Report of the Technical Education Commission was presented to the Dáil. <Col N="2073" /> We should not adopt machinery until we see clearly what work we intend the machinery to carry out, and I submit that the Government have made absolutely no case for rushing this Bill through until Deputy Frank Fahy's motion has been discussed and until the position of the Gaeltacht has been discussed in all its aspects. Then when we have thrashed that out we can with more clearness tackle the problem as to what sort of machinery we are going to set up to carry into effect what we think should be done in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, was glad to hear the Minister for Finance say that he is contemplating the spending of a good deal more money on the rural industries in the Gaeltacht.  I hope now that he has been contemplating it for the last five or six years he will do something about it.  The Government have been in office for six years, and they have done absolutely nothing regarding the saving of the Gaeltacht.  They have done less, as has been pointed out to-day, in spending money in the Gaeltacht than the old Congested Districts Board did under the British Government up to 1921.  Surely to goodness we should do more than the British Government did to save the people in the Gaeltacht? Land division and migration cannot save the Gaeltacht, and I hope that the Minister has thought enough about spending some money and that he will now start to spend a little on the development of the rural industries in the Gaeltacht.  If one quarter of the money that has been put into the development of the Shannon had been put into the development of industries there, I am quite certain that not a single man of those who have emigrated from that district in the last five or six years would have had to emigrate.  You have people there who are naturally quick. They have some experience in cloth manufacture, and there is a tradition there for that.  With a little money put into it, the people would establish their own factories and would become very quickly the best manufacturers of cloth in the world.  I hope, now that the President is here, that he will agree to postpone further consideration of this Bill until the whole Gaeltacht problem has been discussed in all its aspects.  I <Col N="2074" /> think we should all try to see what policy everybody in this House has regarding the Gaeltacht before we set up machinery.</P>

      <P>Let us understand one another.  Deputies will admit that I have afforded a very considerable amount of Government time towards Private Deputies' business.  We are now approaching the consideration of the financial business&mdash;Estimates, the Finance Bill, the Appropriation Bill, and so on&mdash;and that will take a very considerable time.  If I am disposed to consider the proposal that has been put to me, what accommodation am I going to get, in good faith, in return for that? Am I going to get back the time in respect of Government business?  Deputies will note that out of something like thirteen and a half hours for three days Private Deputies have got three and a half hours.  That is a pretty considerable inroad upon Government time, and, if I were disposed to give the two days, am I going to get a return for Government business&mdash;willingly. not by means of the Division Lobby&mdash; in return for it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President ought not to complain about the amount of time given out of Government time for private business.  We <Col N="2075" /> were quite prepared to sit here for weeks before Christmas, and we were quite prepared to sit here after Christmas for some weeks before this Session opened.  We made that clear to the President at the time.  I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to go back on that, so I will leave it.  However, on this question of the Gaeltacht we are keen that something in the way of a definite policy should be arrived at by this House as soon as possible, and we would be quite anxious to facilitate the President in every way possible as long as adequate opportunity for discussion could be given for this important question.  We would do everything we could to facilitate the President and his Government in making the debate as concise as possible.  We are anxious&mdash;and I will say this much, that I believe on his Benches, too, there are people who are just as keen as we are&mdash;to see that this Gaeltacht question is properly attended to, and attended to soon.  I do go that far, and it is not for the purpose of wasting time that many of our speakers have spoken as they have.  Many others are keenly interested.  They have not spoken at all, and would like to get an opportunity to do so.  In conclusion, I say that we certainly would do all we could to facilitate matters, so that at the earliest possible time a definite policy could be arrived at by the House with regard to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am in doubt about is where we are getting. Since we came back I have given, I think, a day, or a little over a day, in respect of Private Deputies' business. The motion was in respect of the old age pensions, and it took up a day and portion of another day of Government time.  I have no objection to giving Government time if we can afford it. But when the Deputy mentioned&mdash;I suppose he did not mean it in any offensive way&mdash;that there was time before Christmas and after Christmas, I admit. of course, there was, but there is a limit to human endurance.  We have been engaged here for many months, many months last year, previous to the General Election, after the General Election, and after the subsequent General Election, <Col N="2076" /> and I have had many representations from various Deputies with regard to the time.  I believe that even on the Deputy's side there are Deputies who are finding a considerable inconvenience in attending here three days in the week.  It is a very different proposition for citizens of Dublin to attend compared with Deputies from Donegal, from West Cork, from Kerry, or other places such as those.</P>
      <P>I have had great difficulty in trying to impress on them the necessity for a number of days attendance during the week.  We are going to adjourn until April 18th, and we propose to take the Estimates on the 18th, 19th and 20th of April, with a small reservation as to Government business undisposed of up to that time.  I hope to be able to persuade Deputies to sit for four days in the week, but it is a considerable sacrifice on the part of many Deputies interested in agriculture to attend here at this period of the year.  The Estimates and financial business, taking the average of the last few years, would occupy something like 120 hours.  If we allow Deputy Fahy's motion to be considered in Government time, will I get that two weeks in connection with the Estimates in private members' time?  I would not press it in respect of the first two weeks, but I would say, take the first and third week in order to get back some of the time I am allowing, bearing in mind the fact that I have already given a full day, which amounts to about 5 hours, and portion of another day, possibly amounting to about 7 hours altogether.  I put forward that suggestion for consideration. I do not know whether Deputy Fahy would be in a position to go on to-night.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That was really the intention, but there is no earthly chance of either Deputy Davin's motion or Deputy Murphy's motion being considered to-morrow.  There is this point, and I do not put it in any offensive spirit: There has been a great demand on Private Members' time.  Some business on the Order Paper for a considerable time has not been disposed of.  That is scarcely affected by this proposal.  There is more business than is likely to be disposed of, and if the activities of the various parties are kept up to the fever point which they have reached, the Private Members' portion of the Order Paper will be very well filled during the whole session.  We have still the financial business to transact.  I am prepared to meet Deputies as far as possible, but we ought to be met in the same spirit, and there ought to be some easing off in connection with Private Members' business.  I make this suggestion.  The Gaeltacht Report is a very important one.  That Report and the White Paper afford very considerable <Col N="2079" /> opportunities to all parties to consider a matter of vital importance in the life of the nation.  I suggest that we should devote the whole of to-morrow to that discussion.  I am prepared to meet all parties with a view to the provision of time, provided we also get some accommodation, but it would not savour of seriousness in the consideration of this report if it were interrupted at 12 o'clock to-morrow. Therefore, I would say, let us have a truce to whatever party differences there are in the House, and let us consider for a moment what we would like to read about the Parliament if we were not in it, and were concerned only with having a good picture of it in the public mind.  In that respect, it appears to me that the Gaeltacht Report, if it is under consideration to-morrow, ought not to be interrupted. A division will not be taken on it to-morrow.  There have been representations during the last twentyfour hours as to Deputies wishing to get away.  If they want to get away, they can get away in good faith, knowing that a division will not be taken to-morrow, and that the resumed discussion will take place when we reassemble, so that there will not be a snatch division.</P>

If we look at the bare Benches opposite at the present moment, when we are supposed to be discussing the Gaeltacht Report, it is a <Col N="2080" /> disgrace to the House, if we contemplate this House from outside as other people would have us contemplate it. To anyone who had any respect for, or interest in, the Gaeltacht, the mere picture of the Benches opposite at the present moment would be a disgrace, and the suggestion that the occasion of the discussion of the Gaeltacht should be announced to Deputies as something that they can freely and comfortably go away from without any responsibility is one that should never come from the chief officer of the House.</P>

The Bill dealing with rent restrictions is down for to-morrow, and is a very important measure.  The time now is very short, and if we are to get something done to right the position with regard to decontrol of houses which is to take place in a short time, then this Bill would have to get through in the shortest possible space of time.  If we go away for Easter holidays without discussing the matter it might carry us to a period when it was too late to have the Bill put into operation at all.

      <P>Perhaps I might explain the position.  The Ministers and Secretaries Bill was being debated on Second Reading.  A suggestion has been made that decision on that Bill should not be taken until the motion on the Paper in the name of Deputy Fahy has been discussed and decided upon.  The debate upon the Bill was interrupted to see whether that, in fact, could be done, and the suggestion has been made by the President that Deputy Fahy's motion should be taken in Government time to-morrow at half-past ten, and there is the further suggestion that the motion should not be interrupted at 12 o'clock for the taking of the motion in the name of Deputy Ruttledge about the prisoners, which would be the normal procedure.  To get over that difficulty the President has agreed that Deputy Ruttledge's motion should be taken now after the debate on this Bill has been adjourned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Ruttledge's motion were taken now, according to that suggestion, <Col N="2083" /> and decided to-night, to-morrow in Government time Deputy Fahy's motion would come on as the first opposed business. The increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill would come on in Private Members' time.  Therefore, I think that the problem for Deputy O'Connell is, unless the right to take that Bill in Private Deputies' time to-morrow is waived, the suggestion to have a discussion on Deputy Fahy's motion during the whole time to-morrow could not be carried out.</P>

      <P>As has been already pointed out, I understand, by Deputy Morrissey, we are extremely anxious that we should have a statement of the Government's attitude towards the Bill to prolong the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act before the Easter adjournment.  We are extremely anxious to have that statement, and, as has already been explained by Deputy Morrissey, we are not prepared to waive any right we have in the matter of getting that Bill in Private Deputies' time, if Deputy Ruttledge's motion is finished to-morrow.  We believe that this is a matter in which hundreds and thousands of people in this city are concerned, and they are more or less anxious to know what is the Government's policy with regard to that Increase of Rent (Restrictions) measure, in view of the fact that the time when many houses will come out of control is fast approaching.  Our attitude is that the Second Reading Stage of the Increase of Rent (Restrictions) Bill should be taken to-morrow.</P>

That is the position now. Deputy O'Connell comes along and he asks why we do not take his Bill, although the Town Tenants' Commission has been sitting and has not yet reported.  He asks us to do, and he is trying to do himself, what Fianna Fáil tells us we should not do on another matter.  In all seriousness, we cannot have it every way.  We expect that the report of the Town Tenants' Commission will come on before the Second Reading of this Bill is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with a point raised by Deputy Lemass.  It is in order to settle the question of interpretation, and it is really to provide for any new services which might arise.</P>
      <P>
        <b>Professor THRIFT</b> took the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It had no reference whatever to the order made on the 20th July last putting the Land Commission under the Ministry of Fisheries. I think it was Deputy Lemass who said he would prefer to have the Land Commission kept with the Department of Agriculture and that Department to have control of the Gaeltacht services. That matter has been dealt with by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  I hope Deputies will not take it that I am endeavouring to answer any propaganda, but there is a disposition on the part of a great number of people to speak of economies in the matter of Ministries as if it were an easy matter. The Ministry of Agriculture, which is a very important Ministry, would not be affected by having a second Minister appointed, by having, say, a Parliamentary Secretary appointed to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An expense of £1,000, or even £1,700, would be negligible in respect of services that could be rendered in that connection.  I am not stating that it would not be an exceedingly difficult thing to administer by one head a Department, portion of which should be regarded as an economic unit, and another portion which, I think it is generally admitted, is not an economic proposition.  That is the real trouble in the Gaeltacht, that it is not an economic proposition, that the conditions there are such that it is not regarded as being on a level with other parts of the country, in respect of either agriculture, industry or any other of the various activities which form its chief business or which are looked to by people as their means of support.  In that connection I may say that I was rather surprised at Deputy Aiken's contribution, <Col N="2089" /> in which he said that if the money which had been expended on the Shannon scheme had been devoted to the Gaeltacht we would have saved a very big emigration from that area.</P>
    <P>Those are two different matters altogether and they ought not to be confounded.  The necessary power for industrial activity for the whole of the country is one matter, and this problem of the Gaeltacht is entirely another matter.  It does not help matters to bring into comparison sums of money expended in other directions. As long as five or six years ago, speaking at an election in the City of Dublin, I stated that it was at that time my opinion that there would be considerable disappointment in connection with any development and any attempts at improvement which would be made by any Government in connection with the Gaeltacht.  Those who have experience of it will admit that it is a problem fraught with many complexities and with great difficulties in finding a solution. That solution will not be found by legislative action or by the most benevolent attention which any Government could give it.</P>
    <P>We are faced&mdash;no matter how good our intentions and our works are&mdash;with years of disappoinment, in my view, in connection with that and it is inevitable that it should be so.  We are not going to stop emigration by any improvement in industrial conditions down there.  By that I mean that you are not going to stop emigration immediately.  Within the last eighteen months I was down there in a place which is a particularly densely populated Irish speaking district and we had occasion to go in through a gateway.  The woman of the house had the key and after our business was done I noticed a very fine looking girl at the doorway.  I inquired from the woman of the house if she were her daughter.  She said she was and I asked her was she employed but she said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she was not looking for employment, she was going to America and she had her passage in her pocket for six months.  To a very considerable extent that is the attitude in a great many parts of the Gaeltacht and in other parts of the country also.  When coming across on the boat from New York I met a lady who informed me <Col N="2090" /> that she had engaged a cook.  I asked her what salary she was paying and she said sixty dollars a month.  That is £144 a year.  Deputies who take any interest in domestic matters know that that is far in excess of what is paid to a cook in this country and that there is a natural ambition among people who see greater opportunities in other and richer countries to get away.</P>
    <P>Our problem, and the problem of the people of this country for the next twenty or thirty years will be to endeavour to attract the young people of the country to remain in it and to see that there is a livelihood here for them which will be sufficient to keep their eyes off other countries which can afford them greater opportunities. Deputies will admit that that is by no means an easy task.  Most of the people one meets at some time or another have had their eyes on other countries where there are greater opportunities.  It was our hope when we initiated the Shannon scheme that that of itself would make some contribution towards having a greater attraction, greater possibilities, and potentialities for the young people of this country.  It may be that something better might have been done but it has been done and it is there, and the best thing, I suppose, we can do is to portray its usefulness to all sections of the community and endeavour to make the country sufficiently attractive to keep people at home.  The Ministry of Agriculture, as I have said, is concerned with agriculture as an economic proposition.  The Gaeltacht, for one reason or another, has a different character.  It does, and will, require the expenditure of considerable sums of money to make it a place in which people can live.  I think it was Deputy Tierney who drew attention to one particular paragraph of the minority reports, I think of Father Cunningham, which deserves more than passing attention.  He recommends a commission. We are not in agreement with that.  We are proposing something very much the same which would do the same work.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Commission would effect a great saving, as the Gaeltacht would in a short time become self-supporting <Col N="2091" /> and prosperous.  The recurrent poverty, destitution, and misery met with now would be prevented and those large, unremunerative relief grants with their inherent objectionableness, dispensed with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That should be our aim in connection with this matter, not to be perpetually looking for some assistance from State funds.  Assistance from State funds is requested in quite a number of services.  It is being given to many services.  It is being given to more services than is looked for or expected in other countries, more than is given in those countries to which the majority of the people of the Gaeltacht go.  It is not a sound or sensible policy that in connection with practically every service there is a criticism that there is not sufficient Government money given towards it.  All that money must come from other people. There are not many people in the country taxable for all those services we require.  The sum of £100,000 that is mentioned in connection with the Gaeltacht is only a very small percentage of the total sum that will be required in future in connection with that area.  It is not good business, in my opinion, to have the eyes of the Gaeltacht on the State for huge sums of money.  We expect, and I am sure Deputies opposite and in all parts of the House expect, some contribution locally towards the solution of the problem, and without an effort being made locally there is very little hope of solving it with money.  Money of itself will not solve it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahy is not here at the moment, and I suppose I had better not refer to a certain incident with which he is acquainted in connection with that place.  One Deputy remarked that people in the West had the same sort of boats as they had a couple of hundred years ago.  There are people who say that no other boats would live in the waters in which they fish.  If there was a disposition on the part of the people down there to go in for trawling and to operate in the same way as the Scottish, French or English fishermen, I am sure that the Ministry of Fisheries would be only too pleased to help in every possible way in the <Col N="2092" /> provision of boats, gear and machinery. But we must remember that the associations of generations are not lightly broken and that the people engaged in fishing down there are, to a very considerable extent, involved in agriculture or some other calling.  Any man in business knows that if he specialises in one particular line there is a much greater chance of success than if he had his attention directed towards two or three separate businesses. I think we might have heard an alternative proposal in connection with this matter.  I hope I am not getting out of order, but most of the discussion, I think, ranged itself around the suitability of the Minister rather than of the Ministry.  I submit we ought to be fair in connection with the criticism of the Ministry of Fisheries.  I do not think that there would be any great ambition on the part of any member of any party in this House to take on that Ministry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that really most of our trouble in this country, and a great many other countries as well, that we want more money?  The fishery business constitutes a very considerable element in the industrial progress of that region.  Ought not these things be under a single Parliamentary head or under some central control? That in a sense, is really the Government's intention with regard to this matter of the Gaeltacht.  Generally speaking, during the last few years I observed a disposition on the part of members of the House and of parties in the House to have some Minister responsible in respect of particular services. If we had a Commission, Deputies will understand the difficulty of making a Commission responsible to Parliament.  Here there is a Minister who is concerned with the industries which are peculiar to and inseparable from the Gaeltacht.  One need not go very far into Connemara to see that the land question is a very important item in the West and that it is a wonder that they have managed to eke out an existence on the small holdings they have got.  Even a very cursory perusal of the report will satisfy one that these <Col N="2093" /> big migration schemes have not appealed to people who have a very close association with the Gaeltacht.  I think it was Father Cunningham who expressed himself as not being at all satisfied that that was a likely way to do any useful work down there.</P>
      <P>Broadly, the Government's intention is to give effect to those recommendations which they are prepared to adopt in the following manner:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Each Department will pursue the policy laid down for its guidance in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister for Lands and Fisheries will act as the co-ordinating authority for all services in the Gaeltacht bearing on the economic development of the districts. He will at the same time arrange to keep in touch with those activities of other Departments (e.g., housing, health, agricultural instruction, etc.) which directly bear on the economic life of the districts.</P>
      <P>A conference of heads of Departments has been held and has reported to the Government on the manner in which effect should be given to various recommendations regarding the staffs of Departments working in the Gaeltacht. This Conference has also reported to the Minister on the steps to be taken for securing the co-ordination of activity in the various Departments. A Standing Committee of principal officers of these Departments will shortly be set up to meet periodically under the presidency of the Minister for Fisheries or the Parliamentary Secretary to discuss schemes of proposals for development of the Gaeltacht.  Regarding the recommendations of the Coimisiún na Gaeltachta for the carrying out of which his Department has special responsibility, he has taken action on most of the matters on which the White Paper indicates agreement with the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill to provide for compulsory inspection and branding of mackerel is now in preparation (Recommendation 68).  Sanction has been obtained for State grants towards the construction and repair of several small harbour works (Recommendation 69) and proposals have been submitted for larger harbour improvements at places like <Col N="2094" /> Buncrana, Rathmullan and Cahirciveen. Negotiations are in progress for setting up a kelp factory in the Saorstát (Recommendation 70).  A scheme for restoring the homespun tweed industry in Donegal has been prepared and is at present under consideration by the Finance Department.  This scheme embraces the instruction of weavers, introduction of improved looms, state inspection of cloth, and the setting up of a carding and dyeing mill (Recommendations 71, 72, 73).</P>
    <P>Preliminary investigations are proceeding having for their object the improvement of marketing of the products of our rural industries by means of centralised selling (Recommendation 74).  The Minister is in communication with the Minister for Education as to steps to be taken to set up such a fishery school for the training of deep sea fishermen as has been recommended by the Commission on Technical Education (Recommendation 64).</P>
    <P>These are some of the activities, in addition to the proposals in the Bill, for dealing with the Gaeltacht.  In a nutshell, the objection to these proposals is that it is the Department of Fisheries that is concerned in them.  As I have said, in all fairness, it was the Department which lent itself, by reason of the unfortunate conditions of fishing during the last few years, perhaps to most criticism, but it must, and ought to be, whatever Ministry it would be attached to, the one that is in closest association with the districts in question. The Department of Fisheries is the one certainly that is most closely identified with the work of the Gaeltacht. I do not propose to say anything about the motion of Deputy Fahy, because I find from the Report that I was to arrange a date for its discussion, but certainly that is not my recollection of what I said.  When we resume after the Easter recess I will endeavour to find time for the motion.</P>

There have been quite a number of houses built under the Housing Facilities Acts in various parts of the Gaeltacht.  There are other portions in which the conditions attaching to the Housing Facilities Acts would be utterly unsuitable.  That would be a matter that would be discussed with the Department of Local Government, and that Department, having been concerned mainly with the problem in places where the present scheme is suitable, would have representations made by the Minister for Fisheries for an entirely different scheme in respect of the areas where there was very little chance of the same proportion of money being put up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I wished to raise on the adjournment the question of the position of the area in Co. Wexford where foot and mouth disease exists.  It is now 8 o'clock, and I have not had an opportunity of consulting with my colleagues from the constituency.  I imagine that they will also wish to speak on the matter, and I would like, if possible, to give them sufficient time.  Perhaps if it is convenient the adjournment might be moved now in order to give more than half an hour for a discussion on the matter which, I think, is of general importance.</P>

      <P>The general practice that has obtained is that when the adjournment is moved, unless there is some agreement about it, earlier than the hour fixed ordinarily for the adjournment, the Deputy who has given notice, and any other Deputies who wish to speak, get half an hour between them, and the Minister then replies.  But I take it that on this particular topic, which is of importance, the discussion may go on until 9 o'clock, giving the Minister adequate time to reply before 9 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies from other constituencies have only got to imagine the situation which would arise in those constituencies if such a calamity took place there as has taken place in County Wexford within the last two months, in order to understand the anxiety that my colleagues from the County Wexford feel on the present position in the south of that county as a result of the imposition of the restrictions consequent upon that outbreak.  I have raised this matter to-night because of the fact that the Minister has not yet made any statement since the fresh outbreak which occurred last week.  The people in the district, who are suffering very considerable loss, and who are faced with <Col N="2099" /> the prospect of still further loss during the next month, or possibly two months, are not aware that the Government is showing any particular sympathy with them in the plight in which they find themselves to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister is, no doubt, doing what he thinks is best and as much as he can, but certainly the people in the district are not aware of what he is doing.  It is more to give him an opportunity of stating exactly the position that I raise this matter to-night.  He stated yesterday in his speech on the Bill which has been under discussion to-day that the Gaeltacht was entitled to special consideration, and it was generally agreed on all sides that that is the case.  I wonder if the Minister is not prepared to admit that the district which is now suffering the losses imposed upon it in the interests of the whole community is not also entitled to special consideration from his Department and from the Government. During the last couple of days some alleviation has been given by a relaxation of the regulations which permit the slaughter of cattle in the affected area.  That alleviation, however, does not in any way assist the owners of store cattle, and it so happens that that area of the County Wexford is more interested in store cattle than other parts of the county or, probably, most parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would say if it is his opinion that nothing possible can be done for the owners of store cattle in that area and that they must look forward to a definite dead loss without any prospect of alleviation. The Minister is very well aware that the farmers and the people in the area which we are discussing are very hardworking, thrifty and conscientious. They certainly are not asking anything in the nature of charity from the Government, but it is felt that the Minister and his Department in this crisis should take the people of the district into their confidence and help them to formulate suggestions with a view to alleviating the situation.  I think that is a very small request, and one which the Minister should accede to.  He could help them particularly <Col N="2100" /> by telling them the schemes or suggestions that are feasible and the ones that are not feasible in the present circumstances, and what the Government would be prepared to do in order to help them out of their difficulty.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of discussion as to what part the Agricultural Credit Corporation should play in any such alleviation.  I fully admit that the Corporation was not designed in order to meet a crisis of this kind.  It was established as a banking institution on a strictly business basis, and there was no suggestion that it was intended that it should be used for the purpose of alleviating exceptional or extraordinary circumstances such as exist in South County Wexford to-day.  At the same time, I notice that there is nothing in the Act establishing that Corporation which would prevent the machinery of it being used in order to assist these farmers in the exceptional circumstances in which they find themselves to-day.  There is nothing in the Act to prevent the Corporation giving special consideration to an area which has been specially hit through no fault of the farmers in that district. It could be given particularly in the way of providing credits for the acquisition of food stuffs, and also in the sense that the Credit Corporation should expedite its activities in that area.</P>
    <P>There is one rather interesting development which I am sure members of the Fianna Fáil Party will appreciate as a result of this outbreak.  It is that the Farmers' Party have been converted not only to Protection, but to the theory of Deputy de Valera with regard to the prohibition of imports. That is a result which, I am sure, gives satisfaction to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  But, seriously, I think there is room for a more helpful and more sympathetic attitude from the point of view of the Government and of the Department of Agriculture in dealing with this matter.  I hope the Minister will adopt the suggestion made to him by Deputy Corish that some high official of his Department or that he himself would go to the area in order to work out what is feasible in the way of schemes for alleviating the <Col N="2101" /> situation.  The prospects, as far as the farmers in the area are concerned, indicate a very lean time between now and the harvest, and probably, no matter what happens, for a year or two more. I hope the Minister will give his earnest consideration to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add a few words to what has been said by Deputy Esmonde in connection with this outbreak of foot and mouth disease in my constituency.  As Deputy Esmonde has pointed out, a great deal more than what has been done by the Minister requires to be done.  Certainly one must appreciate the action taken by the Minister and officials of his Department in connection with the outbreak and the measures they have adopted in order to prevent its spread.  I would like to say that, so far as the Civic Guards and the officials of the Department of Agriculture are concerned, they have certainly acted in an admirable manner.  But as Deputy Esmonde has pointed out, the position of the farmers in this area during the past eight weeks has been an unenviable one.  They are faced, in many cases, with privation and with the fact that they do not know what is going to happen next, as well as with the fact that the disease might spread still further. They are in a dilemma, and I believe it is absolutely necessary for the Minister himself or at least a very high official of his Department to go to Wexford at once with a view to conferring with the people and of seeing what are their actual needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hears on all sides of the great hardship that prevails and of the uncertainty of the position.  The uncertainty that prevails in that particular area is doing more harm than the actual disease itself.  One wonders if anything can be done to lessen the restrictions in view of the fact that the particular part of the district where the last outbreak occurred might be styled a peninsula. It is practically isolated from the rest of the County Wexford by reason of the fact that it is almost entirely surrounded by water.  Perhaps something could be done to lessen the area of the restrictions, or the period that the restrictions are to be left on.  Deputy Esmonde spoke of the Agricultural <Col N="2102" /> Credit Corporation.  In this connection a great many inquiries are being made by the farmers affected by the restrictions as to what they are entitled to. I would earnestly ask that the Minister himself, if possible, would go to Wexford within the next few days and confer with representative bodies and farmers with a view to finding out what can be done in order to remedy the unfortunate situation with which they are confronted.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the urban population, of course they are not directly affected, but the town of Wexford especially has been very badly hit.  There has been no fair held in Wexford town since the 3rd February and there is no prospect that one will be held in April.  That is a serious matter for a town like Wexford. Enniscorthy and Gorey have been lucky to the extent that they had one fair when the restrictions were, to some extent taken off.  Wexford town has been badly hit.  I suggest when the Minister comes down, as I hope he will, that he should confer with representative people, as apart from the farmers, who have the interests of the farmers and the general community at heart.  I think it is not too much to ask that the Minister, or one of his high officials, should go down and find out the actual position.  As I have said, we are  complaining of what has been done, but in view of the hardships that exist and the uncertainty that prevails I would appeal with Deputy Esmonde that something would be done immediately to alleviate the distress which there undoubtedly is in that particular area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Corish in the appeal that something should be done to alleviate the sufferings of these people in Wexford.  There are some small points that I think could be smoothed over in some way.  Perhaps if the Minister will act on the suggestion that he should go down himself or send some responsible member of his Department to investigate matters on the spot.  I have been told, for instance, by people who live in the villages and in the town of Wexford, and who keep one or two cows, that they are in a desperate way as regards the shortage of hay and straw.  In that <Col N="2103" /> area the supply of hay is running short, and hay and straw cannot be imported. Something should be done for these people.  It would help if they could send their cows to a farmer who would be prepared to take them for the time being.  As occurs sometimes, there are farmers with their buildings on one side of the road and the farms on the other side.  They are compelled to keep their cattle housed, because they cannot cross the road with them if they wanted to bring them across at night. Then there are the people, with whom the Minister would have sympathy, who went in a good deal for rearing premium cattle and spent a good deal of money&mdash;it might be called capital expenditure&mdash;in getting good premium stock, and who expected to reap the benefit of their capital outlay by selling their young bulls at the show in Dublin. They failed in that and are now badly off.  I think it would be possible for the Department to give these people something in advance on the prices that will be got for these bulls when they are sold, as they undoubtedly will be, to enable them to carry on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Esmonde has said, the principal industry of the farmers in that area is the rearing of store cattle. These were sold mostly in March and some in April.  The farmer, as a rule, had only enough of feeding stuff to carry him into March.  Now he finds the food running short and he cannot dispose of his cattle.  Also, of course, he is running short of money because he cannot sell the cattle, and he has to pay rates, etc.  He has not the money to do that.  I think if the County Council were enabled not to press for these rates, and were empowered to get an overdraft for the present, it would be a relief.  The annuities will be due also, and perhaps the same thing would apply to them, and that there will be no pressure for payment, so that they would be given a chance to carry on. There may be in the Minister's mind the question of legal obligation and that he cannot relieve the people from the payment of their rates or annuities. I think some way should be found out of the difficulties that exist.  There is the difficulty of getting rid of the stock. The people cannot import feeding <Col N="2104" /> stuffs, while hay and straw are running short, and in any case they have not the money to pay for feeding stuffs.  The same would apply to farmers who want to buy seeds and manures.  The question arises: how are they going to get credit?  I understand from the Chairman of the Agricultural Credit Society that his organisation would be prepared to come as quickly as possible to the assistance of those people.  But, as we know, that corporation would want certain securities, and, though they will do their best to meet the situation, they cannot be able to meet it in all cases. It may be necessary to deal with it as an emergency situation and in a special manner.  I therefore appeal to the Minister, with Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Corish, to come down himself or send down one of his officials.  I think I can promise him he would have the support and co-operation of all parties represented here in anything he might do towards relieving the desperate conditions of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the appeal made by the Deputies who have just spoken to the Minister to visit the area may be said to be already met, as I understand the Minister has promised to go there. One point I think he has missed in connection with this matter, and that is the supply of fodder, especially hay.  Foodstuffs can be rather easily procured if there is money, but hay at this time of the year is a very scarce commodity. If it is left to the individual farmer in Wexford to get supplies now when he is run out, he will find it a very difficult proposition.  In this connection I suggest to the Ministry that perhaps the most beneficial way they could help would be to try to organise supplies for Wexford from other parts of the country.  That could be done through the county instructors.  From now on to the first week in May hay will be very scarce.  Many farmers have cattle they are not able to keep for want of hay.  This year hay is very scarce, and most of it is not good.  I think very material help could be given in this way.  On the question of feeding stuffs, the supply of roots would be a difficulty. Beet is not available, and pulp is out of the question.  If it is possible an effort should be made to organise <Col N="2105" /> the supply of roots.  There is also the question of killing facilities.  I do not know, but I suppose they have sufficient killing facilities in the area.  A body of farmers appointed by the Farmers' Congress met the Minister to-day with regard to shutting out accepted sources of infection.  There are some accepted sources of infection coming into the country, and it is well recognised that chilled meat is one of these sources. Any sacrifice which is necessary to stamp out this national calamity I think the whole State should be prepared to make.  It is not a matter for Wexford. It is Wexford to-day, but it may be any other part to-morrow. It is a national question, and any sacrifice that is necessary to be made, I am sure the State will be ready to make it. I do not want to suggest for a moment that the outbreak was not a natural one, but there is the possibility that other places interested, with unlimited money resources, could have been the means of deliberately planting the infection. That was hinted at in connection with previous outbreaks, when we heard about suspicious characters being seen going around.  I do not know whether suspicious characters have been seen around Wexford.  It is impossible to put in-fed cattle out on grass.  They will have to be killed direct from the stalls or there will be tremendous loss.  That is the reason I want to stress the desirability of organising a supply of fodder, especially hay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the appeal made to the Minister to come to the rescue of the people down in Wexford who are affected by this outbreak.  As a farmer coming from the infected area I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way he has handled the outbreak from the very start.  He has not alone brought credit on himself, but he has set a headline to the people of other countries who have not been able to cope with the disease in the efficient manner that he has.  I should also like to say a word in praise of the Civic Guard, who helped in every way possible to have the regulations complied with.  The farmers also deserve the congratulations of the people for the <Col N="2106" /> manner in which they have risen to the occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. JORDAN Mr. JORDAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JORDAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister could see his way to come down to Wexford to consult with the people there.  If he cannot come himself, he should send one of his officials, and Deputies of every party from Wexford would be only too glad to meet him or one of his officials and give any help they can in order to be of some assistance to the people.  Certain complaints have been made to me about the restricted area.  According to the regulations the restrictions apply to the police area.  As a result of that, a man living seventeen or eighteen miles away from the affected area may be held up, whilst other people, living within fifteen miles of the area, are not restricted.  That is due to the irregularity of the police area.  I consulted with the Minister about that and he informed me that the limit would be reduced to ten miles, and that it would not require to be dealt with, but it did create great hardship for the time being.  There was another unfortunate thing that I am sorry to have to refer to, and that is that some local firms have taken advantage of the crisis in connection with the purchase of stock from farmers.  I do not want to mention names, but it is a matter that deserves ventilation.  It is not to the credit of these people that they should take advantage of the unfortunate people.  I do not suppose any Deputies can form any idea of the plight of the people in the affected area except those who make their living from farming.  It is really pitiable to enter a man's place and see forty or fifty cattle without anything to eat.  So long as the restrictions are on these cattle cannot be moved.  In the case of fat stock, I was glad to hear the Minister say that he was making provision to have the stock sent direct to the factory to be slaughtered.  That would be a great relief.  But in the case of stores, feeding has run out with most people, and the only feeding stuff they can provide is what they can buy in the town.  Unfortunately, they have no money to purchase it, and I appeal <Col N="2107" /> to the Minister to speed up the machinery of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in order to come to the aid of the people and lend them some money to tide over the present crisis. That is really the important thing.  So far as the rates are concerned, I think we can nearly guarantee that the county council will not press the people for them.  I want to appeal, however, in case there may be any prosecution pending by the Land Commission for unpaid annuities, that they should be stayed until the crisis passes.  It would not be fair to press the people, who find it very difficult to struggle on at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to associate myself with the views expressed in connection with this calamity.  This is not only a matter for the Co. Wexford but for the farmers of Ireland. The sympathy of the farmers of Ireland goes out to those in Co. Wexford.  We realise that the efforts which have been made to wipe out this disease are not only in the interests of the farmers there, but of all the farmers in the Free State, and therefore we are prepared to recommend and accept responsibility for the recommendation of any measure which may be necessary to relieve farmers in that area, and to bear the responsibility, financially or otherwise, which may accrue, because of any efforts which may be taken in that direction.  I also want to join in the appreciation expressed here of the work of the Department officials.  We feel that the efforts made by the Department and its officials could not be excelled, and it is only right that we should give expression to that feeling and say that we believe the suppression of the disease is due to the prompt action taken by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey touched the kernel of the situation, and that is the provision of feeding stuffs for the farmers who have been obliged to retain stock which otherwise would have been disposed of by now.  It seems to me that the provision of feeding stuffs alone is not the solution of the problem, unless at the same time we provide means whereby the farmers can purchase the feeding stuffs.  I do not want to try to elaborate <Col N="2108" /> a plan, or put a plan before the Minister as to what should be done, but on examination of all sides of the case, it seems to me that the suggestion put forward by Deputy Esmonde is the right one, that the Agricultural Credit Corporation might be used to relieve, to some extent, the difficulties existing, and that special efforts might be made to get a representative of that Corporation into the area for the purpose of placing money at the disposal of the farmers who need it.  In my opinion it would be better that the farmers who find it difficult or impossible to pay rates and land annuities should be provided, by means of Government credit of that class, rather than that a measure like a moratorium should be adopted.  I think it would be in the financial interest of the State that the provision should be of that kind rather than not having any legal obligation to pay their way.  I really think the best suggestion is the one already put forward, that some responsible representative should be sent down for the purpose alone of examining into the economic situation and the possibility of relieving the people who need it.  Doubtless that examination has taken place in a cursory fashion, but the officials there are primarily for the purpose of suppressing the disease and not for the purpose of inquiring into the economic situation which has arisen out of the disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. ALLEN Mr. ALLEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALLEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add a few words to what has been already said.  There is one view-point that I would stress and that is the condition of people who cannot drive their cattle across the road.  They may live on one side of the road and they may have land on the other side.  As has been pointed out this is an area in which there is a lot of store cattle.  In the usual course of events they would be sold in March.  There are people who have store cattle and who cannot get hay for them.  They have to carry water to them every day.  In the towns it is much worse.  In Gorey, people cannot let the cattle out and some of these people have no yards at all.  Imagine the state of the people in the town of Wexford who have large dairies and cannot let the cows out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> There is another matter and that is the matter of credit.  Deputy Gorey said this is a matter for the State.  The State up to this has not borne any of the brunt of what the people of Wexford have borne.  I think it is up to the State to come to the relief of the people in the affected areas by some means of credit or otherwise.  I doubt very much if the Credit Corporation is capable of dealing with the matter effectively.  It is no doubt an emergency case and emergency measures are needed to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a question or two.  Has the Minister made any inquiries as to the cause of the outbreak and if so what is the result?  What was the cause of the original outbreak five or six weeks ago? My information is that friends of some people in the area, in the habit of passing over from infected areas in England were not disinfected at the Port. I would like to know if that is the case. Generally those engaged in the cattle trade are subjected to a great system of disinfection; their clothes are disinfected, but those who are not engaged in the cattle trade are allowed to pass without any disinfection process.  As far as I understand it that has been going on all through the winter.  It would be well to know if that is so.  I saw in the papers last Saturday a report that the inspectors visited the infected farm about a week ago.  I expect the inspectors should be disinfected on leaving the infected areas. Was there any connection between the case of the original outbreak and the recent one?  It may be possible that inspectors themselves did not take sufficient precautions.  It would be well if the Minister would give some indication upon the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephGorry" hpid="Mr. P. GORRY Mr. P. GORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. GORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I would make a suggestion with regard to the supply of feeding stuffs in the infected area.  I think the farmers as a whole do appreciate the necessary restrictions placed round the area and that it was to the benefit of the whole country that that was done and done efficiently.  Following up Deputy Gorey's point as regards the shortage of feeding-stuffs I think it would not be too much to ask the Railway Company who in <Col N="2110" /> normal times draws a large amount of its income from freightage on cattle to come to the help of the farmers of Wexford by reducing freights from the areas where there are abundant supplies of roots and hay.  Perhaps there are not sufficient hay and roots in carting districts in the area.  Districts thirty or forty miles away might be able to organise supplies.  I make that suggestion and possibly it could be made use of.  I am sure Railway Officials would meet the Department if the suggestion was put up to them.</P>

      <P>There is, of course, no doubt about it that it was a misfortune that the outbreak should have occurred at all, and it was a real misfortune that it should have been followed by a second outbreak.  In a situation like this the important thing, from the point of view of everyone in the country, is not to make it worse than it really is.  I say, frankly, nobody has made it worse than it really is.  Certainly the farmers of Wexford have acted very well.  They bore the direct brunt of the restrictions; they have on the whole admirably complied with the restrictions and regulations made by the Department of Agriculture. It is also a fact that the public generally, the farmers in the rest of the country generally, and people with interest in it of one kind or another, acted very well in the whole matter. But remember it is now five or six weeks since the first outbreak in Wexford. I had hoped that it would be the only outbreak, but at the end of the five weeks period we had a second outbreak. You can never be certain of when foot and mouth disease is going to end, but I confidently anticipate that we will be able to control this outbreak, and from that point of view it is rather reassuring that the second outbreak should have taken place within a few miles of the first and within the restricted area.  That means that in the last five or six weeks there was no free movement of cattle in the area, and consequently there is very little likelihood that the infection, wherever it is within the area, has been carried outside it.  It is not possible at this stage, without being rather rash, <Col N="2111" /> to prophesy where it is just going to end.  We will be very lucky if this is the last outbreak, as we confidently hope it is; we will be much luckier than they have been in England.  From that point of view we have to remember what the English farmers have gone through.  For the last five or six years they have had constant outbreaks.  It is very much harder to control the disease there than here.  Cattle are being imported every year into England. There is constant movement of cattle across the country, and it is much harder, in a populous country like England, where there is constant movement of cattle, to control foot and mouth disease than here.  They have had it for five or six years, and they have lost millions and millions of pounds in direct losses, while their indirect losses must have been something enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are standing up to it in great style.  And we ought to remember that here in this country if we are to continue the policy of stamping out foot and mouth disease and keeping a clean bill of health&mdash;and I think there can be no question about it that there can be no other policy&mdash;we must have a very serious dislocation of trade whenever an outbreak does occur.  We can have only one consolation, that it will be temporary.  We must remember that there must be a point of view everywhere in the State in regard to this question.  When these outbreaks occur they will occur here to-day and there to-morrow.  But where they occur and when they occur the people concerned are inevitably going to suffer hardships which, no matter what the State does, they cannot be fully compensated for. That does appear to have been the point of view of the Wexford farmers concerned, and I appeal to the Wexford farmers and Deputies generally to take things coolly and quietly in this matter and not say or do anything that would make the situation anything more difficult than it is.  There are certain things that can be done when an outbreak of foot and mouth disease occurs. It is absolutely essential to delimit the area.  And remember when we come to consider what area we will delimit for <Col N="2112" /> the purpose of the restrictions, we have to take into account not only the point of view of the farmers concerned and the Irish Department, but also the point of view of the Department of Agriculture in the country to which we send our stock.  That happens to be England. We must take such measures as will convince sensible men who have technical knowledge of the subject that we are dealing with it in such a way that we know our business and that we are taking steps that prudent people should take to stamp out the outbreak.  If we do take those steps my experience is that we will be met half way.  And we were certainly met half way for no other reason than this&mdash;that I believe the point of view in the Ministry in England was that the steps we had taken were adequate, and that consequently they could agree to make the concessions which they made, for the first time I think, in the matter of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>In connection with the point that Deputy Jordan has made about the fifteen mile limit, that was usually the limit which you drew round an area where an outbreak of foot and mouth disease had occurred.  You cannot simply run a line round an area from the centre of it and keep to the circle. You cannot do that.  You must have regard to the administrative units in that area.  You must have regard to other circumstances, and you must include the particular areas which can be most usefully and efficiently administered. And there is no doubt that from that point of view the police areas were the most convenient, because the police have a lot to do with any regulations that are made, and they see that these are carried out&mdash; the police as well as the officers of the Department of Agriculture.  There are cases where the police area runs out beyond the fifteen mile limit, where it runs out from a centre perhaps eighteen miles.  The man who is living outside that fifteen mile limit and inside the eighteen mile limit thinks he is unfortunate.  Yes, he is.  He is unlucky. It is his chance.  He has reason to regret that he was not living in the area outside this limit that was being drawn.  But he has to take his chance. But we cannot, for the sake of <Col N="2113" /> uniformity or in order to have an exact fifteen mile radius, cut the top off a police area and try to administer that separately.  We could not do that, and it would not be worth while.  Because, remember, the best service we can do to the farmers of Wexford is to stamp out this disease as quickly as possible. Any restrictions which could possibly be imposed by the Department of Agriculture within this area, no matter how onerous, would be of no consequence as compared with, say, an additional month's or week's restrictions, if you like, due to a lack of efficiency in the beginning.  That is my view.  The best service we can do to the farmers of Wexford and to the farmers of this country is to take whatever measures are necessary to stamp out the disease in the shortest possible time.  For that reason I appeal to the farmers to continue to do what they have been doing, and to report at once any suspicious cases, any cases where there is even the slightest doubt that it may be a case of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>We have to draw this line.  We have to make certain restrictions within this area.  There is no free movement of cattle and free trade there, and there is practically no export trade.  Various problems arise, the problems of getting fodder into the restricted area and moving the stock about.  We cannot allow stock to be moved freely through the roads.  We cannot allow hay and straw to be moved freely and without inspection.  But I think we have met that case; the removal of hay and straw within the area is possible.  Hay and straw can be moved by licence, and there are five or six licensing centres where licences can be got.  We have arranged with the Gárdaí to give these licences.  Licences can be got freely for the removal of hay and straw.</P>
    <P>There is another problem where hay and straw has to be brought in.  The same applies to the stock.  Licences can be got, and got quite freely, for the removal of stock.  Of course, before such licences are given the Department's inspector inspects the place and sees whether it is necessary to move the stock.  But where a good case can be made we meet the farmers.  Sometimes it is necessary to remove the stock in <Col N="2114" /> one farm to the other side of the road for water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You never have it where you want it.  Where you have stock in one field and where the farmer wants to get that stock removed across the road to his other fields, a licence can be got.  I think, therefore, the position with regard to the movement of stock and the removal of fodder within the area has been met.  We could not go further than that.  We could not have free movement of stock and fodder where the foot and mouth disease exists, or in an area where the disease may be existing at any point&mdash; because you must assume that it may exist at any point&mdash;if we put on restrictions, therefore, there is no point in putting restrictions at all in the areas if you allow free movements of hay and straw.  Consequently we met that point by allowing the movement of hay and straw and the minimum inconvenience is being caused there.</P>

      <P>I want to clear up one point.  A great deal of the complaints I got were that people who wanted to put their cows across the road could not do so.  I do not know would it be allowed now.  I do not think it was allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that it would be allowed where necessary.  We have power to allow it where necessary. I could imagine a case where a person made such an application and was refused, but the inspector would call later at the place and see what accommodation could be given.  He would see what lands the man had on <Col N="2115" /> the near side of the road on which his house was, and that inspector would probably come to the conclusion that there was ample accommodation there, and plenty of grass there for another week, and in that case he would not give a licence for a week.  There are cases where they refuse licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the inspector on the spot power to give the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  If he has not power, the man at headquarters has power, and he sends the licence. There are five or six inspectors there. That is with regard to the movement of hay and straw within the area.  Then there is the question of fat cattle.  Of course, it was particularly unfortunate that this outbreak should have occurred at this time and that it should have occurred in Wexford, because Wexford is one of the districts which supplies a lot of fat cattle.  It was particularly hard on them.  The cattle have been in the stall and are being fattened.  Some of them must be well finished now.  They have been in the stall for some weeks longer perhaps than they otherwise would. We have succeeded in making arrangements under which even within the restricted area cattle may be sent to Wexford, to the dead-meat factory, to be slaughtered and exported as dead meat from there.  There is no possible chance whatsoever that the British Minister for Agriculture would accept fat stock on the hoof or store stock from the area.  It would be unreasonable to ask him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreed all round.  Therefore, the only thing you can do is to make arrangements, if you can make arrangements, that they will take it as dead meat&mdash;on these conditions, that there is to be a post-mortem and an ante-mortem inspection, which they have agreed to carry out.  That will go a long way to meet the case of the farmers who have fat cattle.  They will not, I admit, get the prices which they would get if they had a free market. There would be a difficulty in dealing with hides and offals at the moment, and there will be other difficulties. <Col N="2116" /> The farmers will not get the price.  But this concession about the fat cattle will be an easing of the present position.  I think the dead-meat factory can handle from thirty to fifty fat cattle a day, practically as many as they can get, and this particular concession which has been agreed on will, to a very considerable extent, relieve the situation so far as the fat cattle are concerned.  When you come to the stores, what can be done?  Stores cannot be taken outside the area.  They are not fit to kill, therefore they must be kept there.</P>
      <P>I do not think the question of stores is as serious as the question of fat cattle.  What can we do?  I do not see that we can do much; in any event we are not so very far off the grass season, and all you want for stores is hay.  You do not want meals unless you want to keep fat cattle going on.  For stores all you want is hay.  I daresay there is a shortage of hay at the moment, but I wonder is it as big as people say.  There is the question of bringing hay and roots and fodder generally and making arrangements with the railway companies. You can get hay and roots, but you can only get them at a price.  I suppose there would be hay and roots in other parts of the country and they could be brought in.  Of course there is not a lot at this time of the year, but if the price was big enough they would be sent in, and it is a question for the farmer to consider whether it is worth buying hay and roots, except the minimum absolutely necessary, at the price that would be paid at this time of the year.  I do not think you would do much good by going to the railway company and getting concessions in regard to freight because I imagine the amount of roots that would come in would be infinitesimal.  I believe that if 95 per cent. of the farmers could get roots brought in at 1/- a ton it would not be worth their while to get them. It is the price that counts, and unless you come down to the question of subsidising the importation of hay and roots I do not think it makes very much difference about the freights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes down to a matter of brass tacks, the farmer who can just carry on without buying anything more <Col N="2117" /> than the minimum of roots and who can go on without borrowing money will come out of it best.  I daresay some farmers will have to borrow.  Most farmers, if they have stock in the stalls&mdash;if they can stall&mdash;can get a certain amount of credit for meals and household needs, and so on.  If the whole thing is measured up, you may have many farmers trying to get credits who really do not want an awful lot of credits.  The very worst service you could do the farmers there is to give the impression that the thing to do was to use this particular opportunity for the purpose of getting more credits than would be necessary under ordinary circumstances. The farmers there will lose money in any event; they will lose money because of this misfortune.  On the other hand, whatever credits they will get they will have to pay back sometime, and the day will come when they will regret that they availed of money which came quite easily and which they have to pay back.  I ask Deputies not to press that point too hard.  On the other hand, if they want money the Agricultural Credit Corporation is there.</P>
    <P>I saw something in the paper from the Secretary suggesting that the farmers there now see that it is important to consider the question of forming some guarantee society for the purpose of getting money to tide over this particular crisis.  I think that is an excellent idea.  Within a narrow area you are bound to have a certain number of farmers who want assistance and if they could only come together and form that society they could get money.  I think it would be money very well spent because the farmers would have the giving of it and they would have to pay it back.  The worst turn you could do the farmers in that district would be to give them the impression that because of this misfortune easy money was going, and it would be wrong to say or do anything that would make them forget that whatever money they would get would have to be paid back some day.  If they have not to pay it back you have to come to a State subsidy, and if the State is to subsidise, not the direct but the indirect consequences of foot and mouth disease, then we must <Col N="2118" /> give up our policy.  It would be too expensive.  There are things you cannot guard against and there are times when you must take your chance.  The farmers in that area must take their chance now.  It possibly is a disadvantage to be there now, but perhaps they will reap the advantage at another time of being in that area.  It really comes down to that.  Life is hard.</P>
    <P>The arrangement about fat cattle to be licensed for slaughter in Wexford does not apply within two miles of the outbreak&mdash;an area within two miles of the outbreak.  Deputy Jordan mentioned a point about firms down there taking advantage of this situation to give a cheaper price than the market price for cattle, sheep, pigs or whatever they are buying.  They should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. Further, we have asked firms there to quote their prices to us so that we will try to check them.  I do not know if there are any firms trying to take advantage of this situation to make money at the expense of the unfortunate farmers who are suffering from the restrictions, but if there are they ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves and the farmers in Wexford should remember those firms when all this trouble is over.  This has been referred to as a calamity.  It is a calamity because you have not free export owing to an outbreak in one small area in this country; you have not free export to our principal market in England.  I ask Deputies to turn that over in their minds and to remember that the real lesson to be drawn from that is that we cannot afford to ignore that market until we have got a better.</P>

On the other hand, I can undertake if this thing goes on, if it continues, and if there is no sign of alleviation, to go there.  I would consider it my duty to do so, if I could gain anything, and I think I could, by going to Wexford and seeing the situation there, and I intend to do so at the first opportunity. I have tried to explain as well as I could what the State can do and cannot do, and in answer to the people who suggested that it should be a matter for the senior officers of the Department, and the Minister concerned, I say that the senior officers have been there and will go there, and I intend to go to Wexford at the first opportunity to investigate the situation on the spot.</P>
