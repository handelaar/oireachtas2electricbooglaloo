      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether overtime payment is being refused to members of the prison staff; whether in pre-Treaty days the staff were paid overtime as a matter of course; further, how many prison officers have applied for permission to retire under Article X. of the Treaty and have been refused; and whether compensation will be paid in the case of officers retained against their will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of the General Prisons Board in dealing with claims for overtime worked by prison warders has not been altered since the transfer of Government. When overtime is worked on escort or other special duty, payment is made in respect thereof unless time off in lieu is allowed.  In former years it was more difficult to arrange for the grant of equivalent leave than it is at present, but such equivalent leave was always granted when possible.  This practice will continue to be followed.</P>
      <P>Seven prison officers now serving were refused permission to retire under Article X. of the Treaty.  This decision was based on the grounds that they were not entitled to any compensation under that Article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>The lands referred to are the holding of the late John Ralph in the townland of Rathbrane, on the estate of Miss Denis, County Wicklow, which is being dealt with under the Land Act, 1923, and a parcel of untenanted land comprising 13a. 3r. 11p. of Goldenfort, allotted to him as additional land by the Land Commission on the estate acquired by them from Captain M.C. Saunders.  After the death of Mr. Ralph his widow applied to the Land Commission for permission to sell the holding and the parcel of untenanted land as she was 60 years of age and unable to work the lands, and the Commissioners on consideration of the circumstances gave permission, provided the entire lands were sold in one lot to a suitable purchaser. In September last Mrs. Ralph's solicitor informed the Commissioners that it had been found impossible to sell the lands in one lot, but that a Mr. Martin Mullins was willing to purchase the holding in Rathbrane and Mr. Peter Douglas the parcel in Goldenfort.  Mr. Douglas occupies lands adjoining this parcel, and the Commissioners agreed to the proposed sales, and deeds of assignment have since been lodged ratifying the purchases.  The Land Commission have not refused to answer inquiries as regards the matter.  The position was explained fully to the Deputy when he called at the Land Commission in the autumn, and also in a letter which was addressed to him on the 21st instant.  The consent given in this case is not in conflict with the spirit of the Land Act, and I am satisfied that it was a proper one to give.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recollect that, before the adjournment last night, I was endeavouring to establish that the management by the Government of the subsidy for the growing of beet sugar was such as to show considerable inefficiency on their part.  I pointed out that, when the Bill was before the House, the Government supplied the Deputies present with totally wrong information as to the probable total output of the factory during the ten years during which the subsidy would <Col N="373" /> run, and also as to the amount of subsidy which the State would have to pay. Deputy Derrig pointed out that, as a result of the subsidy, the owners of the factory are making very substantial profits, that they have written off in their first year 10 per cent. of the capital valuation of the plant and machinery, and have also secured a 10 per cent. dividend for themselves, and that it is very obvious that at the end of the ten years during which the subsidy is to run the owners of the factory will not merely have completely cleared off their capital liability but will have netted, in addition, a very considerable sum of money as profits.  They will then still have the factory on their hands and will, I submit, be subject to a strong inducement to close down, to net their gains, and to leave the beet-growing industry in this country in exactly the same position as it was before the subsidy was granted.  The factory during last year made a gross profit of £114,000.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that a smaller subsidy could have produced exactly the same result that the subsidy now being given has produced.  I think there would have been little difficulty in getting capital invested in that enterprise, even if the reward offered was less than the 10 per cent. which has been secured.  During a debate upon a similar Supplementary Estimate last year, the Minister for Finance stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The people who were to undertake the erection of the factory were desirous of getting Irish capital for many reasons.  They wished to have people who were connected with the country and who would be of assistance to them in dealing either with the Government or the beet-growers, but in their early efforts to get Irish capital they were so unsuccessful that they were discouraged.  At one point they were very much discouraged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now I submit that either the Minister for Finance was in those remarks deliberately deceiving the House as to the facts, or that he himself had been deceived by the proprietors of the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think <Col N="374" /> the Deputy will realise that to say that the Minister was deliberately deceiving the House is not desirable.  The Deputy ought to withdraw that, because if we are to intercharge across the House accusations of deliberate deception we cannot get on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the charitable explanation that the Minister himself has been deceived.  When Class A £1 Shares of the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company were placed on the official list of the Dublin Stock Exchange, the &ldquo;Financial Times&rdquo; made this comment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This will be the first opportunity the general public in Ireland have had of taking an interest in the concern, though it is not expected that much scrip is likely to come on the market as the bulk of it is in Belgian and Czecho-Slovakian hands.  In point of fact there was no real appeal to the public, and there appears to have been considerable misunderstanding over the financial details. One firm of brokers was prepared to take shares to more than half the sum mentioned in the Dáil, and there can be little doubt that, with proper publicity, a much larger subscription would have been secured in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think our own commonsense should convince us that there can be little doubt that a much larger share of the capital could have been secured in Ireland if a serious effort were made to get it.  The owners of capital in this country, as a general rule, are not national and are not anxious to encourage industry in the country, but the prospect of 10 per cent. and several other additional profits would, I think, appeal to them just as forcibly as to any others.  The fact remains in any case that in consequence of the misunderstanding, as the &ldquo;Financial Times&rdquo; puts it, concerning the financial details, the bulk of the capital of the factory remains in the hands of foreigners, and the profits which are being realised in consequence of the subsidy are going out of the country. As I endeavoured to establish yesterday, the resulting policy of the company <Col N="375" /> is such as to give us very serious grounds to believe that they are working the factory for the ten years during which they will get the subsidy, with the obvious intention of closing it down and clearing out with the profits at the end of that period.</P>
    <P>I gave an example yesterday of one instance, which can be verified, in which the factory conducted its business in such a manner as to antagonise one of the biggest potential customers it could have in this country.  And there are other examples.  Throughout the whole management of the factory there is evidence that there is no serious effort being made to make it an efficient business enterprise.  The cost of production in the factory during the period for which figures are available must have amounted to about £15 per ton.  The costs of production in England at the present time average about £8 per ton, and in Germany, I understand, about £5 per ton.  We have a whole board of twelve directors drawing over £4,000 in fees.  We have also the spectacle of a considerable portion, nearly 50 per cent., of the company's ready cash deposited not in any Irish bank but in banks outside this country.</P>
    <P>There is also reason to believe that there is some co-operation by the Government with the company in antagonising possible customers in this country.  There is an excise duty on sugar amounting, I think, to 9/4 per cwt.  A manufacturer of sweets in the Free State, exporting sweets outside of the area, is entitled to a rebate for the duty paid on the sugar content of the sweets.  Now sweet manufacturers with an export trade have been refused that rebate in cases where the sugar used was Carlow sugar, and they were actually told that the Carlow sugar pays no duty.  It does pay a duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, the effect of the whole thing is that they do not have to pay duty.  But what has happened as a result of it?  The sweet manufacturers, who have to pay the same price for the Carlow sugar that they have to pay for the imported sugar, get no rebate on the sweets they manufacture and export if Carlow sugar is used.  Therefore, any sweet manufacturer who has an export trade in sweets, no matter how small it may be, will not stock the Carlow sugar, because if he does he has to employ a clerk to keep trace of the sugar as it goes through the factory, so as to be able to prove to the Revenue Commissioners that not a single grain of it was used in the sweets manufactured for export.  The result is that the sweet <Col N="377" /> manufacturers in the Free State are not stocking the sugar.  I think that shows that there is considerable mismanagement in the whole business in connection with the subsidy.  The action of the Government at the beginning, the false estimate on which they worked, the excessive subsidy which they are paying, and the fact that the benefit of the subsidy goes to the factory, and not to the farmers, the fact that the farmers will be left at the mercy of foreign owners at the end of three years, as well as the further fact that the factory itself is being grossly and inefficiently managed, and that, in addition, there are other red-tape regulations which prevent its development, justify, I submit, this House in rejecting the Vote and in making this a vote of censure on the Government in connection with its management of the whole business.</P>

      <P>I have listened with some care to the two speeches from the Opposition on this Supplementary Estimate. It struck me, if I may use the expression again, that Deputy Derrig's speech was ill-informed, and that it was wanting in knowledge with regard to the whole work and life of the factory. He wanted to know what had been done to protect the growers, and said nothing had been done.  He seemed to think they were like a lot of sheep in which neither the Minister nor anyone in the Free State was interested. No one was interested in them except Deputy Derrig and the people for whom he speaks.  But what are the facts?  When has Deputy Derrig, or one of his Party, interested themselves in the growers, except just now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have a record of what they did.  Before the growers started to grow at all, before the first seed was sown, an association was formed of beet growers.  The Farmers' Union convened a conference of the growers in the area to be served by the Carlow factory.  They were brought together and asked to form an association. They formed this and appointed their own chairman and their own officials.  Their staff has been in the factory since.  Their agents have been <Col N="378" /> at the several stations where beet is taken in both by rail and canal.  Their agents are in the testing-room and all over the factory, and we are asked what has been done?  This is a little general information for the first time for Deputy Derrig and his friends.  If this powerful organisation of beet growers are unable to look after their own interests, that is their affair.  Any assistance they want outside their own staff they have always received, and people have been working in this House for the last two or three years to give it to them.  It has been said that the directors are paid £4,000 a year.  I do not know how much they are paid, but I know that £4,000 a year has very little to say to the total overhead charges in the factory.  What is the total wages bill?  Mention has been made of the cost of production in Germany. Deputy Lemass has said that it cost £15 to produce a ton of sugar in Carlow and £5 in Germany.  What has £4,000 to say to that?  Is Deputy Lemass making a case, deliberately, to use his own words, making a case against Irish workmen?  What is he making a case for, and how does this £4,000 a year affect the case he is trying to make?  It is time that Deputy Lemass and his friends awoke to the fact that the Irish farmer and the Irish worker deserve some care and attention.</P>

As a pretty large user of the sugar, I can say that nobody can complain of the manner in which they turn out their product.  This bears testimony to the way the work is done.  As early as last January the factory had contracted to sell all the sugar it could make for the whole year. To-day if Deputy Lemass or any other person wanted to get one hundred tons of sugar from that factory he could not get it, because it has been already sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that Deputy Lemass managed to cram a terrible lot of nonsense into what was, for him, a short speech.  I do not mind him laying down the law about the Governor-General, and even talking in a general way about tariffs, but when the Deputy gets up coolly to criticise technical processes, the working of a factory and its efficiency, really it shows that he completely lacks a sense of humour. <Col N="380" /> There are very few people in this country even now who know anything about the manufacture of sugar from beets.  There are very few people even in England, and there were none before the establishment of the factory there. The processes are highly technical, and it simply is absurd for Deputies in a loose sort of way to use the Dáil to throw charges of inefficiency in connection with an enterprise of this sort.  It is in fact one of the most efficient and one of the finest factories in the world. It is a factory that we are all proud of.  That is admitted even by its rivals in trade.  We can judge one end of the business, and that is the way in which they turn out the article.  Deputy McDonagh, who at least knows what he talks about, because he deals in this article, says he can testify, just as any big wholesaler can testify, as to the quality of the article they turn out and the way in which they do their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are charged here with a great number of offences.  First, the subsidy was too high.  That charge should not come from that side of the House.  I was through the whole of the sugar beet negotiations.  We interviewed three or four of the best firms in the world, because our idea at the time was to get the most efficient company that we could possibly get to carry out this experiment.  If we were undertaking a commercial transaction, the first question to consider would be the question of costings, the question of £ s. d., profits, and so on; but when you are undertaking an experiment, when you are undertaking a big experimental proposition, the first question you have got to consider is efficiency, and you have got to pay for efficiency.  You can take no chances whatever in that regard.  When our committee had travelled over Europe, and had interviewd practically every big man in the sugar world, we decided, rightly or wrongly, that if we could make terms with M. Lippens, we would give him the factory, and then we came to discuss the subsidy.  That was at the end of 1924 or the beginning of 1925.  This was a nice country in 1924 and 1925 in which to invest £400,000. Look at it from the point of view of a stranger.  Deputy Lemass, I suppose, <Col N="381" /> or Deputy Derrig, would hardly make the claim that Ireland was full of first-class business men who could establish a factory here.  I presume that they will at least admit that we had to go outside the country.</P>

      <P>We had to go outside the country.  Look at the proposition from the angle of a Belgian, a Dutchman or an Englishman investing £400,000 worth of capital in this country at a time when we had hardly repaired the bridges.  They were broken at the time.  We had hardly repaired or replaced houses that were destroyed. The houses were hardly rebuilt.  The smell of petrol had hardly left the country.  That was put up to us, time and time again, by every single one of them, and we had to go out of our way, in spite of all that evidence that was under their noses, to assure all these firms which we were anxious should come into this country and compete for an industry, that that state of affairs was not going to recur.</P>
      <P>Remember all the wild talk there was going on at the time, the number of people who wanted to die for Ireland still, and so on.  In all these circumstances we had to make a bargain with foreigners and ask them to come in here and spend £400,000 worth of their good money in putting up a sugar beet factory.  In addition to that, there was the fact that the crop had never been grown here on a commercial scale, that nobody had any real information as to whether the farmers would or would not grow it, whether, if they did grow sugar beet, it would be approximately equal to the Continental sugar beet, and whether there would be anything in Irish sugar beet, due to the soil, climate and so on, which would make the process of manufacture more costly.  All these things had to be taken into account and ensured against&mdash;ensured against, at least in the mind of the people who were putting up the money, who were going to do the work, and, above all, who had to be ensured against the condition of the country at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are told at this stage from <Col N="382" /> the opposite benches that the subsidy was too high.  I believe that, but for the events of the last five years, we could have had a factory with a smaller subsidy&mdash;not very much smaller, because when you compare the subsidy in our first ten years with the English subsidy there is not such a tremendous difference.  The subsidy for the first ten years works out at, I think, 22/6.  The English subsidy for the first ten years was 19/-.  It is not a tremendous difference when you remembers the conditions in England&mdash; the financial and economic reputation of England, its reputation as a secure country.  I have no doubt whatever that but for the events, which I will not recapitulate, of the last five years, and all the loose talk&mdash;and when I speak of loose talk I mean this condemnation of Irish labour, of Irish business, the constant complaints and demands for State assistance for everything, constant demands for spoon-feeding and subsidies, that give the impression generally that the people of this country are no good and cannot do anything unless they are spoon-fed at every hand's turn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be true.  I must say I have nothing but admiration for the company who came in here at that subsidy and started a factory.  I am delighted that they have made, not £114,000&mdash;we ought to be accurate at least in some respects&mdash;but £50,000 net profits last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>£114,000 gross profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, gross profits; but when we refer to profits we do not refer to gross profits but net profits, which are what really count.  I am sorry they have not made £100,000 or £200,000.  I should like very much if they had made £400,000, because what would it prove but that sugar beet could be made a commercial proposition in this country?  Do we want the experiment to be a success?  If we do, we should be anxious to see that this <Col N="383" /> company is able to make very good profits, because the more profits are made the more elasticity there is, the better the chance of being able to get some other company, or the same company, to open new factories on a commercial basis.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why people take a balance-sheet in connection with this experiment, examine it, and say: &ldquo;This company made £50,000 net profits and £114,000 gross profits,&rdquo; and consider that this is criticism of the scheme. I consider that is in its favour.  I can well imagine what would be said if during the first year the company was a failure and made no profits.  Everyone would point out what fools we were.  We would get all this belated wisdom about sugar beet, but in an entirely different sense.  We would be told that sugar beet never suited this country, that we were foolish ever to start it.  We would be told exactly what we were told when we were endeavouring to start this enterprise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, in an airy moment, charges the Minister for Finance with deliberate misrepresentation, and, in a charitable moment, gives him the benefit of the doubt, withdraws the charge, and says he was mistaken.  He says there was no real attempt made to get Irish capital.  That is nonsense.  The Deputy must know that a company is not going to put their shares on the market to establish a new enterprise unless they have some idea that they will be taken up, unless there is a chance that they will be taken up.  If you try to float an enterprise and fail, you discount it in the beginning.  No business man would attempt to float an enterprise and ask the public to take shares unless he thought that there was a fair chance that they would be taken. What any business man who knows anything about his business does is: he first makes all the inquiries he can make through stockbrokers, banks and other sources to see what the chances are, what the prospects are&mdash;whether there are any chances of getting capital from the public&mdash;and if he is satisfied, he asks for it and gets it.  No business man would adopt any other method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> In this case the company were extremely anxious to get Irish capital, and we were extremely anxious to get it for them.  We used all the resources we had, they used all the resources they had, through their stockbrokers, to get Irish capital.  I heard moneyed people in this country, who count financially, telling the representatives of this company that they were foolish to put any of their money into sugar beet, or into any Irish enterprise. After every effort that we could make, that they could make, and that men of good-will in the financial world in Dublin could make, they got, I think, £20,000.  But now it is a success.  Who made it a success?  The farmer number one, the company number two, and labour number three.  Now, when it is a success, all the wise people tell us, first of all, that the subsidy is too high, that this is a gold mine, and Deputy Lemass is qualifying for a position worth about £4,500 per year as the chief technical expert of the sugar beet processes in this country. Deputies are anxious that another factory should be started.  I wonder what will the prospective company think of this debate?  We hear complaints about the taring and the testing arrangements&mdash;that the farmers in a state, I think the words were, of great anxiety and insecurity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was nearly forgetting that.  I am glad you did not let me forget that.  I thought that was a good point.  There is glass in the sugar, their taring is wrong, the testing is doubtful, and the farmers are in a state of trepidation as to what is going to happen when the guaranteed price ceases.  Moreover, what is the Government going to do about it?  Should not the Government take a share in the factory?  I think Deputy Derrig suggested that it was a good idea that the farmers should control the factory themselves.  But he went on immediately to explain that when he spoke of the farmers controlling the factory he really meant the Government.  I thought as much.  That is always what is meant.  There were suggestions made <Col N="385" /> that the farmers should have some say in it&mdash;in other words, that the factory should be run by a committee and that on any business proposition that would come up for discussion on some technical question we should have a sort of debate between the farmers and the company and the whole lot of us as to what should be done&mdash;have the sort of debate we are now having.  If we are to judge by what they say, that is their idea of business.  They say they are anxious to start another factory and enterprise generally.  Some Deputy complained&mdash;I think it was Deputy Lemass&mdash;about the Germans on the Shannon, the Belgians on the Barrow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no complaint to make about French beauties.  We want enterprise, and we want everybody to help.  We have not all the money and brains and efficiency in this country. We want help from all sides.  What are the prospective producers, who are thinking of establishing sugar beet factories and industries of one kind or another in this country, to think of a debate like this?  By the way, the Minister for Finance has again been misquoted.  It has been said that he gave a definite undertaking to the Dáil that only 85,000 tons of sugar would be manufactured, and that he afterwards altered that and agreed to have 125,000 tons manufactured.  That is not so.  At the beginning the proposal was for a factory dealing with about five thousand acres of beets per annum, and upon that basis&mdash;five thousand acres for the first year, six thousand acres for the second year, and seven <Col N="386" /> thousand acres for the third year&mdash;it would work out in ten years that about 85,000 tons of sugar would be produced. Remember when that was being discussed, the question was whether we could get five thousand acres for the first year and six thousand acres for the second year.  We held that we could, although we were a little doubtful.  Other members of the Dáil held that we could not, while others held that we could get up to ten thousand.  Personally I never thought that we could get up to ten thousand, but the point of view of everybody was perfectly clear, that if we could get up to ten thousand acres, so much the better.  That was made quite clear by the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Lemass has not discovered something new in the case when he reads the debates, and tells us it was only afterwards we realised we could get ten thousand, and from that he infers that we deceived the Dáil when we said we could only expect five thousand acres the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil knew our desire was to get as much beet as we could grow up to ten thousand acres.  We did not believe we could get it.  I did not believe it at the time, but the fact that we got it is an example that the farmer is not a fool and does not need all the advice from people who are amateurs and not farmers, and can see a good proposition when put before him.  He realised that this was a good proposition and that the price was good.  They came in with 9,000 acres the first year, and they have grown 17,000 acres this year instead of 15,000.  That will put the contract out again and will lead to further debates in the Dáil because, under the contract, the company can only accept if they are to keep to their final estimate, about ten thousand acres the first year, fifteen thousand acres the second year, and much less than ten thousand acres in the two following years, and then, after that, go up to fifteen thousand acres again.  You had close on 10,000 the first year, and then 17,000 acres the second year, which will mean that you must drop your estimate for the following years, or else a new arrangement will have to be made.  When we come to discuss that we will be told that that <Col N="387" /> was our foolishness again, but that is not so.  I am glad to see this happen. I did not anticipate it would happen, but the farmers saw the advantage, and saw that they were getting a good price, and we found it extremely difficult to keep them within the estimate. They have grown this year two thousand acres more than they should have grown.  Now as to what is to happen next year when the market is open. There is no guarantee next year for the farmer as to the price the farmer is to get for his beet, and we are asked what is to happen?</P>
    <P>There is a Beet Growers' Association, and the sooner that Beet Growers' Association takes full charge of the position the better for everybody concerned. It is an efficient association, and it has done a tremendous amount of good work.  It has made the taring arrangements and the testing arrangements watertight.</P>
    <P>Of course you are bound to have complaints, but they settled a lot of the difficulties that inevitably must arise between the company and the farmer. In the first instance, this is a matter entirely for the Beet Growers' Association and the company.  The company is there and they have £400,000 worth of a factory.  They do not want that to be idle.  The farmers are there, on the other hand.  They want a good price for their beets.  There you have two elements to a bargain.  The company do not want to close and lose the chance of good profits.  They are open to a good bargain, and the sooner we get back to the healthy position that these bargains should be left to the interests concerned, and that the State should not be brought in except as a last resort, the better.  If we are to have debates like this, if people are trying to bedevil the position by pretending to be interested in the farmers pressing for outrageous prices, and if we are to have people blackguarding the company, we will not get business done as we would if we let them alone. Let us, at least, try to have fair play. You cannot have the agricultural industry without the farmer on the one side and the entrepeneur industrialist on the other side.  The soundest way to <Col N="388" /> arrive at a proper price is to leave it between them, and, if we are to come in, let us come in a helpful spirit to see that it is settled as it should be settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. COONEY Mr. COONEY">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise. Now, coming to the railway arrangements, they are, in my opinion, good. I think the railways have acted well, and I think it is good business for them.  They are giving freights at about a penny per ton mile.  That is the average amount, and is a low rate. The arrangements about fertilisers are working out well.  The arrangements are as follows: The farmers make certain arrangements with the shopkeeper for fertilisers.  They then send documents to the sugar company authorising them to stop the price of the fertilisers out of the first payment for the beets.  The sugar company do the rest.  In other words, the farmer gets his fertilisers on credit automatically from spring to autumn.  We do not attempt to rule the price for the fertilisers, and every Deputy knows now that the fertilisers are down to, and in some cases below, pre-war prices. Sulphate of ammonia is below pre-war price.  Then there is the question as to twelve directors.  I do not know that I ought to refer to that; I do not care if there are twelve or twenty-four directors.  It is their own business, and they know their own business.  They are really a first-class firm, and I wish we had more of them in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I should say not, but of course there are two companies.  I was asked, finally, by Deputy Kennedy, what about other factories.  There is no question of starting other factories on the basis of subsidising agriculture to the tune of £24 an acre.  The sensible thing to do, both from the point of view of the farmers, and the country as a whole, is to wait and see the result of the first three, four or five years of the factory. <Col N="389" /> We can get all the data required then, and a very complicated problem will then present itself.  It will be a problem from the farmer's point of view as to what he can take for the beets, and the problem from the point of view of the company of what they can afford to run the factory at.</P>
      <P>It will be a problem from the point of view of the country as a whole as to what are its reactions on, say, railway rates.  On all these questions we will have from this factory fairly accurate data in four or five years that we can act on.  We need no other factory for that purpose.  This factory is handling about 15,000 acres of beet from seven or eight counties, from every variety of soil and grown under all sorts of different conditions, and this factory is sufficient to give us any information we want in regard to the growing of beet.  Further, the beets are manufactured in great quantities, and the factory itself is handling such large quantities of such different kinds of beet that undoubtedly they can have all the data that would enable them to come to conclusions as to what exactly the processes must be for the manufacture of sugar from sugar-beet.  We will get all this information from this factory, and it would be a pure waste of money to establish another factory at this stage.  I could not say when another factory will be established.  I do not think that there should be any pressure for other factories.  I cannot understand how people on the one side will say that this subsidy is too high, and on the other that more factories should be started.  Of course, I will be answered by somebody saying: &ldquo;With a lower subsidy.&rdquo;  Well, until you lower the subsidy to make it a commercial subsidy, whatever that may be, it is at best pure waste of the taxpayers' money to start another factory.</P>

      <P>I do not set myself up or pretend to be an expert in the making of sugar from sugar-beet, but I do think that I know the rudiments of business efficiency and business courtesy, and we have had fairly conclusive evidence that the management of the factory is lacking in the rudiments either of business efficiency or business courtesy.  Does the Minister think that at the end of the ten years' time the factory will be able to manufacture sugar from beet economically without the aid of a subsidy?  The Minister appears to be worried as to what the proprietors of the factory and the possible proprietors of other factories may think of this debate. One thing I hope they will get into their heads very definitely, as a result of this debate, is that there are Deputies in this House who are not quite as green as the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was not green at all.  I thought all the greenery was on the other side.  Green used to be the national colour.  The Deputy wants to know whether I think that the factory will be able to operate at the end of ten years without a subsidy. I hope so, but, of course, it is a very difficult question.  As far as I know there is only one country in Europe where sugar is manufactured from beet without a subsidy, and in that country the farmers are prepared to take a very low price.  I do not want <Col N="391" /> to say any more than that.  I could not answer that.  The Deputy suggested that it is quite plain now that at the end of ten years this company will close the doors of the factory and go away.  I do not know how he arrived at that conclusion.  I put this to him: They will close the doors of the factory and go if it does not pay them to make sugar-beet, and for no other reason.  If it pays the company to manufacture sugar from beet they will continue it; if it does not they will not.  And when they are considering the question as to whether it will or will not pay, they will have this big factor to take into account, that they have a valuable factory, originally worth £400,000, and renewed, by the way, practically every two years, and possibly then worth £300,000, and I think that business people will think twice before they close the doors of a factory and leave all that machinery and all that capital idle.  It is a purely business proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>First the subsidy was extravagant; second, the factory was extravagant&mdash;extravagant on two grounds: in that it made too much money, and in that the depreciation was too big; and, third, by reason of the success of the growing of the sugar-beet a multitude of questions have been raised which may have no other effect than to warn farmers not to grow beet next year.  Let us understand where we are.  Is the idea to damage this place?  One can draw no other conclusion from what we have listened to to-day.  It was attacked because there was no Irish capital in it.  I wonder if Deputies opposite know that down in Carlow they spent £1,000 in circularising the whole country with a view to getting Irish capital invested; that upwards of £10,000 was spent by other people interested in the County Carlow <Col N="394" /> in having it made a success; that apart altogether from what the Minister has said about interested persons having Irish capital to put into it, these efforts were made locally, and that locally more work could not have been done to make it a success from its very inception by those who sold the site&mdash; which was sold at a cheap price&mdash;by those who took part in the construction of it, and in every phase of the operations from the commencement.  And now I can draw no other conclusion than that Deputies opposite are determined to show that it has not been a success.  They may not have intended that, but no other conclusion can be arrived at.  If I examine what Deputy Lemass has said, that the cost of production is high, I can come to no other conclusion than that wages have been paid in excess.</P>

      <P>And taking into account what the Minister has said, that there is a difference of 2/- between the subsidy here and in Great Britain, I find it hard to draw any other conclusion than that we have got the idea, as the Minister has said, that, with the Belgians on the Barrow, the Frenchmen on the streets of Dublin, and the Germans on the Shannon, there has been a deliberate policy to exclude Irishmen from developing their own country.  That is a bad atmosphere to import into a discussion of this sort. This was a business proposition from the beginning.  It has exceeded the rosiest anticipations of everybody connected with it.  Great efforts were made by persons interested in this industry to get a large acreage sown.  It was not believed that we would ever have had 10,000 acres in the first year. Now, because a larger acreage has been grown, and has been grown successfully, we are attacked for its success. Deputies can have it every way, but they cannot prove that it has not been <Col N="395" /> a question of good industrial development. There has been every effort made to get Irish capital into it, and even in face of the damaging statements that are made I believe that the people of this country will be satisfied from this industry that there is a hope for industrial expansion, notwithstanding the caoiners and the wailers and the fee-fa-fums that we have here.</P>

      <P>It was understood that the Minister for Lands and Agriculture had concluded, and that we were asking him some questions about it.  However, I think that Deputy MacEntee must be allowed to speak now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I think we want very strongly to rebut the President's allegation that we are attacking the industry as an industry. We do attack the subsidy as a bargain and as a contract, and the reason why our speeches have been made here has been in order to elicit some information regarding this particular company. When the Bill was going through the Dáil various efforts were made by practically every party in this House, including some members who followed the President into the division lobby, to set up a committee to inquire into the <i>bona fides</i> of this contract, to ascertain whether it was a justifiable one, and likely to be a profitable one for the country.  But the extraordinary thing about it was that the sugar beet subsidy went through in exactly the same way as the Siemens-Schuckert contract, without any detailed inquiry into the merits of the proposal by this House. I noted that on the Second Reading or the Committee Stage of the Bill there was a proposal that the whole scheme should be referred to a Select Committee nominated by the Committee of Selection, and that was turned down. There was then a proposal made by the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that, in the event of the company being established, a director should be appointed who would be nominated by the Minister for Finance.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave very cogent and sound reasons as to why that <Col N="396" /> course should be adopted.  He was supported, I think, in that attitude by the then chairman of the Farmers' Party, Deputy Gorey.  I think that the course of this discussion should have confirmed them in their wisdom, and that to-day we would know a little more about this Carlow sugar beet factory, if the course they had suggested had been followed.</P>
      <P>There is something remarkable about the accounts of the Carlow beet factory. The Minister pays a subsidy, and one of the conditions of the Act was that within a statutory period the accounts should be presented for his inspection.  They are there and you can understand them, but it is quite easy to see that last year there was, after an incomplete year's trading, a profit of £114,000 returned, and of that £114,000 some £40,000 was allocated for depreciation services.  That sum is sufficient, I believe, to redeem the whole capital expenditure of the Carlow sugar beet factory in a period of approximately seven years, allowing for interest at 5 per cent. on the investment.  But, as you have heard, the cost of maintenance of this factory is very high.  The Minister says that practically the whole plant has to be renewed within two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so certain that that is so.  I am not so certain that the real depreciation charges upon this factory, the real costs of keeping it in repair and maintaining it, are so heavy as the Minister suggests. This House has no means of knowing, and it is quite a common thing in every trading company to create something in the nature of hidden reserves, by putting down excessive charges for maintenance.  We have the accounts presented here, but there is no trading account, nothing which shows the actual income and the actual expenditure of that company. We have a statement as to the net profits, and a balance-sheet, but we have nothing that would show that the company is not, in fact, making a much greater profit than it returns.  We have nothing which would enable the House to judge for itself as to whether this subsidy is in fact a profitable and <Col N="397" /> economic one for this country.  Not only that, but there is another point to be considered.  Originally, I think the factory was to have a certain output. I believe the capacity of the factory has been greatly increased.  Surely it must be very largely increased if, instead of having an output of 10,000 tons, as was originally contemplated, it is now to have an output of something over 23,000 tons of sugar in the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kent voices the demand of the farmers of Cork county, and the farmers in other districts, when he suggested that the Government ought to consider the establishment of sugar beet factories in other centres.  We, on these benches, would like to see several sugar beet factories working in Ireland, but we would not like to see them started on the same terms as the Carlow sugar beet factory was started. We would like to see that the subsidy paid would be a reasonable one, one that was just necessary to enable the factory to show a profit, and let any excess of that profit depend on the skill and management of the factory.  The fact that the subsidy is excessive, I believe, is going to prevent the development of the sugar beet industry, because this factory, with an excessive subsidy, is in a position to dominate the whole internal market.  There is very little chance of another factory starting with a smaller subsidy and being able to pay its way in the face of this over-subsidised concern.  Therefore, the bargain that has been made, if the subsidy is excessive, instead of helping the development of the sugar beet industry will help to kill it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all this debate ranges around the question as to what it should cost this country to educate the farming community.  There is bound to be difference of opinion on that question, so long as you have different parties in this House.  I do not think that this debate, so far as I have had the privilege of listening to it, is going to serve any useful purpose. Deputies Lemass and MacEntee are at a certain disadvantage in taking part in a debate of this kind, in so far as they represent industrial areas as against rural or agricultural constituencies. If those Deputies had the information <Col N="398" /> at their disposal which representatives of tillage constituencies have, regarding the necessity for further beet factories in this country, I do not think that they would be so enthusiastic about the contributions which they have made to this debate. I find that the trouble in the constituency which I have the honour to represent is that everybody who has been engaged in tillage operations in that area, and who has been unable in the last five years to make a living out of the land, is anxious to know when we are going to have further beet factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers of this country are conservative enough in their own way, but they realise what a good proposition is. The farmer is the last man who, in this country particularly, will tell you he is making money when he is not doing so.  I have sufficient evidence from the people in my constituency to enable me to say that the farmers are unanimously of the opinion that beet-growing is a paying proposition for them. I was one of the Deputies in this House who happened to be concerned with the organising committee drawn from the Barrow area who were responsible for the creation of the agitation to establish a sugar beet factory, and I was engaged in the squabble as to whether the proposed factory should be built in Athy or Carlow.  I was not much concerned with that once I had experience of finding out in Belgium what beet cultivation meant to the farmers there.  I had the privilege, with other Deputies who were in this House at that time, of going on a deputation to Belgium, when we were given an opportunity of going through the beet factories there.  After two or three days spent in a tour of examination of the working conditions of those engaged in beet cultivation there from the productive side, and having seen the workers engaged in their work in the factories in Belgium, I began, I confess, to ask myself whether we could find similar types of workers in Ireland for factories here.  It was a new industry to us.  We came to the conclusion that men working in those factories were mere machines, and I wondered whether we could find workers here who would be able to do <Col N="399" /> that kind of work in the same way as they did it in Belgium.</P>
    <P>I had my doubts then, but I was glad to hear from those responsible for the Carlow factory that the workers in the beet factory there are equally as good as those in Belgium or anywhere else. I would not have taken part in this debate were it not for the serious statement of Deputy Lemass regarding mismanagement and bad working in the Carlow factory.  It was only in the middle of December that I had my first opportunity with representatives of the surrounding districts of going through the factory and seeing the conditions under which the workers were working and the way in which the factory was conducted.  I am satisfied with them&mdash; we will agree to differ, so far as Deputy Lemass and I are concerned&mdash; and I see no difference in the methods of management carried on in the factory in Carlow and those in Belgium.  So far as I know, the conditions under which the workers work in the Carlow factory are, at any rate, acceptable to the leaders of the workers who belong to the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and to the Amalgamated Transport Workers' Union who negotiated the conditions of service on behalf of the men there.  The question of future factories is a difficulty. The question as to when and where these factories are to be established is one which the Minister for Agriculture has to consider and decide.</P>
    <P>I notice that a Deputy from Cork is looking for a factory there, and we know that when we get Deputies from Cork&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, and Labour Deputies together&mdash;making a joint move there is generally danger.  The question of the establishment of future factories and the conditions under which they are to be worked will not, in my opinion, be helped by throwing cold water on the working of the present factory.  We can agree, or at least agree to differ, as to whether the conditions of the subsidy for the Carlow factory are too generous or otherwise.  I think those who have the interests of the farming community at heart see that beet cultivation is a good proposition for them, and, incidentally, for the workers who <Col N="400" /> will be afforded employment.  People should not be anxious to throw cold water on the working of the factory, and on the beet-growers who are supplying the raw material.  The only profit made by the farmers in my constituency of Leix and Offaly has been made out of beet, and I challenge Deputy Gorry and Deputy Boland to deny that it is only the farmers who have grown beet who have been able to keep their heads above water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this question that has not been touched upon to any extent.  We have had the admission from the Minister for Lands and Agriculture that the sugar beet factory made a net profit of £50,000, and we have been informed by Deputy Derrig that £40,000 was written off against capital expenditure.  In other words, there has been a clear profit of £90,000 on the working of the factory.  The capital investment is £400,000, and that sum brings from the Government a guaranteed subsidy, which amounts in ten years to £3,000,000.  I think when the Government has committed itself to support the factory to the extent of £3,000,000 of the ratepayers' money it should at least have had the foresight to invest £200,000 in the undertaking.  The Government has interested itself in other undertakings where the ratepayers' money has to be expended, as for instance the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the bank that guarantees the trade loans.  But in the case of this beet factory it did not consider it necessary to invest a portion of the money in the factory.  An expenditure of £200,000 by way of investment would not be a great addition to the £3,000,000, and if that sum had been invested we would not have the situation that has arisen.  It is a fine proposition for the people concerned.  I cannot see how anybody could have refused to support the undertaking if the matter had been properly presented. Here you have for an investment of £400,000 practically a guaranteed profit of 25 per cent. per year, and yet we are told by the Government that support was not given to the undertaking.  I maintain, with previous speakers, that the facts of the <Col N="401" /> matter were not put properly to the country.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House in discussing matters already dealt with.  This factory is only in its infancy, and it should get all the encouragement possible. The question is whether the subsidy given to the factory is too large for the ratepayers.  I sincerely hope this factory will be successful, and that it will be the forerunner of others that will be established in the near future. I think this is a question that should be left to an open vote.</P>

      <P>I am very much surprised that the Opposition should in any way try to retard the onward march of industrial Ireland.  The establishment of a beet factory was unanimously supported by this House on the grounds that it would go to show that we were almost a self-supporting country. Even though it should be run at a loss to the ratepayers it is an industry that is giving employment in the district, and I am sorry that any Deputy should raise his hand against it.  In my county we are hoping for the establishment of beet factories, and we would be very grateful to the Government if it would give us a beet factory with a subsidy, even if that subsidy was to be put on the local rates.  I assure the House that we would be delighted to contribute to the support of such a factory.  If we only put our shoulders to the wheel we could make this country self-supporting. We have advanced in that direction by establishing the beet factory, and we hope in a short time to be able to grow tea.</P>

There is a slight increase in the actuarial Estimate under F 2.  The reason for that Supplementary Estimate is that the figure for expenditure for the first six months of the current year is such as to indicate that the expenditure will be greater than was anticipated under this sub-head.  In connection with the Appropriations-in-Aid, the work is done by the National Health Insurance Commissioners in the Free State, who give medical benefits to discharged British soldiers here.

      <P>If the Deputy's point is that further legislation requires to be introduced in order to facilitate persons insured under the insurance companies and societies to a greater extent than now, I take it that that matter is not a matter for discussion on the Estimates.  The alternative is that the insurance companies and societies are delaying claims, and that <Col N="405" /> they ought, as the law is at present, pay up earlier than they are paying. It seems to me that that is a matter for taking up with the insurance societies or in some other form.  To oppose this Estimate would simply be to reduce State funds that we are making available here for the insurance societies in order to enable them to make the payments that they are statutorily required to make.</P>

      <P>One point that I would like to make is in reference to the Vote under the sub-head AA.  I would like to know why it would not be possible to employ an Irish actuary to do that same work.  I imagine that if it were possible&mdash;and I am sure it ought to be&mdash;that an Irish actuary would be able to estimate the cost of this work better than to have to go at the end of the year and to ask to have the Estimate increased by 25 per cent.  The Minister said it had to be increased by a small sum.  An increase of 25 per cent. on a small sum is a considerable amount, and an actuary, who ought to be something of a mathematician, ought to have some experience of his work, and ought to be able to go closer into his estimate than that at the end of the year he should have to alter it to such a large extent.  I think there is quite a good deal in the complaints just referred to by Deputy Little.  I do not know whether this is the right time to go into them or not.  But one does hear numerous complaints, of the administration, for instance.  Whether it is the approved societies that are responsible, or the administration at headquarters, I am not at the moment prepared to say.  But one hears very frequent complaints, at any rate, and probably when this Estimate is under consideration again these complaints will be aired.  I do not know whether it would be right to go into some of them that I have in mind or not.  I would like to call the Minister's attention to that statement there in AA, and to ask if it is possible to have an Irish actuary employed, and if not, why would they not get an efficient British actuary, if a British actuary is necessary in the case.</P>

      <P>The only way we have to mark our disapproval of the manner in which sickness insurance benefits are administered under the National Health Insurance Commissioners is when this Vote is being discussed.  It appears to me that in a big percentage of cases the money that goes in procuring National Health Insurance stamps and the stamps in insurance cards is taken under false pretences.  I do not say that that is entirely the fault of the Local Government Department, or the fault of the Minister responsible, but the actual practical situation is that when people go to look for sickness insurance benefits, and when they are certified by the certifiers, they find it practically impossible to get benefits extracted out of the societies.  People who have been contributing for long periods, some of them for a period of several years, and getting their cards stamped regularly, naturally expect when they become ill, and when they get a certificate from the doctor, that they should be entitled without undue delay to draw insurance benefits.  I have been certifying for a considerable number of years for a number of societies&mdash;roughly, seven or eight societies&mdash; and my experience is that it is rare that any benefits are paid for the first four or five weeks of illness.</P>
      <P>That is a very serious matter for the unfortunate people who have no other source of income at the time they are ill unless the benefits to be derived from the National Health Insurance. It has very serious effects on those people.  Take, for instance, the mental anxiety of a father who has no source of income and no means of providing the extra nourishment that a person acutely ill would require.  The mental anxiety, apart from the physical disability in not being able to diet himself properly, is a very serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A big percentage of the insurance certificates are issued for acute illnesses, illnesses that last over a period of one, two or three weeks.  It is found in actual practice that people seriously ill for a period of only one or two weeks will not seek certificates at all because of the difficulty experienced in getting benefit from the society.  These <Col N="407" /> people rush back to work before they are physically fit to work and the result very often is that their health is permanently impaired and they become chronic invalids; they become a perpetual drain on the State or on the insurance societies with which they are insured.</P>
    <P>I have in mind at the moment a particular case, a man to whom I have been issuing certificates for a period of months.  The last payment he got was on 1st January this year.  He has had no notification from the society that his benefits have been reduced or cut off. He has written to the society and has not even got a reply.  I think the Minister, in view of the large amount of public money which is being allocated for the purpose of providing benefits for the people who are ill, should take steps to see that the benefits are made available at the time they are most required.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the matter of the actuary, I do not know whether there is an actuary in the country capable of doing this work. I think the House will remember when the Minister for Finance wanted to get actuarial work done in connection with the proposal to give pensions to secondary teachers he had to go to Britain for a person capable of doing the work.  In connection with the National Health Insurance finances the apportionment of the finances as between Northern Ireland and the Saorstát as in February, 1922, was actually only completed in 1926.  The five yearly valuations of the insurance societies' funds that should have taken place in 1923 did not actually take place until 1926, I think, so that even if there was an Irish actuary here capable of doing this particular work there probably would be, and actually were, circumstances in the past that made it very desirable that the person who had been dealing as an actuary with the National Health Insurance scheme generally under the old régime should be the person who should do the recent work.  If it is a fact that there are persons competent to do the work in the Saorstát I would be glad, and I am sure the National Health Insurance <Col N="408" /> Commissioners would be quite glad to examine the situation and see whether the work could not be done by a Saorstát citizen.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statement made by Deputy Ward, any complaint of non-payment or delay in payment of benefits under the National Health Insurance that is made to the Commissioners will be fully investigated.</P>
      <P>Whether it is a matter of fact or simply an atmosphere that grows up around a particular institution, I cannot say, but you do hear a great volume of complaint here and there among people with regard to delay in the payment of National Health Insurance benefits.  I doubt if the amount of fact is really as great as the amount of complaint, but if the facts are there to be complained about, then there is full machinery in the hands of the National Health Insurance Commissioners to take those facts, whether individual facts or a volume of facts, and go into the whole matter and see that the societies do equitably discharge their duties.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion and amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the Tariff Commission, as at present constituted, is unsuitable for dealing expeditiously with applications received for the imposition of tariffs and should be replaced by a Commission, consisting of five members who should have a knowledge of agricultural and industrial conditions (of whom one should be a qualified accountant), appointed by the Executive Council with the approval of the Dáil, and to hold office for a stated period;</P>
    <P>That the Commission, thus constituted, should have power to investigate the conditions existing in any industry in regard to its need for protection against foreign competition and should make recommendations to the Executive Council as to how the benefits derived from the measure of protection afforded to any trade can be shared by the consumers.</P>
    <P>That for the purposes of its inquiries the Commission should be empowered to enforce the attendances of witnesses and to examine them on oath;</P>
    <P>That the Commission report to the Executive Council which shall publish such reports within three months of their presentation if so requested by the Commission&mdash;Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>Amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; in the first line and add the words:&mdash;&ldquo;that the Tariff Commission Act should be amended so as to provide that the members constituting the Commission shall devote their whole time to the work of the Commission;</P>

      <P>I had for a period of roughly ten minutes examined the actual Tariff Commission and the relations which existed between a Tariff Commission so constituted and an Executive of this House as illustrated by the actual conduct of an existing Executive. On two occasions different Deputies in this House found difficulty in seeing whether what I was saying was or was not in strict relation to the question at issue.  I think it happened on three occasions.  On those three occasions the Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled that I was in order and instructed me to proceed.  I propose now to continue that line of argument and, having regard to the fact that this Committee as now constituted is a judicial Committee, to examine the relations of the Executive towards the independence of such a Committee as illustrated by the actual activities of the existing Executive. I have already shown that in relation to two questions which were <Col N="411" /> before that Commission definite interference was made by members of an existing Executive.  I want to show you, in relation to other courts and the judgments and opinions and expressions in relation to facts and law of other courts, that the customary habit, judging by merely an illustration of the actual activities of members of the existing Executive, was that the Executive should interfere with the work and express judgments and opinions in relation to the judgments and acts of courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate which we have just been listening to has been marred by certain remarks which were directed towards me.  I dealt with those remarks yesterday, and do not purpose dealing with them to-day.  I now come to consider the question under discussion.  There are really two questions, because the difference between Deputy O'Connell's amendment and Deputy Lemass's motion are not very broad.  In form indeed they are very distinct, because the motion by Deputy Lemass is a motion to set up a committee, and in form it is a motion to repeal an Act of the Oireachtas. Deputy O'Connell's amendment differs from that.  His amendment is, that in the opinion of the House a certain existing Act should be amended.  There is a distinct difference in the form of the two&mdash;the motion and the amendment. One appears to me to be entirely within ordinary Parliamentary procedure, while the other appears to me to say the least of it, very unusual.  I welcome, however, this motion by Deputy Lemass for one particular reason. It appears to me to show a very considerable mental growth in Deputy Lemass since he came into this House. I have a clear recollection of the first time that I heard Deputy Lemass speak here.  Though I do not propose to quote his exact words, I remember him stating that he and his Party had a completely-thought-out programme for the settlement of every single economic difficulty which faced this country.  He left us under the impression that the Fianna Fáil army, like the French <Col N="414" /> army in 1870, were ready to march down to the last shoe lace.</P>

Since I observe that Deputy Lemass has now arrived, if I have in any way misquoted or misinterpreted him, he will set me right.  What I stated was that Deputy Lemass told us, either on the occasion of his first or second speech in this House, that his Party had thought out a complete economic programme down to its last details for the regeneration of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>No; no difference substantially.  I did not at any time profess to give the words of Deputy Lemass.  I gave the impression that was left on my mind by <Col N="415" /> Deputy Lemass's words, but as it has been said, it can be looked up in the Official Reports.  Deputy Lemass, in his opening speech, I think, rested his case largely upon two propositions.  One of them was that this existing Committee had not power in itself to originate discussions.  That he put in the forefront of his argument; it has not power to originate discussions.  That is so. This Committee was set up for a definite purpose, to consider the question as to whether tariffs should or should not be applied to certain industries, and it was then considered that those tariffs should be applied on the report of that Commission as manufacturers actually engaged in manufacture went to the Tariff Commission and asked for protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish here to diverge one moment because this Commission has been called a judicial committee.  It is not a judicial committee.  A judicial committee is a committee which makes up its own mind and which delivers judgment. If this were a judicial committee, then the duty of this committee would be to say that such and such a tariff must be imposed.  That is not the duty of this committee.  The policy of this country must be settled not by committees, but must be settled by the Dáil, by the elected of the people.  The responsibility is not upon any commission that is set up.  The responsibility is, and the responsibility should be, upon the elected of the people.  That is precisely the nature of the Committee which has been set up by the statute of 1926.  It is the duty of the Commission to examine evidence which is brought before it, to make up its mind upon that evidence fairly and honestly, and then, not to deliver judgment, but to make a report to the Executive Council, for the Executive Council in its judgment, and finally for the House, in its judgment, to act upon or not to act upon accordingly as is thought fit.  It has been said in this House that civil servants ought not be allowed to be on this Committee.  It has been stated, and freely stated, that civil servants have been tampered with by members of the Executive Council. That is not so.  It is, in my opinion, to <Col N="416" /> attack the Civil Service and the gentlemen who are members of the Civil Service, to say that such a thing could happen.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council are often attacked.  We are ready for attack. We do not mind attack; we are able to defend ourselves.  Civil servants are in quite a different position.  The Civil Service and civil servants are not members of the House.  They cannot answer in this House attacks which are made upon them here.  To say that they would allow themselves to be tampered with by any Executive Council is to bring a charge of personal dishonesty and personal corruption against members of the Civil Service.  What else is it?  What other way can you regard it? If there was in this country a dishonest Executive endeavouring dishonestly to tamper with civil servants in the discharge of their duties, such as they would have to perform on a committee like this, if they were told by a dishonest Executive to make a dishonest judgment, would they be honest men if they did so?  And yet that charge is levelled against them.  No honest man would be prodigal of his own honour. No honourable man, at the bidding of any person, will do a dishonourable act. Yet you are asked to believe that civil servants have been tampered with, have been willingly tampered with, and have acted under undue persuasion.</P>
    <P>Let me return now to the point at which I left off a few moments ago&mdash; that there is no power to originate in this Committee.  It is not within the scope of the Committee that there should be, and if Deputies had read the debate which took place when the Act of 1926 was being introduced they would know that that matter had been fully and entirely gone into.  Deputy Lemass should bear in mind that there were debates in this House before he became a member of the House.  There were great men before Agamemnon. This matter was fully and entirely threshed out in those debates.  If there is an entirely new industry which is possible of being established in this country, then that would not go before the Tariff Commission.  If, in the opinion of the Executive Council, who are responsible for governing and responsible <Col N="417" /> for shaping the policy and directing the government of this country, a new industry should be established, then the proper course is to set up a second tribunal to investigate that and consider it carefully.</P>
    <P>As we know, the most heavily protected industry in this country at present&mdash;protected not by a tariff but by a bounty&mdash;is the sugar industry. We heard all about the sugar industry from Deputy Lemass and various other Deputies this morning.  That was not set up in response to a tariff commission. That is entirely a new industry set up independently of any commission, and the question as to whether a new industry of that nature should or should not be set up in this country is a question which would be more correctly deliberated upon and decided upon by a special tribunal set up for that purpose than by this Tariff Commission which considers the ordinary applications of existing industries to have the proceeds of their labour defended against undue foreign competition.</P>
    <P>Another argument which Deputy Lemass put forward was, that this Tariff Commission was constituted of men who are not whole-time officers, and that, in consequence, matters are not being discussed as quickly, and decisions are not being arrived at as quickly, as he would desire.  This tariff question is a big question and an important one.  Tariffs have the habit of acting in one direction and reacting in another.  Tariffs must be imposed after the most careful deliberation, or else not imposed.  The question as to whether any industry should or should not be protected is a question which should be thought out most carefully and most deliberately. It is not a question upon which any rushed decision should be arrived at. The utmost care and the utmost deliberation are the things which are required in imposing tariffs.  Before interfering with the ordinary normal trading between nation and nation, or individual and individual, you must be perfectly satisfied that you are doing good and that you are not doing harm. In order to come to that conclusion, you must weigh up the matter in every single one of its bearings, and you <Col N="418" /> must not come to hasty or ill-judged decisions.</P>
    <P>We have here an existing tariff commission, a commission which is thinking out steadily and slowly, to a well-judged and well-balanced conclusion, the arguments for and against each tariff which comes before it.  That is far better than that there should be rushed discussions, rushed decisions and judgments made which are practically impossible to reverse.  Because once you protect an industry, even though you afterwards see that the protection of that industry has reactions elsewhere, that the result of the protection is not helpful to the country as a whole, as was desired, but is more baneful in other directions than helpful in the one towards which it was primarily directed, taking off that tariff becomes a matter of extreme difficulty. Extra moneys will have been invested, extra risks will have been run in the protected industry, and cries would immediately arise that an injustice was being done.  This question of tariffs has been grappled with in this country in a satisfactory fashion.  A tribunal which has given, I believe, to the majority of the people entire satisfaction has been set up, is deliberating, is doing good work for the country, and there is no reason why either its constitution or its personnel should be altered at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened with great interest to the magnificent plea which the Minister for Justice has put up for the civil servants.  He accuses the Fianna Fáil Party of charging the members of the Tariff Commission and of the Civil Service generally of dishonesty. I might as well say that the Civil Service, when they publish a periodical and devote a column or two to describing the tremendous inconvenience, trouble and expense that Deputies on this side are putting the State to in asking questions, are impugning members of this Party.  The case is just as apposite.  The Minister has stated on several occasions that we were charging the Executive Council with having tampered with the Tariff Commission.  The origin of the Tariff Commission is too well known to the <Col N="419" /> members on this side of the House, who are interested in this question, to bear out the Minister's allegation.  We know that when the policy of protection was first mooted the associates of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;the new alliance which it had formed for itself &mdash;were very anxious that the protection policy should not be gone on with. There was fortunately a strong national element in the Cumann na nGaedheal Party which wanted a definite policy for the protection and development of Irish industries.  That element gathered strength throughout the country by its propaganda and by the fact that it stood on the old Sinn Fein platform of a self-contained and a developing Ireland.  Therefore, when a crisis was likely to emerge, and when the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was divided in its counsels, and the new alliance and the new people who had joined it were anxious that no steps should be taken by the Government to interfere with British trade control of this country, with the British distributors, and the control that British trade interests held here, this Tariff Commission was set up.  It was expected by the national element that it would be a commission independent of political influence, which would calmly and judiciously examine the whole problem of the industries of the country, and take as its foundation a definite programme for the prevention as far as possible of the importation of foreign articles into this country; not that the Tribunal or Commission would take as its basis that the British fiscal system still existed here; that we were only going to depart from it in certain exceptional circumstances, and that any industry which sought protection would have to be put upon its trial in public, would have to prove its case as an isolated industry before it could get assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the Tariff Commission themselves have said quite recently that it is impossible for isolated industries to put up a case, that the whole industry and agriculture of the country is inter-dependent, and, in the words of Mr. Whelehan, one of the members of the Tariff Commission: &ldquo;You do not know where one industry <Col N="420" /> ends and another begins.&rdquo;  All the more reason for knowing definitely what was the policy behind this Tariff Commission, what was the Government's idea.  Were they definitely out to accept the protectionist idea, or were they simply establishing a stop-gap, which they are now modifying because the altered circumstances in the country and the presence of this Party in the House have made them advance from experimental to what they call selective protection? Selective protection we are all in favour of.  It has never, I think, been contended by anybody that protection should cover raw materials, or that a tariff should be put upon them.  But what we are interested in is to know what is the policy which these civil servants, this Tariff Commission, must have in mind and which must considerably influence them.  What is the exact policy of the Government?  Does it stand for protection or does it not?</P>
    <P>The nomination of the Tariff Commission was made by three Ministers. The Ministers may have made the best choice possible, and the three civil servants selected may be the very best men possible for the job.  But other countries have seen fit in setting up tariff boards, as in the case of Canada and Australia, to include representatives of trade and commerce.  In this country, I think, any Deputy who approaches the question with an open mind will agree that civil servants cannot, in the nature of things, have the same knowledge of conditions in the country as an independent representative of the agricultural industry or of commerce generally would have.</P>
    <P>Therefore Deputy Lemass's proposal that the Tariff Commission should not be confined to civil servants, but should include representatives of trade and industry and agriculture, is one that deserves support.  The question of the independence of civil servants in dealing with this matter is a very important one.  We know that in tackling protection it is not the cost of living that is the really important question. The Minister for Finance, speaking upon the question of protection, spoke at great length of the burden that would be put upon the consumer under <Col N="421" /> a protectionist policy.  Strange that in every other country in the world that is not accepted as a sufficient argument against protection.  We know that there are other elements in the situation.  There is chiefly the freemasonry of interest between the bankers and the importers, the shipping interest and all the rest of them against Irish trade and industry. These do not want Irish industries to develop.  They want to maintain England's hold here, and accordingly they are sending flour into this country at a lower price than they are selling it in Liverpool.  Yet we hear Deputies getting up here and suggesting that the claim of the Irish flour millers is unfair and unjust and likely to put an undue cost on flour when they know that for very many years the English flour milling industry has been exporting flour to this country at a price probably below their own cost of production. That is a matter that ought to be considered.  There is, further, the question of the exportation of our population and the drain on our wealth.  Are we definitely in favour of the present policy under which the land is being depopulated and our industries are being crushed by foreign competition?  If we are to endeavour to put a stop to that we must definitely stand for a rigid protectionist policy.</P>
    <P>The Labour amendment suggests that it ought to be the duty of the Tariff Commission to look into the question of working conditions.  I take it that one of the primary objects of the Tariff Commission would be to see that foreign dumping combines and concerns could not continue to dump their materials in this country, which, if allowed to continue, must inevitably mean that the Irish farmer will be reduced to the same standard of living as the Russian who is producing cheap barley, or that the Dublin operative will be reduced to the same standard of living as the worker in the factories where English shoddy is made and sent to this country, or that the producers of bacon will be reduced to the same standard of living as the Chinese.</P>
    <P>And that reminds me that the Ministry in their statements in this House have given the show away on themselves and have proved that they <Col N="422" /> have not approached this question judicially, and have not kept an open mind upon it, and that in the nature of things the Tariff Commission cannot be independent because the issue to them must appear already pre-judged.  On a certain celebrated occasion when this question was first being discussed in the country the President referred to the business men of Dublin as old fossils and antiquated furniture.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a definite statement here that if a tariff was imposed on flour a certain industry would leave the city.  It was shown in the debate here before the adjournment that that statement had not been made by a representative of the firm.  The statement that was made was that if there were fresh restrictions put upon them they would have to consider the question of leaving Dublin.  It was pointed out that the firm could receive special treatment, that they could receive a rebate, and that special arrangements could be made to deal with their case.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce came here and definitely quoted that as an argument against the protection of flour.  I need not go into his reference which, in my opinion, was in the worst possible taste, about the slovenliness of certain business men, who are not satisfied with the findings of the Commission.  Then we had a long string of phrases referring to interests, concessions, interested parties and disinterested parties.  Deputy Gorey, who was a disinterested party when he was leader of the Farmers' Party, when under some strange influence he gave up the protectionist idea which he held when he first came into this House, is now a person looking for special concessions and an interested party because he is looking for a tariff on bacon.</P>

      <P>There is the important point that the Executive Council will not refer to the Tariff Commission any case for protection for an industry; representation must be made by a body of persons who substantially represent those engaged in the industry, and if such representation is made the Minister may, in his wisdom, refer the matter to the Tariff Commission.  What is the position of the farmers on this matter? Is the Minister for Agriculture to represent them?  Is the Farmers' Party, that &ldquo;nucleus of enlightened opinion,&rdquo; as Deputy Heffernan called it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to decide the matter? There was at one time an Agricultural Council in existence which was entitled to speak with some authority on behalf of the farmers.  At present there is no such body, and because the farmers had the audacity to call a grain conference, under the auspices of the County Committees of Agriculture. Deputy Gorey is very worth that certain gentlemen put forward certain proposals there.  One proposal was put forward there which could not be considered by the Tariff Commission as at present constituted, a question that will have to be tackled somehow if the industry is to be put on proper footing. That is the question of the provision of granaries and of finding facilities for the growers of barley and cereal crops. That proposal was put forward by members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party themselves; it was passed by the grain conference, and it is a question in which every farmer must be interested. Still, it is at present quite outside the scope of the Tariff Commission.  I can see no reason why, in the same way as the Government has given a guaranteed price to the beet industry and has endeavoured to bring the dairying industry to a point where a guaranteed price will be possible, it ought not also <Col N="424" /> to work towards the policy of giving a guaranteed price to the Irish farmer for his produce.</P>
      <P>The whole discussion in this House on the question of the Tariff Commission has been concerned, not with the interests of the farmers or the producers, but with the interests of the middlemen, the distributors.  The very people who in this House talk most about the cost of living are, strange to say, themselves the biggest profiteering element, and they are the people who are grinding down the farmers.  I cannot see how the Tariff Commission can ever make things right unless it is in a position to discuss this whole question of distribution in relation to farming and to put a stop to the present situation by which prices are constantly falling, taxation is increasing, and the agricultural industry is contributing an ever-increasing proportion of its income for the upkeep of the administration.</P>
      <P>I hope that the good example we had yesterday of taking off the Whips will be followed when this motion is put to a division, and that the Deputies on the opposite benches who stand for a protectionist policy, for the protection of the farmer as well as the manufacturer, against unfair foreign competition, against dumping by foreign combines, will take their courage in their hands and stand by the policy of Arthur Griffith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an amount of subtle irrelevance about the arguments used in this debate that makes it very difficult for an ordinary person to understand what is exactly the drift of the whole matter.  We started off with amendments which have for their object the setting aside of the Tariff Commission, as at present constituted, and the substitution for that of a Commission which is very vaguely and very uncertainly defined, the arguments in support of the setting up of which Commission being still more vague and uncertain.  It requires a considerable amount of study to get at the real gravamen of the charges against the present Tariff Commission. One has to put aside a large number of other charges, not only against the Tariff Commission but against the <Col N="425" /> Government and against things in general, before one can get at these arguments. I do not know whether I am in order in referring to Deputy Hugo Flinn, but he adopted the attitude that the Tariff Commission ought to be changed and ought to be condemned because the Government is an impudent Government, a libellous Government, a calumniating Government and, in general, a calamitous Government altogether. That is an argument that might carry a certain amount of weight in certain parts of the country and at a certain type of public meeting, but it is not an argument that should be put forward seriously in a serious discussion where a certain amount of order is supposed to be kept.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy Flinn was not alone in his peculiar attitude towards the subject, because Deputy Lemass himself, when he began the discussion, seemed to adopt a somewhat similar attitude.  He said that there is something radically wrong with the composition of the Tariff Commission: &ldquo;It is our opinion, of course, that it was not established to facilitate the imposition of tariffs, that the purpose of its establishment was mainly political.&rdquo; I suppose he would not agree that the purpose of its establishment was politico-economic.  If these charges have anything in them, if they are really believed by the Deputies who put them forward, then there is no need for them to attack the unfortunate members of the Tariff Commission; they have a remedy against this calamitous Government and against all this impudence that they complain of, against all this discussing of political motives under economic pretences, and so on.  They have the remedy of getting the majority of the people behind them and turning out this evil Government, and when they have done that they can proceed to rebuild the universe and establish the Tariff Commission as it ought to be established.  But until they have, I suggest that these arguments about the impudence of the Government are totally irrelevant on this discussion regarding the rights and wrongs of the Tariff Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flinn managed to confuse the issue still further by introducing a quantity of the most perverse subtlety <Col N="426" /> that I have heard for a long time in this House about the Tariff Commission being a judicial body, about matters before the Tariff Commission being <i>sub judice</i>, and about these matters being wrongfully made use of in this House on certain occasions.  It seems to me to be a complete perversion of language to describe the Tariff Commission in that fashion&mdash;to say that it is a judicial body in the sense that the High Court, for instance, is a judicial body, and to say that matters before it are <i>sub judice</i> in the same sense as matters before an ordinary court are <i>sub judice.</i>  There is no analogy whatever between the two, and arguments of that sort simply show that the Deputy's mind is either too perverse or too innocent to be able to arrive at a conclusion at all on a subject like this.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Lemass telling us how urgent is the demand in the country for protection, that &ldquo;it is the agricultural community which is most urgently in need of protection at present, and it is really most urgent in its demand for it.&rdquo;  Deputy Lemass has very frequently taken it on himself, I think more frequently than any other Deputy, to inform the House what the people of the country want.  I suppose it is because he sits near the throne in a large minority Party in the House he can speak for a large minority of the people.  Probably the real process he puts into operation is to look deep into his own heart and see there what is wrong about the needs and desires of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>We have another class of argument put forward against the Tariff Commission which is really based on the fact that it is a Tariff Commission and not something else.  That is the kind of argument that seems to me to be enshrined in the second paragraph of Deputy O'Connell's amendment.  He suggests that the Commission which he recommends should be empowered&mdash; the language is rather complicated, but I think the meaning is clear&mdash;&ldquo;to report on the probable effect of methods of assisting and protecting any industry by methods other than customs duties.&rdquo;  That means that the Tariff Commission is to report on the probable effect of doing something else for an industry besides the imposition of a <Col N="427" /> tariff.  That is to say, that it is to be something bigger than Tariff Commission. Then we have that notorious political economist, Deputy Corry, complaining about the Tariff Commission because it was not in a position to put an embargo on flour, without any reference, apparently, to any Government or anybody else, except a reference to the fact that instructions had been thundered at it by Deputy Corry.  And we have, apparently, behind the whole of this objection to the Tariff Commission a subtle, vague feeling that what is really wanted is something that can be set up as a kind of dictatorship over the heads of the Executive Council and that can be used either by the Fianna Fáil Party or by various individuals in the House or in the country to carry out whatever magnificent schemes they have in their heads for the good of the country, without any reference to the Executive Council or to anybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has progressed so far in his economic studies that he has now decided that a tariff on flour would raise the cost of living.  He thinks the remedy for that is not to refrain from putting a tariff on flour, but go further and keep flour out altogether.  He says that would not raise the cost of living. I suppose the probable effect would be to lower the cost of dying in many cases, which is, possibly, the sort of thing Deputy Corry is interested in seeing happen.  This class of argument and insinuation should be, I think, put on one side when discussing this question. We come now to what are in effect the only arguments, the only ones deserving of consideration at all in this matter, that have been put forward. One of these is the complaint that the Tariff Commission consists of part-time officials.  Deputy Lemass thinks it would be much better for the country to have five men instead of three paid full-time salaries for doing nothing else, except considering this question of the imposition of tariffs.  It seems to me that that raises some interesting speculations.  It may happen&mdash; I do not say that it necessarily would happen&mdash;that the task of investigating industrial conditions and so forth, with a view to putting on tariffs, would be <Col N="428" /> more than would be necessary to take up the time of these five men, and in that case I suppose the idea at the back of the Deputy's mind is that, having a certain amount of time on their hands, with nothing else to do, they would simply suggest the imposition of tariffs in order to fill up the vacuum.  I must say that I cannot see what other argument has been put forward in favour of making these mand that the whole-time consideration. If the work is sufficiently big to demand that the whole-time consideration of the men engaged at present in this work should be devoted to it, I do not see that there exists any obstacle at present which prevents their whole time or a large proportion of their time being devoted to it.  It seems to me very largely a question for the Government of the day.  If there is a good deal of work before the Commission, the members of the Commission can be released from other duties in order to attend to that work.  If not, it is a salutary thing that they should have something else to do to earn their salaries.  I do not think that argument is one that need worry us very much in our attitude towards the Tariff Commission. It is merely a question of detail, like the matter of the five members instead of three which the Deputy himself seems to be willing to put to one side.  It was introduced, as a matter of fact, largely because the Deputy wanted to have some alternative to the present state of affairs, and he was not very much worried what alternative he had if he had something.</P>
    <P>The only other point, and it is by far the most important one I can see in all this, is the question of the initiative whether the initiative in going into these matters should rest with the Tariff Commission, or whether the various industrial, agricultural and other interests in the country should be compelled to formulate a case before it could be brought before the Tariff Commission, or be considered.  Considering that question it seems to me that Deputy Lemass and the people who support this resolution have fallen into a very peculiar self-contradiction. Deputy Lemass says in one place:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is therefore important that <Col N="429" /> there should be on the Committee not merely civil servants, but men with a practical knowledge of agricultural and industrial conditions, which would make them useful members of that body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the point about Civil Servants.  I think it is a matter of even less importance than the number on the Commission.  What is wanted on this Commission is that we should get men who know what they are doing, men who understand the work, and whether they are Civil Servants or not does not seem to me to matter in that regard.  The point I want to emphasise in this is that the Deputy believes that these men should be men with practical knowledge of industrial and agricultural conditions. That is to say that they should not be Civil Servants but men who are either ex-farmers or ex-business men, or men actually engaged in farming or business. A little later on the Deputy says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have practical experience that there is a number of industries in which those engaged in them are convinced that if they are to be developed in this country protection is needed, but who will not themselves take the initiative in demanding protection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He therefore opposes the initiative for industrialists or agriculturalists by the argument that a large number of industrialists and agriculturalists are opposed to protection in their own interests, and in addition to that he suggests at the same time that we should remove from the Tariff Commission the civil servants who now compose it, and substitute for them agriculturalists and industrialists, who for all we may know, may be opposed to protection because they think it is against their own interests.  It seems to me that you cannot have it both ways.  You cannot object to civil servants on the Commission and insist on putting on men with practical knowledge of industry and agriculture, and at the same time object to the fact that the initiative in seeking for tariffs is put into the hands of men with practical knowledge of industry and agriculture.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>The present law simply insures that, <Col N="430" /> before the question of putting a tariff on the products of any particular industry is taken up, the men who are engaged in that industry in Ireland shall be consulted and have first voice in the matter.  I am not an industrialist, but I can say that if I were, and if a question like that was being discussed, I should think that I, and people like me, had a better right to be heard and could contribute more information in regard to it than some of the political economists on the Fianna Fáil Benches, whose only qualification for discussing such matters is that they are patriots and have the good of the country deep down in their hearts.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that, reviewing all these arguments that have been put forward, they have made no case whatever for any change in the present constitution of the Tariff Commission. There is a resolution and an amendment before us, and it is my belief that if it should happen that either or both of them were accepted the Dáil would find itself under the necessity of going into the whole matter again and trying to interpret, with great difficulty, the exact meaning of the proposals before us.  It seems to me that neither the resolution nor the amendment does anything like cover the whole case, or all the points at issue, or form any substitute for the Act which set up the Tariff Commission, or gives us any decent alternative to that Commission.  If we are going to set aside a body which has done a considerable amount of work already, and as against the success of that work no arguments have been brought forward, we should be certain before doing so that we are going to put a better body in its stead.  I do not believe that we are going to get from either the resolution or the amendment any body that will be better qualified or empowered <Col N="431" /> to do better work than that which the Tariff Commission is doing at present.</P>

      <P>I think that one of the reasons for putting forward the resolution and the amendment was a feeling of impatience, a very natural feeling.  Within the past few weeks in this country we have lost, at least, two very important industries.  The Cork Spinning and Weaving Factory, which at one time employed 1,000 people, with machinery valued probably at £100,000, sold that machinery the other day as scrap.  I am sure that it would be small consolation to the unfortunate people who were employed there to listen to some of the arguments put forward here on both sides.  Their industry is gone, but it would have been saved if some protection had been afforded to it a year or two ago.  The Kilkenny Woollen Mills have closed down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>They are closed at any rate and the people there are out of employment while this country is being flooded with materials made in Scotland and in England which should have been made in Kilkenny.  That is very poor consolation to the employees of that factory who are out of employment, and it would be a good thing if work could be found for them.  I know something about the leather industry, and I know that in my time this country had a considerable number of tanneries.  Now we have only one or two tanneries left.  A tannery closed a few weeks ago in New Ross.  Though it was a small industry, employing only a few men, it meant something in the way of employment.  One reason why I am in favour of a tariff policy is that it would probably prevent such things as I have mentioned happening.  I see the danger put forward from the other side of the House, that it might increase the cost of living, but if the cost of living did increase and if there were increased employment and increased circulation of money, it would not be a bad thing.  In this country, when the cost of living was at its peak, people were better off than they are to-day&mdash;<Col N="432" /> there was more money in circulation, and there was more employment.  It would be better if you could bring back that state of affairs, as we are gradually going down and people are leaving the country day after day.  We would be doing good work if we could speed up the operations of the Tariff Commission, and I think the resolution, if adopted, would have that effect and would tend to stop emigration.</P>

      <P>As a farmer I am opposed to the appointment of a Tariff Commission with powers to investigate the farming industry.  Deputy Lemass in introducing his motion, said: &ldquo;There is the agricultural industry.  It is difficult to get agriculturists organised in order to submit a considered case to any tribunal.  The existing organisations which pretend to serve the interests of the farmers are, of course, merely graziers' organisations, and in no sense representative of the agricultural community at all.  We consider that the Commission should have power to examine the conditions existing in all phases of agricultural work and, if necessary, recommend to the Dáil that a protectionist policy should be embarked upon.&rdquo;  They would recommend tariffs to us whether we wanted them or not.  As a practical farmer I would prefer the opinion of the organisations we have to the opinions of theorists representing industrial centres as regards the medicine that is good for us.  Why do they require this Tariff Commission?  In the beginning of the last Session we were asked to see an Ireland with a high tariff wall built all around it.  It struck me that perhaps the reason for the motion and the amendment was that there were only three members on the tariff tribunal; that they are only part-time <Col N="433" /> officers and were not building quickly enough, and that a Commission of five, working whole time, would in a short period build around the country a wall that you could neither see over nor through.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned, I do not want to make any charges against the personnel of the present Tariff Commission.  What I want is to have them placed in a position so that they will not be showing their impotency, if one might say so, day after day.  I, and also the mover of the motion and of the amendment, want to have the present Tariff Commission given more power.  The Deputy who has just spoken would object to any investigations being made into the farming industry.  He says he prefers to rely on the organisations they have for any advice.  I think that some years ago, when inspectors were sent out from the Department of Agriculture, a similar resentment was felt by the farming community to what they now profess to feel regarding the suggestion that an examination should be held by a Tariff Commission into their industry.  I believe if the farmers would only try to analyse the situation fairly they would find that it would be to their advantage that something should be done by the way of a Tariff Commission to develop their industry. Deputy Byrne the other day said that people who are running an industry know far more about it than any member of a Tariff Commission could, and that he would resent any interference with the particular industry in which he is interested.  I and other people know that there are industries in this country that are being mismanaged to a terrible extent.  I believe if the country is to be put in a proper position that a Commission, such as the Tariff Commission, should have power to investigate conditions under which industries are being worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in this country who control industries who are satisfied to make a certain amount of money every year, and who only want to be able to look after themselves.  They have no interest in the country as a whole, and it is because of that we ask for the Tariff Commission to give them more <Col N="434" /> powers.  I have been much interested in the cement industry for the last two or three years.  Some ten years ago an English syndicate bought the Drinagh cement works in my county. Could anybody imagine these people asking for protection for that industry? They did not want it.  They bought that industry to control the market in Ireland, and to find a better market for the products of their factories on the other side.  A conference was held which was attended by the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and representatives of the Portland Cement Company, and these people asked not for protection for the cement manufactured at Drinagh but a monopoly for the English article as against the French and Belgian article, though these articles are a great deal cheaper than the English one. One must realise that in regard to many firms in this country there are certain English influences at work.  We know that a number of soap factories have been purchased recently by these syndicates and we know these people will never come forward to a Tariff Commission and ask for protection for that particular industry.  We do not know all the influences at work behind the scenes.  When we were discussing unemployment in the debate which took place last November the question of the importation of foreign capital was referred to.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with that question now, as I suppose I would not be in order in doing so, but I wish to tell the House that in my constituency there is an agricultural implement manufacturing industry.  The manager, or proprietor, of that firm was approached recently to know why he would not apply for protection.  He said the reason was that if he did so some of the English people would come to Dublin, or somewhere else, and establish an industry which would do him a great deal of harm.  I submit if that were to take place it would be of no benefit to the country.  There is no use in providing employment in Dublin at the expense of Wexford, or vice versa.  These are questions that ought to be examined carefully by any Commission set up.  I believe that if the Government would try to get out of the <Col N="435" /> groove they are in on this matter in paying more concern to a vindication of a policy they had in mind when they got the Bill through the Dáil rather than to the realities of the situation that confront them we would get along better. I see no reason why there should not be accomodation found between the mover of the motion, the mover of the amendment, and the Government on this issue.  We must take it that everybody is anxious to see the industries of the country developed.  If we approach the matter from that angle, and give the present Tariff Commission a little more power to examine every industry in the country, regardless of whether the proprietor of that industry wants it or not, I believe we will make this a better and more prosperous country in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. BOLAND Mr. G. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been charged with the suggestion that the members of the present Tariff Commission are men of dishonour.  The Minister for Justice used words to that effect.  Another Deputy, Deputy Tierney, said that this Commission was not a judicial body.  Section 5 of the Act says that it is a judicial body and has all the powers of the High Court.  As it has those powers, and as a Minister has said that civil servants are removable at will.  I think a good case has been made for substituting that body by another.  The Minister for Justice also said that in cases of new industries being set up something could be done, as has been done in the case of the Carlow sugar beet factory.  But what about the industries that are dying? We have been told that there is no machinery, and I believe that there is not, by which the agricultural industry could make a case for itself.  I will speak about an industry about which I know something, namely, the iron industry. In the Saorstát there is practically no iron industry, and the only one we had was the manufacture of railway engines, as well as boilers and other parts of engines.  About twenty years ago there were three good repair shops in Dublin.  I worked in one of them myself.  There were numerous craftsmen of all descriptions employed, and I also know that the principal <Col N="436" /> managers of these railways were people whose interests were centred more in Leeds than in Dublin or Ireland.  As in the case of the Drinagh Cement Factory, does anybody think that these gentlemen are going to come here and ask for protection for railway engines, seeing that there is no manufacturer of railway engines but the railway companies alone?  The really important point in this resolution is that it will give the initiative to the Tariff Commission which it has not got at present, and I say that if the Tariff Commission does not get these powers it will simply be useless.  It has been practically useless up to the present.  Anyone who knows anything about railway working knows that the iron manufacture in connection with the railway industry is dying out, and the same applies to coach building.  I remember coaches being built when we were loyal citizens. His Majesty King George the Fifth came over, and they built a railway coach there that could not be surpassed anywhere, and at a price that could compare with anything that could be imported.  The people who run these railways are the tools of the financial gangs in England, whose representatives in this House have, up to the present, dictated the policy of the Executive Council.  They would not have it otherwise.  I hope we have come to the stage now when the Executive Council will shake itself free of that influence and work for the interests of Ireland and not for the interests of British Imperialism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In the proposal put forward from the Fianna Fáil benches, <Col N="437" /> and in the amendment put forward by the Labour Party, there are a number of points of agreement.  I think the first outstanding point of agreement between the two proposals is that they both aim at setting up a whole-time Tariff Commission.  There is also a similarity between the two proposals with regard to the constitution of that Committee&mdash;that it should consist of five members.  Let us examine for a moment the problem that would be before such a Commission.  The industries in this country are exceedingly limited.  A number of those industries have already had tariffs applied to them.  I do not know whether any of the Deputies have taken the trouble to inquire as to the number of industries that are left to which tariffs might be applied.  That is a problem that we might have some information about when we are asked to appoint this whole-time Commission.  If my knowledge of industry serves me rightly, there are only twenty to twenty-five industries left to which tariffs might be applied.  For the purpose of dealing with twenty to twenty-five industries we are asked to set up a whole-time Commission of five impartial representatives to deal with the problem.  Is that a reasonable proposal?  I am not a lawyer, but if I were to suggest that five additional judges should be set up in the Saorstát to deal with twenty-five cases that were pending, I do not know what some Deputies on the other side would say with regard to my mentality. What would happen to this whole-time Commission when its duty would cease in the near future?  Supposing we allocated a week to every particular industry and allocated these five impartial judges to deal with them, I presume that would be a fair allocation of time.  That would mean that we would have work for this Commission for six months.  These men are to be pensioned for all time after six months' work.  That is the proposal of a Party that is going in for a reduction in expenditure&mdash;to set up a whole-time Commission for whom there is six months' work.  I would like some more information on that point, and I am sure the House would like some more information <Col N="438" /> put before it before it could approve of a proposal of that kind.</P>
      <P>The next point of importance in these two proposals is that the Government should be empowered to go into any industry and to regulate the fiscal conditions that shall apply to that industry. Many Deputies in this House have spoken about the difficulty, and there is a great deal of truth in it, of getting Irish capital into Irish industry. Let us take the industry that we were discussing this morning&mdash;the beet sugar industry.  Supposing the Government had contemplated, and it had been urged on the Government by an important section of the people, that they should bring in an Act empowering them to go into that particular industry and regulate the conditions governing it and interfere with its whole outlook and trade, supposing such a proposal were before the minds of those capitalists who put the money into that particular industry, does anyone think for one moment that under these conditions you will induce business men to invest a half million of capital in an industry whose business might be destroyed in a month or in three months' time?  Do Deputies realise what it means to a business to upset the fiscal conditions governing that industry?  It means that the whole of the money that is invested in that industry may become useless and worthless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the proposals before us, and I will keep as closely as possible to these proposals. I want the Deputies to realise what is contained in those proposals before they vote on them.  If we are going to have business industries in this country surrounded by this liability, that at any moment the State may walk into that particular industry, and, as I say, upset its whole business, how are we going to get money invested in industries under those circumstances, and if we cannot get money invested in these industries, how are we going to get employment for our people?  The one <Col N="439" /> hangs on the other.  That is an aspect of this problem that I would like to see considered seriously by the House. The third proposal contained in this amendment is that the Government is to regulate the working conditions governing the industry.  Every industry, as we know it to-day in this country of ours, has its conditions and wages governed by its economic surroundings. What any competitive industry can afford to pay in the matter of wages is regulated by its economic surroundings.  If the State is to go in and regulate the conditions in these particular industries without any reference at all to their economic surroundings, then no industry could exist.  Therefore, I say that that proposal, like the other two proposals, is impossible if we would like to see that form of development in industrial matters in this country that most of us are anxious to see.  As one listened to the speeches that have been delivered on these two proposals, and bearing in mind the speeches that were delivered last session on exactly the same subject of tariffs, one was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Quite so.  It does appear to me that discussions of this kind are not going to help industry.  These discussions not alone unsettle the surroundings of industry, but they unsettle the minds of those engaged in industry, and that is very unfortunate. I think if we could bring this particular matter that has engaged the Dáil the greater part of its time during the last six months to an end with these proposals, it would be very desirable in the interests of the country.  This unsettlement is not good for any of us, and the longer it continues, I am quite satisfied, the longer its influence on industry will be felt.  There is one aspect that I would like Deputies to bear in mind, and it has been referred to by a number of Deputies.  They have <Col N="440" /> admitted that the application of tariffs by this Commission will increase the cost of living.  That has been referred to by Deputy after Deputy.  I only want to say in that connection that the difference between the cost living in this country, and the cost of living in an adjoining country has reached a serious figure.</P>

      <P>In the constituency I represent that is not the opinion.  The present Commission appears to be satisfactory to most of us.  Its chief fault in the eyes of the Opposition is that it is moving too slowly, that it is giving too much time and attention to this very important matter of fiscal reform.  In addition we are asked to scrap this Commission and set up a Commission with the additional powers that it can on its own initiative inquire into the condition of any industry in this country which it thinks might need a tariff.  If this resolution is passed, then in four or five months time we may be discussing a tariff on every industry imaginable, from darning to ship-building. One can imagine what the debates in this House would develop into if that should take place.  I sincerely hope that the House will not accept that resolution. The people of this country have been too much occupied in recent years to give the necessary thought and consideration to this highly important subject. There is no apparent desire, at least amongst the members of the agricultural community, that this matter should be rushed.  I leave aside altogether the question whether they desire that it should be scrapped.  At any rate, <Col N="442" /> there is no desire amongst the majority of the people that I represent that this matter should be rushed.  Somebody said a moment ago that tariffs raise prices.

      <P>Deputy Boland in endeavouring to prove the inadequacy of the present Tariff Commission, referred to the fact that at one time he was engaged in the manufacture of railway engines and railway coaches, and that since his valuable assistance in that industry has been withdrawn the industry has languished and the railway engines and railway <Col N="443" /> coaches are now supplied from Leeds. Just over a fortnight ago I was getting into a railway coach at Rome, the capital of Italy, a country that has a high tariff and in which the railways are controlled by the State.  When getting into the coach I happened to notice that it was made in certain works.  I have forgotten the name of the works.  In any event I am not disposed to give the works a free advertisement, but the coach was made in Leeds.  I assume that was due to the fact that Leeds was able to supply the coach at a satisfactory price.  Of course, Deputy Boland would have found another reason.  He would have found that Signor Mussolini, the Prime Minister of Italy, was under the influence of the hidden hand and had no power of his own and no mind of his own, and that he moved at the actuation of England.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure, and to prove it I can give the day and date and the hour at which I entered the coach.  I entered the coach in Rome shortly before noon on Wednesday, the 9th February.  The coach was made in Leeds and was run over the Italian railways.  It is facts that should decide this question.  I do not want to discuss the general question of tariffs because I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would not allow me, but I do submit that there is a little misunderstanding on this question.  The speech of Deputy Dr. Ryan on the night before last shows that he realises that there are inconveniences attached to tariffs, and he argued that we ought to have a different Tariff Commission because of two inconveniences that he was aware of.  In one case I think it happened that goods were sent outside the Saorstát on approval and duty had to be paid on them on their return. That, I submit, is not any indictment against the Tariff Commission.  As a matter of fact, both these tariffs, about which Deputy Ryan complained, were imposed before the Tariff Commission came into existence at all.  The Deputy was confusing the functions of the Tariff Commission with the functions <Col N="444" /> of the Revenue Commissioners.  If you are going to set up a Tariff Commission, and if that Commission will have to look into every complaint against the existing tariffs, then, indeed, this is not going to be a whole-time job, but an overtime job.  In any event, to look into these complaints is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and not for the Tariff Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the Tariff Commission, as I understand it, though they may be extended by this motion, would not be materially altered.  The function of the Tariff Commission at the present time is to examine, from the economic point of view, every application for a tariff and to see what extra employment it would give, what revenue it would yield, and so on.  It is equally important, though this point has not been emphasised by Deputies on the opposite benches, that the Tariff Commission should examine objections from other manufacturers and other industries in the Saorstát to applications for tariffs when made.  Any Deputy who has been in the Dáil for some time must have realised that the question of tariffs is bound to affect other branches of industry.  The Tariff Commission is there to examine those objections.  Before we had the Tariff Commission Deputies were continually receiving complaints.  Take one instance. A tariff was imposed on glass bottles.  There are several manufacturers of ink in the Saorstát who require empty bottles.  They employ probably as many men as the manufacturers of glass bottles.  They complained bitterly that their trade was hampered because they had to pay an increased price on the glass bottles they got, while the Englishman could send glass bottles in here duty free.  There is an application before the Tariff Commission at present for a tariff on flour. The manufacturers of biscuits in Deputy Lemass's constituency think that they would be very much affected by a tax on flour, and they have made their objection before the Tariff Commission. The fact that the Tariff Commission is there enables them to go before it and make their objection. The Tariff Commission is in a position to hear objections when an application is made for a tariff.  I am not clear <Col N="445" /> as to how far that is contemplated by Deputy Lemass's motion, but I think that Deputy O'Connell proposes to leave the Tariff Commission with all its present powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the reasons I am going into all these details which otherwise might be out of order.  Deputy O'Connell proposes to leave them with their present powers. Deputy Lemass is not clear whether they should have these powers or not Deputy Lemass condemns the Tariff Commission, but matters affecting large sums of money and matters affecting considerable employment cannot be dealt with in a Stop Press spirit.  They can only be dealt with after some consideration and after some caution.  It would be unwise to act otherwise.  He suggests that the present Tariff Commission should be replaced by a Commission consisting of five members. Deputy Lemass does not say whether they will be whole-time or part-time officials, or whether they can engage in an ordinary business occupation, or whether they will give their whole-time to the business.  It is important that we should know that, because if they are whole-time members they will have to be paid, and their office being an important one, which has to deal with thousands of pounds of State revenue and hundreds of thousands of pounds in private enterprise, they will have to be paid in some relation to the importance of their office.  Then Deputies will be able to go to the country and talk about big salaries and unnecessary posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five unnecessary posts Deputy Lemass wants to create&mdash;five more posts which will presumably require to be paid posts.  Furthermore, they will probably require to be made pensionable, as Deputy Good said, because it will not be everybody who will be qualified for this work.  They are to have a knowledge of agricultural and industrial conditions&mdash;&ldquo;agricultural and industrial,&rdquo; not &ldquo;agricultural or industrial.&rdquo; We must have a man who knows both agriculture and industry. There are not very many such men in <Col N="446" /> this country.  I know one such man who is at the head of an important business, and he is also a practical farmer.  I think his present salary is in the neighbourhood of £2,000 a year, and so Deputy Lemass will have to pay him that much to detach him from his present business.  Then if he is detached he will not satisfy the Deputy, because he objects to tariffs in any shape or form.  There may, perhaps, be twelve men in the State who are qualified to hold a position of this kind by reason of their having a knowledge of agricultural and industrial conditions. There are men who have knowledge of agricultural conditions in the country as a whole, and yet they may know nothing of agricultural conditions in a particular part of the country.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in this country is singularly diversified.  There is very little in common between the large farmer who grows barley in Wicklow or Wexford and the small farmer in Leitrim or Mayo.  There is not much interest in common between the small farmer who raises store cattle in the West and a grazier in Meath.  Only in very exceptional cases will you get a man who has a knowledge of agricultural conditions in all parts of the country.  The officials of the Department of Agriculture may, perhaps, possess such knowledge, but I do not know any other set of men who do.  You may get a man who has a knowledge of agriculture in Mayo or Sligo, but a man who has a general knowledge of agricultural conditions spread over the whole country is very hard to find.</P>
    <P>Even if you leave the question of industrial knowledge in abeyance, five men will hardly cover the whole thing.  Then one has to be a qualified accountant.  I confess I do not know any qualified accountants who are farmers in their spare time.  The next statement is that they have to be appointed by the Executive Council with the approval of the Dáil.  That is to say, that every name is to be brought up on motion in the Dáil: &ldquo;That the Dáil approve of the appointment of Mr. So-and-so as a member of the Tariff Commission.&rdquo;  Then it has to be debated.  After nearly five years' experience of the Dáil I can say that the <Col N="447" /> Dáil holds a very high rank in the deliberative assemblies of the world, but this Dáil, as every other deliberative assembly, appears at its worst on a personal question.  Whether it be the appointment of a sub-postmaster or the appointment of a Tariff Commissioner, the debate is not edifying and is not calculated to enhance our reputations in the eyes of the world.  It will also prove an almost insuperable deterrent to the kind of man whom you want to appoint if he knows that his appointment can be debated in the Dáil, that every member of the Dáil can attack him, can say that he did so and so in a strike, or that he locked out his men.  Any amount of mud that any individual wishes to throw, can be thrown at him.  You will not get a man in the highest position in the country to undergo that ordeal.</P>
    <P>That condition of Deputy Lemass's motion alone would make this proposition a weak one.  There is the precedent for it in the appointment of a Minister and the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Ministers are here to answer for themselves, but as has been already pointed out, the Tariff Commissioner will not be here to answer for himself and will not be able to make his own case.  I think that in itself is a very serious objection to Deputy Lemass's proposal. There is one feature which Deputy Lemass's motion had in common with Deputy O'Connell's, and I propose to consider it when I have dealt with Deputy O'Connell's.  That is, to investigate the conditions which exist in industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I make a general and detailed statement on the regrettable outbreak of foot and mouth disease which occurred near the town of Wexford last week, I would preface my remarks by saying that I am glad to inform the Dáil that up to the present there have been no unfavourable developments.  The local authority veterinary inspector for Wexford district telephoned the Department at mid-day on Thursday, the 16th instant, that he had been called by Mr. Jonathan Jones, of Park, near Wexford town, to examine some sick animals; that he had seen the animals, and thought it was advisable that the animals in question should be seen and examined by an inspector of the Department. The portal inspector in charge at Waterford port was immediately instructed to proceed at once by motor to the premises.  The director of the Department's Veterinary Research Station was also instructed to proceed forthwith by motor to examine the animals, and to report to the Department. Shortly after 7 o'clock the latter reported by telephone to the Department that he considered the case a suspicious one and that he had issued all appropriate restriction notices.  The Chief Veterinary Inspector was instructed to proceed at once to Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About noon on Friday this officer confirmed to the Department that it was a case of foot and mouth disease, and at once a corps of veterinary inspectors, in charge of the superintending veterinary officer, was sent by motor to the scene of the outbreak.  A stand-still order was made applying to the whole County of Wexford as a special precaution, and a further order was made in this instance, purely as an additional safeguard, forbidding the holding of markets and fairs in the surrounding Counties of Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Wicklow.  On Saturday it was thought well, as an extra safeguard for the live stock industry, <Col N="449" /> to prevent by order the sending of any animals from these four counties to the Munster Agricultural Society's Show and sale of breeding stock at Cork on the 22nd and 23rd instant.</P>
    <P>All the live stock, save, of course, horses, on the infected premises, namely, 27 cattle, 23 swine, were slaughtered and buried on Saturday, the 18th instant.  Post mortem examination of these animals showed that 13 cattle and 4 swine were affected with foot and mouth disease.  In-contact animals, though healthy, on neighbouring premises, to the number of 44 cattle, 33 pigs and 1 goat, were slaughtered on Tuesday, the 21st instant. The usual restrictions applicable to a radius of five miles of the infected premises came into operation immediately the outbreak was confirmed. These restrictions and those already mentioned, which were applicable to the entire County of Wexford, entailed the making of provision for the movement by licence of animals intended for immediate slaughter for the meat supply in the county.  This need was met by the location at Wexford, New Ross, Enniscorthy, and Gorey of inspectors charged with the duty of issuing such licences.  Before animals can be moved under these licences all the stock on the farms whence they come must be examined by a veterinary inspector.  Upwards of 5,000 animals in County Wexford have been examined by the investigating and licensing inspectors, and all have been found free from disease.  Animals moved from County Wexford since the 1st instant to destinations in other counties in An Saorstát, so far as already traced and examined, have been found to be likewise free from disease.</P>
    <P>The Department have strong hopes that the outbreak may prove to be an isolated one, but having regard to the nature of the disease and the history of previous outbreaks in this country and elsewhere, the time has not yet arrived for any relaxation of the restrictions which presently obtain in County Wexford. I would point out that it is not unusual for a so-called secondary outbreak to occur even after a lapse of <Col N="450" /> more than a fortnight from the date of the initial outbreak.  The Department have to-day made an order which frees the Counties of Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow, and Wicklow from all restrictions from 11 o'clock to-night.  This will enable bulls and boars entered from those counties for the Royal Dublin Society's Show and Sale on Tuesday and Wednesday next to travel to Ballsbridge on and after to-morrow. Arrangements will, unless unfavourable developments intervene, be made for the movement of bulls and boars from that show and sale under special licences into County Wexford next week.  The new order made to-day will permit the resumption of fairs and markets in the four counties adjoining County Wexford as from to-morrow, Saturday.</P>
    <P>The British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries notified the Department on Tuesday last that they were prepared to allow the landing of live stock for slaughter within 96 hours at the landing places at Glasgow, Birkenhead and Manchester from all Irish ports save the port of Waterford and the ports in County Wexford.  On the following day the British Ministry added Holyhead and Fishguard to the list of British landing places at which animals from the Irish ports might be landed for slaughter within 96 hours.  I may say that the Department have had the whole-hearted and loyal co-operation of all concerned in their efforts to control the outbreak.  I would take this opportunity of acknowledging the ready and valuable assistance which the Department have received from the Gárda Síochána who, immediately the outbreak was confirmed, sent reinforcements into County Wexford and immediately instituted and have since maintained a rigorous watch on the boundaries of that county by means of a special contact patrol system which operates day and night.  The Department's own staff, technical and administrative, have, needless to say, spared no pains to control the outbreak.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4 p.m. to Wednesday, 29th February, at 3 p.m.</P>
