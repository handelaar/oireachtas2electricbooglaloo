      <P>No decision has yet been arrived at by the Government as to its future policy with regard to the Trustee Savings Banks in the Saorstát. It will be necessary, when occasion permits, to, introduce legislation to clear up the present anomalous position of these Banks.  The Trustee Savings Banks will, however, be afforded an opportunity of placing their views before the Government before the introduction of such legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say if there were any others that were not paid, but the recommendations were acted on in several cases.  The recommendations were generally made where very real hardship was caused by the fact that goods or property had been lost or destroyed, and compensation could not be obtained under the Terms of Reference.  There were many cases of very great hardship which did not come within the Terms of Reference, and in which no recommendations were made by the Committee.  In this case I do not think there was any real hardship.</P>

      <P>I have previously had notices, warning the public against any interference with the transmission lines, posted at all the schools, provincial Government offices, offices of local authorities, Gárda Síochána barracks, and in the immediate vicinity of the transmission line poles.  An enamelled plate containing a warning notice is affixed to every pole as soon as the painting of it has been completed.  In addition, copies of the warning notice and an explanatory memorandum have been issued to managers and teachers of National Schools with a request to have its terms brought specially under the notice of the school children, and to the Department's field engineers for distribution, particularly in those districts where much mischievous damage to the installation has been done.  In districts where the cables have been strung, the co-operation of the clergy has been invited in impressing the danger on the public.</P>
      <P>I take this special opportunity of giving a deliberate and solemn warning that power is about to be transmitted over a wide area of which the approximate boundaries lie between Dublin South via Bray and Enniscorthy to Wexford, from Wexford to the West through New Ross to Waterford, from Waterford by Kilkenny and Carlow to Maryborough and then from Maryborough back to Dublin.  Roughly the whole South-East quarter of Ireland is involved.</P>
      <P>Since no interference with the transmission lines is justified I hope that no one will consider that such interference is safe at a place not mentioned in my description of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; area, which is necessarily approximate. I wish it to be known by everyone, parents of children especially, that while there is absolutely no danger from the transmission system, if it is left alone, any interference now with lines that are &ldquo;live&rdquo; means almost certain death.</P>

      <P>Both the Caulfield and Rodney Estates, which adjoin, were purchased by the late Congested Districts Board many years ago, and <Col N="181" /> large sums were expended on improvements on both estates by the Board. The holdings of the tenants on both estates have since been vested in them. The turbary allotted to the Rodney tenant-purchasers is situate on the Caulfield Estate, and the Board made, many years ago, when dealing with the estate, such roads as were considered necessary.  The Land Commission cannot undertake further expenditure on roads on these estates.</P>

There is no road going to it, and how does he expect the people are going to get their turf home?  They are paying 6/8 per annum for the making of this road, and is it fair that they should go on paying it when they have no road?</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for re-consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for moving that this Estimate be referred back for further consideration is in order to focus the attention of the members of this House on the magnitude of the unemployment problem prevailing right throughout the country, and in order to draw the attention of the House to the poverty and hardship occasioned thereby.  We are asked to vote a sum of £2,000.  The total sum mentioned in the Vote is £32,000.  I would like to point out that <Col N="184" /> that is only portion of the unexpended amount which was voted by this House in the last financial year.  Although the House is now being asked to vote the sum of £2,000, or in all £32,000, I would like to point out to Deputies who might be under the impression that that would go towards relieving unemployment between now and the end of this financial year that that is not the case, because the greater part of that sum, if not all, has already been expended on relief works.  One could quite understand the action of the Government in refusing to increase this particular Vote provided there was no unemployment, poverty, or destitution throughout the country.  But, as far as the present situation is concerned, we find that there are tens upon tens of thousands of people legitimately looking for work and unable to find it.  In addition to that we find that there are thousands of farmers in a state of poverty.  They are hardly able to feed and clothe their children let alone pay rents and rates or anything of that description.  We also find that there are thousands of fishermen around our seaboard and on the islands off the coast who are absolutely in a state of want, many of them in a state of destitution.</P>
    <P>As far as this particular Vote in other years is concerned, I would like to point out to the House that the attitude taken this year differs from the attitude taken in other years.  Notwithstanding the fact that unemployment, poverty, and hardship are as prevalent throughout the country at the present time as they were last year or the year before, we find that the Government are not endeavouring to deal with this problem seriously.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the House that in the year 1922-23 a total sum of £348,000 was voted by this House for relief schemes.  Out of that amount the sum of £339,647 was expended. In the year 1923-24 we find that no money was voted for relief schemes.  But that was an exceptional year, inasmuch as at that particular time the one million pounds building grant was being expended which did something at least to relieve unemployment and to help those people who were destitute and required help.  In <Col N="185" /> the year 1924-25 we find that there was an original estimate of £250,000. There was a Supplementary Estimate of another £250,000, making a total Vote for the year £500,000.  Out of that £500,000 we find that in that financial year a sum of £380,596 was actually expended on relief schemes. In the year 1925-26, we find that there was £370,000 voted by this House for relief schemes.  Out of that, a sum of £336,465 was actually expended. In the year 1926-27, £50,000 was voted by this House and out of that amount £30,447 was expended.  Last year, as a result of the motion in regard to unemployment moved by this Party, the Government were compelled to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for a sum of £150,000.  Out of that £150,000 £118,000 was expended up to the 31st March last.</P>
    <P>As far as this year is concerned, as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we are asked to vote £32,000.  I would like to impress upon the House that practically all that £32,000 has already been expended in connection with relief work.  That means that from now until the end of this financial year no money is going to be voted by this House to relieve the unemployed, the destitute and the poor.</P>
    <P>On the 5th July last I put a question to the Minister for Finance requesting him in view of the poverty and destitution that were rampant throughout the country to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in order to relieve the situation, prior to the Summer Recess. At that time, as I pointed out, the Minister for Finance treated the whole situation with a big amount of callous indifference.  He told this House that he was not prepared to introduce a Supplementary Estimate.  Being dissatisfied with the reply I got from the Minister, I raised the matter on the adjournment and the Minister stated on the adjournment that while he was not prepared to introduce a Supplementary Vote in order to help the poor people in the country there would be a Housing Bill in the autumn which would be a Housing Bill for a longer period and which would contemplate a longer programme than any of the Housing Bills that had heretofore been <Col N="186" /> introduced.  There was a definite promise from the Minister for Finance that a Housing Bill would be introduced in the autumn which would help to relieve the situation.  Although this is the month of November and this House inside three or four weeks will be asked to adjourn for the Christmas Recess, no Bill has been introduced, and we get an assurance from the Minister that he is not going to introduce a Supplementary Vote to relieve the unemployment situation and to relieve the poverty and hardship existing amongst the small farmers and the fishermen.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister or the President will tell me, in reply, that a big lot has been done.  No doubt the President will tell us that as far as the City of Dublin is concerned building operations have gone on to a very considerable extent, and that the situation in regard to the scarcity of houses has been relieved somewhat.  But I would like to point out, especially to the President, that in the City of Dublin in the year 1913, according to the Report of the Local Government Departmental Committee, 68,100 persons were in families occupying one-room dwellings. In the year 1926 &mdash; thirteen years later according to the census taken in April of that year, the number of persons living in one-room tenements was 78,934, an increase of over 10,000.  Not less than one-fourth of the population of Dublin City consists of families housed in one-room tenements.  Again, take the County Borough of Cork.  In April, 1926, 5,537 persons were in families occupying one-room dwellings, and 14,738 were in families occupying two-room dwellings.  In the County Borough of Limerick on the same date, 4,469 were in families occupying one-room dwellings, and 9,153 persons were in families occupying two-room dwellings. I have quoted statistics in regard to Dublin City, Limerick, and Cork which should, undoubtedly, prove to Deputies that there is a great scarcity of houses.  That scarcity of houses is not confined to the places I have mentioned, because in my own constituency, as I have repeatedly brought to the notice of the House, there is a great scarcity of labourers cottages.  If the <Col N="187" /> Government had tackled this problem of housing in the way it should, and if the Minister had introduced the Bill which he promised to introduce in the autumn, my contention is that it would have helped to relieve the situation, not alone in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, but in every one of the twenty-six counties.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister for Finance or the President will tell us in reply that the Unemployment Committee dealt with this question and that certain conferences took place.  No doubt he will endeavour to camouflage the issue and to whitewash his own neglect by pointing out that the workers employed in the building trades were, to a certain extent, responsible.  I can give the House an assurance that the building trade unions will guarantee that labour in this country will give at least as good a return in house building as is obtained in England if the jobs are organised in a similar manner and if the general facilities for efficient production are equal.  Last year, when the Labour Party moved its motion in regard to unemployment, there was a Committee set up to deal with the problem. But I put it to the Minister for Finance, and I charge the Government, that up to now no employment has been given as the result of the findings of that Committee.  Again, certain recommendations were laid down in the Report of the Gaeltacht Commission.  If the Government had carried out the recommendations contained in that report in the manner which they should have done, it would have helped to a very considerable extent to relieve the unemployment situation.  It would have helped the small farmers and the fishermen in the Gaeltacht areas.  In the year 1927 there was a conference set up to deal with the question of sea fisheries. The Sea Fisheries Conference made certain recommendations.  If the Minister for Lands and Fisheries were present now, he would be able to tell the House that those recommendations have not been carried out.  If they had been carried out it would have helped to relieve the unemployment situation and it would have helped to relieve the poverty which is prevalent in the <Col N="188" /> country.  On the 9th May last, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in replying to a question by Deputy Cooney in regard to unemployment amongst women, said: &ldquo;Important aspects of the question of unemployment amongst women have already been dealt with in the Report of the Committee on Technical Education.&rdquo; There is the same story to be told about the Report of the Committee on Technical Education.  It has not been put into operation.  In addition to these recommendations made by various committees, there are at the present time a very large number of schemes in the pigeon-holes of the Land Commission which could be put into operation with beneficial results to the unemployed and to the country.  If the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would make his mind known with regard to this problem, he would be able to tell us that a large number of the local authorities of the Saorstát have been endeavouring to bring pressure to bear on his Department to get funds for financing certain schemes.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health could also tell us that yesterday, or the day before, the North Dublin Rural District Council passed a resolution calling upon the Department of Local Government, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to put into operation relief schemes, because the North Dublin Rural District Council considered that in their area such schemes were necessary in order to relieve the poverty prevailing, especially prior to Christmas.  What is true of North Dublin rural area is also true of practically every other rural area in this country.</P>
    <P>When the Ministers are dealing with this problem they will, no doubt, say that it is all right for Deputies on the Labour Benches to get up and put forward suggestions to the Minister for Finance to introduce a supplementary vote to relieve unemployment.  They will probably charge the Deputies on these benches with omitting to deal with the financial aspect of the situation. In reply to the remarks from these benches we will probably be asked: where is the money to come from?  In answer to that, I would refer <Col N="189" /> the Minister for Finance to a statement which he made on the 25th April last in reference to the Budget.  He said: &ldquo;Our credit is now such that we can borrow in the international money market on terms of which no country need be ashamed.&rdquo;  When that is put to the Minister for Finance he will probably say that it is not advisable that we should borrow, that it would increase taxation.  But on the same day that he made that speech the Minister also said: &ldquo;I am not arguing that lower taxation is necessarily the goal that should always be aimed at.  Increased taxation well spent may even give better results.&rdquo;  Surely the Minister for Finance, the Deputies on the Government Benches, and in fact all the Deputies in the House admit that money spent on schemes to relieve poverty would be money well spent&mdash; that the money is well spent if it goes to feed hungry men, women and children. I would like the Government to understand that I am not contending that relief schemes generally are going to cure the unemployment situation.  I believe they are not going to cure the unemployment situation, but, at the same time, I believe that half a loaf is better than no bread.  I believe the Government have not faced up to their responsibility in regard to this question of unemployment.  I believe they have not tackled it in the serious manner in which they should.  I believe they have endeavoured to fix it up in a sort of piece-meal fashion.  That is not going to relieve the unemployment situation throughout the country.  At the same time I believe that relief votes do some little good.  If they are able to do something to alleviate the situation in any way prior to Christmas, I hope, irrespective of what replies the Ministers give to this amendment, Deputies on the Government Benches will remember the promises they made during the last election campaign to their constituents.  They told their constituents that if they were elected to this House they would do their best to relieve the unemployment situation. They told the small farmers and the fishermen in the constituencies in which these classes were represented that they would do their best to relieve the hardships and the poverty existing. <Col N="190" /> Deputies on the Government Benches are now faced with the acid test, irrespective of any camouflage that may be indulged in by the Minister for Finance in reply to this amendment.  They are either going to carry out their promises to their constituents or they are going back to the country to tell their constituents that they refused to vote for an amendment referring this Estimate back, in order that the Minister for Finance might be relieved of the responsibility of moving for more money in this House to relieve destitution.</P>
    <P>It will, no doubt, be said that the country cannot afford money for the relief of unemployment or for relief schemes.  I would put the matter to the House from another angle altogether. Can this House afford not to vote money for the relief of unemployment and to keep people from starving? Deputies on the Government Benches are aware that approximately 30,000 young men and women emigrate on an average from this country every year.  If they weigh up in their own minds the cause of this emigration, they will find that these people do not go out to see their friends in America, and that they do not go out owing to the spirit of adventure.  They go out to America and to other foreign countries from the land of their birth because they are not able to eke out an existence at home, because they are not able to keep body and soul together. It would be well if the Government would tackle this problem and have regard to it as it actually exists. There is no use in our camouflaging the issue.  There is no use in telling the people that the country has turned the corner, or that there is an upward curve so far as the trade of the country is concerned.  Statistics speak for themselves.  Emigration statistics speak for themselves.  The poverty existing in the country speaks for itself; and it is with the idea of focussing attention on this problem that I move that this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    <P>I maintain that at the present time unemployment&mdash;more especially in the rural districts in the west and northwest of Ireland&mdash;is even more acute than it was last year, because of the <Col N="191" /> fact that labourers going across to Britain this year found there was not as much employment as formerly, and many of them had to come back without employment.  Again, many of them who went in former years did not go this year because of the poor prospects of employment.  It will probably be urged by the Government that they do not want to borrow money in connection with this matter.  I would submit that if the Government had been anxious to deal with this problem in the manner in which it should have been dealt with, there were ways in which other Estimates could have been reduced in order to allow of a Supplementary Estimate for relief schemes.  We had a discussion yesterday in regard to the Governor-General's establishment.  We had a discussion in regard to the salary of the Governor-General.  The statement was made that the salary of the Governor-General was statutory and could not be altered.  I would point out to the House that at the time it was decided that the Governor-General should get a certain salary the Free State was composed of 32 counties and not 26. Therefore, I maintain that the salary of £10,000 is not statutory.  Again, we find that there is £18,845 voted for the upkeep of the Governor-General's establishment.</P>

      <P>We went into all this before, and I suggest to the Deputy that we cannot go into other estimates on this amendment. Debate would become impossible if that were done.  Instead of having debate on the grant of more money for relief schemes, we would have a debate on the cutting down of other estimates.  As a practical question I think that is impossible, particularly in regard to estimates that have already been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. CASSIDY Mr. CASSIDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to point out that if the Government were not prepared to borrow money in order to relieve the unemployment situation, there were other ways of realising the money.  I was going to point out a few headings, without going into full detail, under which they could save enough money to permit of <Col N="192" /> the introduction of a supplementary estimate.  I was going to submit that while they thought £18,845 was not too much for the upkeep of the Governor-General's establishment, they were not prepared to introduce a relief vote in order to give employment for a week, a fortnight, or a month to those who are unemployed.  There are other Votes, such as the National Theatre Society, £1,000, and Broadcasting, £27,355.  These votes may be desirable. Nobody will dispute that, but at the same time, I think it is more desirable that hungry men, women and children should be first provided for.  This House last week voted money in order to keep monkeys, lions, kangaroos and other animals in this country.  The House may laugh, but this is a serious matter when you come to consider it. The House voted a sum of £1,000 to the Royal Zoological Society in order to keep animals in this country.  At the same time the House is not prepared to introduce a Supplementary Estimate or to carry this amendment in order to get the Minister to vote money to keep human beings in this country and to keep them from emigrating.  I do not know whether you might think that a laughable matter or not, but I venture to say if those animals in the Zoo could speak they would say that this House was a very funny place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it should be recognised that the first duty of any Government in any country is to look after the welfare of the people of the country.  At least we in the Labour Party recognise it.  Some of the Ministers may laugh at the remarks made in reference to the Royal Zoological Society, but nevertheless, they cannot get over the fact that they actually voted money for those purposes and now they refuse to vote money to keep human beings from emigrating from this country.  Last year a sum of £150,000 was voted and £118,000 was spent on useful productive works, works in connection with water supply schemes, sewerage schemes, sea defence works, the improvement of reservoirs, road work, clearing of housing sites, repairs to landing-stages, etc.  It means that unless this House is prepared to carry this amendment of mine there are going <Col N="193" /> to be no relief works put into operation in the constituencies which the Government Deputies represent.  I address my remarks principally to those Deputies for the reason that I do not want them to be hoodwinked in regard to the situation.  I do not want them to say: &ldquo;We are going to vote as the Ministers tell us.&rdquo;  I want the Government Deputies and the Deputies on the Independent Benches to look at this matter from a humanitarian standpoint and from the standpoint of their constituents.</P>
    <P>An Independent Deputy, a few days ago, speaking against Deputy Conlon's Bill said that he would like to see social services improved.  Other Deputies said the same.  I wonder were they sincere?  If they were sincere now is the test.  Let them vote for my amendment.  As I pointed out already, unemployment is not confined to Dublin City or to Cork or Limerick. It is rampant all over the country. Every constituency in the Saorstát has an exceptionally large quota of unemployed. Each constituency has a large quota of poverty-stricken people who need relief and I hold it is a duty of the Government to give that relief. I believe that as far as unemployment is concerned the Government's record has been one of deplorable apathy.  It has been a record of apathy right since the last election and even prior to the last election, notwithstanding the fact that there are on the Government Benches Deputies who subscribed to the democratic programme of the First Dáil.  Did the Deputies who subscribed to that programme, including the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and the President, regard it and treat it as a pious resolution?  I submit that they are treating it to-day as a pious resolution unless they are prepared to accept this amendment of mine.  One clause of that democratic programme was that while it is the duty of the citizen to give allegiance and service to the Commonwealth it was the right of the citizen to demand from the nation an opportunity to work for adequate reward.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Government that they have failed in their responsibility in <Col N="194" /> dealing with that.  I believe that if the resources of the nation were properly organised and under a properly organised system, with waste in its many forms eliminated, this country would be able to give a reasonable standard of living to all its citizens.  I would, therefore, in conclusion, appeal to the Deputies to vote in favour of my amendment.  I do so because it will mean that this Vote will be referred back for consideration and a demand will be made on the Minister for Finance to introduce into this House a supplementary estimate or to increase the Vote.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Deputies on the Independent Benches that there is poverty and unemployment in their constituencies. Are they going to carry out their election promises?  To-day the poor people in the country and the unemployed in the country are looking to this House to get some measure of relief.  I put it to the Deputies here&mdash;are they going to fail the unemployed or will they vote for this amendment that I am moving?  I have put down this amendment in the hope that it will be carried, and I appeal to the Deputies to exercise their rights in regard to it.  Let each Deputy on the Government Benches and on the Independent Benches stand up and show his independence and let them show, at any rate, that if Ministers are not sincere, they are sincere.  On the other hand, if they are going to pass this Vote as it is, let them be honest and straight.  Let them go back and tell the people in their constituencies that they and their Party have let down the poor and the unemployed and let the people judge for themselves. I, therefore, move my amendment.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of Deputies on these benches to support Deputy Cassidy's amendment, although I think it is likely that there is some difference in the attitude of our Party towards the amendment and the attitude of the Labour Party as expressed by Deputy Cassidy.  It is, of course, our view that a Vote here providing for the financing of relief schemes is inadequate. <Col N="195" /> It is inadequate while the present conditions exist and while the present Government remains in office and while the policy of that Government is in operation in the country. It is, I think, clear to those who have given any thought to this problem that the voting of sums for the purpose of relief schemes by this House, will not, and cannot, provide any solution of the unemployment problem.  Our attitude towards that problem has repeatedly been made clear both within this House and outside it.  We have pointed out that there is in operation in this country an economic scheme based upon the laws enacted here under which you give to the farmers, and to the agricultural community in general, control of our resources in land, and our knowledge of agricultural working, and under which you give to those engaged in industrial enterprises the control of our resources in capital and technical skill.  We maintain that if those engaged in agriculture and industry are unable, between them, to provide an adequate supply of food, clothing and housing for the people of the State, it is on the State the responsibility rests of providing for the surplus which is not covered by the existing industries or the agricultural industry in the State.  It is quite clear, I think, that responsibility resting on the State is not to be discharged by the periodical voting of a sum of money for relief schemes here.  It is obvious that it would not be possible to get every year out of the pockets of the taxpayers of this country a sum of money large enough to provide the most meagre form of relief for those who are in need of it.  The Government has, however, provided no alternative method of dealing with the problem, and it seems to us an extraordinary thing that in this year of 1928 we have in this State, a supposedly civilised State, no methods devised for meeting periodical distress other than those which were, I think, invented and successfully put into operation by the Emperors of Rome some 2,000 years ago.  The same mentality is behind the present Government as was behind the Roman Emperors to whom I have referred. It was the idea of providing a <Col N="196" /> supply of corn whenever distress became particularly acute or vocal, and then trusting to the adequacy of that supply to tide the powers that existed over the critical period.  It is the same thing that is put into operation here now.  We have the Government of the State dealing in no way with the problem of unemployment and distress that exists in this country except by coming, on rare occasions, to this House and asking for a very inadequate Vote for the financing of relief schemes.</P>
      <P>We propose to vote for this amendment to refer this Vote back because it is up to the Deputies seriously concerned, in view of the amazing inactivity of the Government in this matter, and particularly in view of the amazing inactivity of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to express their complete dissatisfaction with the situation which has been allowed to develop. Members of the Fianna Fáil Party have been in this House for over twelve months, and during no part of that period has any indication been given that the Government or the Department of Industry and Commerce is working in conformity with any considered plan or with any definite objective in view.  They appear to be dealing merely with each situation as it arises, going on from day to day hoping to tide themselves over their immediate difficulties and allowing the main difficulties to take care of themselves.  The attitude of the Government towards the unemployed and towards those who are distressed was, I think, very clearly demonstrated by a speech delivered by the Minister for Agriculture in Clonmel on Sunday last when he told the distressed farmers to stick it out.  The only words of advice he could offer to the farmers was to stick it out.  Live horse and you will get grass.  That is the attitude of the Government generally. They are not facing their problems at all; they are merely carrying forward the burden of the problems from day to day, hoping that ultimately something will happen which will solve them despite their inactivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in the past committed itself to the policy of relief schemes.  They never at any time have been able, no matter how diligently they searched the corners of the Treasury, <Col N="197" /> to provide enough money to case in any appreciable degree the distress and poverty that exist amongst the unemployed. It is quite obvious they could not get a sum large enough to deal with the problem of unemployment by the voting of relief schemes and yet they have consistently failed even to consider seriously any alternative method of dealing with the matter.  As Deputy Cassidy indicated, in the City of Dublin the condition of the class with which we are now dealing is worse probably than it has been for a very considerable period, and yet this Government, which has based its hopes upon the voting of relief grants, has not in the city provided more than £20,000 for the relief of unemployment since April, 1926, two and a half years ago.  There was not a halfpenny voted for relief in the year before that.  We see the numbers of people living under the degrading conditions of the slums gradually increasing.</P>
    <P>We see industry after industry closing down in consequence of the inactivity of the Government, and particularly the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the numbers of unemployed are consequently increasing.  Against all that we have the Government coming forward this year and proposing, not to embark upon a new policy, not to face this problem as it should be faced, but proposing to drop the policy it has carried on heretofore, and vote nothing this year for the financing of the relief work so urgently needed.</P>
    <P>While conditions exist as at present, and while the Government is not working on any settled policy, undoubtedly we cannot find it in ourselves to object to voting money for relief grants, even though we know that in the long run that money is practically wasted.  We know at the same time that the poverty and distress are there, and as people who have accepted responsibility to do our share in the government of the country, it is up to us to see that some effort is made to ameliorate that poverty and distress.  It cannot be dealt with adequately, but the distress can be eased to some extent, and we consider it our duty to do that, even though it means <Col N="198" /> a little extra screw being put on the taxpayers or forcing one or other of the Government Departments to exercise a long-desired economy.  For these reasons we are supporting Deputy Cassidy's amendment.  We hope that it will receive the support of Deputies who every day during the last fortnight went into the Division Lobbies to vote for obviously extravagant expenditure in other directions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cross the line drawn by the Ceann Comhairle and to deal with matters not connected with this debate, but Deputies should consider the attitude they have adopted in regard to other Votes, and they should satisfy themselves in their own consciences that economies were not possible in respect of any of these Votes.  If they are satisfied that economies were not possible there they should satisfy themselves also if they conscientiously should draw the line merely in the case of the Vote for relief schemes to ease the situation of the unemployed.  I hope, like Deputy Cassidy, that the Deputies who go to the Division Lobby and, by voting against the amendment, express themselves satisfied with the action of the Government in not providing one halfpenny this year for the initiation of new relief schemes, will stand before their constituents and give an explanation which will satisfy those people.  I believe they will find it hard to satisfy their constituents on that score.  I hope, anyway, that they will not try to deceive the people, and that they will be prepared to stand behind whatever action they take and accept the consequences when the people get another opportunity of deciding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to speak in favour of the amendment moved by Deputy Cassidy.  I come from a portion of the West of Ireland where there is acute congestion.  I know that a good deal of distinction will be drawn between unemployment in congested areas and unemployment in other parts of the country.  I know that sufficient attention has not been given in the past to the conditions in the congested areas when unemployment grants were distributed or relief schemes were being put into operation.  I do not want to minimise the importance of dealing <Col N="199" /> with unemployment as it is understood in the cities and larger towns.  That case is specifically established.  You have unemployment bureaux in which those not in employment register from day to day or week to week.  Therefore, the State is aware of the existence of unemployed people.  But in the congested districts there are no such facilities, and although the Department responsible may know nothing whatever of the fact that there is unemployment in the congested districts, I may assure the House that the condition of poverty there is equal to, if not in excess of, the conditions in the towns. Some provision is made for unemployed people in cities and towns, but none is made for those in the congested areas. I do not want to harp too much on this question, but I think I could illustrate it more forcibly by giving the experience of an inspector sent down recently to Leitrim from the Land Commission. In the course of his investigations, with the object of starting some relief work in the district, he interviewed a family. The family, which consisted of a father, mother and four children, were at dinner. When the meal was finished, he asked the father if that was the only food the family had for dinner, and the father said yes.  He further asked him if there was any variety for the other meals, and the father said no.  The meal consisted of potatoes and water.  I do not want to emphasise this.  It is painful to me, and the people I refer to would certainly be very sensitive about making the fact known.  But I do it in the interests of those concerned, and with the object of bringing home to those responsible the condition of the people that I have a particular interest in&mdash;the small farmers in congested areas, who are living in a state of endemic poverty and have had no assistance given to them at any time to deal with their condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary indictment of the Government that after the years they have held office, during which these areas were represented here by men who knew the conditions, they have brought in no measure to deal in a permanent way with the position.  I am satisfied that if the majority of the House were aware of the conditions as <Col N="200" /> they actually are in these areas they would make special provision for dealing with them.  These relief schemes, after all, only touch the fringe of what is really wrong there.  They may provide a few weeks' work, but, after all, they only temporarily relieve the situation and leave the problem unsolved.</P>
    <P>I was very much disappointed, perhaps more than most people, because I had hopes that when a native government found itself in office it would tackle this problem in a way which would be sufficient to deal with it.  I am satisfied that the Government have had at their disposal means big enough, if they had courage enough, to undertake the solving of that big problem that will confront this State as long as it remains unsolved.  There is no use in thinking that the problem of the congested areas affects only the areas concerned.  That is not so.  Year after year, as long as that problem remains unsolved, the Dáil will be called upon to make provision by way of gratuities for the relief of unemployment and distress.  There is no other solution.  The farmers there are quite incapable, no matter how energetically they strive, of eking out a means of existence for themselves and their families, as matters stand at present. A wider view should have been taken by the Government of this problem so as to relieve the conditions prevailing and remove a slur on the whole community. There is no use in my attempting to outline what I consider would be a scheme which would meet the necessities of the case.  There are men on the benches opposite who know the conditions as well as I do.  I do not know whether they have put their views before the Executive Council or not, but the fact remains that the problem is there and that it is a slur upon the State as long as it remains as it is. It is a problem that must be solved. It could have been solved if the Executive Council had undertaken it on the right lines.</P>
    <P>This Vote that we are asked to pass for this year of a balance of something like £30,000 from last year is not sufficient to deal with the requirements of the community.  It would be merely hypocritical to say that £32,000 can <Col N="201" /> solve the problem.  When one takes into account the various channels through which that £32,000 will be absorbed, and how little of it will go down to the actual relief of those in need of it, the situation is all the more grave.  I can quite understand how difficult it is for the officers who are sent down the country to allocate the various amounts to be spent in each district to determine what is the best manner in which to spend the money. After all that is the factor that any person responsible for the spending of this money has to take into consideration. I have on other occasions in this House exposed glaring instances of how relief money has been spent, not on the lines of giving the best results in the relief of unemployment or the best results from a practical point of view. I do not wish to go over the ground again, but I do say that, if Deputy Cassidy's amendment is carried, that this should be referred back, and that a sum of money equal to the actual requirements should be provided, better provision should be made for the allotment of that money.  When an inspector is sent down to the congested areas from the Land Commission, as he probably will be, I suggest that he should take the people more into account than he has done in the past.  I suggest that in appointing supervising gangers he should endeavour as far as possible to secure men who have some knowledge of the work and see that these men are not appointed to the areas in which they live or with the life and politics of which they are associated.</P>
    <P>Furthermore I suggest, with the object of having the money spent in the best interests of the community and in a manner that will give the best results, that local committees should be set up irrespective of party politics, and that those responsible should endeavour as far as lies in their power to clear themselves of the charge that has been made, and made with a good deal of foundation, in the past against them, that they are spending the money for the purpose of furthering their own political party interests.  I suggest that independent committees should be set up in each district in which it is proposed to spend money with a view to <Col N="202" /> getting the most independent opinion that can be secured, as to the work that will give the best results both from the point of view of relieving unemployment as well as from the point of view of the practical results to be obtained. In making these suggestions, I am satisfied that I am voicing the opinion of the constituency that I represent.  I have no hesitation in saying that the other Deputies who represent that constituency will say as I say, that the proportion of this £30,000 that would be available for our constituency would be quite insufficient to meet the reasonable requirements of that district.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that if Deputies to whom I allude give expression to their opinion, then the majority of the House will record their votes in favour of having this matter referred back, because the sum is entirely insufficient, and should be supplemented in order to make provision, in a fair way, to deal with the whole requirements of the community.  We have been engaged during the last few weeks in passing estimates running into millions of pounds.  While these estimates may be regarded as essential, all of us on these benches, and others as well, believe that in many cases the sums voted were in excess of what could be regarded as essential services.  We believe, and have no hesitation in saying so, that the relief of the distress of the country is a more important matter than all the services combined for which we have voted millions in the last few weeks. Let those Deputies on the benches opposite who feel that they should take their direction from the standpoint that there is no available money for this necessitous work, the relief of unemployment and distress in the country, examine the conditions in their own constituencies and see if there is not sufficient evidence under their own eyes that there are necessitous cases crying out for redress.  They have the opportunity now to give effect to the power they received from the electorate which sent them here to do common justice to the community.  That large section of the community which consists of unemployed and those poor people in need of assistance are calling for common justice to be done to them to-day.</P>

      <P>I would be failing in my duty to those who send me here if I did not avail of this opportunity to join in the appeal made to the Minister for Finance.  I hope he will listen to the appeal, especially if he knows the conditions that exist in the City of Dublin to-day.  The Minister for Local Government is well aware of the conditions in Dublin City.  I sincerely say, from my twenty years' experience in the public affairs of the City of Dublin, that the condition of things was never worse than to-day.  I hope a warning note will be sounded that will prevent people coming either on foot or by train from other parts of Ireland to the City of Dublin in the hope that they will get employment or relief.</P>
      <P>The slums of Dublin to-day are overcrowded, and applications are being made by unfortunate &ldquo;down-and-outs,&rdquo; persons who have only just travelled from the unemployed areas in the Twenty-six Counties, for rooms without avail, because the Dublin poor law authorities are not in a position to deal with the matter.  These men leave their home towns in the belief that they will get employment in the City of Dublin.  When they arrive they unfortunately only make things much worse for themselves and much worse for those already there, and who for many years have been living in hopes that something may turn up.  Of the £30,000, part has been spent, but no one on the unemployed list in Dublin who made application to the local authorities for work got an hour's work since the 31st of last March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am encouraged by the statement made by the Minister for Finance a couple of weeks ago when he said that before he would feel justified in bringing in proposals for new taxation dealing with this matter he would want to be satisfied that a state of emergency existed.  I tell him now, and I am satisfied that every Dublin Deputy can tell him, that, as far as Dublin City is concerned, a state of emergency does exist. If the Government are not in a position to deal with this themselves, it is their duty to order the local authorities, having the power in their hands to grant home assistance or other kind of relief. It is their duty to do that and not to hide their heads in the sand.  If the <Col N="204" /> local authorities dealing with home assistance want to know what is going on in the City of Dublin, let them ask the officials of the St. Vincent de Paul or the Roomkeepers' Society what the situation is.  Let them look at the reports of the visits made by the members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, and let them read the appeals made by speakers at the St. Vincent de Paul meeting.  The report stated that over 27,000 visits were paid to the homes of the poor in the City of Dublin in the year.  And the Roomkeepers' Society have a record of an almost equal number of visits paid.  These two societies, up to a month ago, were almost in a state of bankruptcy.  They sent out their appeal to the charitably-disposed people of the country in order to be able to assist in the relief of the unemployed and the poor.  They are doing the duty that the Dublin local authorities should be doing.  The people are taxed to enable the local authorities to do that duty.  There is no use in the Dublin authority, in order to keep the poor rate down by a penny in the £, starving the poor in the city.  I say unhesitatingly there is starvation in the City of Dublin to-day.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, but the Minister in charge of Local Government has his hands tied by the Department who controls the purse. I am satisfied if it was in the power of the Minister in charge of the purse to listen to the pleadings of Deputies in this House, including the Minister in charge of local authorities, he would open the purse strings and give the Minister for Local Government some money to enable him to carry on.  The Dublin authority that I was a member of up to a few years ago dealt with relief schemes every year, especially in November, December and January, and they raised the money themselves. They had a distress committee in the city of Dublin dealing with relief schemes.  I say it would be a good thing <Col N="205" /> for the poor of Dublin to-day if that committee was got together again, and if they were assisted in their efforts of relief by charitable institutions, who are doing their utmost to deal with unemployment problems, and to deal with relief generally in the city of Dublin.  It is an extraordinary thing that relief, either by work or by cash can be granted everywhere in other parts of the twenty-six counties except in Dublin.  No matter how hungry the workman's wife or children may be in the city of Dublin he is told by the local authority, if he applies for it, that they have no power to administer relief or to help unemployment.</P>

They are forced, for the first time, I think, for many years, this Christmas to see their wives and children hungry.  Unless it is done, the local authorities will be neglecting their duty.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long, but I am wondering why we have not heard something from the Government side of the House on this very important matter, or is it the intention of Ministers not to say anything until the debate is concluding?  Two years ago there were £2,000,000 given local authorities for road work.  That £2,000,000 gave very valuable and very necessary employment, but that money is, if not altogether expended, nearly all expended by now.  As a consequence men who last winter and the winter before secured employment from local authorities are now without employment, and have no prospect of getting any employment during the coming winter.  I cannot understand why the Government are refusing to make any provision for relief works this year. It has been said that money voted for relief works is wasted.  I do not at all agree, and, I think when that statement is made, some evidence should be put forward in support of it.  Even if we were to agree that we do not get the fullest possible return for the money spent on relief work, we must face up to the fact that there is more return given to the country for money spent in that way than there is for money given either as unemployment benefit or as outdoor relief.  We have to face <Col N="207" /> up to the fact that if these men do not get the means of buying the necessaries of life through relief works, they must be supported in some other way. I say that the giving of money in this way for works to be done for the country is, to say the least of it, the least wasteful method of relieving them.  I wonder what the defence will be.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for Finance intimated in the House some time ago, in reply to a question, that the Government felt that there was not the same necessity for relief works this year, as there was in previous years.  How does the Minister know?  Is the Minister able to produce figures to satisfy the House that there are less unemployed in the country at present than there were last year, or the year before, or during any year for the last six years? I challenge the Minister when he makes the statement that there is not the same necessity for relief this year, as there was last year or in 1926 or in 1925, to give to the House the facts on which the statement is based, and I challenge the Minister to produce figures of the total number unemployed in the country this year and compare them with whatever figures he had for last year and the year before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Local Government has read the report which the superintendent of home assistance in County Kerry submitted to the County Board of Health there last week.  I wonder if the Minister is aware that many other superintendents in other counties are submitting similar returns.  Is the Minister or any other Deputy who read that account of the appalling conditions which exist in County Kerry, and which are typical of the conditions in many other counties, satisfied that there is no necessity to make provision for the relief of the unemployed this year?  I must say that my opinion&mdash;and I do not want to exaggerate in the slightest degree&mdash;is that there is, at least, as great necessity for a relief vote, and a very substantial relief vote, this year as there was last year, or any year for the last five years. I have no hesitation in saying that. We had a relief vote last year and we <Col N="208" /> had a relief vote the year before, and with that we had a sum of £2,000,000 given the county councils for the making of roads, money which, to a large extent, relieved unemployment, and for which a good and satisfactory return was given.  So far as my information goes that money has been nearly expended&mdash;at least it has been altogether expended in some counties&mdash;and the position at the moment is that there is very little prospect of any work being provided by local authorities, unless the Government is prepared to do this year, at least as much as they did this time twelve months.  I think the House ought to insist on some provision being made for these people.  They do not want charity, they do not want outdoor relief, but they want this House to vote money to pay them wages for work they are prepared to do.  I say that it is not fair or right to suggest, without putting forward some evidence, that money spent in that way is wasted.  I do not agree with that at all.  I believe a good return has been given by the men employed on many of these schemes.  If there has been waste&mdash;and I do not believe there has been&mdash;it is probably due to lack of proper supervision of the scheme or proper attendance of those in charge to see that the work is carried out expeditiously and well.  I think we are not only entitled to bring this matter before the House, but that it is our duty to do so. This House will adjourn within a short time, we are told, and I think the House would be failing in its duty if it were to adjourn without making some provision which, at least, will enable some of the unemployed to carry on over the winter.</P>

      <P>The position of the Government in this matter is that there is a very large sum of public money available at present for spending throughout the country, and that sum is so large, that it is considered inadvisable to expend a further sum of money that would have to come out of taxation.  I read the report of the home assistance officer in Kerry and the reports of other home assistance officers.  I think that we must be quite clear that the home assistance scheme <Col N="209" /> cannot be scrapped and replaced either by pensions or relief works as a general scheme, and in our discussion of this matter we ought to leave the home assistance problem to those who are responsible for dealing with it. Deputy Cassidy has stated, under the heading of housing, that the Minister for Finance had promised to introduce a Bill in the autumn that would deal with housing in a very exhaustive way. In fact, the Government have introduced a Housing Bill, although Deputy Cassidy says they have not.</P>

      <P>At any rate, from the point of view of the subject we are discussing, of relief for the winter that makes a contribution of £250,000 in respect of housing, a very material contribution to the work that can be done to housing during the winter.  Very large sums of money in connection with that £250,000 will be spent by local authorities, as well as by private people, so that the £250,000 is simply an index of a much larger amount of money that will be spent on housing as a result of the Government's action in providing that money.</P>

      <P>They require that money in order to cover them. Practically the whole of that money is in respect of houses not yet built but <Col N="210" /> for which commitments were fully entered into either by local authorities or by private people.  As I say, the £250,000 is only an index of a much larger sum that will be spent on housing during the winter, because that £250,000 is being provided.  At present there is unissued out of the Local Loans Fund a sum of £214,000 in respect of work contemplated by local authorities.  That £214,000, some of which is in respect of work that had no connection at all with the relief schemes of last year, but some of which had, is all a measure of the work that will be carried out on water schemes, sewerage schemes or on repairs to institutions, by local bodies during the winter, if the local bodies go ahead with them.  For instance, of that, Galway accounts for £16,830, Louth for £14,223, Co. Dublin £45,000 odd, Leix £12,500, Tipperary about £14,000, Limerick £28,000, Cork £13,000, and Kerry £18,000, out of the total amount of money unissued from the Local Loans Fund for work already contemplated or actually being carried out.</P>
      <P>In respect of roads, on the 1st October last there was unissued from the amount of £2,000,000 allocated in July, 1926, and April, 1927, a sum of £303,000 in respect of work under the national roads scheme, apart altogether from any of the road work that is in hands.  County Donegal accounts for £25,000 of that, Mayo for £24,000, Limerick for £28,000, Cork £64,000, Tipperary £17,000, Leix £11,000, Cavan £12,000, Meath £20,000, Louth £21,000, and Dublin £15,000, to mention only the counties where the sum is more than £10,000.</P>

As well as that, there still remains to be allotted out of what was set aside for road expenditure this year about £30,000 or £40,000, so that there is a very considerable amount of money more or less at the disposal of local authorities, whether central money or money that they are putting into their own scheme, and in the light of that it is considered that the financial situation of the country cannot bear to have an additional amount of money taken out of taxation for the purpose of additional relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. RICE</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to ask the Minister not to press the House to leave this Estimate standing where it is, but to give his earnest and favourable consideration to the question of increasing the amount.  Deputy Cassidy told the House that last year the amount expended on work of this kind was £118,000.  The present Estimate is for £32,000.  To my mind, to justify such a very large reduction you would need to have present one of two conditions &mdash;either that conditions as regards unemployment had so improved since last year that it was no longer necessary to spend this large sum that was spent last year, or that the financial position of the country had so much worsened that it was impossible to do it.  I suggest that neither of these two conditions is present here.  I do not pretend to know as well as many Deputies the conditions throughout the country as regards unemployment, but all of us who live in Dublin know that very acute distress in the way of unemployment exists in Dublin, that there are, in fact, thousands of men in Dublin who are able and willing to work but who are not able to get work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy referred to the building trade and pointed to it as the medium of a great deal of employment <Col N="212" /> if certain things could be done.  He said that his Party&mdash;I hope I am quoting him correctly&mdash;would undertake for the building operatives that they would give as good an output and as good results as are got elsewhere if the jobs were organised in a manner similar to elsewhere and if equal facilities were given to the men.  I think those were the conditions he made.  I do not doubt the sincerity and the earnestness of Deputy Cassidy and of the Deputies who are associated with him in his desire to get something done in this way.  But I do suggest to them that this hypothetical effort to get something done is not very helpful.  I do suggest that Deputies on the Labour benches might themselves draw up some practical scheme, something that would enable the country to build houses on more economical lines than they are building them at present, and put that before the House and the Minister and ask them to accept it.  Now Deputy Lemass stated that money spent on relief works of this kind is in the long run practically wasted.  Like Deputy Morrissey I do not agree with that statement.  I say no doubt it is a fact that the unemployment committee, with which I had something to do, reported that relief work is uneconomic and wasteful, but that after all is a relative expression.  It is not of course as good as reproductive and economic employment but it is a great deal better than none.  It may be that the conditions in the country, with regard to money spent on relief, are not as good from the point of view of giving a return as in the cities, but certainly in Dublin the money spent last year on development was well spent because a great deal of work was done by it.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister he ought to give his earnest consideration to this matter and consider how a great deal of development work could be done during the coming winter which would relieve unemployment and which if not giving an economic return at least would give a good return for the money.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I think it is a very regrettable feature that after six years of so-called national government we should be look-men <Col N="213" /> ing for relief, and it is all the worse when I remember that in those six years almost 200,000 young men and women have left the country.  Still there is unemployment.  The Minister for Local Government alluded a little while ago to the amount spent.  I admit he has made a royal road down to Cobh, a road for the export of human beings, but when I look around my constituency at present and see the condition of affairs there, I consider that the Government are absolutely wanting in any initiative.  People do not want relief work, but they want employment, and it should be, if possible, permanent, not a month in the year or two days in the week at 29/-.  We remember that, for instance, Rushbrook Dockyard, where there were a large number of men employed, is, to all intents and purposes, closed down, and that last week we had a Vote on Haulbowline, and that Vote was merely for the upkeep of a maintenance party there where there were formerly thousands employed, and that all this was caused by the change over, and that it is incumbent on a national Government to provide permanent employment for its people.  If we travel down to Midleton we see there the definite Government policy which is being attacked in this House.  The malthouses of Midleton have been closed down, while foreign malt is being brought in here by our brewers.</P>

      <P>There are many ways in which the small farmers of Ireland could be helped under this scheme.  The country is going out of tillage and that is one of the causes of unemployment. The whole country is being turned into bullock ranches with no bullocks to eat the grass even.  During the past twelve months many proposals have been put before different Ministers here with regard to schemes by which money, which should be granted in my opinion, could be well spent.  There was, for instance, the question of Knockadoon. On this question several proposals were put to the Ministry of Fisheries by Deputies here.  It would take a couple of thousand pounds, but it would bring in a decent return and provide decent employment in the district and prevent those people who were looking for further relief schemes from having to emigrate to Canada.  The cry of the Ministry of Fisheries on every occasion was: &ldquo;We have no money for them,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The amount of fish captured in this district amounts to only £500,&rdquo; although the amount of fish caught was something over £4,000.  We are <Col N="215" /> definitely told they have no money.  I consider in cases like this, where it would not alone afford much-needed employment, but would afford a permanent improvement much needed, that that money should be forthcoming and that the present relief grant is useless from the point of view of relief&mdash;£32,000 divided among twenty-six counties.</P>
      <P>I would not mind if I saw any definite effort made for economy, but the Government says: &ldquo;We have no more money for this; we have not a couple of thousands to spend on the much-needed fishing industry.&rdquo;  That very Government gives £3,000 a year for garden parties for the Governor-General and £600 a year to the gentleman who takes around the strawberries whilst families are starving and whilst they tell us very solemnly that they have no money for relief work.  I think there should be no occasion, if there were any kind of Government in this country that had any respect for the country, to come to this House and look for a relief grant at present.</P>

      <P>That is the sole reason why we have to come here looking for relief grants.  I think that the Government will have not alone to double the present grant but to provide at least a sum of £100,000 between this and the next Budget if two-thirds of the population are not to be allowed to die of starvation.  I say that from a knowledge of portions of my constituency where there used to be a large amount of employment, but where the people are now walking round the streets <Col N="216" /> looking at one another afraid to go home to their starving relatives.</P>

The Government who allowed industries to die, and who take no steps to provide necessary employment, are bound definitely to provide some relief schemes.  That is the bounden duty of any government.  If the Government are going to say: &ldquo;We cannot help you.  We are going to allow the dumping of foreign materials that will hunt you out of business&rdquo;&mdash;that policy has been definitely enunciated by the Government within the last fortnight&mdash;I say that it is their bounden duty to provide some relief schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that in this debate, as in all debates that have taken place on this subject, there is a certain element of unreality.  Deputies always speak as if there was some special virtue in voting money under the heading &ldquo;Relief Schemes,&rdquo; and some special virtue in spending it under that heading.  It seems to me that there are Deputies who do not care in the least what money is provided for the relief of unemployment so long as there is a certain amount voted as a result of special appeals for relief grants.  They pay practically no attention to any provision that is made for the relief of distress and unemployment except that provided under this particular heading.  Therefore, I say that there is in this debate, as there has been in all debates that have taken place on this subject, an element of unreality.  It would be possible, for instance, to have reduced the other provisions made for the relief of unemployment.  We have this year in the Land Commission Vote provided a sum of £323,000 for the improvement of estates under the Land Commission. It would have been possible at the beginning of the year to have reduced that sum to £223,000, and now to come along and bring in a supplementary estimate for £100,000.  There are many Deputies who have spoken here who would have been quite pleased with <Col N="217" /> that arrangement, though under that arrangement as good results would not have been got for the money as are being got by the other arrangement.</P>
      <P>I believe that while certain results can be got from expenditure under relief schemes those sums spent as the result of money voted in the autumn, when no particular plans have been made in advance, do not give as good results as we could otherwise obtain.  A good deal has been done in the way of relief schemes, and a great deal of money, as the Minister for Local Government has pointed out, is available.  I think that everybody concerned ought to take all steps that can be taken to put that money out.  There is money provided for roads, and what ought to be done is to see what is preventing that money from being expended and to get it into wages and employment as rapidly as possible.  Money has been allocated out of the Local Loans Fund, and steps ought to be taken to see how rapidly these works can be carried out. Account can also be taken of the fact, as I have said, that a very big sum, a sum substantially larger than that of last year, has been voted through the Land Commission for the improvement of estates.  Employment given by means of that Vote is more remunerative and better for the community than employment given by way of hurried schemes that would be carried out if there was an additional Vote for the relief of unemployment.  It has been suggested that every year we have had special Votes in regard to unemployment. That is scarcely so.</P>

      <P>And also, I think, the year before last.  The Vote provided in the year 1926-27 for a sum of £30,000, and it was provided in exactly the same way as this sum of £32,000 is being provided this year.  There was one year or two in which I had absolutely no doubt that the Vote for unemployment and distress was necessary. That was the year in which the fluke epidemic occurred and when there was a great shortage of fuel owing to the failure of the turf harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> I felt on those occasions that we were bound to provide this extra money and throw it out, even though it was to some extent unremunerative.  In other years, however, I have not had quite the same conviction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not, but it helped to put money into circulation in districts that were badly hit.  As I say, in other years I had not quite the same conviction about the need for it, but in all of these years there was this difference to this year, namely, we could see a surplus of revenue before us.  In this year, however, we cannot see a surplus of revenue before us. There are such factors in the situation that it is impossible to say at present what the return of revenue for the year will be.  I think there will be some deficit, but whether it will be large or small I cannot say.  But there is this much certain, that there will be no surplus this year, and also that we must consider voting sums much more carefully than was necessary in previous years.  It will be necessary, very shortly, to incur fresh borrowing.  Further borrowing will have to take place next year for the completion of works that are in hands, such as the Shannon scheme, works connected with it, drainage works, and other schemes.  It will be necessary to incur fresh borrowing, and it is therefore necessary, if we are to maintain the State credit, that we take care that the Budget is balanced and that revenue is obtained to meet expenditure that cannot properly be covered by borrowing.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Cassidy said, in moving his motion, that we ought to borrow for relief schemes.  My reply to that is that we cannot borrow for relief schemes.  If this motion were passed, then it would seem as if relief schemes were going to be, as in fact there is much already to indicate, recurrent expenditure.  It is not recurrent expenditure of a type that builds up a capital asset.  Therefore, if additional money is to be provided now for relief schemes there must be taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> If this motion were passed, before any new Vote for an increased sum for relief schemes could be introduced, it would be necessary to introduce a No. 2 Finance Bill, and to impose taxation that would bring in the sum required. If there was a failure to do that, then the borrowing that has to take place would become difficult, and the difficulty would be reflected in the rate at which the borrowing could be carried through.  If borrowing has to be carried through at high rates, then the remunerative character of the various schemes which are being carried out on borrowed money is destroyed.  I say this in the most solemn way that I can say it, that if we are going to provide additional sums for relief grants then we have got, before we spend a penny of that, to put on additional taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the question of a reduction before us, and it is quite a different problem.  All the reductions that can be carried out or that are feasible at all will be necessary to meet the budgetary situation that will face us next April.  This talk about reductions is talk in which very often there is very little sincerity or very little helpfulness.  It is a sort of catchcry business that carries us nowhere, because very often the people who are calling out for reductions are calling out the next moment for additional expenditure, and what you find they want is not a reduction of expenditure, but alternative expenditure.  Alternative expenditure would have to be provided out of taxation in just the same way as the present expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the employment situation is going to be helped by the introduction of a No. 2 Finance Bill and the imposition of a fairly substantial measure of fresh taxation at the present time.  I think that the thing ought to be faced in other ways.  We are always prepared to consider any constructive method of meeting the unemployment situation.  The President indicated a few days ago that we were prepared to set up a committee which would examine the whole situation. <Col N="220" /> The Government itself has already carried out various important constructive schemes, and for constructive measures money can always be borrowed.  If we preserve the practice of meeting out of revenue the expenditure that ought to be met out of revenue, then for constructive works we can always borrow, and at such rates as will enable us to carry these out as well as they can be carried out elsewhere.  Anything that will enable constructive schemes to be formulated will always be welcome.  The situation is sufficiently grave for us not to have one of those unreal debates in which unreal and unreasonable importance is attached to spending money out of a Relief Distress Vote.  Instead of having one of these unreal debates we ought to face up to the situation and see by what constructive measures it can be met.</P>
    <P>Nothing very much came out of the Unemployment Committee that was set up last year because the accommodation and the co-operation which it was sought to obtain in the matter of housing has not been forthcoming.  I said that there would be a Housing Bill to cover an extended term in the Autumn. We were not able to introduce that Bill and had to introduce merely a transitory measure.  If we introduce a Housing Bill without obtaining definite co-operation from those concerned in the provision of houses, then we are not going to get the results from public money that ought to be obtained.  I would suggest that the people on all sides should have another try especially those directly concerned, at evolving some scheme of co-operation which would enable the housing programme to be speeded up and better results obtained from the money expended.  I would suggest also that steps should be taken to carry out road work for which provision has already been made, and to carry out other Public Health schemes.  I would also suggest that local authorities be asked to make their contribution, and that we should not have this thing, which seems to be growing up, that no local authority will undertake any work until a relief vote has been passed and until some sort of a grant is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> I do not think it is good for the community, or for the good of employment to let that attitude of mind become general; to let it become a habit with local authorities of refusing to act until a Government subsidy is provided.  I suggest to Labour Deputies and to other Deputies that the situation deserves more serious consideration than is implied by the introduction of this particular amendment to this Vote.  I think the real facts about these relief grants have been very frankly stated. They are not very economic and they are not entirely useless, but they are no solution for the problem of unemployment. They are only a very moderate palliative.  They reach only a small fraction of the people who might need relief.</P>
    <P>Concentration on them is entirely wrong, and some of the efforts the Government have made to carry out constructive work have been largely with a view to avoiding this relief expenditure.  And what is going to happen, no matter what government may be in power, if pressure from Deputies and people in the country for relief votes continues, is that Governments, whoever may be in power, will be inevitably driven to going slow on constructive work, and simply doling out the annual grant, for they will realise, and be driven to realise, that no amount of constructive work is going to save them from the clamour and the pressure for this particular form of expenditure which is undoubtedly wasteful and distracting. Deputies are looking at it as a sort of normal thing.  It should take place only when there has been something exceptional that calls for the rather speedy assistance or small assistance that can be given in this way.  I think that the Dáil, instead of passing Deputy Cassidy's motion, should think more and try to think better on the matter, and the different interests should try to give some other contribution than this.  I certainly think it is a very unfortunate thing if there is going to be a sort of demand for fresh expenditure no matter on what object, as that is going to call at the present juncture for a sharp increase in the <Col N="222" /> taxation under which the country labours.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this debate until I heard some of the remarks of the Minister for Finance.  He has complained that there is an air of unreality about this debate.  Months ago we called attention to the fact that from an examination of the revenue returns for the first quarter it was highly probable the Minister would not be able even to balance his Budget.  Now, for the first time, we get an indication of the fact that the Minister himself thinks it not likely that he can balance his Budget this year.  He tells us that this form of relief is the worst form.  So we believe, but a year ago we asked that this whole question of unemployment would be taken into consideration and tackled in a proper way, and not be merely coming along each year like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know there are thousands of people starving, and we know there is no other method of relieving their distress than by coming along in this way and by asking for a special vote for that purpose.  The Minister says this is not capital expenditure.  I would ask him what is a greater capital asset of a country than the people who live in it.  If human beings are going to starve this winter, if we are to save them from starvation, are we not building up a capital asset?  I believe we are in exceptional circumstances at the present time.  For the last two or three years these circumstances have been exceptional. There is distress that everybody who keeps his eyes or ears open is aware of.  Are we here not going to make any provision for people we know to be starving, when as has been pointed out we spend the money otherwise carelessly and lavishly?  I say that by reductions in proper directions we can produce an amount which would enable us to meet the present exceptional circumstances.  Even if we had to do it by extra taxation and had to borrow to meet the exceptional circumstances I hold we would be justified in doing so.  The Minister tells us that borrowing would be more difficult, and the rest.  If we have not our people here what is the good of it all?  It is going back to the policy enunciated by <Col N="223" /> the Minister for Agriculture of having only two hundred acre ranches with a million people on them.  That is what we are coming to.  It seems to me the Executive Council are not considering the matter properly at all.  The President has indicated that he is going to set up a Joint Committee to go into this matter.</P>

      <P>It is a lifelong job if carried out in the way in which the President and others intend it to be carried out, but I hope it can be carried out in some such way that this time twelve months when you are coming along and considering votes of this kind some steps will have been taken to provide that you will not have the problem of emigration and starvation before you constantly.  We have time and again indicated that the way to deal with this problem is to build up the industries of the country, to prevent goods being dumped into this country that could be manufactured here, and to take a number of other steps that have been indicated.  But probably this is not the time to go back on these.  For the present, at any rate, we are going to vote for Deputy Cassidy's motion, because we hold even if extra taxation is necessary, then we will have to face it.  I hold that if there is extra taxation the complaint ought not to be that it is for a relief scheme but that we are spending more money needlessly in other directions such as in the case we mentioned yesterday&mdash;the Governor-General&mdash;and in salaries that are beyond the capacity of our people to bear when there are social services that demand relief.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance charges anybody who is supporting this motion with establishing a state of unreality.  Nobody regrets more than the Labour Party the necessity there is, year after year, to remind the Minister of the position that prevails in the country in so far as unemployment is concerned.  I retort to the charge made by the Minister for Finance about unreality, that he appears to be very far away from the <Col N="224" /> realities of the situation that confront us all in this country.  He states that in his opinion there is no necessity to do anything this year to help the unemployed. At the same time he admits that, to some extent at least, something should be done to relieve unemployment generally.  He has not by any means produced any figures to show that there has been any improvement in the situation in comparison with this time last year.  He recites to us the litany that we have been listening to for the past two or three years as to the amounts of moneys in the Estimates, such as the Land Commission, the Shannon scheme, and various other things, but the Minister knows quite well that some of those moneys have been included in the Estimates for the past two or three years, and there are certain conditions surrounding these moneys which prevent them from being spent, and they are re-voted year after year.  The Minister for Local Government made what appeared to me and my colleagues a very peculiar speech. He said there was £303,000 available in the Local Government Department for the relief of people in the way of employment on the roads throughout the Free State.  I am a member of a county council, and I do not know of any money being available for roads in the county I represent.  I think it could be found on examination, if we were to be given access to the files in the Local Government Department, that any grants that are there are surrounded by conditions which make it impossible for the county councils in the Free State to use that particular money.  I know there are certain sums available in the Local Government Department for the treatment of roads, but they are for the use of tar and bitumen and things of that kind which could not be used at this time of the year, and the money was not available during the summer period when tar and bitumen could be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I know differently. The Minister for Local Government also talked about housing, and said £250,000 was available, forgetting that on the Second Reading of the Housing Bill he said that £200,000 of this money was required for houses which had already been started&mdash;which had been started prior to the 17th October.  That can be found in the records of the House, and the Minister knows quite well that most of these houses have been started, and a great many are practically finished.  I do not think it is fair to state that £250,000 is available for houses.  I am aware that only £50,000 is available.  The Minister also suggests that only a certain amount of money has been borrowed by local authorities from the Local Loans Fund. I know that that is correct, but the purposes for which local authorities can borrow from this particular fund are very limited.  As far as I know the local authority is only permitted to borrow from that particular fund for housing or sewerage, and it is not every local authority is prepared at the moment to undertake schemes of that kind.  Time after time I have suggested to the Government, and I repeat it, that if they were to make sufficient moneys available in that fund to enable local authorities to do something for housing the unemployment situation would not be as bad as it is now.  If they were to advance money from that fund to enable a local authority to acquire sites or do drainage on a plot on which they intended to build houses, the situation would be eased to a considerable extent.  To suggest that the small amount of £50,000 available under the Housing Bill, which is not yet passed by the Seanad, is going to do something to relieve unemployment is certainly stretching the imagination rather too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to ask ourselves: Is the situation in this country normal?  Is the situation anything like what it should be?  I do not care what any Deputy's <Col N="226" /> feelings may be towards the unemployment problem, but I put it to every Deputy in the House: Is the situation what it should be?  The Minister for Finance appears to think it is. He and the Ministry generally seem to forget that this country has passed through&mdash;I was going to say a revolution&mdash;a series of revolutions within the last ten years, with the result that industry has been prevented from developing, and things have not settled down as they should have.  A state of uncertainty prevails which prevents people doing anything in the nature of establishing industry.  I am not going to blame anybody for that.  I suppose we were all responsible for it, and I suppose it was necessary in the fight for the freedom of the country.  In view of that, and because the Government are aware of it, I believe something ought to be done for the unemployed in the country.  Amongst the unemployed are men who took part in the country's fight for freedom, and they should certainly have consideration.</P>
    <P>Some people have suggested that money voted for the relief of unemployment is wasted.  I do not hold that view.  I agree that early in the lifetime of this Government, when grants were given, there was a tendency to waste, and there was a lack of supervision in so far as relief grants were concerned.  But as regards the last three or four Votes for relief, I believe full advantage was got for any money expended.  Certainly the amount of money spent in relief work last year for the carrying out of sewerage and water-works and the clearing of housing sites was wisely spent.  I do not think it is correct to say that any tendency towards waste prevails to-day. Some Deputies have used language which might lead people to believe that we are now voting £32,000 for the relief of unemployment.  As Deputy Cassidy has pointed out, that £32,000 has already been spent and therefore is not available to go towards the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that they should face the realities of the situation.  The Minister for Finance pointed out that if a grant were to be given for the relief of unemployment <Col N="227" /> it would be necessary to introduce a new Finance Bill and raise new taxation. I do not think any member of the community would object to that course being taken.  Everybody, no matter what his position in life, realises the miserable plight of the unemployed, realises there are men willing to work who have been idle for five or six years, and nobody would object to the payment of extra taxation or to the introduction of a new Finance Bill.  I do not think the Government need be uneasy, and they will have this House and the country behind them in the endeavour to help the poor and unemployed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the President and the other members of the Government to consider the situation.  A great many things can be done with any money which will be voted.  The housing situation would be eased, and there could be money given to the local authorities for paying men engaged in the manufacture of cement blocks, the laying down of sewers and watermains for new housing schemes.  The money would be spent in doing useful work, work urgently required, apart altogether from the fact that it would be going to relieve the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I do hope that the views expressed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and by the Minister for Finance, do not represent the views of the whole Government.  I hope that before this debate has concluded the President will tell us that he is alive to the realities of the situation and that he is going to do something to help the downtrodden poor of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>During the five years that it has been my privilege to be a member of this House, I have listened to a series of debates on this question of unemployment.  The one solution that is put forward for the relief of that trouble on every occasion has been the provision of money by the Government. In his remarks this evening Deputy Lemass pointed out&mdash;what I think is very true&mdash;that it is quite obvious that relief money is no solution of unemployment.  Let me pursue that subject a little further.  It is being <Col N="228" /> urged here that funds are not available and that a loan should be issued and money provided in that particular way to deal with the relief question.  Every Deputy here knows that if we issue a loan, we have to pay for the money. It is industry that has got to carry that burden.  Instead of helping industry by the issue of loans, you are going to burden it with additional charges.  I ask Deputies is that a reasonable solution, is it one that is likely to provide additional employment?  Is the placing of an additional burden on industry one that is likely to provide additional employment? It has been pointed out in the House on this occasion&mdash;I think, An Leas-Cheann Comhairle can bear me out that it has been urged on every occasion on which we have had an unemployment debate here&mdash;that the Government is to blame largely as the cause of it.</P>
      <P>I venture to point out that this problem of unemployment is not a problem that exists in this country alone.  It exists in every other country to-day. It exists even in prosperous America. What solutions have been forwarded there by the various Governments for dealing with unemployment?  I have yet to find any Government that can deal effectively with the question of unemployment.  I am satisfied from the study that I have made of this problem that it is quite beyond the power of any Government to solve.  It is a problem that can only be solved by the co-operation of all parties in any State. Deputy Cassidy, in dealing with this subject this afternoon, referred to the question of housing.  I do not want to deal with this question of housing at any length on this Vote, but Deputy Cassidy made an important statement this afternoon in connection with housing.  He said he was quite satisfied that those engaged in the building industry were quite prepared to give as good an output as will be given by their fellow-tradesmen in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear that statement.  That is a step in advance. I would like the Deputy to go a little further.  Employers in this industry, as all of you are aware, have to guarantee to those engaged in the industry <Col N="229" /> a certain wage.  Is it unfair, on the other side, to ask that in return for a guaranteed wage they should give a guaranteed output?  Would it be unfair to ask for a guaranteed output? At that I will leave that particular part of the problem.  If we could get that far, we would have made another step in advance in connection with the difficulties that prevent the development of housing, as we would like to see it developed in this country.</P>
      <P>In this problem of unemployment, there is an immense number of factors. One of the most important factors in causing so much unemployment in this country is, in my opinion, the low standard of education to be found amongst the people of this country. Those of us who were in this House when certain proposals were put forward by the Minister for Agriculture to deal with the better marketing of agricultural goods, will remember that the farmers immediately told us that to carry all these proposals through would require a better standard of education amongst employees.  I agree with them.  If we had a better standard of education, more people could be employed in that industry and that industry could be developed much more rapidly than it is being developed at the moment.  What is true of the agricultural industry is also true of other industries in this country. Employers have complained again and again that the development of Irish trade and industry was handicapped by the low standard of education to be found amongst those they employed. I, therefore, say that one of the contributing causes of this problem is the low standard of education.  There are a great many other causes that one might deal with, but time does not permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with one particular aspect of this problem.  It is an aspect that has come before me for a number of years past.  I would like to see that aspect getting more attention than it is getting to-day.  Amongst the young people leaving the schools in this city of ours alone, some 6,000 odd apply at our labour exchanges every year to be given an opportunity of entering on industrial careers.  We are only able <Col N="230" /> to find employment in the City of Dublin for something like one-tenth of that number.  The problem often presents itself to me&mdash;what becomes of the remaining nine-tenths?  I do not say that the whole of the nine-tenths are faced with the problem of unemployment, but a considerable percentage of them are. We educate them, we encourage them to enter on industrial careers, and nothing is done to help them to get into those careers.  They are faced with unemployment.  That is an aspect of the problem that all of us might deal with and that all of us could help in dealing with.  I would almost say that that is the manufactory for unemployment. I think that in using these strong words I am saying what is quite true.</P>
    <P>That is an aspect of the problem that ought to be dealt with.  It is the other end of the problem.  Instead of providing money for assisting unfortunate people when they cannot get employment, it would be much better to train them in such a way that they might get employment.  In that way, they would be more usefully employed.  They would, in many cases, be employable, where at the moment they are unemployable. There is only one other aspect of this problem on which I would wish to say a word.  Deputy Cassidy, in his final remarks, said: &ldquo;Provide money for these people and keep them at home.&rdquo;  Keep them at home! There I am at variance with the Deputy.  I am satisfied that there is a considerable percentage of our population in this country that grow to years of manhood and womanhood every year for whom there is no employment in this country.  Is the future before those as put forward in this House to be: &ldquo;There is the dole for you; you have the dole to look forward to&rdquo;?  Would it not be much better to say to these young men and young women: &ldquo;It is obvious that there is no employment for you in the future in this country; we will endeavour to train you so that you may become useful citizens in other countries.&rdquo; Is it a disgrace to suggest to those people that if we cannot get employment for them at home we will try to do what we can in order that they <Col N="231" /> may make useful citizens in other countries?</P>

It is obvious, as the case appears to me, that there is a considerable number for whom there is no employment at home at present, and the future does not hold out any hope for employment for them.  Would it not be much better, therefore, to endeavour to educate and train them so that they might make useful citizens in another country, if we cannot take advantage of them in our own country?</P>

      <P>No one has suggested that the claim which is made in Deputy Cassidy's amendment would provide anything more than a palliative to meet the abnormal conditions. It is made necessary because the schemes which we were told Ministers have been working on for the past three or four years have not absorbed into employment the number of people looking for employment.  That is the case in a nutshell.  A tent or a wooden shack may not be a very nice place to live in, but it is something to give shelter in any case while a brick-and-mortar house is being constructed.  We have heard for the last three or four years from Ministers that they were working out their policy towards constructive schemes.  The test of the success of the measures they have adopted ought to be how many people have been absorbed into employment. How many people are unemployed to-day? Nobody has got up from the Government side of the House and stated that there are substantially less unemployed to-day than there were this time last year.  No one has made that case.  Does the Minister make that case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear it proved.  We have the undisputed <Col N="232" /> fact that there are people unemployed. We have the figures given to Deputy Coburn yesterday of 800 unemployed being registered in the one town, in Dundalk, and we know that that figure only represents 50 per cent. of those who are unemployed.  We also know that over 3,000 people are registered as unemployed in Cork.  Again, we know from experience that many unemployed people do not register at the exchanges.  The fact is that there are people unemployed in this country. Deputy Good would say: &ldquo;Get them out of the country as quickly as you can if we cannot get employment for them.&rdquo;  Our job is to get employment for them.  We were elected to see that they get employment.  As I say, the Government have failed to absorb people into employment.</P>
      <P>Two years ago a reduction was made in the rate of income tax in order to relieve the burden on industry, as Deputy Good would have us believe. Can the Minister for Finance say that that relief given in income tax has been counterbalanced by the absorption of people into industry?  Can it be shown that the relief given to income tax payers, even at the expense of breaking a promise to the old age pensioners, has gone any distance to relieve unemployment?  We have had a half-hearted tariff policy on the part of the Government.  What has that done?  We heard yesterday that there was actually an increase in the imports of these tariffed articles.  In boots and wearing apparel alone close on £8,000,000 went out of the country to pay wages to people in other lands. Of course the Minister for Agriculture has adopted the new slogan, &ldquo;The cow and sow and the acre of land.&rdquo;  I maintain, even if it were carried out, that that is not going to take any more people into employment or give employment to more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to make a few remarks on the question of housing which was touched upon by Deputies Rice and Good.  The Minister for Finance told us, as the President had told us previously, that money could be borrowed for constructive work such as housing. We all remember that this time last year a Committee was set up, and one of the principal recommendations they <Col N="233" /> made was that a national scheme of housing should be adopted.  The Government appointed a committee of workers in the building trade and building employers, and we do not know what that Committee has been doing since.  Is it the policy of the Government to shelter themselves behind that Committee?  I should like an answer to that question.  Are we to take it for granted that it is to be the policy of the Government that unless this Committee of building workers and employers produce something that will satisfy the Government nothing is to be done?  I take the liberty of saying that, irrespective of builders and building employees, the Government of the day should face the building situation. If it is the case that either of these bodies or both of these bodies are standing in the way of the building programme, the Government should not allow that to happen.  I do not care which is responsible.  I say, and I have good reason for saying, that the fault does not lie with the building trade workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">

      <P>I have justification for it in my hand, that two months ago definite proposals, as was suggested by Deputy Rice here, were put up by the building trade workers to that Committee, and we have heard nothing about that since.  What has Deputy Good and his colleagues to say to that programme put up?  Definite constructive proposals were put up by the building trade workers.  When we hear that building is held up we know always the fault is laid on the trade unionists&mdash;the bricklayers, the carpenters, the plumbers, and all the rest of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like again, for the benefit of Deputies, to recall very briefly what Deputy Anthony told us had happened in Cork.  There a contract for 150 houses was taken by an English contractor at £70 per house less than the lowest tender from Irish builders. When there was a strike in Cork among the building trade workers for a miserable halfpenny an hour, the builders <Col N="234" /> kept their workers walking the streets for six weeks, while this particular contractor kept his men on the whole time and paid them the full wages. There is no proposal Deputy Good can put forward as a constructive proposal except to ask the men to yield in the matter of wages and in the matter of hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt.  The Committee set up is still sitting, I understand, considering the problem before them.

For that reason I had not dealt with it.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that the Government have no right to shelter themselves behind any Committee.  If there has been delay the fault does not lie with the workers' side of that Committee.  I want to make that clear, if it is not already clear, and I, too, leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated that there was an air of unreality about this debate and that the continual asking, year after year, for these grants for relief schemes will mean that the money will be drawn from constructive work. That cannot happen.  Surely we on these benches would not ask for relief schemes unless we were satisfied that there were people unemployed.  If money is given for constructive schemes, and if they succeed in absorbing the unemployed, then there will be no question on our part of asking for special relief schemes.  Deputy Good talked of the burden on industry.  I put it to Deputy Good, unless the unemployed are to be shipped out of the country, as he is rather inclined to suggest, the country has to maintain them and they will be a burden on the country in some form or another.  They are a burden upon the rates.  The Minister for Local Government always comes forward with the only palliative or remedy that he seems to have in these matters, and that is home assistance. What are we going to do if we all want home assistance in Mayo, as may possibly be the case?  Are the <Col N="235" /> people of Meath coming to our relief? I hold it is a good thing for the country as a whole to give work, even though it may not be absolutely economic, or even though it may not return five per cent. on the money invested&mdash;I hold it is an economic thing for the Government that control the resources of the country to provide work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacENTEE Mr. MacENTEE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>In column 1381, Vol. XII., of the Official Reports of the Oireachtas the Minister stated that it was the duty of his Department to keep demands for money within bounds.  We are, therefore, I presume, upon this Vote entitled to consider how the Minister's Department has fulfilled the Minister's conception of its duty, &ldquo;to keep demands for money within bounds.&rdquo;  Within what bounds?  Obviously within the bounds of our people's capacity to pay.  Has the Minister's Department even to that extent, an extent which is the lowest criterion of its achievement, discharged that which he himself says is its own particular duty?  Let us consider.  For the year ended 31st March, 1928, the receipt into the Exchequer from the revenue was £24,329,406.  Of that sum £20,396,000 was the product of taxation. In compiling his Budget the Minister estimated that £26,889,000 would be required to defray the expenditure which he was prepared, after having made a deduction for overestimation, to justify to the Dáil.  He proceeded then to make further deductions. Some of those deductions were very questionable.  He divided that expenditure into two categories, one of <Col N="240" /> which he proposed to regard as normal expenditure and the other as abnormal expenditure.  I do not wish to go into that at the moment; possibly I am not entitled to do so, because it might be regarded as a matter of policy, and I do not propose, therefore, in a discussion on the Vote to deal with it.  But at any rate, after making certain deductions, the Minister came to the conclusion that he would require £24,062,000 to meet the expenditure for the current year.  In order to provide that sum he imposed a tax on sugar, and he adopted a number of other expedients which Deputy Flinn likened to eating his seed potatoes.  As the result of these the Minister calculated that he would get from the taxpayer an additional revenue of something like £1,151,000.</P>
      <P>I think that we are entitled to ask ourselves how the Minister's expectations are being fulfilled.  Last year the Customs, Excise and other taxes and duties produced, from the 1st April, 1927, to the 12th November of that year, £11,987,000.  This year in the same period those same taxes and duties have produced only £11,311,000.  I would ask the Minister to consider the significance of that, in the light of the exposition which he himself has given of his conception of the duty of his Department.  The Minister proposed to obtain £1,151,000 from the taxpayer, over and above what was obtained last year.  We presume that the Minister has been endeavouring to collect that sum.  If one-tenth of the things which were said in this House in the debate upon the Vote for the Revenue Department be true, he has been endeavouring most strenuously to collect that sum, and yet, despite those most strenuous endeavours of his, the Minister has failed, not only to collect the extra revenue, but has failed even to collect as much revenue as was collected last year.  That is a signal failure.  The Minister sets out to secure in twelve months £1,151,000 more than last year. Seven and a half of those twelve months have already elapsed, and, so far from securing that £1,151,000, he finds that his tax revenue to date is actually £676,000 less than last year. There are the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> I do not intend to keep the House very much longer, but I feel that we are entitled to ask what is the conclusion that must be drawn from that. There must be some conclusion to be drawn from these very significant figures, and I suggest that the conclusion is that the people are now being taxed beyond their capacity to pay, and that therefore the Department of the Minister for Finance is not discharging its proper duty and is not keeping the demand for money within bounds.  I do not think that that conclusion requires any further enlargement. I think the fact that can be drawn from these official figures is a condemnation of the whole administration, not only of the Department of Finance, but of the Government of which the Minister is a member.  I leave it at that, but I suggest that every single Deputy who is charged with a personal responsibility, and a personal trusteeship for the people's money, is entitled to ask whether he is going to vote to continue in office a Minister for Finance and a Government who have already, as the figures clearly show, taxed this people beyond its capacity to pay, and are not discharging what is the primary duty of every Government, to keep the demand for the people's money, the money which is collected from the tax-payers, within bounds.</P>

He has been called on by this country, or by, I think, point one of one per cent. of the majority to occupy a position for which the figures in the Estimate, and the other surrounding conditions in relation to finance, which have been exposed in this House, suggest that he is not fitted for.  I do not blame him in any way for that.  It is not his responsibility. We are all as God made us&mdash; some a good deal worse&mdash;and the Minister did not choose himself for the particular responsibilities that have been thrust upon him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the Minister for Finance does not desire to be present during this discussion on matters in relation to his own Department. The Minister for Finance is capable, during the discussion of the Ministry of Finance's Vote, of leaving completely unoccupied the Ministerial Bench.  The Minister for Finance to-day has told us that not merely is the condition of this year's financial position bad, as shown by the figures, but he has told us that he will not be able to balance his Budget next year.  He has told us he cannot balance his Budget next year except by borrowing at a high price.  One of my indictments of the Minister for Finance is that he is responsible, by a calculated policy, for degrading the credit of this country to such a condition that he can only borrow at a high price.  He is responsible in the extraordinary method of finance which this existing Budget represents.  No man can borrow money who is doing the thing which, in an ordinary commercial concern, would be regarded as dishonest.  You cannot <Col N="243" /> build the credit of this country upon the basis of using assets as income. You cannot build up the credit of this country on the basis of taking into this year revenue which does not belong to it.  When you are going into the money market to borrow money and say in your balance sheet that you have put in two items of that kind you are asking for the Shylock's price for money; you are asking for that price of money which is exacted from a man known to be in a bad condition.  You have got to pay the penalty price of your default.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance or any other Minister upon these benches was in the hands of moneylenders and those facts were known to the moneylenders what would be the price they would charge for accommodation?  What would be the price if, in his personal capacity, any man or Minister in this House chose to put himself in the hands of moneylenders under those conditions?  That is his responsibility and his sorrow.  But if any man speaking for this House, for the Twenty-six Counties in this country, does choose deliberately to put the country into that position, when going into the hands of the moneylenders, it is not his misfortune; it is his shame. What did the Minister for Finance do in relation to the credit of this country?  When he was going for a loan he stumped up and down the country, telling the world, in a stunt election, the horrible position in which the country was and demanding for the carrying on of the ordinary law of this country penal laws of a character that would shame an uncivilised State. He was not satisfied with that.  When the election was over, when the people, in their folly or in their wisdom, had decided other than he had expected and calculated on in his stunt election, he actually made this statement&mdash;a man who was going for a loan, who was going to buy money&mdash;to those from whom he was going to buy the money on behalf of this State: &ldquo;The position of the country will mean that we will have to pay £300,000 more for our loan.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine the condition of any business man who, going into the market <Col N="244" /> to buy anything, would declare first to the seller that conditions had been produced which would make him have to pay more.  The statement was untrue. What would be the position of the managing director of any firm, faced with his shareholders who, before he had gone into the market to borrow money, had said that untrue thing in relation to the condition of his firm? In spite of the defeatist policy, in spite of the slander upon the credit of this country, consistently indulged in by the Minister for Finance, the credit of the country rose, as is illustrated even by the very unsatisfactory indication of the price of existing National Loan.  In spite of that, and at a moment when it ought to have been the policy of the responsible Minister for Finance at least to show a price which was a fair price for National Loan, although he buys some hundreds of thousands of pounds of National Loan in a year, he leaves the market for National Loan be depressed on the Dublin Stock Exchange 1½ points on a ridiculous little parcel of stock that could have been bought by any man in this House.</P>
    <P>We are going to have another loan, and how I know it is by what has been said on these Front Benches to-day.  I heard a speech in this House the other day, and I turned to my colleague, Deputy Carney, and said: &ldquo;They must be going for another loan.&rdquo;  The next day one particular organ of the Press of this country sent out to 80,000 people in this country the declaration that a Minister in this House had made a startling speech&mdash;a speech which, in the opinion of the Press, was good enough to be placarded as a sign and a proof that in the opinion of the Ministry there were causes in this country for fear, and for apprehension of danger.  How on earth can you expect to borrow money at a reasonable price if the policy of the Ministry itself and, above all, of the Minister for Finance, for Party purposes, for the purpose of attacking his political opponents, is to say, first, to the people who are lending the money that their security is insecure, and, secondly, to the lenders of money that, due to that insecurity, the price must be higher. That is the sort of thing which would get any ordinary commercial man <Col N="245" /> laughed out of commercial life as an utter incompetent.  My charge is more than incompetency.  I do not blame, I say deliberately, any member of the Front Bench for the incompetency which is natural there, but I do blame them in so far as they refuse to learn to improve, and in so far as they deliberately use their position for the purpose of damaging the assets in their hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell to-day said that the Ministry was in possession of the resources of this country.  They are in possession of certain resources and they have a considerable influence over the value of some other resources in this country.  One of the things which they do not possess, but over whose immediate and exchangeable value they have a direct influence, and their conduct has a direct influence, is the credit of this country and the policy of the Minister for Finance and the policy of his colleagues for party purposes has been to debase and degrade that credit so that in a party sense they may get advantage from it.  The position as disclosed by the state of the revenue is bad.  The Minister for Finance has been quite frank.  I like to give him credit for anything I can.  I like to give every opponent credit for everything I can.  The Minister for Finance has been frank enough to say that he does not see the corner being turned within the financial year.  I had hopes that possibly there were things known to the Ministry of Finance, that they had worked out their rate of revenue accretion in certain conditions, that the Minister was calculating that there were certain conditions in relation to the artificial £1,150,000, which he has taken in as income and which is not income, which would lead him to believe that in the remainder of the time he would get a much larger proportion than we on these seats know anything of, or that Deputies could envisage.  He says he will not.  Frankly I sympathise with him in that fact, and I am disappointed.  But is the Minister for Finance entitled to get away with it on that ground?  Have we tried, has he tried, to reduce avoidable, overhead, and non-productive expenditure within the limits which would enable him to balance?  Has he kept that restraint <Col N="246" /> over his colleagues and over their actions and incitements which would enable him to do it?  He has to include under two single heads of enforcement expenditure, namely, the Civic Guards and the Army, somewhere about £3,000,000 of money.  Has he tried to enforce upon his colleague, the Minister for Justice, that conduct which would enable him to reduce that amount? Has there been any protest from him when in his presence the Minister for Justice has stated things which will directly cause an increase of expenditure under those heads, namely, when the Minister for Justice has defined as a good and a reputable member of one of these forces a man who keeps his assaults upon the general public within that degree of atrocity in which it will not be awarded more than £40 valuation in one of his own Circuit Courts?</P>

Has he controlled other Departments which were capable of producing productive activities?  We went through his last Budget here with great care, and, I think, with great kindness.  It was a Budget which was treated with every possible consideration in this House. We pointed out that there was nothing in the Budget which would enable production to be helped, but what we know is that money is being provided by him and allowed to go out, and his officers are functioning in Departments who are not using their activities for the purposes of developing production but for the purposes of preventing it being started.  The indictment of the Minister for Finance is, in his own words today:&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot balance my Budget. I cannot live out of my means.  I have to borrow money to pay ordinary out-of-pocket expenses.  I have to borrow money at a high price, and I have to borrow it because my conduct&rdquo;&mdash;the conduct of the Minister for Finance, in co-operation with that of his colleagues &mdash;&ldquo;has been to debase instead of enhancing the credit of this country.'</P>

      <P>When Deputy Flinn began in his lugubrious and almost religious tone, I realised that he had come to bury Caesar and not to praise him.  And the corpse is still alive. Deputy Flinn is deeply concerned for the credit of this country, and is concerned that the Government are crying down the credit of this country, but what is Deputy Flinn's contribution? Has he enhanced the credit of the country?  I read a report of a speech delivered by Deputy Flinn in the country during the week-end, in which he said that those on the Government Benches had not even good second-class brains.  I do not know whether the Deputy meant everyone on the Government Benches or merely those on the Front Bench.  I accept Deputy Flinn as an authority on second-class brains.  I do not know any Deputy in the Dáil who has a more intimate knowledge of second-class brains than Deputy Flinn.  Does he think that by that public remark he is enhancing the credit of the country for which he is so deeply concerned to-night?  He spoke somewhat irrelevantly, I think, of penal laws of a character that would shame an uncivilised State.  I do not know if Deputy Flinn has noticed that yesterday the Minister for Justice, being well assured that Deputy Flinn is not going to put on his trench-coat and take to the hills again, is bringing in a Bill to repeal those penal laws that would disgrace any civilised State. Deputy Flinn might have referred to that.  He might have enhanced the credit of the country by pointing out that we no longer require those penal laws, and thank God we do not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flinn with great perspicacity informed Deputy Carney a few days ago that the Government must be going for another loan. A year ago the Minister for Finance informed everybody in the Saorstát that he was going to take the present loan in halves; that he was going to raise half of it at once and was going to come, in about a year's time, to raise the other half if still in office.  Deputy Flinn did not notice that.  I would like to congratulate Deputy Flinn on <Col N="248" /> having found someone more ignorant than himself to whom he would give his piece of news.  Deputy Flinn challenged the Minister for Finance and asked him if he was trying to reduce overhead expenditure.  With regard to a reduction in overhead expenditure, if Deputy Flinn looks at this Vote which we are discussing he will find that, in spite of automatic increments, which he knows and which all of us know must occur in the Civil Service, because after a service of a year or so every civil servant becomes entitled to a very small rise in his salary, this Vote has been decreased by £2,700.  In other words, it has been decreased by 4 per cent. This is the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance.  He has shown the example, and I believe from my knowledge that the control of overhead expenditure is going on and will be continued.  The credit of the country? Deputy Flinn is anxious for the credit of the country.  Would it not be better if Deputy Flinn were to refer to some facts that are well known to him?  The credit of the country?  The first National Loan was issued at 95.  It sunk in a time of crisis to 91½.  I was wise enough to buy some.  It is now over 99. The second National was offered at 98. The credit of the country is high, and will remain high.</P>

The credit of the country is high.  The indebtedness of the country is low.  I wish that Deputy Flinn, when he was deprecating our financial position, had referred to the financial position of other countries. We can raise money in the United States of America at, I think, five and a quarter per cent.  What was the price which France had to pay for a loan in the United States?  Does Deputy Flinn know?  My information, which is subject to correction, is that they had to pay seven per cent.</P>

      <P>It may seem strange to step down from the regions of high finance in which we have been for the last ten minutes.  I desire to ask the Minister a question in regard to the last item in the Vote.  It refers to the sum of £1,100, repayment to the British Government in respect of agency services performed by the British Government actuary on an actuarial Investigation into the Teachers' Pension Fund.  I want first to ask the Minister why it was necessary to go to the British Government for an actuary to enquire into this purely Irish fund?  That is not the main question I want to put to the Minister.  My reason for rising is to try to find out from the Minister what exactly is the position with regard to this investigation which was promised over two years ago and which the Minister himself, about eighteen months ago, said would be ready last November. Shortly before the adjournment for the summer recess, the Minister undertook to make a statement to the House as to the result of this investigation. Up to the present we have heard nothing except the hint contained in the speech of the Minister for Education on the Education Estimates to the effect that the result of the investigation was likely to prove that this fund was not solvent.  That is a rather serious matter.  This fund does not belong to the Government.  The teachers, who are contributors to it, have a share in it.  They are interested in it, and are very anxious to have, at the earliest possible moment, a statement from the Minister as to the results of the investigation, or to be furnished through their organisation with <Col N="250" /> a copy of the actuary's report.  I think as part-owners of the fund that they are entitled to have that at the earliest possible opportunity so that they may take steps to examine into the findings of the actuary and to look after their own interests in the fund if they deem that their interests are in any way involved. I hope that the Minister, when replying, will make a statement on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee occupied himself largely with the budgetary position and with his ideas about the revenue yield for the year. As I have already said, it is impossible yet to say how the revenue will turn out because there are one or two factors which might make a very substantial difference in the amount of payment. I would say this, however, that practically all the heads of taxation are likely&mdash;I might say are as certain as anything can be&mdash;to yield the amount estimated.  As regards the heads under which the amount obtained may be less than was anticipated, I have no reason to believe that it is because of a fall in consumption. When we get nearer to the end of the year and can foresee what the expected yield will be, we can go further into an explanation in regard to the matter. I would say this: that there is nothing at all in the revenue position to indicate that the yield of taxation is seriously falling off.  The Deputy is well aware that, so far as the liquor taxes are concerned, there has been a steadily diminishing yield since the change of Government.  Perhaps the diminution was going on before that, but in no other branch of the revenue have there been any indications of a drying-up of the sources.  There has been no indication, if you like to put it that way, that the rate has been so high as to cause such changes in the habits of the people as to diminish substantially the yield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a question arising out of that?  Dealing with Excise.  I think one of the Minister's proposals was to shorten brewers' credit.  I think that by doing that he estimated he would get in, in the current year, something like £300,000 <Col N="251" /> more.  Does that mean that if the yield were at the same rate as last year the Excise returns should be £300,000 more than last year, whereas in fact they are £300,000 less at this date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, you cannot say that, for we have here one very large brewery with a very large export trade which amounts to about double the home trade.  When beer is brewed the duty becomes payable, allowing for credit, and when it is exported a drawback has to be paid. The course of trade of that firm may frequently cause variations in the stock of beer in hand, amounting to as much as 60,000 barrels between one quarter and another.  It has been our experience that from time to time, for trade reasons, there have been great fluctuations in the stock of beer in hand.  If the stock is reduced it means in effect that the beer is exported and the drawback is paid.  On the other hand, if beer is not being brewed at home and the tax is not coming in, there is the greatest possible fluctuation.  It would be impossible to deduce anything from one quarter or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacENTEE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said all I want to say on that, and I cannot go into anything I may have learned in the way of revenue inquiry about a business firm.  It does not follow that because you expect more revenue in a year you will have more revenue at a particular point before the end of the year.  There is no use in continually talking about the capacity of the country to pay, and then advocating all sorts of new expenditure.  That is what I find happening from the opposite side of the House.  It seems to me that practically every proposal for increased expenditure meets with support from the opposite side of the House.  If Deputies believe the country is taxed beyond its capacity to pay then they ought to behave in a different way when proposals for increased expenditure are before the <Col N="252" /> House.  Deputy O'Connell asked why a British actuary had to be employed. We have not a great number of actuaries in this country, and there was no suitable alternative to the employment of the British Government's actuary.  We hope we will be able to put a report in the hands of the teachers' organisation and in the hands of the public at a very early date.  As the Minister for Education indicated, the fund is in an insolvent condition, and whatever proposals may be made for bringing the fund into a solvent condition we will certainly give every opportunity to the teachers' organisation to examine the whole report before any decision is taken on these proposals.  The Deputy need not fear that there is going to be simply a Government consideration of the report and then the formulation of a set of proposals for bringing the fund into a state of solvency, and the laying of these proposals before the Dáil, without the teachers' organisation having a good opportunity of studying the whole matter and advancing their views with regard to it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say why his Department refused to give permission to the British Government to pay the Irish scale of cost-of-living bonus to Irish pensioners of the Irish Lights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Treaty the Irish Lights service should have been transferred to us.  The transfer has not been effected, because it is obvious that, concurrently with the transference of that service, there must be some arrangement to transfer to us portion of the Lights revenue which is collected at British ports, and Lights dues collected at Irish ports.  These Lights are maintained for the benefit of ships that go to Southampton, Liverpool or other British ports.  They are largely for the benefit of those ships.  Lights dues collected at Irish ports are of a trivial amount.  If we were to accept a transfer of the service without having any financial arrangements made at the same time, it would mean that out of the Exchequer we would have to provide large sums for the maintenance of the Irish Lights <Col N="253" /> service.  The service has not been transferred, for we have not arrived at any financial arrangement about the share we should get of the general Lights fund.  We cannot agree to any increase in the charges that may be paid to the men in the Irish Lights service until we have completed a financial arrangement with the British Government in regard to it.  When that arrangement is completed we shall know exactly where we stand with regard to the service.</P>

      <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that there are in the County Mayo about 2,000 subscribers to the old Dáil Loan who have not been repaid by the Government.  As the Minister knows, documents have been lodged in his Department proving that money had been subscribed to the Loan by certain people, and declarations were sworn that they had paid it.  The Minister stated he would require the original documents showing that the money was paid by the people to the Loan.  Many claims for repayment have been put in. I would like to know if any steps would be taken by the Finance Department to see that these people will be paid in a short time?  The President promised some time ago that some tribunal would be established at an early date to inquire into such cases, and there are thousands of them throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy with regard to these cases.  I do not remember the facts.  The Deputy should either write a letter or put down a Parliamentary question on the matter.  Good progress has been made with regard to the repayment of the loan.  We have not reached the position where the present machinery cannot carry us further.  We are making good progress with repayments with the present machinery.  When we reach the stage that we cannot get either forward <Col N="254" /> at any reasonable speed, or get any further with the present machinery, then we will have to consider what can be done.  I have myself, as well as the President, said it may be that we will reach a point when we may have to appoint a tribunal that will deal with a thing by way of hearing evidence in a rough and ready way.  I do not know about that yet.  We are continually getting further evidence, adding further names to the register and completing arrangements for payment. So far as individual cases are concerned the Deputy will either have to write to me or put down Parliamentary questions, because I could not give him any information now.</P>

      <P>There is nothing very remarkable about this Estimate this year.  It will be observed there is a decrease of £1,627 as compared with the previous year.  The staff provided for in Sub-head A constitutes the Headquarters Staff of the Department of Justice. Ministerial control over all the various services, police, prisons, court officers, and so on, is exercised through this staff.  The Accounts Branch, which is shown separately, is responsible for the payment of the Gárda Síochána, the court staffs throughout the country, the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds staffs and all account work which has to be done in connection with the Department's activities is performed by this Branch.  The only staff provided for outside Dublin is the emigration officer in Cobh.  A fulltime officer is required there to carry out the provisions of the Aliens Restrictions Act, and in the very busy tourist season, when several liners call in or about the same time, an assistant is necessary, and £100 is provided for this assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head AA is devoted entirely to the film censorship.  The total cost of the film censorship is not shown in this sub-head.  It will be noticed, if Deputies look at the foot-note on page 109, that sums of £10 and £20 are included for services in Sub-head C and Sub-head D, and £575 is included in other Votes which are set out on that page. The service is as a matter of fact, self-supporting. If Deputies look at page <Col N="259" /> 107 they will notice the fees charged for film censorship amount to £2,300. These fees are collected by means of stamps.  The proceeds of the sale of these stamps reach the Exchequer in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>One is always faced with a difficulty in dealing with an Estimate like this, because it is presented in such a general way that one cannot say for certain whether there is a redundancy of staff or whether the work done is really worth the money expended.  There is a secretary at £1,200 and an assistant secretary at £888.  Then there are other secretaries and other members of the staff, but no details are given as to how the work is allocated.  We are really not in a position to judge whether the amount of work done is value for the money spent on the Department as a whole.  The amount of work done at Ministerial headquarters in regard to the police force must be very small, because the staff of the Gárda Síochána is large and in the ordinary course would be well able to do all the work except a very small amount of correspondence with the Department of Justice.  The chief work, so far as one can judge from the outside, is the answering of questions here and supplying information often of a false nature, information of the kind we got when a question was raised about the arrest of Peadar O'Donnell, a kind of sophistry and false information covering up the fact that a series of arrests were illegal arrests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then as to the film censorship, I have heard complaints from very serious people that films are getting through which should not get through.  I just mention that in passing to draw the attention of the Minister to it.  The comment I heard was made by a person who was arguing against any other kind of censorship because of the failure of the film censorship to stop certain films which are undesirable.  I asked a question which was answered to-day about the number of charges made in connection with obscene literature and the answer is astonishing. The machinery of justice was used to such a small extent in four years that there were only five charges made and <Col N="260" /> in the last year only one charge was made.  The blame could not be thrown upon the Judges for not acting because in every case there was a conviction. This is a very serious aspect of the neglect on the part of the Minister for Justice.  It is well within his control to see that the proper authorities are put upon the watch as regards this literature so that the ordinary machinery can be used.  It has been said that the Judges have failed to deal with this matter, but that is not the case.  If the Minister would go into the law as it is, he would find that there are ample means of dealing with a very large mass of objectionable stuff without having recourse to legislation at all.  It is a clear case of neglect on the part of the Minister for Justice who has the guiding of the policy in regard to criminal matters entirely in his hands. In fact, he uses his forces where he should not use them, and he does not use them where he should use them.  If he were to fine-comb this State for indecent and obscene literature in the way in which he has tried to fine-comb it for Republicans he would have ended long ago the nuisance of obscene and indecent literature.</P>
    <P>We had a bout of raids for which the Minister accepts full responsibility and he refuses to give the least information as to why he carried out these raids.  We are left entirely to guess what the reason is.  Apparently they have produced little or no result.  The raids seem to have been made largely on the officials of the Fianna Fáil organisation and in most cases nothing whatever of the kind of thing that the Minister was looking for has been found.  Perhaps in his reply he will give us some information as to why he carried out these raids.  Was it done without his knowledge by his forces who wished to justify the continuance of the Public Safety Act, at a time when it was coming up to be brought to a conclusion? The attitude of the Minister generally is&mdash;and it is only by such an attitude that the expense involved in his whole policy can be justified&mdash;that this country is still more or less in the same condition that it was in the years 1918 and 1919, that his forces are a sort of army of occupation, and that he is in <Col N="261" /> the position of a Chief Secretary in the old days.  To give him his due, he seems to be just as subject as the old Chief Secretaries were to false information. Time after time in this House we, with the information of the average citizen, and knowing the conditions, bring up and make a statement of facts. On the other hand, the Minister comes along with his &ldquo;cock-and-bull&rdquo; story invented by his forces either in his own office or down the country.  If he cannot carry off his alleged facts, he adds his own particularly offensive method in order to throw sand in the eyes of the public and of course he has the Press to assist him and we have not.</P>

In dealing with this matter of the raids, I regret very much that the Minister had recourse to the rather low down and odious method of referring back to a very tragic incident that occurred in this country&mdash;I refer to the assassination of Mr. O'Higgins.  I think it was a deplorable thing to refer back to that.  It has nothing to do with present-day politics. It was simply an attempt, I suppose, to cover his retreat&mdash;an attempt to get out of the difficulty.  I make no comment on it and I ignore it, because he knows as well as anyone else in the House and in the country that we stand as much as he does for peace and good order in the country.</P>

      <P>In any case, it was a tremendous victory for the Minister for Justice, on charges like interfering with a jury, to have managed to keep people like that in jail for six months, and also for keeping in jail for twelve months Mrs. MacDermott and Miss Jackson for posting up Republican leaflets.  This kind of petty-minded persecution should not be allowed to continue by the decent-minded members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  In fact I suggest that the time has come when certainly all political prisoners should be allowed out of jail, and that for those who are on the run&mdash;and there are still some men on the run&mdash;a truce should be called and the matter ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had a case of suppression of a meeting because it was alleged that it was a Bolshevik meeting.  I did not know that this State was at war with Russia or that there was any law in this country to prevent people from holding public meetings and advocating there whatever views they wished as to what the social organisation of a country should be.  I understood from the Constitution that people were immune if they wished to advocate particular views from any particular social or political point of view.  I would <Col N="263" /> like to know what authority the Minister has to interfere with the ordinary rights of citizens.  Surely the ordinary citizens are capable and sensible enough themselves to judge whether the theories of Bolshevism are satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  Has it become so widespread in this country that it is necessary for the Minister to send his forces to interfere with public meetings held under the constitution of a legitimate party?</P>
    <P>There is really not very much that one can say about the actual expenditure under this Vote, because we have always found that owing to the lack of details given as to the exact amount of work done by the Department it is impossible to say where the extravagance or the redundancy comes in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question, for which I think the Minister is responsible.  It concerns citizens who make use of the post office machinery. I had my attention drawn within the last couple of months to two cases where it is quite evident that the correspondence of citizens was interfered with.  I made inquiries, so far as I could, of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and while I have not got the information officially and do not expect to get it officially, I am informed that there is good reason for believing that a high official in the Minister's office has authority to issue warrants to certain high police officers in the force for holding up the correspondence addressed to so-called politicians or people who may be regarded as enemies of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may deny any knowledge of this, but he should be aware, if it is a fact, that any official of his Department has authority to issue warrants whereby certain police officers can interfere with the correspondence of ordinary citizens.  The letters posted about which I am speaking, and which certainly were opened in the course of their passage through the Post Office, were not addressed to people with any strong political leanings, and certainly were not addressed to citizens who hold anti-State views or who have taken part in anti-State activities.  I was <Col N="264" /> urged to raise this matter and bring it under the notice of the Minister.  I wish to know, therefore, from the Minister whether he will deny, if he is in a position to deny, that any such official in his Department has any such authority, or that he has delegated such authority to any high official in his Department.  If he has, this is the Vote on which to justify the action he has taken.  If there is any such thing going on with the sanction of the Minister it would help to break the confidence of the ordinary citizen in the machinery of the Post Office.  Such authority should not be held by the Minister or given to the Minister, or passed from him to any of his officials, unless he is able to give very good and grave reasons for it.  I raise the matter so that the Minister can deny the allegation if it is not true, or so that he can justify his action in this House if it is true.  The matter is a serious one. Personally I never alleged any political prejudice against the Minister so far as he is personally concerned in the administration of his Department.  But I look upon such authority as I have mentioned as uncalled for, and if the Minister is prepared to stand over it let him do so and give his reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to Deputy Little's comment and reflection upon the film censorship.  I think Deputy Little is a fair-minded man, and I am sure he would be the last person to cast a slur on vague and indeterminate grounds upon an official who, to my mind, is extremely zealous and efficient.  The film censor has a very hard and arduous task.  I am possibly an incompetent member of the Appeal Board, but I have reason often to admire the extraordinary vigilance of this official, and I think the State is very lucky to possess him.  I think the charge that Deputy Little brought should not be brought lightly on what somebody said or because somebody did not like a particular film.  The Film Censor has no power to reject a film because it is inartistic.  Possibly I wish he had, but I bear testimony to the fact that he has discharged the duties of his office with extraordinary vigilance and care.  If he errs at all it is on the side of excessive rigour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why I want to bring it up here&mdash;to give the Minister and the House the evidence that was put forward in that case by the State Solicitor for Mayo, and I am sure that the arguments put forward by him ought to bear weight with the Minister for Justice.  This case was brought forward in Ballina, and the State Solicitor said the charge was that the accused swore two declarations&mdash;one on the 15th May, 1923, and another on 13th December, 1923&mdash;that on September 12th, 1922, Irregulars came to his premises and forcibly took away goods to the value of £4,158 13s. 8d.  In May, 1924, he swore goods to this value had been taken from his premises, and the State case was that Irregulars did visit his premises and took goods from the premises, but that the value of the goods taken was not more than about, roughly, £65.  Mr. Hanley brought his claim under the Damage to Property Act, 1923, and based his claim on a stocktaking that he alleged took place on 28th February, 1922.  These stock sheets were examined by Mr. Saunderson, on behalf of the State, whom he would produce as a witness on behalf of the Minister, and he would give evidence to show that even accepting Mr. Hanley's figures and valuation of the <Col N="267" /> goods, the proper amount he should have claimed would be £65&mdash;that was accepting his statement that all these goods were really taken on that date. But they would go further than that and would show that there was never any stocktaking on the 28th February, 1922, and that these stock sheets were made up and produced simply for the purpose of the case, because in the stock sheets it was found that he had put down as in stock on the 28th February, 1922, goods that he bought in 1919.  The special goods he referred to were Irish suitings and fancy suitings. He bought these in 1919, and, according to his stock sheet, he had them in February, 1922, but he also bought the same class of article in March, 1920, and subsequently in September, 1920, and he alleged that he had all these goods in stock on 28th February, 1922.  That would be an amazing thing for a man to do&mdash;to buy the same class of goods three times and still have the original stuff in his possession.  He told them he also took stock on the 13th September, after the raid, and gave them the amount of stock he then had on hand as £1,379 5s. 6d.  He also told them that he purchased between then and the 28th of the following February goods to the value of £4,432 9s. 3d.  That was a total of £5,811 14s. 9d.  They were all the goods he got during that period, either had on hand after the raid or purchased, according to his own statement, and they would be able to prove that to the Army (that was the Free State Army) alone, between 13th September, 1922, and 3rd January, 1923, he sold goods to the value of £7,851 8s. 11d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government auditor could prove that, including the £4,000 worth he claimed that was raided from him, and all the goods he bought during the two periods mentioned, amounted to something over £5,000.  According to the sworn statement of an Army officer at the same time, goods to the value of almost £8,000 were sold to the Army between 13th September, 1922, and 3rd January, 1923.  Between February, 1922, and September, 1922, his weekly sales were £136 1s., according to his own figures.  If he sold only to the Army and not an ordinary customer <Col N="268" /> came into his place, it was still difficult to see where he got the goods he supplied to the Army.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. CLERY Mr. CLERY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it would be much shorter to read the State Solicitor's case&mdash;that it would be more of a proof to the Minister that I am not dishing up stuff; that if this is dished-up stuff, it is dished up on behalf of the Minister by the State Solicitor.  I think that is the shortest and the fairest way to deal with the case.  His business could not have completely disappeared after the raid, but even if it had, and not a person came in and bought stuff, he had not sufficient stuff there to supply the Army.  The State Solicitor also went on to say that on a sworn declaration they would show that only one small motor car came up to Mr. Hanley's door, and that the goods were thrown into that motor car and taken away in it.  It was a Ford motor car, and no matter how they would succeed in getting the stuff into it, they certainly could not put £4,000 worth of drapery goods into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just quote a few lines from the accountant's evidence.  He was a Mr. Saunderson, and he was sent down to inquire into the case when they were bringing on the prosecution.  Mr. Saunderson said that in May, 1924, he was employed by the State to investigate the claim made by the accused. He asked Mr. Hanley if he could produce a balance sheet or profit and loss account for any period prior to 28th February, 1922, but Mr. Hanley refused or was unable to do so.  He examined the stock sheets upon which Mr. Hanley based his claim, dated 28th February, 1922, and asked Mr. Hanley to produce invoices in support of certain of the prices charged in the sheets, and he found these dated back to 1919 and 1920.  He was aware of a very considerable drop in prices in woollen and other goods in which Mr. Hanley dealt during the autumn of 1920 and the spring of 1921&mdash;a drop which averaged 50 per cent.  He examined Mr. Hanley's prices generally, and found that they were the 1919-1920 prices. <Col N="269" /> Taking Mr. Hanley's figures to be correct, he prepared an account allowing a gross profit of 25 per cent. on his sales.  He was dealing with the purchases to prove his claim that Mr. Hanley had not the goods mentioned on the premises at the time.  He said that the first of the purchases was made in September, 1919, and was for seven items for fancy suitings and Irish suitings to the value of £223 19s. 7d.  These items were on page 6 on the declaration of the accused.  The next invoice was dated 20th March, 1920, from the same firm.  There were in that for Irish and fancy suitings a number of items amounting to £362 1s. 7d., which appeared at page 4 of the accused's declaration. He produced the third invoice from the same company (Messrs. Mack &amp; Company) for £38 5s., dated 15th July, 1920.</P>
    <P>Now, Mr. Hanley was claiming for all this stuff which he bought in 1919 and 1920, that he said he still had in his shop, and that he was carrying on business all the time he had them in his premises in Ballina when the raid took place, and they had disappeared in 1922.  From that it appears that the defendant, in 1920, bought two lots of suitings, while he had on hands the suitings he bought in 1919, and that he had the three lots on hands, according to the stock sheets, on 28th February, 1922.</P>
    <P>To put the matter shortly, the auditor sent up by the Government to inquire into the case, proved by Mr. Hanley's own figures that the value of the amount that was taken on the day of the raid in September, 1922, could not have been more than £65.  That was the sworn statement of the accountant. The defendant was returned for trial to the circuit court in Mayo, and my information is&mdash;and I think I have it on fairly accurate grounds&mdash;that there was such an amount of wire-pulling brought on by Mr. Hanley and his friends in Mayo that the State thought it wise to have the venue changed to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin. Then after a little while the State, in spite of all that evidence, in spite of the case put forward by their own accountant that not more than £65 could have been taken, while Mr. Hanley had put in a claim for more <Col N="270" /> than four thousand pounds, in spite of all that the Minister told me a few weeks ago, a <i>nolle prosequi</i> has been entered by the Attorney-General on the assumption that there was not sufficient evidence to prove the case.  In addition to that there was the evidence of the gentleman who went to Mr. Hanley's house on that day, with two others, who were there to prove that they took from Mr. Hanley's house&mdash;this was given before the accountant gave his evidence&mdash; stuff valued between £60 and £80.  That was their evidence, and I think it was quite clear that they were correct when the accountant came along afterwards and with Mr. Hanley's own figures proved that the amount taken must have been £65 worth.  I do not see how the Minister can claim that there was insufficient evidence to prove the case. I am not bringing this on because I want Mr. Hanley rearrested and put into jail, but I want this case thrashed out seeing that I was prevented from getting the evidence through the Department of Justice, in a decent open manner, so that justice would be done. Either the gentlemen who went to Mr. Hanley's house during the civil war period committed perjury at the court or Mr. Hanley committed perjury. Either the case made by the State Solicitor was entirely wrong, Mr. Hanley is entitled to his claim for over £3,000 and the gentlemen who went and who are still available are guilty of perjury or the State Solicitor is right. It must be one way or the other.  These things took place when it was popular for members of the Government Party, or the President's Party, as it might be called, to go about the country calling everyone associated with the Republican movement looters and robbers.  That was quite the usual thing at that time as most Deputies will remember.  At any public meeting addressed by the President if there happened to be any decently dressed young lady in the crowd, who did not agree with the ideas or the theories put forward by President Cosgrave, she was asked by him in the petty and mean way he has on public platforms where she got that hat or where she got that coat.</P>

      <P>It was claimed by the State at that time that people with whom I was associated went into Mr. Hanley's premises and took away ladies' costumes, ladies' hats and other things of that kind to the value of £4,000.  Here was a case where the State brought a prosecution against the gentleman concerned to prove that that gentleman had made false statements, had committed perjury, and tried to get over £4,000 out of public funds under false pretences.  Is the Government going to leave that case aside? If we contrast that case with the treatment meted out to Republicans throughout the country there is nobody but will agree that were it not that Mr. Hanley usually acts as chief steward for President Cosgrave at meetings in the town of Ballina, and is supposed to be the best and ablest armed thug in the town any time President Cosgrave comes there I think you would not have the case withdrawn because there was not sufficient evidence to prove it.  I think it is too glaring a thing to be allowed to go by.  I think the Minister should have the case reinvestigated. He should either arrest the people who are living in Ballina to-day, who are supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, for having sworn and committed perjury a short time ago, or have Mr. Hanley's case reconsidered and the State prosecution gone on with.  This is one case where it can be easily seen the Department of the Minister for Justice through some branch or other, which I do not know, have taken into consideration the politics of a gentleman who had been prosecuted by the State.  I think if the Minister wants to have respect for the courts throughout the country, he would have a case of that kind gone into and dealt with by his Department in a different manner. While this gentleman is allowed to go on in the old way, because he is a State supporter, last week you had the houses of every decent Republican in Ballina raided and ransacked by Civic Guards and C.I.D. men, on the evidence we were informed of secret informers in the pay of the Government.  There is a case where you have every possible victimisation and meanness carried out under the Department of Justice, on <Col N="272" /> the one hand against Republicans, and on the other hand you have the most glaring case that I have yet heard of, perjury and trying to obtain money under false pretences withdrawn, I assume, simply for no other reason than that the gentleman concerned was a very faithful supporter of the Government.</P>

I would like to ask Deputy Little if it was the film censor who passed the picture he referred to?

It may not have been the film censor that passed this particular picture.  It is not fair to put everything on an individual who cannot reply in the Press or <Col N="273" /> here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I am going to prove it&mdash;should let an opportunity pass without taking the Minister to task for the various happenings that occurred during the past year under his direction. There is throughout the country a very strong suspicion that justice is not blind, that she has got her eyes wide open and is carefully picking her steps and discriminating between the persons who come before her.  It has been repeatedly brought to our notice that the activities of the Guards are directed, in the main, against a particular section of the community, and that does not happen to be the section with which the Minister is associated, although if justice were blind, I am sure the reverse would be the case.  We have been endeavouring for a long time past to carry out what we declared to be our policy, to abolish the memory of the dissensions that split our people and wipe out the recollections of the bitter years that followed the acceptance of the Treaty so that there would be developed in this country the right spirit of co-operation between all classes to enable us to confront the many problems that face us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice appear, however, to set themselves definitely against the realisation of that aim and to have directed their efforts towards provoking a renewal of the spirit of civil strife which existed so violently a short time ago.  There is, at any rate, a suspicion that there is something concealed behind the various declarations which we get from the Minister concerning such of the activities of his Department as we question in this <Col N="274" /> House from time to time.  When questions, as to the beating of prisoners in the barracks by Civic Guards or other matters of that kind, are brought up here the Minister has a stock reply which he turns out very glibly.  In fact, I was often wondering where the Minister went to recoup himself after each of those bouts, where he went for the purpose of getting a fresh stock of wind.  I found in the Estimates the explanation, and I hope the Minister will elaborate it when replying.  I found an estimate for one wind-boy at a salary of £30 per year.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I will have to continue my quest for information which I thought I had acquired. However, we have had here this afternoon, yesterday afternoon, and for some time past questions directed to the Minister concerning raids carried out by the Civic Guards throughout the whole country since the Estimate for the Civic Guards was discussed in this House.  Deputy Little may not be altogether correct in saying that nothing was found as a result of these raids.  In some cases something was found, and I will deal with that presently. I have no doubt the Department of Justice are not quite as stupid as people might think they are, and when they decided to carry out a series of raids upon the active officers of the Fianna Fáil organisation they were careful, too, that the Guards engaged on those raids would find an odd gun, a land mine, or a parcel of bombs. Ammunition was found in some outhouse or disused garden so that it could not be traced to anyone in particular. In fact, I noticed the other night that when some misguided individuals blew off the hind leg of King Billy's horse the Civic Guards, called out to investigate the occurrence, were able to drive out immediately to Inchicore to a disused brickworks and find a dump.  I am sure their success the other night surprised more than myself.  The Guards called out to investigate the occurrence in College Green were immediately able to get into their cars, drive out to Inchicore, and find a dump.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it was inspiration, and possibly it did not exist there before King Billy lost his horse's leg.  It was necessary the Civic Guards should be able to show something to justify their existence and carefully find a dump.  I wonder how often during the past year have the particular arms found that night been found by the Civic Guard, where they will be next discovered in order to justify the activities of the Civic Guard, and in connection with what occurred.</P>
      <P>To get back to the raids: with a knowledge of the Fianna Fáil organisation that, personally, I thought was surprising in each constituency, the Guards appeared to be able to pick out the most active members of the organisation and afterwards raid them.  In no single case in which an officer of the Fianna Fáil organisation was raided were weapons found, but papers relating to the organisation were seized. The Minister states it is for the purpose of finding arms, but he knows he will not find a machine-gun inside an envelope, no matter how large it is, or a dump in any correspondence which goes out from Fianna Fáil.  The activities of the Guards, on the occasion of these raids, may have been for the purpose of finding arms, but actually they appear to be for the purpose of finding out information concerning the Fianna Fáil organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been more extraordinary cases than that.  There is the case of the delegates who attended the recent Ard Fheis of Fianna Fáil and who had to return to their homes.  They were arrested and taken to the police station and all the documents relating to the Ard Fheis were taken by the Guards. I will facilitate the Minister by arranging to have specific questions in the Order Paper dealing with each case. Already we have drawn his attention to cases of raids, which appear to be carried out for no other purpose than that of irritating the political opponents of the Minister.  I have tried to satisfy myself as to the reason for those raids.  The newspapers reported a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies as having spoken somewhat enthusiastically <Col N="276" /> of and praised the Civic Guards. Probably the Ministry thought this would be a good opportunity of causing disruption in the Fianna Fáil organisation by irritating supporters of the Deputies who spoke in that way. If that be their purpose I may tell them that they have achieved a measure of success because, from all over the country, those of us who did praise the Guards have received letters of protest from those who have been the subject of those pernicious activities. The activities of the Civic Guards, in connection with the finding of these dumps to which I have already referred, have given rise, in most cases, to the suspicion that crime is being manufactured for political purposes. I am saying this quite seriously, because in many parts of the country statements have been made to me that dumps are alleged to have been found in places where the people living there knew quite definitely that nothing of the kind existed, and they appear to be at a loss to understand the motives for the alleged discovery of those dumps.  The only explanation that occurs to one is that the Ministry are anxious to maintain in the minds of the people the idea that they are walking on land over a mine which may go off at any minute, and thus terrorise those people sufficiently so that they will think their safety lies in maintaining the iron men that constitute the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would deal with this subject in his reply and tell us exactly why orders were given for all these raids which have occurred during the last fortnight, and in particular why orders were given to raid the houses of the secretaries of the Fianna Fáil branches, and in particular why the houses of a number of gentlemen, who were candidates for Fianna Fáil at the last General Election, were raided, and in one case why the house of one member of this Party, Deputy Corkery, was raided also.</P>
    <P>There must be some motive.  We would be glad to know it.  I do not believe that the Minister for Justice or any responsible officer of the Civic Guard expected to find ammunition in these houses.  In the reports that reached me it does not appear that any <Col N="277" /> serious attempt was made to search for arms, but to get documents.  There is another matter to which Deputy Davin referred, namely, the interference with correspondence going through the post. It has been repeatedly denied in this House that there is anything in the nature of a censorship of letters.  I want to give a specific case, namely, that of Sean Russell, who some time ago was a political prisoner in Mountjoy and was released.  For a considerable time after his release, he informs me, the letters he received in the ordinary course of business were delivered opened and sealed by a white gummed seal and marked, &ldquo;Opened by the Post Office,&rdquo; and initialled in blue pencil in a corner.  No explanation was offered. Those of us who have had experience of having letters censored in the post know that that is the way that letters are delivered after being censored.  I want to know definitely if there is such a thing as a censorship of letters, and, if so, in what manner is it operated and against whom?</P>
    <P>Another very serious matter which was referred to to some extent by Deputy Little was the reply given by the Minister for Justice to a question asked by Deputy Cooney last week. Deputy Cooney asked the reason for a raid on a certain workers' club in Dublin, and the Minister replied that the Guards had information that this club was organising a demonstration, part of the plans of which was a procession through the streets calculated to lead to a breach of the peace.  A number of placards, he added, with offensive and treasonable inscriptions thereon, were to have been carried.  In reply to a supplementary question he said that the offensive and treasonable inscriptions were: &ldquo;Up Red Russia,&rdquo;&ldquo;Long Live Soviet Russia.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Loughrey says &ldquo;So it is.&rdquo;  We are trying to find out what is the law of this country.  I have already said that we are the Party who are anxious to ensure proper respect for the law in this country, but we cannot do so until we know what the law is.  Deputy de Loughrey says that it is treasonable to say &ldquo;Up Red Russia.&rdquo;  I often felt inclined to say &ldquo;Up de Loughrey.&rdquo;  It may not seem so offensive as it may sound.  I am certain that Soviet Russia will outlive Deputy de Loughrey's antagonism.  At the same time we want to know under what law, or in consequence of what article of the Constitution, it has been decided that it is illegal, treasonable and offensive to display placards with the words &ldquo;Up Red Russia.&rdquo;  Moreover, it appears that the Minister for Justice was under the impression that the term &ldquo;Up Red Russia,&rdquo; if displayed in the streets on a placard, was likely to lead to a riot.  There is no recorded case in the history of this country where the display of such a placard resulted in a riot.  In this case, acting on his own instinct, no doubt, the Minister ordered the police to raid the club, seize the placards and prevent the procession taking place.  There are emblems and slogans which, when displayed in the streets, have resulted in riots and, please God, always will.  I refer to the flag of the British Empire. There is always work for the police, rioting and broken heads when that emblem is displayed.  Yet the Minister has never attempted to prevent the display of such emblems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand, there is no case in which the display of a placard with the words &ldquo;Up Red Russia&rdquo; has caused a single person to turn a hair but, on the other hand, the display of the Union Jack has always led to a breach of the <Col N="279" /> peace.  Yet the Minister for Justice immediately pounces on the one and lets the other go uninterfered with.  As the Party anxious to maintain the law, as against the Party opposite, we want to ensure that the regulations governing police action in this matter will be wisely interpreted and wisely used.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to prevent a breach of the peace and, consequently, to prevent any undue strain being placed on the resources of the police, he will have, and has had in the past, many opportunities of exercising the powers conferred on him, but if he merely wants to interfere with the activities of those who happen to hold political or economic views contrary to his own, he will act in the future as in the past and keep the bandage off the eyes of justice.  He will carefully pick out the cases in which the machinery of the law is to be set in motion.  He will use the police for the purpose of raiding the homes of his political opponents and breaking up their organisation.  Like Deputy Davin, I want to give the Minister for Justice an opportunity to prove that these statements are untrue.  Deputy Davin coined a gem when he said that the Minister is an adept in denying anything. I think it would be impossible to conceive any charge against the police, substantiated by no matter what evidence, which the Minister would not have the cheek to deny.  On every occasion he stood up against assaults which any other Minister, I think, would not care to face, and he always carried his flag, if not victorious, at least fighting a good rear-guard action by the very nature of his denial &ldquo;It is not so.&rdquo; No matter what evidence you give he will always say &ldquo;That is not so.  We can always rely on the Civic Guard to carry out the law of this country.&rdquo;  I hope that the Minister will not take up that attitude in replying to this debate, but that he will deal with the specific points that I have mentioned&mdash;the raids on the offices of the Fianna Fáil organisation, the extraordinary facility with which members of the Civic Guard can find dumps whenever it is convenient for them to find them, interference with letters going through the post, and finally, this raid upon the <Col N="280" /> Connolly Workers' Club and his description of the slogan &ldquo;Up Red Russia&rdquo; as being treasonable.  I hope that he will deal with these matters and tell us what the attitude of his Department is, as well as the attitude of the Government in relation to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. CORRY Mr. CORRY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get some information from the Minister with regard to raids carried out around my district during the last half year.  The raids were carried out by the Civic Guards.  They called to a number of houses there and turned them upside down day after day.  In some instances they came and raided on one day and came back in a couple of days' time and carried out another raid.  The houses of the following people in the district were raided:&mdash;Charles Barry, garage proprietor, Harbour Row, Cobh; Mrs. Fitzgerald, Ballinbrittig, Carrigtwohill; Mrs. Madden, Ballinbrittig, Carrigtwohill; Mrs. Deasy, Killacloyne, Carrigtwohill, and Denis Fenton, Upper Killacloyne, Carrigtwohill. These houses were raided on a couple of occasions during the last fortnight. I would like to know what is the reason for all these raids.  I am quite aware of the want of employment for the Civic Guards in that district.  I am sure they were badly off to get a bit of an airing in motor cars going around at night doing these jobs.  There is another matter that I want to refer to.  It is in connection with the salaries, wages and allowances for this Department.  I notice that every official drawing a fairly high salary has got an increase but that the unfortunate under-dog, according to the figures here, has been pulled down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salaries of higher executive officers were increased from £462 to £488 a year.  The salary of the film censor was increased from £600 to £650. The salaries of junior administrative officers were raised from £3 to £5 a week each.  I notice that the unfortunate typist was reduced from £63 to £60 a year.  Apparently the wind boy did not succeed in putting up sufficient wind for the Minister, because his salary was reduced from £84 to £83 a year.  I hope the Minister will give us an exact description of the duties of the wind boy.  I was under the impression, <Col N="281" /> from the nature of the stereotyped replies that the Minister has been giving to the House in regard to raids and other matters, that he had a gramophone in stock.  Now I think it must be a bellows that he has, and that he has this chap for blowing the wind into it.  I do not know what particular kind of wind he wants to raise when he got a hold of this boy.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfair that there should be a reduction in the smaller salaries when we see here that people with salaries of £600 a year have had theirs increased by £50 a year.  The Minister got through so well during the last twelve months that there must have been a good bit of wind behind him.  I think that the wind boy did not deserve to have his salary reduced.  I do not see any indication of the Minister reducing in size, so that I think that the wind must have been kept up fairly well.  I would appeal to the Minister to increase the wind boy's salary by this £1 that he has taken off him.</P>

      <P>My complaint against the Minister for Justice is, unlike Deputy Clery's, that he has kept a certain person in prison.  I think it is rather a hardship that this person should be kept in prison.  I am referring to a man named Edge.  I have written to the Minister about this man, but I did not get very much satisfaction.  This man is not a political prisoner.  He was left a farm of land in the year 1916 by his mother.  In the year 1924 his sister took an action against him for part of the property.  Edge believed that he was quite entitled to the land under his mother's will, and the will was genuine. It was afterwards proved that the mother was not entitled to make this will.  Edge was then told that he would have to give his share to his sister.  He was not in a position to do so, because he was just like every other farmer and had nothing in 1924.  He was charged with a rent for the farm from 1916 to 1924.  His sister had two courses open to her, I believe, in law. One was to ask the sheriff to put him out, and the second to ask the judge to put him in jail.  She took the more vindictive of the two courses, and had him put in jail for contempt of court because he would not carry out the previous <Col N="282" /> order of the court in paying up the rent or whatever was due.  As far as I can learn from the Minister's Department and from legal friends, this man is likely to remain in jail until he says &ldquo;I have no right to that land.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Little touched on a matter that I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to.  There are two distinct items that I want to refer to.  On Friday week, when the Dáil rose, I was informed that Peadar O'Donnell had been again arrested.  As a result of inquiries, I discovered that he was on his way to the police courts to be charged.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should send for a transscript of the evidence that was given in that case when it came before the magistrate in court, and see if he cannot introduce some regulations to deal with these gentlemen who seem to have nothing else to do but wait about for people who in their own words are &ldquo;suspicious-looking characters.&rdquo;  A C.I.D. gentleman saw Mr. O'Donnell getting off a tram at the corner of Marlborough Road.  He went over to Mr. O'Donnell and accosted him.  Mr. O'Donnell ran away and this man ran after him.  They both fell to the ground, and subsequently Mr. O'Donnell found himself in the police courts <Col N="283" /> on the charge of having assaulted this man who accosted him.</P>
      <P>The magistrate tried to find out what was the reason.  Had he a warrant? He had not.  He had a warrant in his possession which entitled him to stop and search if he liked any person who appeared to him to be a suspicious person. I was a witness of these particular proceedings.  I must say that the legal gentlemen in the court considered it an awful waste of time, for Mr. O'Donnell was released under the First Offenders Act.  The Minister's Department is reducing the law and the police courts to an absolute farce.  Mr. O'Donnell had nothing in his possession. He had been arrested on numerous occasions, as the Minister knows, and he is a heavy cost to the State.  He has never been found to be a criminal, and he has never been found to have had arms in his possession, and yet this detective can practically live around Marlborough Road and arrest Mr. O'Donnell every time he goes home or leaves his house, because Mr. O'Donnell's face is one he does not like. At the time of this occurrence to which I have referred there was a Dublin Metropolitan Guard at the corner but he had sufficient good sense not to take part in the proceedings.  As a matter of fact he should have been brought to the court as a witness if there was any sense in this particular thing.  I suggest seriously to the Minister that he should send for the transcript of evidence of those particular proceedings, and he will see that there is some necessity for altering the regulations which empower people to go around and arrest people of whom they have a suspicion.  Deputy Brady was with me in the court during the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is that there is evidently a great difference between the treatment of political and ordinary prisoners.  The Minister refers here in the House to all prisoners as criminals, but evidently in the carrying out of justice there is a distinction and the Minister's Department does recognise a distinction between the ordinary and political prisoners. I have been in the courts on <Col N="284" /> many occasions and I have seen prisoners tried before a jury.  If a jury disagrees the prisoner is either re-tried again on the same day or on the following morning by another jury, but certainly a prisoner is not kept a long time before he knows whether he is found to be guilty or not guilty.  In the case of four men who were for a considerable time on remand for taking down Union Jacks, they were brought to the criminal courts and tried, but the jury disagreed. That is a considerable time ago but they are still awaiting re-trial. There is a distinction there.  The Minister in reply to a question by Deputy Kerlin on this matter said that he could not give these people special facilities.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for special facilities, but I suggest that they should not have greater hardship imposed on them than the ordinary criminals.  As it happens, there were six men arrested for the same offence.  Two were tried and they were sentenced to two weeks. Four were kept about three months on remand, and they were brought to trial.  The jury disagreed and they are still awaiting trial.  I think there is something suspicious at least about that.  Possibly these men will not get a very heavy sentence and the Minister's Department is taking all they can out of them before they come to trial.  I ask the Minister to look into it and to see that there should be some tightening up in the case of the men who are particularly active and, so far as I know, are engaged solely on work of a political nature.</P>

      <P>This debate has been in some respects, I think, a very unfortunate debate because it produced, in my judgment at any rate, from Deputy Lemass an entirely deplorable speech&mdash;a speech that if Deputy Lemass was in earnest in his statement he could not have made.  Deputy Lemass started off by saying that he was anxious, and his Party were anxious, for peace in this country.  They wanted to have the recollections of divisions that had existed swept away.  They wanted the right spirit of co-operation, and he made a speech as little likely to lead to <Col N="285" /> the establishment of that spirit of co-operation as could well be made.  The Deputy, again and again throughout his speech, asserted that the Guards were manufacturing crime.  Again and again he declared that they were collecting dumps in order that they might discover them.  He declared that this Party were creating crime for a political purpose, a charge which I do not believe the Deputy himself for one second honestly cherishes, and yet a charge which he thinks he can bring forward in this House, and that when he brings it forward he is creating a spirit of amity and working for co-operation between the political parties. The Deputy talked a great deal about peace.  The Deputy is very willing to attack the Guards, but the Deputy is very cautious that he does not say one single word detrimental to or which might be offensive to those persons who are openly preaching the doctrine of violence in this country.  As far as they are concerned the Deputy is dumb.  The Deputly knows there is a body of persons who seek to alter the present conditions, and openly state that they wish to do it with force and violence.  Not one single word against them would ever fall from the Deputy's lips.  As far as they are concerned, he is dumb. Whether it is from want of moral courage or not I do not know.  The fact remains the Deputy never says a word against them, but because he can do so easily and cheaply he thinks he can make his wanton attacks on the Guards.</P>

      <P>I am not, and the Deputy knows perfectly well to whom I am referring.  The Deputy talks about occasions on which there were flags or banners carried and on which there were &ldquo;Up Soviet Russia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Up Red Russia,&rdquo; and other things, and he wants to know if they were likely to lead to a riot.  Does the Deputy recollect the occasion on which that demonstration was stopped? Is the Deputy not aware on that occasion a very distinguished man doing work of great importance to the world visited this country and that when he&mdash;<Col N="286" /> a distinguished visitor&mdash;had landed on our shores and was entering the capital city of this country that this demonstration was got up as a counter demonstration to him and to his world's peace projects?  It was right and proper that this counter-demonstration which would have led to a breach of the peace should have been checked.  No breach of the peace did in fact occur, but a breach of the peace would inevitably have occurred if these two demonstrations had encountered each other.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  Deputy Briscoe comes along and he talks about a certain unfairness to political prisoners, as he calls them.  He complains that they are not tried immediately. They are tried like everybody else.  If a jury disagrees, and if there is time, they are tried again at that same Commission or Sessions, as the case may be.  If there is not time they have to stand over like the others.  I have known many cases in which men have been tried, the jury disagreed, and the case did not come on at the same Commission.  I have one case in mind in which I defended men charged with murder.  They were tried at one Commission, and there was disagreement. <Col N="288" /> Another Commission passed by and their case was not heard, and it was only at the third Commission that their case was taken up for hearing.  If there is congestion at the Commissions certain prisoners have to wait over.</P>

      <P>I am not comparing a charge of murder with a petty charge such as the taking down of the Union Jack in Dublin.  I was in the courts, and there was no pressure of business in the nature of serious charges which would warrant putting a prisoner back for so long.  In one case a man was tried for blackmail and the jury disagreed. This case came on within a few days before another jury.  All through, criminal cases were given preference to the cases of political prisoners.  In the petty case I have referred to the jury disagreed in a short space of time.  There were other juries sworn before which that and similar cases could have been tried, but yet those cases were put back and the men are still awaiting trial.  There is no comparison between a charge of murder and the taking down of a flag.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to do with the order of cases taken by the gentleman who prosecutes for the State.  Sometimes a judge would suggest that a certain case should be taken, but in the ordinary course the cases are arranged by the gentleman who prosecutes for the State.  That does not come under my Department.  I know, however, that the business is properly worked.  Deputy Clery read us out a very long extract from a newspaper.  Here, again, is a matter in which my Department was not concerned, but I am perfectly willing and ready to deal with it.  The Deputy read and read and read, and I must say that what he read did not convey very much of an impression to my mind.  I had inquiries made into the matter, and it appears that this case was one in which, after very careful investigation, the Attorney-General came to the conclusion that there was no evidence upon which a jury could be asked to convict.  Deputy Clery reads out a statement of the case that the State thought it could prove but failed to prove.  He read out the opening statement of the State Solicitor as being absolutely conclusive.  Is it not absolutely absurd for a Deputy to get up here and put a case like that?  The State Solictor puts the State case as strongly as he can.  The State case did not succeed.  The evidence was not sufficient to justify a prosecution.  So the Attorney-General has informed me, and I am perfectly satisfied that that is so.</P>

Deputy Little made charges about not prosecuting over obscene literature.  Of course there have been very few prosecutions, and that is because it is practically impossible to obtain convictions in these cases.  It is only in respect of a book which is terribly glaring beyond all question, not only immoral, but also indecent and gross in its treatment of an immoral subject, that you can take a prosecution with any hope of success.  It is only in such a case that you can succeed with a prosecution as the law stands now.  That is the reason why we have found it necessary to introduce legislation, and we have found it necessary to introduce legislation setting up a censorship, because the Committee reported that a censorship was the only <Col N="291" /> way of dealing with these matters. Under the law as it stands you really never can succeed if you prosecute a newsagent for selling an improper paper.  The newsagent may not know himself that the paper was an improper paper.  A bookseller may have a book in a shop; he may have seen a review of it, and he may write for the book in order to sell it and that may turn out to be an indecent book.  He may not have read the book himself. The only fair thing is to give him notice first.  That is why it is necessary to have a censorship.  You could not succeed in a prosecution if a man innocently sold a book.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little may know a great number of legal authorities.  I am not in the slightest degree interested whether he does or not.  Deputy Little has great sources of information.  The Deputy has very curious sources of information. Here is this anonymous gentleman who makes a violent attack upon the film censor&mdash;an attack which is shown by two members of this House who are on the Appeal Board to be an utterly unwarranted and unjustifiable attack.  Deputy Little is willing to attack anybody on the slightest bit of notice.  Deputy Little talked a great deal about the information which the average citizen has got.  Well, we have got the average citizen's idea of a statement of fact from Deputy Little himself, who, talking about one case, did not obviously know the first thing about it.  As regards these attacks which are made on the Civic Guard, I will give an idea of what the average citizen&mdash;which I take to be an average member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; takes as a statement of fact.  The other day a statement was made by Deputy Goulding that the husband of a postmistress had written to him to say that her house had been raided, or something of that kind, by members of the Gárda Síochána.  He refused to <Col N="292" /> give any further information, but we succeeded in getting down to the particular case which the Deputy was talking about.  I find that the house was never raided by the Gárda Síochána at all.  The Deputy was told by somebody that the Guards went into the house to hold an investigation, while the Guards had actually never been near the place at all at the time.  The only persons who had been there to investigate the post office books were two members of the post office staff&mdash;not Gárda Síochána at all.</P>

      <P>I think I have dealt sufficiently with <Col N="294" /> Deputy Little and his various remarks. Deputy Davin talked about the power of opening letters.  There is, of course, the power to give an order to the Post Office that letters should be opened&mdash;a power which is used in the case of indecent literature, for instance, and other things of that nature.  Indecent literature is very constantly being checked and stopped in the Post Office, and if the sender of the literature is discovered a prosecution follows if the person is living in this country.  That is the only way in which indecent literature can be checked.  The law, in fact, says that indecent literature and matters of that nature shall not be sent through the post.  The same applies in any other case in which it is considered that the Post Office is being used as a vehicle for criminal activities.  This power exists, and it should be exercised so that the Post Office should not be made available for persons planning or plotting crimes, one or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>First and foremost, the question is: Is an official entitled to speak to a Minister in the House at all?  He is.  Secondly, is an official entitled to speak to a Minister while the Minister is speaking? He is, if the Minister chooses to allow him, but not in such a way as to interfere with the proceedings of the House.  Obviously the official did not do so in this particular instance, because the Deputy did not hear what was said.  The third point is: Is an official entitled to speak to any person other than a Minister?  An official is present&mdash;outside the House&mdash;for the <Col N="296" /> purpose of giving whatever assistance he can give when he is asked to give it or when he thinks he can give it to the Minister, and he is entitled to do it in any way which seems proper to him and which does not interfere with the proceedings of the House.  That seems to be the standard.  It is purely a question of expediency.  The officials are present for the purpose of assisting Ministers, and it is a question for the official and the Minister concerned when and how that assistance is to be given.  The only restriction which the Chair imposes is that officials, who are present by the courtesy of the House, shall not interfere with the proceedings of the House.  On that point the Chair is the sole judge.  In this case nothing of the kind appears to have happened.</P>

We have been told that the Fianna Fáil officers' houses have not been raided qua Fianna Fáil officers.  I asked the Minister how he accounts for the coincidence that sixteen residents in the town of Tralee were raided.  Of these sixteen, fifteen were followers of Fianna Fáil.  They were raided on Guy Fawkes Day.  The Minister admits they were raided for arms and ammunition, and that neither arms nor ammunition were found.  I want to know by what coincidence it was that fifteen of Fianna Fáil supporters were raided in which nothing in the nature of arms or ammunition was found.  The Minister got out of it by saying that guns were found somewhere else.  That has nothing to do with the question.  Is it not a strange coincidence that in one town, on one day, these fifteen houses were raided and nothing was found?</P>

      <P>When I raised the question of the film censorship I intended in no way to make a hostile attack upon the censor, but I had evidence that one film, at least, of an undesirable nature got through.  If I did not know the character of the person who made the complaint, I would not have brought the matter up here.  I have discovered now, through asking this question, that there is a gap and that it is possible for a film to get out uncut although it has been censored.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to use some of his forces to prevent that breach of the law and to prevent films being used uncut after they have been already censored.</P>

      <P>The only way that could be done would be if members of the Film Board went to see the film performances.  I am aware they do sometimes, and that the censor sometimes goes when he considers there <Col N="302" /> is any danger of a cut film being put on.  There have been no cases caught so far.  I wonder the Deputy did not send the name of the film and of his informant to the film censor, when he might have achieved some result instead of seeking the publicity here for which there seems to be such a thirst.</P>

      <P>I think it is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  He could direct some of his forces&mdash;the C.I.D. or others&mdash;to act in this matter, in which they would be far better occupied than they sometimes are.  I am not trying to make any political capital out of this matter, but rather to assist the Minister in carrying out the censorship.  He should endeavour to see that films cut are only used in the manner in which they leave the censor, and that in no case should a film be used in an illegitimate manner.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £700 chun slánuithe na siume is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1929, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Choimisiún na nDleacht (Uimh. 40 de 1926).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £700 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1929, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Tariff Commission (No. 40 of 1926).</P>
      <P>The work of the Tariff Commission and the principles on which it proceeds were very exhaustively discussed within the past twelve months, and I do not think that it is necessary to go into them again, nor do I think it necessary to refer in detail to the progress of the work.  I have already announced in the Dáil that the hearing of evidence and the investigations in connection with the application for a woollen tariff, which is the most important application that has come before the Commission, have been completed, and that the Commission is now considering the evidence and is preparing a report. The work in connection with that tariff occupied a great deal of the time of the Commission, because in addition to great masses of written evidence which had to be read and considered, and in addition to the oral evidence which was given, and to other communications which followed the oral evidence, the Commission actually visited twenty factories&mdash;nine in Ireland, seven in England, and four in Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the woollen application a good deal of time was given to the coach-building application and to those in respect of fish-barrels and down quilts.  There are a number of other applications with which much progress has not yet been made.  One is in respect of proposals for a tariff on maize products.  The applicants in this case were asked on the 12th April, 1927, to submit their detailed case, but <Col N="305" /> they have not yet done so.  In connection with the application in respect of sole, insole and harness leather, some of the opponents lodged their statements against the case on 24th October, and in the case of others it is being awaited. In this instance there was very nearly a year's delay on the part of the applicants; they were asked to send in their detailed statement on 20th June, 1927, and they submitted it on the 18th May, 1928.  In the case of the wrapping-paper application there have been a considerable number of sittings, both in public and in camera.  There were sittings on the 9th, 10th, 12th, 16th and 26th October, and the 2nd January. The proceedings are at present suspended until certain undertakings and statements have been received from the applicants.</P>
    <P>A certain number of applications which reached the Department of Finance were rejected as not being from persons substantially representative of those engaged or proposing to engage in the manufacture of the goods in respect of which the application was made.  These were applications like one from Arthur Caball, Tralee, in respect of tin-ware; the Shillelagh Wood Industries, County Wicklow, in respect of wooden wheelbarrows, and James Lawlor, acting for O'Neill's staff, in respect of bicycles.  In certain other cases the applicants were asked to furnish proof that they substantially represented those engaged or about to engage in the industry, or were asked to state most specifically the description of goods in the case of which a custom duty was sought.  The Sawmilling and Packing-case Workers' Industrial Committee was one of these cases.  They asked for a tariff on the product of the sawmill industry, which was regarded as too wide.  The Irish Farmers' Protection Association asked for a tariff on agricultural produce, which again was very wide, and in any case they could not be regarded as sufficiently representative. The Kerry County Committee of Agriculture also asked for a tariff on agricultural produce.  The Dublin Master Printers' Association asked for a tariff on manufactured stationery, which was regarded as too wide, and there are some other cases like that.  There are one or two cases <Col N="306" /> remaining in the Department of Finance awaiting a decision as to whether they are proper to be sent to the Tariff Commission or not.  During its period of office, apart from the great number of private meetings which the Tariff Commission has held, it has held fifty-seven meetings, a few of them in camera, but most of them public, for the hearing of evidence, and there have been thirty-eight inspections of factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the purpose of this Party to oppose the granting of this Vote, not merely because we think that it would be largely a waste of money to vote any funds for the maintenance of the Tariff Commission as at present constituted, but also because we are of opinion that the utility of that Commission has been impaired by the fact that it is not working in accordance with a strict interpretation of the Act under which it was established. Section 2, sub-section (2), of the Tariff Commission Act of 1926 states: &ldquo;The Commission shall consider every application referred to it under this section by the Minister for Finance and shall report to the said Minister on the several aspects specified in the schedule of this Act of such application or such of these aspects as are applicable thereto.&rdquo;  Then in the Schedule to the Act there are set out the various headings under which it is required to have the facts relating to the industry in respect of which the application is made recorded and presented to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I think that it is the obvious intention of the Act that a commission should be established which would investigate the facts concerning any industry which applies for protection and to present these facts to the Minister and through the Minister to the Dáil, in such a manner as to enable both the Minister and the Dáil to secure a clear picture of all the conditions relating to that industry, and to supply the information which would be required to enable a wise decision to be arrived at in relation to the application.  It was obviously a matter for the Minister to decide whether or not the application should be granted and subsequently to <Col N="307" /> justify his decision in this House.  If the Dáil possessed the same information as the Minister possessed then they would be able to appraise the wisdom of his decision and vote accordingly. It is quite obviously not the intention of the Act that the facts should be presented in a partisan manner, or in such a manner as to influence the Minister or to influence the Dáil in favour of a particular view in respect of the application.</P>
    <P>The imposition of a tariff on any commodity imported into this country is a matter of national policy, to be decided by the elected representatives of the people, and not by any commission composed of people outside this House. Nor do we think that any such commission or any body of civil servants should be given facilities for influencing the minds of the Dáil or the minds of the Ministry in respect of any such matter.  The Commission established under this Act and in respect of which this Vote is required did not, in any of the reports which they have submitted to the Dáil, confine themselves merely to a presentation of the facts. They went further than that, and, I contend, further than the Act justified them in going in presenting a recommendation in respect of these applications, and they presented the facts in such a manner as to support the recommendation which they made.  We maintain that is contrary to the spirit of the Act and to wise public policy. If a tariff commission served any useful function it would be the function merely to collect facts and present these facts in an impartial manner to enable the Ministry and the Dáil to make up their minds on the full knowledge and wisdom of the application. The facts should not, under any circumstances, be presented in a manner which would be likely to influence the decision of the Dáil, nor should they be accompanied by a recommendation from the Commission.  In the case of the report on the application for a tariff on rosary beads the Commissioners not merely made a recommendation with respect to the application, but they qualified their recommendation by suggesting that a Customs duty <Col N="308" /> of thirty-three and one-third per cent. should be imposed for a period of five years.  The effect of such a qualification being in the report might possibly work out in a manner detrimental to the interests of the State.  The duty on rosary beads coming to this State was imposed by the Dáil, and will be removed when the majority of the Dáil decides it should be removed.  A person, however anxious to avail of the amount of protection afforded, and to invest money in that industry, might be hesitant about doing so in view of the qualifications appearing in the Commission's recommendation, because they would see the possibility of the Government following that recommendation, and at the end of five years after they had invested their money, removing the tariff and allowing the conditions which existed heretofore to become operative again.  Not merely however do the Commissioners submit that qualification to their recommendation, but they actually support it in a paragraph of the report which, I think I can say&mdash;I do not want to use a strong word&mdash;for unnecessary insolence it would be hard to beat.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For this reason they recommend that a customs duty be imposed, but because they believe that the success of the duty will depend in part on the energy and enterprise with which the Applicants take advantage of the measure of protection afforded them, they recommend that the imposition of the duty should be limited to a period of five years in the first instance.  So imposed, they trust that the duty will act as a stimulus to those in control in the industry, inducing them to tune up their business to the highest possible pitch of proficiency in order that when the period of five years comes to a close the industry may be in a position to satisfy the Minister for Finance that it merits a continuation of support because of the progress made in the interval.</P>
    <P>Now a Commission consisting of three Civil Servants should not be asked to express their hopes in respect of the efficiency or lack of efficiency of any of the controllers of any Irish industry, nor do I think it is right that <Col N="309" /> this Dáil should provide these Civil Servants with facilities to express their views on matters of that kind. The Commission was established to get facts, and should confine its activities to getting facts, keeping expressions of likes or dislikes or hopes from outside the limits of the report they present to the Dáil.  In the case of the application for the tariff on margarine another serious point of a somewhat dissimilar nature arises.  In this case they stated that they considered that unless they could secure to consumers in the Saorstát the benefit of every reduction in price, quality for quality, which consumers here would enjoy in the absence of a tariff they would not feel justified in recommending a tariff at all, for this reason, that they requested the applicants to formulate and submit a definite undertaking with regard to the price and quality of margarine made and offered for sale in Saorstát Eireann in the event of a tariff being imposed.  Now, the action of the Commissioners in requesting the applicants to formulate a definite undertaking with respect to the price at which they would sell their commodity in the event of a tariff being imposed did not operate seriously in this case because a satisfactory undertaking was given by the applicants, but it is quite obvious that if that procedure on behalf of the Commissioners is made a precedent it might prove to be very injudicious and injurious to the best interests of the people.  If is obvious the Commissioners contemplate making such a procedure operate in other cases, because they add later on in the same paragraph: &ldquo;In the absence of satisfactory conditions&rdquo;&mdash; the satisfactory conditions they refer to are the conditions referred to in one of the margarine factories in the country&mdash;&ldquo;no undertaking, no matter how definite, would influence us in our recommendation.&rdquo;  I would remind you of a recommendation which, according to the Act, they are not asked to give: &ldquo;We think it important that this should be fully understood in view of the possibility of undertakings as to price and quality beng offered in connection with other applications.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> Again, whether a tariff should be imposed or not is a matter for this Dáil to decide with knowledge of the facts, even if the facts would be that the imposition of a tariff would increase the commodity in price.  It is easy to conceive an instance in which in the interests of public policy the Dáil would impose a tariff, even though that imposition of a tariff would result in an increase in the price of that commodity to the consumer.  It is not a matter in which the decision or opinion of the Dáil should be influenced by the opinion of members of this Commission as to what should be the action taken under certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is, however, in the report on the application for a tariff on flour that we come up against the most serious objections to the manner of the working of the Commission.  In this report the personal opinions of the Commissioners and the facts they ascertained in relation to an industry are so intermingled that it is practically impossible to disentangle them and distinguish one from the other.  They decided to recommend against the granting of a tariff, and then proceeded to write a pamphlet to justify their recommendation. There is, throughout the whole report, a definitely partisan attitude in relation to the application.  In many parts of the report they repeatedly overstep the bounds of their domain and express opinions on matters of public policy and national importance which do not properly come within their sphere at all.  They make repeated ex cathedra statements which they do not support by any facts, or alleged facts, in many cases.  It would take too long to refer to every paragraph in this report to which objection might be taken, but I would like to refer to a few of them.</P>
    <P>In reporting on the extent and relative importance of the industry, they preface their remarks by a statement to the effect that the number of mills, however, is not so important as their capacity.  That statement is given here as if it were an axiom, something in respect to which there was general agreement, whereas it is common knowledge that there is, in this country, very considerable disagreement on a matter of that kind.  Personally, I am of opinion that the number of mills is <Col N="311" /> just as important as the capacity of the mills, because the members in this Commission appear to have become confused to a remarkable extent with respect to the meanings of such words as &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a matter of public policy, and a question which will have to be decided whether the policy of the Government should be to strive towards the concentration of industries in large towns or centralisation in big factories, or whether their policy should be to strive for the de-centralisation of industry and its ruralisation.  The Commissioners, however, appear to be so captivated by what they saw on the Mersey-side that they come and lay down general laws for Irish industry.  Their entire remarks, with respect to the extent and relative importance of the flour industry of this State are all coloured by their errors in the first instance, because they are based on the statement that the number of mills is not as important as their capacity. There are, however, more serious objections to their reports than that.  In paragraph 60 they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We consider that the Saorstát farmer is interested in flour-milling mainly from two points of view, viz.: (1) he looks to the nearest flour-miller as a prospective purchaser of any wheat he may grow beyond the requirements of his own farm, and (2) he depends upon flour-milling for the supply of such wheat offals as he requires for the feeding of his stock.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners, of course, are not interested in such questions as nationality, and do not seem to consider the possibility of an Irish farmer possessing any patriotism, whereas if any effort were made to ascertain the facts I think it would be found that the majority of the farmers of this country would be prepared, even at inconvenience to themselves, to support a policy which was in the best national interests, such as a policy of protection for the flour industry, in our opinion, would be.  But the Commission go on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>On the information available to us we have formed the opinion that the <Col N="312" /> existence of a flour-mill in his locality is useful to the farmer, since it provides a market for his wheat and secures the local production of bran and pollard, two most useful feeding stuffs for farm livestock. The encouragement of milling by the imposition of a tariff on flour would not necessarily improve the returns from wheat-growing in all parts of the country, though it would increase the supply of offals, and thus, by reducing the price thereof, be of advantage to farmers.  The Commission is not, however, satisfied that under present conditions these benefits can be secured to the general economic advantage of the State by a tariff on flour.</P>
    <P>Who wants to know whether the Commission are satisfied or not?  Who wants to know their views?  We want the facts.  It is a question for the Deputies of this House to be satisfied and not the persons who were appointed under the terms of the 1926 Act to carry out certain statutory duties conferred on them in relation to an application for a tariff.  Throughout the whole of this report they have repeatedly exceeded the proper sphere of their work, expressed opinions and presented the facts in such a manner as to convey the impression that they were under the delusion that an ultimate decision in a matter of this kind rested with themselves.</P>
    <P>In respect to one paragraph in the schedule under which they have reported on the effects which the granting in whole or in part of the concession asked for in the application would be likely to have on the public revenue of Saorstát Eireann the Commissioners refused to carry out their statutory duties and say: &ldquo;Since we do not recommend the granting of a tariff we do not give any opinion of the effect on the revenue.&rdquo;  They actually refused to place in the hands of members of the Dáil the information which, by statute, they are bound to give in the schedule. It is a matter for the Dáil to decide whether the flour-milling industry is to be protected or not, and if the Dáil wants that information it is the duty of this Committee to provide it, and because this Commission does not recomsio <Col N="313" /> mend the granting of the application they actually failed in their statutory duty to provide for the Dáil the information which they were set up to secure.</P>
    <P>Again, in the paragraph of the schedule which asks them to report on the minimum amount of custom duty which will be probably necessary for the successful conduct in Saorstát Eireann of the industry in respect of which the application is made they say, at the beginning of the paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We propose to indicate, under these headings, our opinion as to the future of flour-milling in the Saorstát if no tariff is imposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They set themselves a judicial function at this stage.  I suggest that the members of this Dáil and the country are not interested as to what opinion these Commissioners may have as to the future of the flour-milling industry in this country if no tariff is imposed. We can form our own opinion on that head.  The presentation of the report in this manner is such that we take the strongest possible objection to it.  We object to public money being spent on what is, in the long run, only a propagandist pamphlet.  If publication is to be made of propagandist matter I suggest that a grant be given to Professor O'Rahilly for his pamphlet on the question, because it is, in my opinion, and in the opinion of those I represent a much more useful publication than this report from the Tariff Commission.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Since we do not recommend the granting of the tariff we do not consider it necessary to give any opinion as to its effect upon the revenue.' Apparently the members of the Commission consider themselves superior to the Dáil, could override the decision of the Dáil and also the terms of the Act under which they were appointed.  The view of this Party in respect of the utility of the Commission, even if it worked according to the terms of the Act, is well known.  We do not consider that it was intended to be anything more than a barrier in the way of Irish industry in regard to the protection which it requires, but when the Commissioners ceased to act under the Act, and set themselves up as something which the Act did not contemplate, the utility of the Commission is still further lessened.  A body whose sole function was to hear evidence, collect the facts submitted to it, and present them in a clear form to the Dáil would serve some function, as it would enable Deputies not acquainted with all the facts relating to the industry to form their own conclusions on the advisability of granting a tariff or otherwise.  When the Commission go further and make definite recommendations which they are not asked to make in accordance with the Act, it is only natural that they should present the evidence and the facts in a partisan manner so as to support the recommendations they make.  That is not in the national interest, and public <Col N="315" /> moneys should not be spent on printing reports of that kind.  It would be much better if this money were put back into the Treasury and that the Commission be dissolved rather than it should act in that manner.</P>

      <P>We have heard from Deputy Lemass a reasoned explanation as to why his Party object to the Tariff Commission, and that is because it is going to hear evidence and then express a reasoned opinion for the enlightenment, but not for the guidance or direction, of members of the Dáil.  The Deputy holds that the decision as to whether a tariff should be put on or not is a matter of national policy.  It is, of course, a matter of national policy, but the Dáil decides that the investigation of facts on which that decision should be based should be handed over to the Tariff Commissioners. The Deputy explains that he is against that because he thinks that the Commission has been a barrier against the protection which industry requires.  I do not care anything about the protection which industry requires, but I do care a great deal for the protection which industry can reasonably assert to be necessary for its maintenance so long as it is not going to do the consumer or the community irreparable harm.  The Deputy objects to the Commission as a Commission no longer, but is apparently in love with the Tariff Commission Act of 1926.</P>

      <P>His case is that the Commisioners are not carrying out their duties assigned to them under the Act of 1926, or rather, are not carrying out the duties which the Deputy believes to have been assigned to them. He makes a remarkable mistake. The Commissioners were asked to report on the facts as presented to them, and the Deputy cites three reports which he says were presented in a partisan spirit. Does a judge act as a partisan when, after hearing evidence, he sums up for or against the plaintiff?  Is that not carrying out his judicial functions?  Is not that the normal process, and is it not the habit of judges to sum up for <Col N="316" /> or against the plaintiff?  Why should we describe it as partisan simply because the Commissioners, after hearing the facts, report as, they are entitled to do, according to the schedule?  None of the remarks which the Deputy read out has gone beyond the schedule. The Commissioners reported on the facts as presented to them.  As to Professor O'Rahilly's pamphlet, we should notice that it was not based on any evidence.  He does not state that he had any evidence before him.</P>

      <P>They did.  There were motions brought up here and others are still to come up.  They got a chance of voting on two favoured applications, and they are going to get a chance to voting on one refused application.  At any rate, if Professor O'Rahilly had before him the evidence on which the Tariff Commissioners reported so had the Dáil, and Professor O'Rahilly was not disturbed by the judgment or partisan methods of the Commissioners.  As a matter of fact, the people who made application for a flour tariff were enabled to bring out a pamphlet composed of the prejudiced and partisan paragraphs from the report. I do not like to describe the application in regard to a tariff on flour in that way.  We are told that the Commissioners are only to report on the facts.  Has the Deputy read the section?  They are to report upon the efficiency and so on in respect of the applications made to them and afterwards to report on the effect which the granting of a tariff would be likely to have on the several matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Is that a matter of fact or a matter of opinion or judgment?  Is it pure rigid, stark, naked fact, or do the words &ldquo;which certain things are likely to have on&rdquo; not necessarily imply some judgment formed after evidence heard?  The Deputy's contention has been that the Tariff Commissioners have gone outside the Schedule in expressing opinions.  Have the Tariff Commissioners gone outside the Schedule in expressing opinions where they have not been asked to express opinions?  If they say we are for or against, and that we make a recommendation or we do not as regards an application put forward, is that anything more than crossing the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; and dotting the &ldquo;i's&rdquo;? In the Schedule to the Act the Commissioners have to report on the efficiency, extent and relative importance of the industry in respect of which the application is made, on the effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for would be likely to have, and the cost, efficiency, conditions of labour and rates of wages, and the effect the granting would be likely to have on the matters mentioned in paragraph one and its effect on the consumers of goods.  Could the Deputy imagine a Report which would indicate the Commissioners findings on facts on a matter which they are asked to find on the facts, which would not necessarily include, except in a ball line case, a declaration for or against an application put before them?</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy seriously think that the Commissioners have gone outside their terms of reference?  He says they have fallen short of the terms of reference in one thing, that they have not reported, in the case of the flour application, on the effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concessions asked for in the application would be likely to have on other trades and industries in Saorstát Eireann. Remember, the Tariff Commission has to consider every application referred to it, and report on the several aspects specified in the Schedule, or such of those aspects as are applicable thereto. Surely if the Report is a matter that one as a scholar wanted to see everything <Col N="318" /> worked out to the bitter end, he might say &ldquo;Go on and report,&rdquo; notwithstanding the fact that you are not going to report in favour of the tariff, and notwithstanding what the effect of that on the revenue of Saorstát Eireann is going to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is simply a matter for them to report.  We have the statement made with regard to the Tariff Commissioners that they have delayed applications, that their consideration of an application is so detailed and exact they cannot get on with the other business before them on which the industrial fate of the country depends.  Deputy Lemass, where the Tariff Commission decides to report against an application made by certain applicants, would have the Commissioners to make an academic inquiry as to the effect which the granting of the application would be likely to have on the public revenues of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy simply wants to make them a body to decide certain questions.  If the Dáil in its wisdom sees fit, after getting the report from the Commission, to grant a tariff, it can certainly refer the report back and ask for further information. There is no harm in doing that.  I think the Deputy himself would be outraged if he found that the Tariff Commissioners had spent valuable days in considering the effects on the revenue of an application which they did not think was likely to be granted, instead of going on to hear evidence in regard to some of the other applications coming before them.  The Deputy says that it is a matter of national policy to decide on tariffs, and that it is not a matter for anybody outside this House.  I said before that the Dáil had, to a certain <Col N="319" /> extent, delegated certain powers belonging to the Dáil itself to the Tariff Commission, and asked them to report on certain matters of fact and opinion, but the Dáil by no means hands over to the Tariff Commission the final decision. It will be remembered that in the case of the flour tariff the Tariff Commissioners reported they found great difficulty with regard to the granting of the application because of the effect which the granting of the tariff might have on the firm of Jacob's.  In so far as the decision of this House was said to be the decision of the Executive Council it was clearly announced that what happened was that the firm of Messrs. Jacob mattered very little in coming to a decision whether that application should be granted or not.  The main concern was the effect that the granting of the application would have on the consumers of flour in the country, and increasing the cost of living.  The Tariff Commission did report, as they were bound to report, upon the effect of the granting of that application as regards the firm of Messrs. Jacob.  They brought that before us, but it was not a matter that entered very much into some people's consideration.  As far as the Executive Council are concerned they declared that aspect of the question did not enter into their minds in accepting the recommendation of the Commissioners against the granting of the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil does not part with the final decision, and the Dáil voluntarily, by passing the Tariff Commission Act, gave over to the Tariff Commissioners certain problems and certain matters of fact to form their judgment on, but the final decision rests with the Dáil. Deputy Lemass also complained that no aspect of nationality came before the Commissioners.  That was a strange comment for a Deputy to make, who was complaining that the Tariff Commissioners did not confine themselves definitely and clearly to what was put before them in the Schedule.  The national effect of granting a particular application referred to the Commission is one of the matters that the Dáil was very loath to part with.  It is one of the matters that the Dáil refused to part <Col N="320" /> with.  But on certain matters of fact and opinion which the Tariff Commissioners may eventually send back to the Dáil the Dáil has complete control. It is absurd and ridiculous to say that the Tariff Commissioners in finding on what they are asked to find are acting in any partisan way.  The question of a tariff on rosary beads was raised, and the Deputy stated certain customs rates or duty should have been imposed, and went on to make certain comments.  Again that is inherent, if not explicitly stated, in the first five paragraphs of the Schedule to the Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of margarine, the Deputy complained of the effect on the consumers and made a statement that no guarantee would have helped to get a recommendation made unless the Commissioners were satisfied that the recommendations would have been carried out.  Surely, again, that is inherent in the paragraph to the Schedule where the Commissioners are asked to decide upon the effect which the granting in whole or in part of the concession asked for would be likely to have on the consumers of the country. Are they not entitled to say under that &ldquo;We believe, ordinarily speaking, the granting of the tariff on margarine would have an adverse effect upon consumers throughout the country.  We believe that if a guarantee were given to us that there was to be no increased cost then that would be something in the nature of rebutting evidence in regard to the other matters.&rdquo;  Surely, they are further entitled to say that we would not believe in any guarantee given us by any firm unless we were satisfied that the conditions of the manufacture were such as to enable the guarantee to be carried out?</P>
    <P>The margarine application was the ruling case with regard to an application properly made and granted.  As to the particular way in which the Deputy would deal with this situation, his idea is, apparently, to make up his mind on prima facie evidence that a national emergency calls for the imposition of a tariff.</P>
    <P>An application was made for a tariff on margarine by a firm which said they were opposed to tariffs in general, because they believed that the full effect <Col N="321" /> of a tariff was going to be borne by the consumers in the country in which the tariff was granted, and not merely that, but that the consuming public would also have to bear the extra profits looked for by the manufacturers in any tariffed industry.  These people came before a public sitting of the Tariff Commission at which evidence was given.  Of the three firms engaged in the industry, one definitely is controlled by an outside firm&mdash;a firm which previously said they were anti-tariff in general, though they made an application for a tariff as regards the margarine trade.  One of the members of that firm declared afterwards, after a public sitting at which he had heard that the main manufacturing body in the country was under the control of an outside firm&mdash;a big international combine&mdash;in his own city, and that there are theoretical objections advanced against tariffs by people to whom theoretical objections are a joy, and that if we put on a tariff outside bodies will come in and crush small enterprise in this country.  Within four months the person who had made that statement&mdash;the person who started off by being anti-tariff in general, though for a tariff on margarine&mdash;spoke of theoretical objections, and withdrew his application since he discovered that one of the firms engaged in this application for a tariff is controlled by an outside firm of big international standing, and that he was likely to be crushed.  We want the facts revealed by the Tariff Commission.  We do not want inefficiency protected in the country. We do not want to have the sort of conduct I have described protected. Nobody, I think, will disagree with protection where it is shown that the article to be protected is properly manufactured, or, that if it is not so at the beginning, there is a chance of it being manufactured under good conditions.  There is great necessity for a public body having public sittings, having people examined and the facts publicly investigated.  But no one wants a ring around this country if the people inside are inefficient, or in the absence of any evidence that they are likely to become efficient. One objects to being closed up inside <Col N="322" /> a protection fence.  That is the value of a Tariff Commission, and the value of the investigation which the Commission has to make, and that is the great value of the Report upon such matters which the Tariff Commission are asked to present to this House. When this House gets the opinion of the Tariff Commission, formed after evidence heard and presented, then this House would be in the position of forming its judgment whether or not it is in the interests of the community, and not in the interests of the manufacturers concerned, to grant a tariff or not.  That is the position we want to have, and the position the Deputy apparently wants to have is one where you put on tariffs indiscriminately and hope the result is going to be good. We prefer to have an examination before instead of having rueful experience after the tariff has been put on.</P>

But he has carefully neglected to point out to me the section of the Act that indicates that the Commissioners shall make recommendations in respect of any applications submitted to them. He has also failed to explain how it is that the Commissioners can fail to carry out the duty conferred on them by the Act in respect of reporting under one sub-head, as they have done. Surely it is applicable that they should report on the effect on the public revenue. The Commissioners may be able to guess what the decision of the Dáil will be after they have made their Report.  But if it is their function, as I presume it is, merely to make available to the Dáil all the possible information concerning an industry so that <Col N="323" /> the Dáil will give a wise decision, they should make available all the information, even if that information should <Col N="324" /> not be necessary, in view of the consequent decision of the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KERLIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to raise this particular case of a claim for compensation made by Madame MacBride in view of what I consider the unreasonable and unjust attitude taken up by the Minister for Finance.  In the first place, I do not see why a claim of this kind should be considered outside the scope of this particular Compensation Committee or any of the Compensation Committees which dealt with the claims for property seized or destroyed during the Anglo-Irish struggle.  Personally, I am not acquainted with the terms of reference of this particular Compensation (Ireland) Committee, as it is called.  I think there should be some machinery whereby compensation could be obtained in this particular case.  The actual facts of the case are as given in a letter by Madame MacBride in which she says: &ldquo;During the Anglo-Irish war in 1920 my motor car was seized by the English.  My son was driving it, and the offence was that he was driving Countess Markievicz, T.D., who was on the run at the time.  My son was kept in jail for three weeks, and was afterwards released without trial or explanation.  The car was seized by the Black-and-Tans.  It was a seven-seater Standard, worth £200, and essential to me, as I was very ill at the time, after being six months in jail in Holloway, and by the doctor's orders I was living in a cottage in the Wicklow Mountains, only possible if one had a car.  After the Truce, Mr. Cope had promised that the car or its equivalent would be returned.  Mr. Duggan also promised the car would be returned, but after the shelling of the Four Courts and my son's internment I could get nothing done.  I applied to the Claims Commission in Ely Place, who, after investigating the matter, admitted my claim, and after great delay recommended me for £125 compensation.  Mr. Blythe struck my claim off the list of claims recommended, for the alleged reason that Madame MacBride was responsible for destruction.  Last week the Commission sent me an official letter saying my claim was not within the terms of reference.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further down she says: &ldquo;Mr. Blythe also opposed a claim for damage done to my house at 73 Stephen's Green by Free State soldiers, but eventually I won this in open court before Judge Drumgoole.  Judge Drumgoole said it was quite evident my sympathies were not with the Government, but that did not prove that I had done any destruction or anything which would invalidate my claim to compensation.  Unfortunately, the Claims Commission works in secret and not in open court or I would have my award paid for the car.&rdquo; In reply to a supplementary question as to whether there were any other cases where a recommendation was made for an ex gratia payment by this Compensation Committee, and whether he had acted on a recommendation in any of these cases, the Minister <Col N="327" /> for Finance replied that he had.  When I asked him what was the essential difference between Madame MacBride's case and the other case in which he acted upon the Committee's recommendation, he said that Madame MacBride's case was not one of hardship and that the others were.  I do not agree with that statement.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Madame MacBride has been able to exist without the actual payment for this car.  But there are hundreds of other people who received payment of their claims in respect of property, whether seized or destroyed, who could have done without that money. They would not have actual starvation if they did not receive compensation.  I do not think that the Minister should use that as a reason why the claim should not be paid.  I am quite sure that there are thousands of other people who received adequate compensation in respect of motor cars which were seized both by the British forces and by the Republican forces during the Anglo-Irish trouble.  In fact, when the Minister puts forward this plea of no hardship he is changing his ground on the matter, and I am quite sure that this plea of no hardship is only being put forward just to cover up the case, because the Minister adopted, as far as I can see, quite a different attitude on this matter before.</P>
    <P>As Madame MacBride pointed out, he struck her name off the list of claims for the alleged reason that she was supposed to be one of those responsible for destruction during the civil war. Madame MacBride gave me a letter which was sent on to her by Senator Yeats, who was looking after this question for her a year or two ago.  I do not usually quote Senator Yeats, but I suppose under the circumstances I will be forgiven.  He says: &ldquo;In connection with your claim, Mr. Blythe writes to me as follows,&rdquo; and he gives the actual words of Mr. Blythe in inverted commas.  The actual words are: &ldquo;In regard to the action in the case of Madame Gonne MacBride's compensation claim I can only say that the decision in this matter was taken advisedly and will not be altered.  As Madame Gonne MacBride was one of <Col N="328" /> those responsible for the destruction which placed such a financial burden on this country, I felt bound to refuse her compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That apparently is the actual or supposed reason why the Minister has turned down this particular claim.  I consider that that attitude, as displayed in that quotation, is most unreasonable and unjust.  Madame Gonne MacBride should be entitled to adequate compensation in respect of that car which was seized by the British forces in 1920.  When the car was seized it was actually being used for national work, and Madame Gonne MacBride should be as much entitled to compensation as those other people who have received adequate and, in some cases, over-generous compensation for property that was destroyed during the Anglo-Irish trouble.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to look at this case from the Cumann na nGaedheal point of view, surely the fact that Madame MacBride was a Republican and was sympathetic to the Republican forces during the civil war should not debar her from receiving compensation for a motor car that was seized by the British forces during the Anglo-Irish trouble.  In fact, this question of destruction and responsibility for destruction that has been raised before is just a smoke-screen.  I think that the statement of the Minister in connection with Madame Gonne MacBride is unfounded and most unfair.  To my mind it would appear that the reason for the refusal to deal with this claim has simply resulted from political spite and political prejudice against Madame Gonne MacBride, and especially on account of her activities during the past couple of years in connection with political prisoners.  That is all I have to say in the matter.  I ask the Minister whether, in view of what are undoubtedly altered political circumstances in the country, he would not reconsider a case like this.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt, sir, that possibly a case like this would have gone through if special attention had not been given to it because of Madame Gonne MacBride's activities. But I looked at the case again this <Col N="329" /> morning and it seems to me that it is a case which should not be paid and which ought not to be recommended for payment.</P>
      <P>The Property Losses Compensation Commission made awards in cases which were within their terms of reference. These awards were of the same status as the reports made by County Court Judges, that is, in the case of awards payment might be made in full by the Minister for Finance, or it might be made in part or withheld. Then they make finally a certain other class of recommendations which were called recommendations.  Now, the awards which were within the scope of their terms of reference were merely recommendations.  The decisions that were called recommendations were in regard to cases outside the terms of reference.  Something like 40,600 cases were dealt with by that Commission.  Seventeen thousand nine hundred and seventy-one were ruled outside the terms of reference.  For all practical purposes, you may say 18,000 cases were ruled outside the terms of reference.  A great number of these were cases of loot.  Other cases were cases where there was consequential damage of a sort that could not be claimed for.  A very large number of cases were loot, and, in a great many cases, loot on a very substantial scale had been suffered by the applicants. Towards the end, the Commission were asked to deal with certain cases that were outside their terms of reference, and to make representations for compassionate grants where there had been special hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I looked over a number of the recommendations where we have paid.  The cases that I was able to see in the short time I had available were cases in which, for instance, a business had been shut down for a year, or where four or five motors belonging to a taxi firm or motor transport firm had been seized.  They were proper cases, and it was fair to distinguish them from cases where £50 worth of boots, say, had been looted out of a shop and nothing done.  The man who suffered loot in this pre-Truce period of £50 worth of boots got nothing. The Commission was not <Col N="330" /> satisfied, in dealing with these compassionate cases, to make recommendations. It was supposed to make recommendations where the parties really suffered special hardship.  Looking at it this morning afresh, when I had the answer to the Deputy's question before me, I am perfectly satisfied that no recommendation should have been made in Madame MacBride's case.  It was not one of those cases of special hardship.  Perhaps she is a person of influence and that she was persistent, and she was able to get her case considered where people who were far more deserving by the hundred and perhaps by the thousand throughout the country were not able to get their cases considered at all. I say that, apart altogether from any political question.  I frankly admit attention was drawn to the case, and it was scrutinised because of what I regarded as activities that were damaging to the public interest.  Attention was drawn to it, but, apart from that, looking at it now, I am quite satisfied it is a weaker case than those reported on by the County Court Judges.  It is in a category below the awards of this Commission, which in themselves were only recommendations, and might or might not be paid.  Practically 18,000 cases were ruled outside the terms of reference of the Commission.  Recommendations for compassionate allowances were made in 350 cases.</P>
    <P>Madame MacBride's case should really be amongst the 17,000 odd and not amongst the 300 odd.  There was no sort of hardship.  There was no hardship comparable with that in the case of the man earning his livelihood and supporting his family by a motor business and being put out of business for a year.  There was no special hardship in the case and I am satisfied that it was only by some sort of persistence or influence that she succeeded in getting a recommendation where no recommendation should have been given. It would be giving specially favourable treatment to somebody who as far as one can know does not seem to need it, while nothing was got by people who if not completely knocked out of business were seriously injured in business and might have been injured to <Col N="331" /> the point of having to go out after the Commission had dealt with the case or had ceased to operate.  The class of case in which persons were completely knocked out of business was the class in which there was a chance that the Commission would recommend a compassionate gratuity.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that possibly there are many worse cases than this, but should not the British Government have been responsible for compensation for this motor car which was seized by their forces?  I understood the Provisional Government took over responsibility for payment of such compensation.</P>

      <P>The British would never agree to pay in a case like that. At that time, the British assumed responsibility for certain cases, but not in a case like this.  They never would assume responsibility for any of the loot cases and that is why the loot cases were never dealt with.  We, on the other hand, had contended that it was their responsibility and we refused to pay anything in the loot cases. Then, finally, the British liability was compromised for the sum of £900,000 and it was after that the Commission was asked to make these recommendations for compassionate allowances. The British never consented.  I have not had time to look fully into this case but I presume this was on a par with the loot cases.  It was of the type of loot cases.</P>

      <P>Is not that the essential difference between this case and the cases the Minister said were ruled out?  This was not a loot case. This car was seized and the man who was driving the car was taken prisoner and was held officially.  That is an aspect of the case that the Minister <Col N="332" /> must advert to and give some consideration to.</P>

      <P>These cases are all on an entirely different basis.  The cases that come under the Act are post-Truce cases.  These pre-Truce cases were dealt with on an entirely different basis, and I can safely say that thousands of people who would have got compensation if their losses had occurred post-Truce and had come under the Act got no compensation at all because their losses were pre-Truce and were dealt with by the Wood-Renton Commission.</P>
