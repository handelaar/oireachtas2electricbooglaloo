    <P>Debate resumed on the motion:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In speaking to the Bill yesterday I endeavoured to show that it was introduced because the existing law had failed to deal with the evil of immoral literature.  The Minister for Justice, in speaking to the Bill. stated a proposition with which I was in through agreement.  He said: &ldquo;The aim of the Bill is not an unwarrantable infringement of the liberty of the subject.&rdquo;  There is a certain section of the Press which has been industriously engaged, for some considerable time, in endeavouring to prove that this Bill was an infringement of ordinary liberty, in the ordinary accepted sense of the term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard John Stuart Mill quoted on a couple of occasions during the debate yesterday, and if there is one authority upon what constitutes the liberty of the subject I think that authority is John Stuart Mill.  John Stuart Mill laid down two fundamentals for liberty.  He said first, that the individual is not accountable to society for his actions so far as these actions concerned the interest of no person but himself.  The second fundamental that Mill laid down was that, so far as such actions are prejudicial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable, and subject to either legal or social punishments, if society is of opinion that such punishment is requisite for its protection.  That sums up in a word the very proposition that the Minister for Justice put before this <Col N="682" /> House.  These are two principles upon which the Bill rests, and they are principles which no fair-minded man could object to.  The liberty of the Press has been abused, not by our own national Press, but by a licentious and alien Press, which has been engaged in rivalry amongst a certain section of it. A certain section of that Press has obtained huge circulation by means of the propagation of a vile type of publications which every Deputy in this House objects to.  We are all aware that huge sums for advertising purposes are netted by advertisements of cantraceptives, by the sale of contraceptives, and by a propaganda which deals with birth control.</P>
    <P>This Bill is effectively designed to put a check to the operations of that foreign Press that circulates amongst us.  The Bill is not designed to curtail the liberty of the Press. The Bill is designed to curtail the licentiousness of the Press.  In this House yesterday there appeared to be no difference of opinion, as far as this Bill is concerned, in dealing with what a Deputy very properly termed fugitive literature. But in criticising this Bill a very eminent Senator said that the object of the Bill was to eliminate foreign competition in our Irish markets.  Will any Deputy either in this House or any member of the Seanad contend that the Irish markets exist for the benefit of and for the profit of the alien Press that is in circulation amongst us?  Will and Deputy contend that the English motor markets exist for the benefit of the productions of Cork rather than for the benefit of the productions of Coventry?  If the English Press cannot carry on with the national Press fair and legitimate competition on sane and healthy lines, the duty of this State is to see that such competition must be put an end to.  I, for one, have no sympathy whatever with that particular point of view which has been put forward.</P>
    <P>May I turn for one moment to the second aspect of the Bill which some of the Deputies representing the universities, and some, perhaps, of the best educated men in this House endeavoured to have removed from the Bill?  I refer to the question of the publication of books.  Deputy Law <Col N="683" /> suggested it would be better to leave books alone.  He stated that he doubted if it was worth while.  Other speakers seemed to me to follow similar lines and appeared anxious to eliminate this section of the Bill which deals with the publication and restriction of books.  I do suggest to the Minister for Justice that he should stand firm over this section of the Bill. I do suggest that this section is as vital and just as important as the sections dealing with what has been termed the fugitive Press.  Is it suggested in this House that the standards of literature are of such high excellence that we can with safety give them free circulation amongst us, or will any Deputy say that their circulation requires no check and no prohibition? I think anybody who would give just a moment's consideration to that aspect will admit straight away that there can be no justification for such a statement.</P>
    <P>There has been an extraordinary fall in the moral standard in recent English literature.  Speaking in this House, I hope it is not rank heresy to say that. I should like to quote an eminent authority dealing with that matter in the &ldquo;Evening Standard.&rdquo;  That authority is Dean Inge.  He dealt with what he considers to be the standard of morality of literature in England to-day.  Dean Inge said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A corrupt following of Continental novels, French and Russian, has introduced both vulgarity and indecency into most English fiction.  They have found their way in under the the specious name of realism and problem psychology.  We are threatened with an outbreak of licentiousness like that which followed the Civil War in the 17th century and the Napoleonic Wars of 100 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister for Justice dealt in a very able and lucid manner with this aspect of the question.  The Minister in dealing with the question of books said: &ldquo;A book can only be fairly condemned when its tenor is bad and when it is systematically indecent. It must not be condemned for one or <Col N="684" /> two passages.&rdquo;  And he instanced such a work as Thackeray's &ldquo;Vanity Fair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another eminent member of the House instanced certain works which deal with venereal disease and prostitution. Those subjects can be dealt with in a very different way than that in which the present-day writers are dealing with them.  Anybody who has read the immortal works of Dickens knows that he has dealt with the very seamy side of life, and that his pen-pictures of those aspects of life stand as a moral warning to generations upon generations. Anybody who has read these portraits of life knows the moral drawn is only for the good of the people.  Is it not a very well-known fact that most of the large sellers as far as books are concerned to-day deal absolutely with problems of sex, thinly veiled indecency from cover to cover?  Is there not a very large sale for the type of book that is absolutely subversive of religion.  This has led, in the words of the Bishop of Durham, &ldquo;to the disintegration of the home, and a nation of churchless and creedless Christianity.&rdquo; That is literature as it stands to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Law gave us some examples of books which were upon the border line, but Deputy Law did not deal with the examples which really matter, the examples which really count.  I ask the House, does it intend to tolerate the admission of such books as &ldquo;Woman and the New Race,&rdquo; by Margaret Sanger; &ldquo;The Well of Loneliness,&rdquo; by Radclyffe Hall; &ldquo;Lady Chatterley's Lover,&rdquo; by D.H. Laurence, and &ldquo;Sapho,&rdquo; by Flaubert.  There are other books such as Fielding's &ldquo;Tom Jones,&rdquo; which I think this country could be better without.  There is another very prolific writer, Doctor Marie Stopes, who deals with sex problems, with birth control and with things which no father would permit his child to come in contact with.  I have here in my hand a cutting from the &ldquo;Sunday Chronicle&rdquo; dealing with the banning of the novel of a famous writer.  It says: &ldquo;A sensation has been caused in the literary world by the dramatic action which has been taken by the British Customs authorities against the astounding book, &lsquo;Lady Chatterley's Lover,&rsquo; by D.H. Laurence.&rdquo; It has been printed for subscribers <Col N="685" /> only, and it is reeking with obscenity.  We have the picture of a paralysed husband drawn in the book.</P>

      <P>Lady Chatterley and her lover go into minute descriptions in the book, and such words are used between them that it is absolutely impossible even to hint at their nature. Now that we are dealing with the subject of evil literature it is just as well to look facts in the face and realise for ourselves what the position actually is. I suggest that the literature of to-day is on the down grade.  I suggest there is an absolute necessity for this section of the Bill.  Deputy Law appeared to think that if we took such action as that we would be inflicting very considerable hardship upon those engaged in the book-selling trade.  I have before me a quotation from &ldquo;The Book-seller,&rdquo; the official organ of the book-selling trade.  It says: &ldquo;The more one discusses the question of the decadent the more the problem seems to bristle with difficulty.  The book-seller is too frequently blamed, but he should share the blame with the author, the publisher, and the public who ask for it.  Realistic fiction seems to come in waves.  The war made people think and write loosely, and what is the book-seller to do?  Indecency in fiction, no less than in any other sphere, should be regulated by civic action, and is a matter for the authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested here by some of those who are engaged as authors in the production of books that there is a very rooted objection to anything in the nature of a check or prohibition as far as the activities of authors are concerned.  Anybody who has read the report issued by the Catholic Truth Society on the problem of undesirable printed matter, and who has looked at the section of the Bill dealing with books, can only come to one conclusion that this is a vital section in the Bill. On page 44 of that report I see where <Col N="686" /> Dr. Weber, vice-chancellor of Austria, has received from the Austrian branch of the German Writers' Federation, the oldest association of the kind in Germany, a protest against the present output of pornographic literature.  The protest is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Austrian Group of the German League of Writers feels it a duty to take a definite stand in regard to the increased output, in the fields of books and of journalism, of publications which exceed all bounds of decency and morality, and which, masking under the name of science or philanthropy, or else openly, under no mask whatsoever, pursue no other aim than that of carrying on a lucrative business by serving to the reading public a constant output of sexual arguments, thus stimulating the most perverse instincts.</P>
    <P>It appears to be a most horrible action on the part of this House to introduce a Bill that would deal with books.  In America a Clean Books Bill has been introduced into the Legislature of Albany.  Under its provisions any publisher who issues any printed matter that is found to be lewd, lascivious or obscene can be sent to jail for from 10 days to one year, and, in addition, may be fined from 50 dollars to 100 dollars.  The Bill the Minister has introduced is not nearly so drastic as that, and we have been told that if the section referred to is persisted in it will do more harm than good.  I think we ought to have the courage of our convictions, and I agree with Deputy Lemass when he said that we are really behind the times as far as dealing with evil literature is concerned.</P>
    <P>If I might turn for a moment to the question of artificial birth control, that is another aspect of the problem that must be faced.  This country I believe stands for the sanctity of the marriage tie.  It stands for the preservation and the shouldering of responsibilities by those who enter into the married state. To the vast majority of the people the limitation, the control of births, or the infliction of race suicide upon this nation is one that is bitterly resented. Anyone who has given it any consideration at all must see that in this matter <Col N="687" /> we are behind the times.  If one looks at France, America, Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Victoria he will see that action has already been taken in this particular way.  There appears to be an undercurrent of feeling that birth control is more or less in the interests of this State.  This very eminent critic in the Upper House, that I have already referred to, appeared to think that the introduction of such a measure would be the infliction of a very grave injury, as he put it, not upon the wealthy classes who would no doubt be able to avail themselves whether there were restrictions or not, but on the poorer classes of this country.  Is it suggested by that learned Senator that birth control or race suicide is in the interests of any State?  If one might refer with all respect to the great French nation, what has happened there?  The French population actually exceeded the German population in 1850.  To-day the German population stands at 69 millions and the French population at 39½ millions.  Is that for the benefit of France?  Does it not cause the gravest concern to French statesmen who have the interests of their country at heart? Does it make for the production of a better race, and what is the effect upon a people from whom all moral responsibility, as far as the marriage tie is concerned, is removed?  One might go from one extreme to the other in considering this aspect of the question. One might turn for a moment from the great French nation, which is the acme of European civilisation and glance at China where infanticide is permitted. What happens there?  Has it brought about a reduction in the numbers in that country?  On the contrary, because there is no responsibility under that particular head the population of China has increased.  I do not think any same man could for a moment suggest, as this eminent Senator has suggested, that it is in the interests of the any State, or in the interests of the success of any State, that this question of birth control should go on unheeded and unchecked.</P>
    <P>There was rather a grave attack in <Col N="688" /> the House yesterday on the setting up of the Censorship Board.  That attack I think crystallised the whole kernel of this question.  We read some time ago articles by this eminent Senator to whom I referred which were published in a Manchester paper.  One of them stated: &ldquo;This Bill, if it becomes law, may inflict a dangerous wound upon the Irish intellect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator does not tell us how, but he goes on to say that if such a Board is established &ldquo;our zealots' idea of establishing the Kingdom of God upon earth is to make Ireland an island of moral cowards.&rdquo;  I wonder who has done more for the uplifting of the intellectual status of this nation.  Has it been the incoming flood of literature, to which every right-thinking man has objected, or has it been those zealots, to whom Senator Yeats has taken exception? What have those zealots done for the development of intellect in Ireland? I have no hesitation in saying that I was a pupil of some of those zealots, and I see on the front benches of both the Official Opposition and the Government Party pupils of those zealots, who learned, not alone a taste for literature and the rudiments of knowledge, not alone those things that they required to fit them to fight the battle of life, but who also learned love of country and love of God.  I do suggest to this House that the great majority of this great intellectual nation, which was famous, as far as letters were concerned, at a time when other nations were sunk in barbarism, owes to those zealots to whom Senator Yeats has referred a debt of gratitude which they can never pay.  I feel that as far as the development of the intellectual status of this country is concerned, we in this House have no hesitation whatever in acknowledging the debt that should be paid to those zealots, and we are anxious to take the development of intellect, not from the flood of evil which has been pouring into the country, but from those zealots who always stood behind the nation in fair weather and in foul.</P>

      <P>I wish briefly to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this measure, to congratulate <Col N="689" /> the Government for having taken the matter up, and particularly to congratulate the Committee on whose report this Bill has been drafted.  I do not propose at this stage to criticise the various sections of the measure; in fact, I think there are only one or two sections which have been the subject of criticism up to this.  I have only to say that it is not too soon for a measure of this kind to be introduced, having regard to its importance to our nation. It is a Bill which affects the future of our race, and which affects the mental and physical development of our people, and if we, who have to discuss this measure and to try to make it as good as it can possibly be, bear in mind the important effect that this Bill will have on the future of our people, I think we will set ourselves, in the Committee Stage, to tighten up any clauses in it which require tightening up and to loosen any that require loosening, endeavouring in that way to lay the foundation for the guidance of our rising population in the matter of race control and in the matter of the class of mental pabulum which they should have.  I congratulate the Minister and all concerned on the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In rising to welcome this Bill and to congratulate the Minister on its introdution, I wish to express the hope that when it has gone through its various stages and will appear on the Statute Book, it will be an efficient instrument in combating those evils that everybody in this House so rightly deplores. One very gratifying and satisfactory feature of this debate has been that the fears which a certain section of the Press expressed about this Bill, and those expressed by another section, that I might describe as highbrows, have found no echo here.  Deputies who have spoken have more faith in the common sense of the yet unknown censors board that will be set up to administer the Act.  I am certainly at a disadvantage in following that eminent, learned and discursive speaker, my colleague for North Dublin, who has just spoken, and I only intend to say that no vote I have ever given here, or will ever give, will <Col N="690" /> be given with more satisfaction than the vote I will register in favour of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree at all with what has been said by many Teachtaí to the effect that the greatest harm has been done through the reading of newspapers that come into the country.  It is my opinion that just as much harm is done by the cheap novels that are imported by the ton every week.  They are distributed to the shops throughout the country and they are sold in an underhand way.  They are bought principally by young girls, I am sorry to say, and they go into almost every cabin in the country.  A short time ago I had occasion to visit a poor woman in an out-of-the-way place in County Meath, about three miles from Maynooth. This woman lived in a two-roomed thatched cabin, and a storm took away half the roof one night. She asked me to go out to have a look at it to see if I could do anything for her.  This poor woman and I were sitting by the fire in the kitchen&mdash;the roof had been taken off the bedroom&mdash; and we were chatting.  I saw on a shelf inside the chimney breast a box with some books in it.  &ldquo;Biddy,&rdquo; said I to the woman. &ldquo;I see you have some books here.  Perhaps there may be some valuable old Irish manuscripts among them.  May I have a look at them?&rdquo; She said that I might.  I took down the box and examined the contents. There were about ten copies of the &ldquo;Irish Rosary&rdquo; and just as many copies of these filthy novels, novels with attractively coloured covers, with their suggestive, immoral, filthy stories. I looked through one of them to see what they were like, and then I asked <Col N="691" /> her where she got them.  She said she got them to read from girls in the neighbourhood.  Now, what happened there is happening throughout the country, and, as I said before, these books are bought principally by young girls.  The result is that the girls are getting a taste for that sort of thing, and their morals are being destroyed. Therefore, I say that at least as much attention should be paid to the importation of these books as to the importation of newspapers.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter I think it is silly to mention at all such works as Shakespeare's or Thackeray's, or scientific and medical books.  We all know that the amount of harm that is done by these books is infinitesimal.  It is the cheap novel that is doing the harm as well as the filthy newspaper. I would ask the Minister that, when these books are being examined, if there is a doubt as to whether they should be censored or not, not to give them the benefit of the doubt, but to censor them and prevent them coming into the country altogether.  The point that I wanted to draw attention to was that I think more harm is being done by these cheap novels than even by newspapers.  I know that the poor people in the country do not as a rule read the newspapers.  It is very hard to get them to read a newspaper.  Of course, I know that they are more inclined to take in the Sunday paper, especially those papers that publish filthy stories and filthy news.  I would ask the Minister to pay attention to these cheap novels that come into the country by the ton every week, and that find their way to every corner of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House very long with what I have to say on the matter.  With many Deputies who have spoken already on the Bill, I say that it is a step in the right direction, in so far as it does what it sets out to do, namely, to suppress evil literature.  A good deal of ground has already been gone over, and certain distinctions have been made. My support will be given to the Bill in so far as it sets out to suppress, in the words of the Bill, what is obscene and <Col N="692" /> what is indecent.  I do not think it would take a censor board of supermen to decide that, but if we are led away further, and into other realms, I think that we cannot give the Bill our unqualified support.  The Deputy who has just sat down has recalled some discussions that went on in earlier days when it was thought wrong even to read a novel.  I think we have got past that stage.  We know that novels are now recognised in the classics, and are of very high educational value.  I enjoy reading them myself.  I have no taste, and never had, for the yellow back novel to which the last Deputy referred. If we are going to thrust on the board of censors the task of deciding in the matter of other literature&mdash; that is, apart from what is indecent and obscene&mdash;then I think we are entering a doubtful place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Law, when speaking yesterday, made a distinction between newspapers and books.  I confess that I could not follow what he said in support of it, and while the Deputy and myself see eye to eye on a good many things I am afraid that we cannot do so on that.  I recall a book that I read a long number of years ago.  It was the life of one of America's greatest Presidents&mdash;President Garfield.  The book was the famous one with the title &ldquo;From Log Cabin to White House.&rdquo; He tells of where he was first employed he met evil companions amid evil surroundings. These had no effect whatever upon his character, but in the house in which he lodged there were a couple of very bad books of evil tendencies. These were on the point of wrecking what afterwards proved to be a very useful and successful career, so that I cannot see there is any difference between what you read in a newspaper and what you read in a book.</P>

      <P>My whole point was this, that I said it was logically absurd to forbid in a newspaper what would be allowed within the printed covers of a book.  What I pointed out was this: that while the one evil was patent, <Col N="693" /> widespread in general, the other, so far as my information goes, was not.  We had some other evidence of another kind this morning.  So far as my information goes the other evil, if evil it be, was confined to a very small number of people.  That is to say, it affected a very small number of people, because the book-reading public would be very much smaller than that reading newspapers.  That is the main point I made.  The other point was this, that as it was very easy to tell at once the character of a newspaper which blares its character forth on the face of it, it is by no means so easy to distinguish the exact character of a book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HASLETT</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the explanation. In regard to following up this, it is the duty of this House to see that what is defined is controlled, that is, what is defined as indecent or obscene, but I do not think it is the duty of this House to travel into the realms of other kinds of morality&mdash;what I might call the higher morality.  I think that problem belongs to another department, the educational department, which ought to be engaged in training the youth of the country in a way that would cultivate what is best in them.  I do not think it is the duty of this House to travel into those realms at all.  As regards my position, I am prepared to support the Minister so long as he keeps to the hard facts, to what is obscene and indecent; but I certainly will not give him unqualified support to go into other realms wherein we might be questioned.  In my opinion it is quite enough for the State to put up finger-posts on the road and not barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the debate on both sides of the House might be summed up in the fact that the House accepts the truth of the proverb &ldquo;that the best is often the enemy of the good,&rdquo; and that possibly in attempting to kill with a single blow the hydra-headed evil we may fail to kill that evil, overreach our strength, and leave ourselves open to attack which we ought not to be open to.  So far as I read the discussion which has taken place, there is unanimous agreement in this House and there is overwhelming agreement outside this House and behind <Col N="694" /> it, in the opinion that a certain particular and restricted kind of evil should be stopped ruthlessly.  In so far as the Bill will confine itself definitely to that issue of clearing out the garbage and of suppressing pornographic literature of all kinds and preventing any possibility by casualness or carelessness of evil literature getting into the hands of the ordinary people of this country who are not looking for it&mdash;that so far as that is the principle of the Bill and shall express that principle&mdash;it will have the unhesitating support of the whole House.  The difficulty undoubtedly has been that people have, to some extent, misunderstood and legitimately misunderstood, if they worked merely by what is written in the Bill, the purpose of this Bill.  If the Bill was the Bill which was described, justified and excused by the Minister for Justice, then it would have a large measure of support.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the drafted ambit of the Bill is distinctly different to what is the intention and purpose either of this House or, apparently, of the Government.  We start in this country in relation to sexual matters, and, fortunately, that is an issue with one enormous advantage of which you cannot exaggerate the significance, and that is the vast majority of the people are living on the land close up day by day with natural phenomena, and they do know in the simplest, most ordinary, and very best possible manner those facts which in the city, and among the people less fortunately circumstanced, are the subject of prurient curiosity. We do not start with that breeding ground of evil, of curiosity, which cannot be satisfied by legitimate and ordinary means, and in relation to which knowledge among people living in cities invariably and inevitably comes through the wrong source.  We start with that immense moral foundation upon which to build. I believe without any doubt that morally and physically this country is healthy and sound, and that the purpose of this Bill ought to be that by no carelessness and casualness should people who are not looking for it be brought into contact with that danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How casual and how careless the disemination <Col N="695" /> of that knowledge may be you can take from this example which, not through propaganda in relation to this, two or three years ago in the ordinary course of conversation I came across.  Here in the city of Dublin, on a Sunday afternoon, a father wanting a book to read, picked up a book in his own house and brought it up to his bedroom, but found it was a book unfit for him to read.  Being a sensible man he made inquiries, and he found that the book belonged to one of his young boys.  On further inquiry he found it had been given to him as a prize in a well-known school in Ireland.  Its title was perfectly innocuous, but its contents were abominable.  If that sort of thing can happen there is undoubtedly a case for seeing that you have proper safeguards.  One thing that struck me in the House up to the present is, that while men have differed as to details in the implications of the Bill we have had no defender of eroticism.  Fortunately, this House apparently is clear, and I think the vast body of this country is clear, of any respect for those people who rhapsodise about the lambent beauties, the undefined loveliness of the emanation of the moral garbage table.</P>
    <P>We have a member of the Oireachtas who in a letter to some English newspaper said that every educated man in Ireland is against this Bill.  Thank heavens, there are very few people in this country who would defame the name of educated to the extent of being in any way against the central principles of the Bill as it has been defined and accepted in all the speeches in this House.  Deputy Professor Thrift in his speech touched on a point upon which I would be glad that the evidence for the statement which he made should be made absolutely clear, not merely to this House but through the Press, for this is not a question, I think, upon which the safety valve will be shut down, as to the organisation which is behind the dissemination of this literature.  It is an example of what is very common in Ireland.  There is nothing accidental in this evil.  Deputy Thrift has told us that at the Committee they had definite and conclusive evidence that for the purpose of making money, that for the <Col N="696" /> crude purpose of personal advantage and personal profit, this campaign was organised and was being pursued.  The evidence on that point personally I do not question.  The evidence upon that point which was convincing to Deputy Professor Thrift ought to be put to this House in some portion of this debate in some way in which it would become part of the common knowledge of this country, that there are certain people interested for a financial, and perhaps for some worse than a financial, purpose in making profit out of the debasement of the minds of the ordinary people.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I hope I was clear in saying the Committee had distinct evidence that there were many people using that propaganda for the purpose of profit, but I did not intend to convey the impression that those different bodies of people were organised together and doing it in unity for that purpose.  I merely wished to state that there was definite evidence that there were various centres from which for purposes of profit this propaganda was receiving a most extensive circulation throughout the country, but I did not wish to convey the impression that these different centres were specifically organised and guided by one source.</P>

      <P>To the extent of which Deputy Thrift has evidence of what he has now said I want known not merely to this House but outside.  There is an idea that really we are intellectually low down and lacking in courage.  If we want to live on the garbage table it is desirable that people should know the people who are making money, profit and gain, and who organise to make a profit out of a thing of this kind.  I have spoken broadly and generally on this question, for I think it is on broad, general lines we should deal with the evil.  To the Minister and the Government we say that so long as they confine the Bill to doing specifically the one thing of keeping out of this country pornographic literature, to prevent this source of infection being open into which people can casually drop to get filth, to the extent of which they will seek to do that, they will have <Col N="697" /> every possible support in making the Bill as strong and as definite as they can make it, but in the actual terms of the Bill it must be made perfectly clear that that is what they set out to do, and that is what they have accomplished under the terms of the Bill as it shall finally emerge from this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRADY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief remarks with reference to this Bill.  Like everybody else here, I am glad that the Bill generally has been welcomed by all Deputies.  In considering it, I think we should do so mainly from the point of view of doing the greatest good to all the citizens. One Deputy referred to prohibition and its evils, and compared them to those associated with drink.  I do not think that that comparison can stand at all, because we all realise that there are more good books in the world than any of us will ever live to read.  The prohibition which this Bill seeks can better be compared to the prohibition of drinking out of poisoned vessels. We are not seeking to restrict the reading of decent literature in any sense.  The compaign that is carried on at present, as anyone who takes the trouble of reading the evidence before the Commission that has been set up will see, is of a very vile and well-organised character, and, if the evidence which is available in the library is consulted, we will see that a certain form of evil literature is carried on and is spreading throughout the various countries.  Laws are passed in various countries to prohibit or curtail the circulation of this form of literature, and it has been discovered that the law is evaded, because, according to the evidence given at the Commission, this type of journal has legal advisers behind it to help it to round corners and evade the law.  That is one thing we must face, that these people who have been making fortunes out of this kind of literature have found it sufficiently profitable to enable them to employ great lawyers to allow them to carry on their trade and evade the law.  For that reason I think the Minister would be well-advised to make further provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, for instance, that it would be very advisable if he inserted a clause to make it illegal to advertise <Col N="698" /> or write up any banned literature.  I do not know that the Bill provides it. Personally I cannot find it.  For instance, certain decent papers are imported from the other side and they have fallen to this profitable business of advertising certain books.  Only the other day I was reading a weekly journal dealing with poultry-keeping. I have been reading this paper for years, but I discovered that quite recently it has begun to advertise immoral literature.  We certainly do not wish to ban any decent technical book, but I think that once we pass this Bill we should make provision to control the advertisements in the Irish editions of these papers, because I certainly can see the law being evaded, or cheap advertisements being given to books about to be put on the black list by being advertised or written up in these papers.  Then there is also the possibility that a certain paper or periodical will be put on the black list, and, as has happened with political papers that were censored or banned, will appear next week under a new title.  I think that some provision should be made to prevent that happening in this case.  I also notice that throughout the Bill we are dealing with the circulation or importation of books for sale or distribution.  That possibly is a legal phrase, but I think it would be well if the Minister made it illegal to import or, plainly, to keep without licence.  I mean to leave out certain words, such for instance, as &ldquo;to keep&rdquo; and the words which follow &ldquo;for sale or distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister is able to put some legal interpretation on the words which I cannot see.  I can foresee people bringing these books into the country and handing them around from one to another.  As a matter of fact I am convinced from what I have heard that the greatest amount of harm is done in this country by books being so distributed.  People assemble in dance halls and other places and one asks the other whether he has read so-and-so.  Immediately that book is circulated.  If you go to a book-seller possibly he will tell you that that book has not a big circulation, whereas it is handed on from one to another.  As a matter of fact in the evidence given <Col N="699" /> before the Commission by the Gárdai this very point was suggested by them. &ldquo;It should be made an offence to sell or purchase, to lend or to borrow.&rdquo; Personally I think that that would be a very useful thing to insert in the Bill.  I agree with the majority of Deputies who stated that this Bill is not going to restrict the reading of any people who want to read decent authors.  I do not think that any sensible person will believe for one moment that the board to be set up by the Minister will be so foolish as to do that because we all realise, if this Bill is to be a success, that the one way in which we can ensure its success is by having from the very start public opinion behind us.  I sincerely hope that the Bill when it is finally shaped will be of such character as will have public opinion behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point touched on by Deputy Brady on which I would like some enlightenment. I happen to be a member of a Public Library Committee, and I know that quite innocently unsafe books get into that library.  Possibly the same thing happens all over the country, as it is impossible for a Library Committee to ensure that every book coming into the library is all right.  What will be the position of those connected with libraries when this Bill becomes law if any book in the library is reported to the authorities as unsafe?  Some opportunity should be given to Committees of Public Libraries to go through the books and find out what should be deleted from the library catalogues. Readers are not always discriminating. Very often one reader will see in a book great harm, whereas another person will see no harm in it.  Who is to decide?  We can all decide if a book is very bad, but very often people will not always take the same view of what, for instance, a certain paragraph means. With regard to newspapers, I should say that the daily papers do not do harm, but the weekly papers do a lot of harm.  Often they are taken into families and are read aloud by one member.  Unfortunately, sordid details are published by them and circulated broadcast.  They do far more damage <Col N="700" /> than any daily paper.  The point raised by Deputy Brady as to the private circulation of books is very important.  I have heard Catholic girls boasting of the fact that they could get a particular book.  They get such books and lend them to their friends.  These girls have been educated in Catholic schools, yet they take pleasure in circulating such books.  That is a source of great damage and should be seriously watched.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I find myself in entire agreement with the principle underlying the Bill.  I think it is agreed by all Parties in the House that it is absolutely essential for public morality that the imported filth which we see on sale in the streets of our principal cities and towns should be kept out of it.  But there are some inherent weaknesses in the Bill as we have it presented to us.  I am not going into great detail or to examine the Bill clause by clause, but I would like to say, that to me at any rate, the words &ldquo;public morality&rdquo; appear to be rather vague, and would require some further definition than that given in the Bill. If I can be assured, as I hope the Minister will assure me, that there is in this Bill no intention of restricting the liberty of religion or of economic or political teaching and thought, then I would be very much strengthened in my attitude of support for the Bill.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister and the House to Section 6 relating to recognised associations.  In my view&mdash;and I want to emphasise the fact that I am not giving the Labour Party's view, but my own view&mdash;under this section of the Bill it might possibly happen that you would have very keen rivalry between associations, and you might bring into existence a number of groups of persons of the Nosey Parker type.  You may create in this country a number of Nosey Parkers, altogether outside these associations.  That is one of the dangers of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite easy to assume, because we have evidence all round us of religious fanatics, that you will get a number of sects calling themselves by fancy names.  I met so many &ldquo;Christian Associations&rdquo; and &ldquo;One-and-Only Christian Associations&rdquo; in the country <Col N="701" /> that I often think it would be well if we got a censorship of religions in this country, or for that matter in adjoining countries.  I believe that this section may cause a rivalry of a most unhealthy kind between these associations, whose great object in life would be the poking-out of filth, going around with the muck rake, suggesting that everything is not as it should be, and turning up the whites of their eyes even at a ballet dance.  I want to point out that as far as the prohibition of books is concerned a greater advertisement has been given to some of these books in this House than they ever could hope to get by paying through the ordinary channels.  I want to relate a little instance in connection with my own period at school which will point the moral.  I remember studying under a very good and holy man, and I think the Gaelic book for the year was &ldquo;Diarmuid and Grainne.&rdquo;  There were two pages in that book in which some incident in the lives of Diarmuid and Grainne was related.  This good and holy man saw to it that a pin was put in these adjoining pages.  I assure you that I had not the book a quarter of an hour in my hand when I asked permission to leave the room, my curiosity was so great.  I was at great pains to learn every word in these two pages, and I consulted the dictionary for the words I did not understand.  I confess that it was one of those stolen joys which are considered the sweetest. Possibly other people would not like to make such a confession, but if there are teachers in the House&mdash;and I think we have far too many in the House&mdash; they would agree that if they want to direct attention to a particular classic they have only got to tell the class: &ldquo;Now, you must not read that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I very much fear, while I am in thorough agreement with the principle of the Bill, you may go too far with prohibition.  Some Deputy suggested yesterday that there may be created in this country a very profitable industry in boot-legging in books.  There is no question about it, that if we are not careful we may by means of this Bill give a rather cheap and very effective advertisement to a class of literature which I feel sure we would wish to have kept out of the country.  At the <Col N="702" /> same time, as Deputy Byrne mentioned this morning, there are some books in which the prurient-minded might see something that was filthy or unclean which others might not consider so. We all know that the works of Fielding and Smollet are not books which we would put into the hands of a boy of 16 or 18.  At the same time, for the student of history, sociologists and others, these books may have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>They reflect, of course, the manners and customs of the time, which would not conform to our present social conditions. At the same time they are of value to the student of history&mdash;I do not say of inestimable value.  The same is true of some of the French writers, whose works, to the prurient-minded, may be filthy and unclean.  I could name some which would be banned under this Bill, but which are books of high moral character.  In order to preach a sermon, these writers have to touch very largely on the seamy side of life in large centres of population.  If these books are to be banned&mdash;if we are to shut out certain books on sociology, for instance&mdash;I do not think it would be a good thing for the country.  I agree that books which are blatantly of a sexual character should be prohibited, but I should like to have clearly indicated in the Bill the class of books the Minister wishes to exclude.  When the Bill reaches another stage I hope that it will be found that books dealing with political or economic subjects will not come under the ban.</P>
    <P>Let us take a class of literature which might suggest that the present social order is not all that it should be. Assume, for instance, that the sacrament of marriage was dealt with from a physiological or social point of view, say by some dignitary belonging either to the Catholic or Protestant Church, that book would come under the ban. I want to be assured, so far as certain works dealing with economics, philosophy, and sociology are concerned, that they will be free to enter the country.  I want to have that portion of the Bill very clearly defined.  Does the Minister, for instance, propose to exclude books dealing with philosophy and sociology which may advance certain <Col N="703" /> theories which may or may not be acceptable to the majority of the people, and which under the terms of the Bill might be construed by the board of five as subversive of public morality?</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill as a whole is concerned, I support it; but I suggest that the board should consist of nine members, for the very obvious reason that it is possible to get five cranks, as I think Deputy Sir James Craig said, on this board, and by increasing the number it is quite possible that it will be of a more representative character, apart altogether from the Churches.  I am not voicing the view of the Labour Party now, but if I had anything to say to the Bill I would put nine laymen on the board.  Let me illustrate my point.  Many years ago I was present at the initiation of a social welfare league, and a Catholic clergyman was the first to be proposed as a member of the committee.  That clergyman, like the sensible man he was, suggested that it was entirely a question for laymen. I do not suggest that there is much of an analogy, but there is something to be said for his attitude.  He said that he as a clergyman was cut away from the social life of the city, and that the people whom we wanted to serve were people with whom he was not in close daily contact.  In other words, he did not live the life of these people.  He, therefore, suggested that the committee should be composed mainly of laymen. I mention that, not as reflecting the attitude of the Labour Party, but my own attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. CONLON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second <Col N="704" /> Reading of the Bill.  The object of the Bill as set out in the long Title is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An Act to make provision for securing that future members of the legal profession shall possess a competent knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not intended to apply to those who are at present law students or who are over 16 years of age.  It is introduced really to carry out the national policy initiated in the first Dáil and carried on by succeeding Dála.  It is based to some extent on the report of the Gaeltacht Commission and the White Paper issued by the Government in connection with that Commission.  Article 4 of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The national language of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) is the Irish language but the English language shall be equally recognised as the official language.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the Courts of Justice seems to be the reverse of that&mdash;that English is the language used, whereas Irish is practically not tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief reason for the introduction of the Bill is that the legal profession as a whole has not shown very much inclination to give ordinary justice to the status of the Irish language in the courts.  Paragraph 80 of the Gaeltacht Commission Report recommended that the Executive Council should approach the governing bodies of the legal, medical, engineering and other professions with a view to securing that after a reasonable period citizens of the Saorstát would not be admitted to membership of those professions in the Saorstát without an adequate knowledge of Irish. The medical and engineering professions are in a different category to the legal profession, as solicitors and barristers practising in the courts enjoy certain privileges by being allowed to practice in these courts, so that they are practically officers of the courts.  I consider that it is the duty of this House to see that the officers of these courts will fall in with the <Col N="705" /> national policy of the country and secure that in the shortest period possible the Irish language will occupy its proper position.</P>
    <P>It is probable that many Deputies, as well as many people outside, do not realise what the position is with regard to the Irish-speaking districts; the number of people in these districts who speak Irish only, and the peculiar position they are in because they cannot obtain the services of solicitors and counsel who will be able to understand them when giving instructions.  I quote from the Gaeltacht Commission Report, and shall just give one item of the numbers of people in each country who are Irish speaking.  In Donegal there are 52,647; County Mayo, 54,939; Galway, 75,574; Clare, 18,824; Kerry, 43,472; Cork, 39,271; Waterford, 14,522, and some thousands in the counties of Sligo, Roscommon, Limerick, Tipperary and Dublin, and throughout the rest of the country.  I do not know whether any ordinary Deputy can realise what it means for people in those areas who have not a knowledge of English when they cannot get either solicitor or counsel able to understand them.  I know that District Justices with a knowledge of Irish, as far as they could be obtained, having regard to the limitations of the legal profession with regard to Irish, have been appointed in those areas and, therefore, people there have the advantage that those justices are able to understand them in the Irish language.  But owing to the fact that no arrangement has been made by the legal profession to secure that the Irish language should be one of the subjects for examination, even as an optional subject, so far as solicitors are concerned, there is no chance of their being ever able to secure the services to which they are entitled.  I think it should be provided, by statute if necessary, that those people should have legal assistance in cases that they bring before the law courts.  That necessity will be all the better realised if we take the illustration of an English-speaking district, where the people did not know any Irish, and consider what would happen if no solicitor could be engaged except an Irish-speaking solicitor in that English-speaking <Col N="706" /> district who would conduct the case on behalf of people in a language which they did not understand. It is easy to see how unsatisfactory that would be.</P>
    <P>Considering the thousands of people on the Western seaboard who speak Irish only, I think it is the duty of this Assembly to see that those people, who pay their quota of taxation, should be given the same facilities as are provided by the State for people in other parts of the country.  One would imagine that they should receive even greater consideration than the people in the English-speaking districts, from the view point of seeing that they get ordinary justice.  From the point of view of national policy, it is essential that the legal profession should be brought into line with every other institution in the State.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to this Bill, Section 1 merely deals with definition. &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;the Chief Justice&rsquo; means the Chief Justice of Saorstát Eireann, and the expression &lsquo;the Incorporated Law Society&rsquo; means the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland acting under their present or any future charters.&rdquo;  I am not a legal man and do not understand very much about Law.  I am not concerned with the technical and legal sides of this question and I am not concerned with the legal profession as such, from the technical or legal point of view.  I am only concerned to see that people get the service to which they are entitled and that the legal profession as a whole shall render that service.  But it is well that we who have to deal with this subject in this House should first have an idea of what the Incorporated Law Society is.  They have certain powers under the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, and as Section 8 of that Act is referred to later on in the Bill.  I think it well to read that section for the benefit of members who have not heard it before:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Incorporated Law Society are hereby authorised and required to hold at least three times in the year&rdquo;&mdash;I may mention that that phrase &ldquo;three times in the year&rdquo; has been amended by an Act of 1923 to &ldquo;twice in the year&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;commencing <Col N="707" /> with the 1st day of January, 1899, and in every succeeding year a preliminary examination, an intermediate examination and a final examination; and the Society shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the entire management and control of all such examinations and shall have power to make regulations with respect to all or any of the following matters (that is to say), (a) With respect to admission to apprenticeship, the attendance of apprentices at lectures, and other matters connected therewith; and (b) with respect to the subjects for, and the mode of conducting the examination of candidates; and (c) with respect to the times and places of examination, and the notices of examinations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will be seen that the Incorporated Law Society has full control of the solicitors profession and, therefore, it is that a particular section of this Bill deals with that body.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides: &ldquo;This Act shall not apply to any person who is over the age of sixteen years on the first day of January, 1928.&rdquo;  I know that some Deputies will not be satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies will consider that it should be made applicable to those over the age of sixteen.  After all, any person living in this country for a number of years, unless he was living in the clouds, could clearly understand the tendency of the country was to a greater Irishising as a whole.  That was really the national policy.  That being so, for some time back any person going in for a particular line of business or profession could well understand that the Irish language was an essential subject.  As a matter of fact, the educational facilities that have been provided by the State for the people justify that.  At the same time it might possibly be that there would be a hardship on some people.  I know that there are Deputies who consider that the terms of that section are too drastic and that the age should be made even lower.  However, it is based really on the Commission's report, and I am sure that that <Col N="708" /> report has received every consideration from the Government.  The Government issued a White Paper, and I would like to quote a paragraph from it which says: &ldquo;In view of the fact that the use of Irish in the courts is handicapped because few solicitors or barristers are capable of doing their work in Irish, the Government is of opinion that no person who is under sixteen years of age at the date of the issue of this paper should hereafter be admitted as a solicitor or barrister without a competent knowledge of Irish.&rdquo;  Consequently, we put in the age of sixteen years as being in our opinion most suitable and the age that would really satisfy most of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>No person shall be admitted to the degree of barrister-at-law unless before he is so admitted he satisfies the Chief Justice, by such evidence as the Chief Justice shall prescribe, that he possesses a competent knowledge of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I must say I do not understand quite clearly what the position of barristers is and how they are admitted to the Bar.  If any Deputies require knowledge on that subject I am sure there are members of the House who will be able to enlighten them.  I am not concerned with that particular item; my concern is to see that the business of the courts will fall into line with the national policy and that those engaged in the courts will get a knowledge of the Irish language.  I understand the Benchers of King's Inns&mdash;I do not exactly know the term, and perhaps it is the Honourable Society at the King's Inns&mdash;consist of forty-six members, including Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court and certain leading members of the Bar.  So far as I understand, that body has made Irish an optional subject for examinations.  Some members of it appear to realise that there is such a thing as the Irish language.  There may be some criticism of the wording of Section 3, but that can be dealt with at a later stage.  If we get this Bill through it will be a step in the right direction. I think we will succeed as regards the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> Benchers of King's Inns in having a satisfactory test so far as the Irish language is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 4 says:</P>
    <P>(1)  The subjects prescribed by regulations made by the Incorporated Law Society under Section 8 of the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, as amended by the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898 (Amendment) Act, 1923 (No. 10 of 1923), for every examination held by them under the said Section 8 as so amended shall include the Irish language as a compulsory subject, and the Incorporated Law Society may by such regulations prescribe the mode of conducting every such examination in the subject of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every person who becomes a candidate at any examination held by the Incorporated Law Society under Section 8 of the Solicitors (Ireland) Act. 1898, as amended as aforesaid shall be required to pass in the subject of the Irish language as prescribed by regulations made by the said society under the said Section 8 as so amended and as extended by this section and in the manner so prescribed, and no such person shall, unless he so passes in such subject, be qualified to receive the certificate appropriate to such examination given by the said society to candidates who have been successful thereat.</P>
    <P>The reason it is necessary to introduce this Bill at all is because of the fact that no effort was made to bring in the Irish language.  I understand representations have been made to the Incorporated Law Society with a view to getting them to make Irish a subject in their examinations.  Nothing so far has been done, and I think it is now time that arrangements should be made in order to secure that all solicitors in future will understand Irish. If this Bill were passed five years ago we would be in a different position with regard to the courts to-day.  We hope in four or five years we will be in a better position than now as a result of the operations of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Tá go maith.  At the same time, I might mention that I have heard Bills being explained here in which other Acts were mentioned, and I did not know what they meant.  They might have meant very little, but I think it is desirable that where an Act is mentioned the section should be quoted so that Deputies would understand. There are many members of the House connected with the legal profession, but for the benefit of the House generally I think it would be well to quote Section 31 of the Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1898, which is referred to in Section 5:&mdash;&ldquo;A person who has obtained from the Incorporated Law Society a certificate of having passed a final examination may apply to the Lord Chancellor&rdquo;&mdash;of course, it would be the Chief Justice now&mdash;&ldquo;to be admitted as a solicitor, and thereupon the Lord Chancellor, unless cause to the contrary is shown to his satisfaction, shall, by writing under his hand, admit such person to be a solicitor in such manner and form as he may direct.&rdquo;  The section is made quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained that the Bill became necessary owing to the attitude adopted by the legal profession, and I think I have sufficiently explained the subject-matter of the Bill.  I now submit it for the approval of the House. This is not, of course, a party or sectional <Col N="711" /> measure.  I expect it will meet with the approval of all parties.  It is not in any way drastic.  I think Deputies will recognise it is a very reasonable measure, and it is intended to secure the results we have in view without inflicting any great hardship on anybody.  I do not believe anyone will consider it is a hardship owing to the facilities offered in recent times for persons obtaining a knowledge of the Irish language.  I appeal to Deputies to give the Bill their cordial support, and I hope it will be put through the House without very much trouble. Certain Deputies have stated here that they regret very much they cannot speak the Irish language, and that they were not given facilities to learn it when they were young.  People generally say that they are most sympathetic to the Irish language, and are very sorry they cannot speak it. Deputies will realise there is no hardship being inflicted on anybody in this Bill.  I believe that the boys and girls who are now studying Irish will, when they come to more mature age, thank the members of the Dáil for having made such arrangements that they will be able to obtain a competent knowledge of the language which the Deputies themselves regret they are unable to speak.</P>

    <P>The declared policy of the Saorstát is to restore Irish as the national living language of the country.  The time has come to have the implications of that policy in this country determined by a policy of carrying it to its logical conclusion.  Otherwise we would be only stultifying ourselves by giving the attention that we are giving to the Irish in the schools.  The country has already made up its mind that the money spent in teaching Irish in the schools is well-spent money, and that it is impossible to build up in this country a self-reliant, self-respecting and vigorous nation unless behind the bulwark of the national language.  Once you admit that then it follows that it is our duty to the Irish language to have it used in every department of our national life.  Now, we are already doing this in our Civil Service and in the Local Government services and it would be illogical to insist on a knowledge of Irish in these departments and not to insist on having Irish in the courts.  There are few departments of public life that so much enter into the life of the community and concern the life of the community as the Courts of Justice.  If you want proof of this you have only to see how much space the Press gives to the reports of the courts.  It would be absurd to insist on having the Irish language in every other department of public life if the people have to fall back on English every time they enter a law court.  It is a commonplace to say that you cannot have Irish in the courts unless solicitors and barristers know how to speak Irish.  No hardship <Col N="713" /> is imposed by this Bill because the young people coming out of every school in Ireland now have learned Irish.  Besides, the standard of legal education will be gradually raised by insisting on the students having a competent knowledge of the national language.</P>

      <P>I am sure that Deputy Flinn will be happy to hear that on this occasion those dumb-driven cattle to whom he so often refers as being driven by the Government Whips will not be driven on this occasion and when he comes to vote on this question he is bound to find himself in the same lobby with some of these dumb-driven cattle.  Deputy Conlon in his very modest and disarming speech summed up the grounds of my objection to this Bill.  I object to this Bill. I do not want to enter into a general discussion of the question of Irish and its place in the national life.  I accept the policy of the Government on the Irish language.  The question is how are we going to carry it out?  I am not hostile to the Irish language.  I would have pleased a great many of my supporters in the past if I had been hostile to the Irish language.  Twenty years ago I did my best to learn the Irish language, and it is only the other day that I found my old copy of O'Growney.  The language was not then as popular as it is now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Conlon told us that he knew very little about the law.  That is rather a peculiar qualification for bringing in a Bill dealing with the legal profession.  That is one ground of my objection.  There is another objection.  Deputy Conlon referred to the report of the Gaeltacht Commission. The Gaeltacht Commission in their report recommended the Government to approach the governing bodies of the legal profession.  Deputy Conlon is not the Government, and the governing bodies of the legal profession have not been approached by the Government so far as I know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, if there had been any discussion with the governing bodies of the legal profession, at least <Col N="714" /> with the Bar, one fact would have arisen very early in the debate, and that is the fact that there are reciprocal arrangements between the Irish Inns of Court and the Inns of Court in London. Members of either Bar, by complying with certain formalities laid down by the Benchers of that Bar, can be admitted to the other Bar.  No examination is necessary.  This, as I say, is a reciprocal arrangement.  It has been used very much more by members of the Irish Bar who have taken up a practice in England than by members of the English Bar who have come to this country.  The whole arrangement is based on a mutual recognition of the examination, and if we suddenly impose an additional examination it will mean, almost unquestionably, that the English Bar will have an excuse for breaking off an arrangement which is probably resented by some of their own practitioners. Deputies who were in the fourth Dáil will remember the great pains and attention we had to give to the Bill creating the medical register.  The question is a similar one in this case.  It cannot be solved by a Private Deputy's Bill.  It could have been solved by the Government in consultation with those who control the profession.  I know that this is not an absolutely fatal point to the Bill.  I will admit that at once. It could be dealt with by an amendment on the Committee Stage.  But it is a point which should be taken into consideration, and I use it as an illustration of my objection to Deputy Conlon bringing forward the Bill in this fashion.  I am very anxious to find out his reasons.  I gather that one of the reasons given for introducing this Bill was that there are litigants in the Gaeltacht who find it very difficult to get barristers and solicitors to appear for them in court and to whom they can make their instructions plain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Conlon reminds me of the celebrated fable of Mrs. Partington, who took a mop to keep out the Atlantic, except that Deputy Conlon is Mrs. Partington inverted.  To remedy a comparatively small evil he proposes to upset the whole of two large professions. Of course it is possible to get Gaelic-speaking solicitors and barristers <Col N="715" />&mdash;there is one of the latter sitting behind me&mdash;and as demand creates supply there will undoubtedly be barristers and solicitors practising in the Gaeltacht in increasing numbers who can understand their clients when they speak in Irish.  I will go so far as to say that in twenty years' time a man will be very unwise to brief counsel or instruct a solicitor to appear in court for him who has no knowledge of Irish at all, or who at least would be unable to follow the arguments of the opposing barrister or solicitor if they used Irish.  I think that that is bound to come within twenty years' time.  But there are solicitors who never go into courts at all, whose work is of the family type&mdash;office work&mdash;the preparation of trusts, administration of deeds and settlements, the making of wills and the drawing up of marriage settlements. I should say that the majority of Dublin solicitors do not plead in court, though they may go into court to see how counsel instructed by them are carrying on cases.  A considerable number of these firms are what are called family concerns, in which the son succeeds the father.</P>
    <P>Take the position of a solicitor who intends to have his son join him, first as a partner and then as his successor. The son may now be sixteen years of age, but he was not sixteen on the 1st January.  He may be at a school where Irish is not taught.  There is one such school, a school which has sent very many distinguished men to the Bar and to the solicitors' profession.  It is situated, just across the Border, in Northern Ireland.  Deputy Haslett will know it.  They may teach Irish in that school; I do not think they do, and they are certainly not obliged to do so.  It would be a great hardship if such a boy would have to break his school career and have to go to another school where he would be two years older than the other new boys, and where he would have to acquaint himself with a different system of instruction and adjust himself to an entirely new atmosphere. I do not say that there are very many such cases, but that would be a hardship.</P>
    <P>Certainly this Bill is liable to create hardships.  As I have said, Deputy <Col N="716" /> Conlon has disarmed me by confessing that he does not know very much about law.  If this Bill gets its Second Reading, as it probably will, it will, under Standing Order 79, go to a Joint, Special or Select Committee.  It is conceivable that there might be nobody on that committee who is a member of the legal profession or who has any knowledge of law.  Then the Bill would come back to the Dáil practically in its final form, without having been fully considered from the legal point of view at all.  I hope that when the Selection Committee appoint a committee to deal with this Bill it will take that point into consideration and will put on Deputy Little or Deputy Ruttledge, or at any rate somebody who has some knowledge of the procedure of the profession. It seems to me that we might very easily do harm by proceeding too hurriedly in this matter.  It is a matter that will be dealt with sooner or later, but I believe that it can be dealt with by evolution, not by revolution, not by suddenly imposing from outside a special order on two professions that are proud of their traditions and proud of their membership.  It will be done gradually, by an increasing demand for counsel and solicitors who can speak Irish.  My own opinion is that the sole qualification for entering the two professions should be fitness, and that is the only standard that you should take into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly think that I will be creating very great surprise by opposing this Bill.  Undoubtedly in his exceedingly moderate statement Deputy Conlon has somewhat disarmed opposition.  From what I could gather, he bases the necessity for this Bill upon two principal grounds&mdash;the first being the furtherance of what he described as the national policy, and the second the necessity which he seems to think there exists in certain districts for legal practitioners having a knowledge of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the first, I am merely following my own consistent attitude by opposing this Bill.  I have opposed all forms of compulsion in every branch of life in this country with regard to the teaching and the knowledge <Col N="717" /> of Irish.  I have stated over and over again that, in my view, compulsion is not the proper means to secure that this shall be a more Irish-speaking country than it is to-day.  I am not going to enter into that now.  But to come to the particular reason for the introduction of this measure, namely, the necessity for having legal practitioners with a competent knowledge of Irish in certain districts, I assure Deputy Conlon that there is no profession in the world, from my knowledge of it, where, if there is a demand for something, there shall not be a supply forthcoming than in the legal profession.  If there is a demand for Irish-speaking lawyers there will be Irish-speaking lawyers.  When it is a question of compulsion let us consider whether, if Section 4 passes, and a boy about to engage upon his legal studies passes an examination in Irish, does Deputy Conlon seriously mean us to think that that young gentleman, when he has just been called to the Bar, or admitted as a solicitor, will have a sufficiently fluent knowledge of Irish to be able to converse in that language with his clients or to conduct his case in that tongue?  I do not think so for a moment.  He would have to go much further; he would have to take up Irish seriously, and he would have to make himself conversant with it to a much greater extent than by merely passing a qualifying examination.  If not, what is the position?  Is that examination to be so stiff and so severe that nobody is to be allowed to pass unless he is able to converse freely in the Irish language? I hardly think that that is the proposal put forward in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the differentiation that has been sought to be made between members of the legal profession and others in this respect, I very much venture to differ with Deputy Conlon in that regard.  He said that lawyers were more or less officials of the courts, and he went so far as to say, in winding up his speech, that this principle of compulsion should be applied to the legal profession in that the legal profession should be brought into line with every other institution in the State. Now, I suggest that he is beginning at the wrong end.  Why not start with <Col N="718" /> the first institution of the State?  Why should we be allowed to be elected to the Dáil without a knowledge of Irish? Why should we not have to pass an examination in Irish?  Why should that compulsion be applied to people who are supposed to be semi-officials of the courts, and not applied to those who are the spokesmen and the representatives of the nation in the national assembly?  I think that Deputy Conlon has not gone half far enough in this Bill.  I think he should have introduced a Bill proposing that in every walk of life Irish should be compulsory, and especially that it should be compulsory in the Dáil.  He said he did not propose to make the principle applicable to engineers or doctors, and I presume not to architects either, or even to family grocers in the country. All these people come into far more direct contact with the people than do barristers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Rate collectors, as my friend says, and auctioneers who, every day of their lives, as well as doctors and others, come into direct contact with the people.  If it is necessary to have Irish compulsory to benefit the litigants in Irish-speaking districts, surely it is far more necessary to have Irish compulsory for medical practitioners, because I think it is certainly more important that medical practitioners should know what their patients are saying than even that counsel should know what clients are saying to them.  Therefore, I think, not only on principle, but in detail, this Bill should not be allowed to pass.  If I might say so, it is an inconsistent measure.  It was introduced for one specific object, dealing with one particular profession, to carry out a general policy.  I believe if that is the settled policy of the mover of this Bill, if he believes that Irish should be made compulsory in every walk of life, why not come forward with a thoroughly business-like, all-round comprehensive, consistent measure, and not introduce a mere miserable little nibbling proposal at one particular profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> In regard to the profession itself, personally I am not aware that either of the governing bodies, the Bar Council on the one hand, or the Incorporated Law Society on the other hand, have been consulted in this matter, and I think in that regard that Deputy Conlon has been found wanting. If he had consulted the Bar Council or the Honorable Society of Benchers, he would have discovered that Irish is now an optional subject. It is not a compulsory one, but any student who desires to be called to the Bar or admitted to the solicitors' profession, may take Irish as one of his subjects.  Deputies can take it from me that if young gentlemen going forward to practise at law in this country know, as Deputy Conlon seems to know, that there is a demand for Irish-speaking lawyers, they will take Irish as one of their optional subjects, and there will not be any necessity for compulsion at all.  I was not altogether pleased with what the Deputy said about the attitude of the legal profession. I really think that was hardly fair.  I do not think the legal profession as a whole has been hostile to the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think even the governing bodies are, and in legal parlance I would be inclined to call for proofs of that statement. Though they may not be in favour of compulsion, I think at the same time they have never displayed any undue hostility to the language itself.  There is another aspect too; if there are so few Irish speaking lawyers, whether solicitors or barristers, and if there is such a demand for them, I think Deputy Conlon is behaving very unfairly towards those men, because there must be a premium upon their services, and they must be sought after everywhere. If they are so much in demand, and if there are so few of them available, surely to goodness they must be having the time of their lives. I would suggest that for those the proposals in this Bill certanly create a hardship.  The Deputy also says that <Col N="720" /> there is no hardship in his compulsory proposals.  I am not going to enter into that question now, because my attitude is, or should be, pretty well known on the question of compulsion. I think there might not be much hardship. I do not ground my opposition at all on the question of hardship.  I ground it on the question of compulsion entirely, in the light of my view that compulsion will not only not render Irish more the language of the country, but it has actually, and is at the present time, making Irish and the study of it more obnoxious to the people.  Deputy Conlon certainly has introduced the measure in an exceedingly able, clear, and moderate way, and I have no objection to any member introducing a Private Bill in this House.  I welcome every attempt on the part of a Deputy to do what he considers right in the nature of Private Members' legislation, but I think this Bill, certainly in view of the speech we have listened to from the mover, and also in view of the provisions it contains, is inconsistent and unnecessary, and a Bill that would not meet with the approval of the general public.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give my personal support to the Bill which has been introduced by Deputy Conlon.  If this matter had not been dealt with by Private Deputies' Bill, and it had been left to the Government to take some <Col N="721" /> action on the White Paper which was prepared in connection with the report of the Gaeltacht Commission, it is quite probable that we would have proceeded differently.  Most likely the line of action of the Government would have been to approach the Benchers of the King's Inns and the Council of the Incorporated Law Society, and to point out to them the constitutional position of Irish and the needs of the Gaeltacht. The Government's declaration of policy on the Gaeltacht's Commission report indicated that they should do something to secure that future entrants to the legal profession should have a knowledge of Irish, and if the two bodies had promised to hold examinations, and to require a reasonable standard of Irish in the future, probably the Government would have simply given publicity to those promises and have remained satisfied with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, however, that it is any harm to have the matter put on a legislative basis, or that it is any harm to have, in addition to any promises that the governing bodies of the two branches of the legal profession might be willing to give under pressure, a statute dealing with the matter.  On the other hand, there is no ground for criticising Deputy Conlon for introducing the Bill simply because the two governing bodies of the profession had not been approached and consulted. After all, those two bodies are in a position to know what the national policy about the Irish language is. They know that the main political parties of the country have been in favour of the preservation and revival of the Irish language.  They know that a big political party at one of its functions, long before the rise of the Sinn Fein movement, passed a resolution in favour of compulsory Irish in the National University.  They know what has been done in recent years, and they have taken no action on that knowledge. The Benchers, I believe, have recently made Irish an optional subject at the preliminary examination. That, perhaps, is a little advance, but to my mind, except as an indication and a recognition that the times have changed, it is of no practical value. The council of the Incorporated Law <Col N="722" /> Society, on the other hand, as far as I know, have done nothing.  They have not changed their position about Irish in recent years, and they have declined to move with the times.  I think I am right in saying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they have made Irish an optional subject for entrants, but the society has made no change.  The other body was perhaps further back in that respect, and it has come on a trifle, but the Incorporated Law Society has made no change.  I think it has been suggested to both bodies that they should make a change.  To the best of my knowledge it was reported in the newspapers that at a meeting of the Benchers the question of making Irish compulsory was discussed and divided on, and that the proposal was defeated.  So that if these bodies have not been approached by the Government in recent years, at any rate they knew what the movement in the country was, and I think it was up to them, without any approach being made to them, to make some advance. For that reason I think that nobody can rightly criticise Deputy Conlon's action in introducing this Bill and attempting to force the hands of these bodies.  I think also that this is a matter that may be properly dealt with by people who have not any intimate knowledge of law or of the working of the legal profession.  This Bill does not deal with the technical side of the matter at all.  It simply deals with one aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the professional curriculum.  It is a matter on which any lay person can quite as well offer an opinion as a person who has technical training or knowledge.  I would be inclined myself, at any rate, to put the need for action designed to produce the results that this Bill is designed to produce, on a wider ground than Deputy Conlon has based it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> He referred to the people of the Gaeltacht who might have no knowledge of English, and he said that they ought to be able to consult members of the legal profession in their own language.  But I think we really must go further than that, and we must look forward to the time when anybody who chooses to use Irish will be able to have his legal business done through Irish.  As a matter of fact, the Irish language was pushed to its present position by consistent and long-continued pressure on the part of the British Government, and some of the results of that pressure are still continuing.  One of them is that the Irish language could not be used where the people would be willing to use it, because professional men and others are unable to use it.  I have seen in the Irish-speaking districts doctors who had no knowledge of Irish and who were occasionally obliged to bring in the dispensary porter to interpret for some people who came to consult them.  That means in these particular places, as regards the clients of the doctor, the old pressure for killing the Irish language was still being continued. Steps have been already taken, so far as the medical profession in the Irish-speaking districts is concerned, to see that only doctors with a knowledge of Irish are appointed.</P>
    <P>As to the courts, I think it is essential there should be solicitors and barristers in all parts of the country as soon as possible able to do the work of people through Irish who want it to be done through Irish.  Some Deputy asked what the standard should be.  I think perhaps it would be necessary to start with a somewhat lower standard than would be insisted on a little later on. We have to recognise the difficulties of the position and, to some extent, the difficulties of individuals.  In the Committee Stage of the Bill it may be possible to put in something that would define more accurately the standard of competence required than anything in the Bill at present.  That does not really affect the principle of the Bill. It is a matter of detail.  There are, perhaps, other matters of detail that would require consideration and some <Col N="724" /> amendment in Committee.  One of the Dublin newspapers, while accepting the Bill, commented on the case of foreign students who might come here simply for the purposes of study.  If it is desired, I have no doubt that some amendment could be introduced into the Bill that would meet their case.  So far as the question of reciprocity is concerned, I think there is very little real point in that.  I do not think there is going to be an interchange of barristers in future.  I think under the new conditions that people who have practised five years&mdash;that, I believe, is the period &mdash;at the Irish Bar are not so likely to desire to go to the English Bar, and consequently even if the provisions for reciprocity that exist were lost I think it would be no great matter.</P>
    <P>In any case, in taking the steps that are necessary to preserve the Irish language and to prevent the conditions which operate against the preservation of the Irish language continuing, we cannot be held up for the sake of the convenience, and it is only a question of convenience, of a few individuals.  It may be that the age of sixteen is too low or too high.  The Government in preparing the White Paper on the Gaeltacht report thought it was a reasonable age, and that no hardship that would fall on any person, who last year was only sixteen years of age and who did not know Irish, should deter us from taking action.  He would be obliged to acquire it before he could become a barrister or solicitor.  I think that, while the matter might have been dealt with differently, Deputy Conlon proposes to deal with it upon lines that are quite reasonable and quite proper, and which will probably settle the matter most satisfactorily, and with less possibility of question and difficulty afterwards than would be the case in other methods that might be adopted.</P>

Tabharfhaidh an Bille adhbhar machtnaimh d'adhbhar dligheadóirí agus don aos dlí, agus is maith an rud san.  Nuair a bhí Bille os ár gcomhair roinnt mí ó shoin do <Col N="725" /> chuireas leasú isteach.  Do ghlac an tAire Dlí agus Cirt leis agus thug sé seort geallamhainte go mbeadh Bille eile os ar gcomhair&mdash;Bille níos leithne a chuirfeadh an Ghaedhilg ar agaidh níos fearr.  Níl fhios agam an bhfuil an Bille réidh ag an Aire idtaobh ainmniú na mBreitheamh no cathain a bheidh sé.  Sílim go bhfuil an Bille seo ró-bhog agus ró-chumhang.  Deirtear in san mBille nach mbainnean sé le duine atá níos mó ná 16 bliana d'aois. Cé'n fá?  Nach bhfuil Gaedhilg riochtanach in sna bun-scoileanna agus ins na meadhon-scoileanna le sé bliana anuas.  Ba mhaith liom fhios d'fháil cá raibh na daoine seo, ná fuil Gaedhilg acu, ar scoil?  Do réir mo thuairime, ní bheadh sé as an slí 18 mbliana do chur isteach.</P>

Mar adubhairt an t-Aire Airgid agus an Teachta O Conalláin, <Col N="726" /> tá furmhór na ndaoine i bhfabhar an Ghaedhilg do bheith riachtanach ach tá daoine áirithe ann adeireas nach é seo an dóigh an Ghaedhilg do chur chun cinn.

Ní mar sin a thuigimíd an sgéal&mdash;ar aon taobh&mdash;annseo.  Ní éagcóir é ar aoinne san tír seo iachall do chur air an Ghaedhilg d'fhoghluim. Is beag an t-ualach an t-eolas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that I propose to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill, which I consider is a very modest measure indeed.  Deputy Cooper, when speaking on the measure, said that we should proceed by evolution, and not by revolution. I do not know if anyone could call this measure revolutionary.  It applies to anyone who was sixteen years of age on the 1st January, 1928, but it will not apply to anyone who was over sixteen at that date.  It means that persons will not, at the end of five or six or seven years, be admitted to the legal profession unless they have a knowledge of Irish.  I have heard no substantial argument against the measure.  No one said that it would be a hardship if it comes into operation, and I do not think anybody could say that.  If they were to hold that view, they ought to consider what has happened in the case of another body of public officials in the country&mdash;namely, teachers.  When the Free State came into being, there were many teachers in the country who had not a competent knowledge of the language, but they were compelled by regulations to acquire that knowledge within a certain number of years, and we had the spectacle of a number of men and women, some of them up to the age of forty and fifty, going to classes and to courses to acquire the necessary knowledge of Irish.  We have not heard any complaints from them on that score.  Compared with the demand made on that body of officials, the demand made here is an exceedingly modest one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the mover and the seconder of the Bill that between now and the Committee Stage&mdash;I am assuming that it will get a Second Reading &mdash;they might consider whether the age mentioned in the Bill might not be fourteen years.  That possibly will <Col N="728" /> make it a more modest Bill, but it is not from that point of view that I raise the point.  It is a purely technical point, and I raise it because at that age children will be changing from the primary to the secondary school. If the figure were eighteen years of age, I would not be so much inclined to raise the point.  However, it is at the age of fourteen that the break from one school to another occurs.  I do not wish to press that point unduly, of course.  I had not an opportunity of looking at the Bill until to-day, but I suggest to the mover and seconder that some consideration might be given to that point between now and the Committee Stage.  I think it is a Bill which is necessary if we are serious in the matter of making Irish the national language and the spoken language of the country, because it is essential, in the courts especially, which are so much in touch with the ordinary lives of the people, that those who speak the language should not be under any disability in the matter of having the choice of a lawyer who will represent their interests when they are engaged in litigation of any kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle underlying the Bill is one of compulsion.  I have explained to the House on a previous occasion that I am against that principle.  I opposed it when it was applied to education.  I hold that any of us should be free to select whatever subjects we consider most suitable for the careers we are going to follow.  I hold that view very strongly.  We have taken one step further, and a Bill has been introduced by a private member with, I take it, the approval and support of the Government, to carry this question of compulsion a stage further, and, without any interview or intimation of any kind, it is now proposed to apply the principle to two very important professions in the Saorstát.  Apart from the question of compulsion, I question the wisdom of attempting to make changes in two important professions without any consultation with those professions.  I think that that is a very unwise principle for this House or for any Government to adopt.  Let me alter the circumstances slightly to show the force of that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> If a Private Bill were introduced which would make it compulsory on all apprentices to have a knowledge of Irish before they enter trades, I can imagine the way the Labour Deputies, headed by the Deputy from Cork, would protest against such interference on the part of the State with their trades, and I would support them. Now we have exactly the same principle applied to two professions.  It is a distinction without a difference.  I think we are approaching this question in the wrong way in applying that principle without any previous consultation of any kind with the professions concerned. That, to my mind, sets up a principle which this House ought to be slow to follow.  Deputy Conlon, in introducing this Bill, stated that residents in the Irish-speaking areas had difficulty in finding lawyers and others with whom they could consult freely in any legal matters with which they had to deal.  I move a good deal through various parts of the Saorstát, and I have not heard any serious grievances of that kind.  There have been occasionally isolated cases here and there, and, as Deputy Redmond pointed out, if there is a demand for that particular type of lawyer, as soon as it becomes known to the profession the supply will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalBuckley" hpid="Mr. BUCKLEY Mr. BUCKLEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BUCKLEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The demand has been there all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy points out that the demand has been there all the time.  I am not sure that more is not being made of this Irish-speaking problem than is justified.  I have had the privilege of carrying out work and employing men in all parts of the Saorstát and I can quite candidly say that I have not yet met a man who was not able to understand the English language and the English coinage. Doubtless there are cases in some more remote places in the State where the inhabitants are very largely bi-lingual, but I think there are extremely few cases where English is not spoken and clearly understood.  It, therefore, appears to me that the stress laid on this particular recommendation is much more than the circumstances justify.  There is another aspect of the question to which I would like briefly <Col N="730" /> to refer and that is the hardship that this Bill casts on a number of young people.  It is common knowledge in this House that those two professions are very largely recruited from what are known as the middle classes.  As many of us can recall, families well known in the State have sent their sons for many generations into one or other branch of those professions.  It is also well known that most of these young people to-day are educated in schools outside the Saorstát&mdash;some of them immediately across the Border, some of them further north, and some of them across-Channel.  That has been the custom in those families for generations.</P>
      <P>You lay down in this Bill a regulation which states that those under sixteen years of age on the 1st January last shall have a knowledge of Irish of a certain standard if they are to follow the profession which their forefathers followed for generations.  These young people have no knowledge of Irish, and any of us would be inclined to say that at the age of sixteen the average education of young people is fairly well completed.  This Bill makes it compulsory on them, if they are to follow the profession of their forefathers, to start at that particular age and acquire a knowledge of Irish.  That to my mind is a distinct hardship.  At least five years' notice should be given of a change of that character so that any young people who are going to follow those professions would have an opportunity of learning Irish at a time when it can be more easily acquired than at the age of 16.  It is a hardship on those approaching 16 years of age, and to my mind the principle is one to which we should not agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of this Bill and to say that so far as I am personally concerned&mdash;and I feel sure I can speak for every member of the Labour Party on this matter&mdash;I would be prepared to give to the Irish language movement every support possible consistent with the needs of the people.  We know that the ordinary people of the country, and particularly public representatives, have a certain diffidence in dealing with this question of Irish. This Bill might easily be made a peg upon which to hang a discussion as to the whole educational position, particularly in regard to the teaching of Irish and its effect upon the education of the youth of the country.  I have <Col N="732" /> said that there is a diffience, and that diffidence, or perhaps it would be better to say lack of moral courage, on the part of many of our people, and our public representatives particularly, arises from two causes.  It is not considered by some to be politic to say what they think for fear of arousing the antagonism of certain interests, clerical or lay.  For that reason it would be a very useful contribution to this discussion if we were to examine the whole situation apart from the position of law students.  However, I have to confine myself to the Bill.  I want to suggest that the language cannot be considered as a thing apart from any other subject of the curriculum. While subscribing to the view that everything should be done to encourage the study of the Irish language and make it the spoken language of the country, I hold certain views, particularly in connection with the learned professions.  All educationalists know that some people are more adaptable than others to certain trades or professions.  It is within our own knowledge that there are many men to-day serving, perhaps, behind a drapery counter who would make excellent carpenters or joiners, and many men who are carpenters and joiners who would make excellent salesmen and who may be a failure at their trade.  So it is also with the learned professions.  To enter these professions one must have a certain adaptability so far as languages are concerned.  I do not believe any educationalist will deny that.  There are certain people who have a bent in the direction of languages.  A wonderful mathematician may be an absolute failure in the learning of languages, and a person who can learn languages very easily may be an absolute failure as a mathematician.  I think that will be generally accepted.  I have in mind the case of a young man whom the educational authorities considered would make an excellent medical man, but who, because of his want of adaptability to learn the Irish language&mdash;to acquire the low standard required by the entrance examination to the university&mdash;was unable to qualify.  It may be said that he must have a very <Col N="733" /> low standard of intelligence to be unable to pass that simple examination in Irish, but the fact remains that he has no adaptability as far as languages are concerned.  I have it on excellent authority that he had all the attributes that would go to make an excellent medical man.</P>
      <P>I want to point out the position to-day of the Irish language in relation to the home life of the ordinary parent. Let us be quite frank and honest with ourselves and have no window-dressing. We might say that is not politic, but let us at least face up to the facts of the situation.  Here is what takes place in most of the homes, particularly in the cities and towns.  A boy or a girl is at school in one of our educational institutions.  I think it will be admitted by national and secondary teachers, university professors and others, that co-operation in the home is really the greatest asset the teacher has.  So far as the education of children is concerned, to what extent is that co-operation present to-day?  I say deliberately to a very limited extent indeed.  A boy or a girl comes home from school with a text-book in Irish.  I have seen algebra taught through the medium of Irish, and that algebra is brought to the home.  The educated parent who has not a knowledge of Irish has no possible chance of helping that child.  I am speaking now of at least 95 per cent. of the population of the cities.  A boy or a girl comes home with an exercise written in Irish. Where is the parent who can point out the errors in that exercise?  Some dozen years ago a parent could go over the home lessons of a child and correct them.  To-day the parent cannot do that.  So far as the co-operation of the parent with the teacher is concerned, that phase of the educational life of our country has gone west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I am prepared to do everything that will tend to make Irish the spoken language of the country.  In the meantime I do not want to inflict any hardship, particularly on men or women who may have an aptitude for the legal or medical professions and be hindered in their career or turned away from such a career altogether. It has been suggested that if this were made a test for entry into any of the <Col N="734" /> trades or crafts the Labour Party would object.  The Labour Party would not object if we had not too many young men in a hurry who want to ram the whole programme down our throats at once.  I want to suggest seriously to Deputy Good, or anyone else who has any misgivings as to the attitude of the Labour Party, that we are &ldquo;all out&rdquo; to get the language established, but we want to have it done not in a hurry, but in the way that the country can best assimilate it, namely, by a slow process.</P>

      <P>So far as the sons and daughters of the working classes are concerned, my experience is that they are suffering very seriously as a result of the present system.  But I know that the revival of the Irish language will go on, and while we are certainly inflicting a very severe handicap on the present generation of children, I know that even if you stop the progress of the Irish language now, in ten or twenty years' time it will come on again and you will be inflicting a further sacrifice on another generation of Irishmen and women.  I want to be quite frank and do not want to be misunderstood. I have not been in any way ambiguous in what I have said. I believe in my heart and soul that the present generation of children have been sacrificed educationally.  There are matters upon which I should like to hear Deputies make themselves vocal in this regard.  The school-going population of this country can never hope to be absorbed into employment here unless there is a radical change in our whole economic outlook and system.</P>

      <P>It was made relevant by the interruptions.  So far as the legal profession is concerned, I find very few sympathise with the lawyers, but while one might be prepared to inflict upon these budding lawyers the greatest amount of hardship, I want to say that, from what I have already intimated as my opinion, it is possible that by insisting upon a standard of Irish for our lawyers&mdash;barristers, solicitors and others&mdash;we may be closing the door against people who might possibly emulate Edmund Burke and other great men.  I think I have made it clear that certain people have an aptitude for languages that other people have not.  We may lose to the profession of the law, as to the profession of medicine, men who would otherwise render good and distinguished service to the country.  What I have said is not in any way antagonistic to the learning or acquiring of the Irish language and to using what pressure we can without making it compulsory.  Give a reward, for instance, to the budding lawyer who has, in addition to his other qualifications, a sound knowledge of Irish, but I would not like to see it made compulsory. I am absolutely against compulsion. That is my position.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill. Dealing with the matter of compulsion in education, my own experience has <Col N="737" /> been that all education is compulsory. All the education I ever got I got it because I had to get it.  I think that is true of the average boy.  Generally speaking, he takes the subjects he has to take having regard to the profession he is going for.  When it came to the time for me to study law I found it was not possible to fit in Irish and to study my legal subjects.  At the same time if Irish had been compulsory it would have facilitated me in learning Irish properly.  Once it was made compulsory it would mean that the system would adapt itself both to that in such a way that proper grinds would be given and the language would be properly taught, and it would not have been a hardship to me to take up that subject rather than some other subject I was compelled to take up.</P>
      <P>Really, I have not much sympathy with those who say it is a hardship on children of a certain age to be directed to take up one subject rather than another. As for the matter of compulsion, perhaps Deputy Good is one of the people who should not talk about compulsion, because he himself has tried in the past to impose compulsion in the matter of the price of bricks, when he had a monopoly in that commodity, and he even went further when he tried to use compulsion upon me, in an irate mood one day, to prevent me referring to the subject again in this House.  He is the last man in the world who should come here complaining about compulsion when he himself is such an artist in selective compulsion. One of the speakers seemed to be put about as to whether solicitors and barristers are officers of the court.  Of course they are.  It is a very sound argument.  The mover of the Bill thought all officers under the State are persons who are more or less under the same standard, and that it is inconsistent to oblige officials to have a knowledge of Irish and at the same time to allow others who are, technically speaking, officers of the State, to escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great hope that this measure will lead to something even better than it purports; I mean that young men will be forced in the beginning to learn Irish, and that may have the effect of attracting them to Irish.  I do not care <Col N="738" /> how Imperialistic they are.  They have all underneath their skins somewhere or other a feeling for Ireland; they have all an attraction towards Ireland.  They have chosen Ireland to live in, and because they are human beings they have developed a subconscious Irishness in them which they are hardly themselves aware of.  When they are children the gate is open to them to learn the Irish language, and in a certain percentage of cases where you have developed of a more highly-developed human sympathy, with higher ideals and natural instincts, they may be very well attracted into studying Irish properly and following it from a cultural point of view.  At present the Irish language is in an outcast position, economically and culturally, and until the educated classes have been somehow intrigued into learning it properly, I am afraid it is going to remain in that position.  If you get the professional and educated classes enthusiastic about Irish there will spring up a cultural and modern Irish which at present, except in a few shining exceptions, is absent.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government did not approach the Incorporated Law Society.  I admit frankly that the prospect of getting satisfaction from them is not very great.  But as a matter of form and as an act of courtesy, and as a means of strengthening the hands of those who would afterwards be applying to us after the attempt was made and failed, it would be better if that had been done.  But taking things as they are, the moving forward is so slow that anything is better than nothing.  Of course, I think there is less to be said for the Benchers than for the Incorporated Law Society.  It is, perhaps, because I belong to the one trade union and not to the other that I say that.  But the Benchers were approached, and certain high officials in this country did their best to push the Irish language and they failed hopelessly. I know that.  So far as the Incorporated Law Society is concerned, I cherish the hope that they may voluntarily do a great deal more than is implied in this Bill.  I have seen deeds which were drafted in Irish, and I know of certain attempts that were made by individual members of the <Col N="739" /> profession to push the Irish language. The effect of that was at that time simply to make people angry, and it became more or less impossible to progress with any degree of effectiveness upon those lines.  One argument stated here was that solicitors who practised mostly in their offices would not require to have a knowledge of Irish.  But according as the Irish language becomes used in the legal profession more deeds will be drafted in Irish. After all, there is no reason in the conveyance of house property and other matters why the deeds should not be in Irish.  As that progresses, it will be necessary for solicitors to have sufficient knowledge to be able to get at the root of the matter that is in the deed.  I hope when this Bill is passed that the Incorporated Law Society and the Benchers will adapt themselves to the new situation, and that instead of trying to act against the spread of the Irish language they will go further than this Bill; that they will give scholarships to those who have a better knowledge of Irish in legal matters.</P>
    <P>Legal jargon is an unbroken ground, and so are the terms to be used in deeds.  This is being done at present in the Acts of the Oireachtas, but in all other legal matters there is yet to be produced a phraseology suitable to modern conditions.  And that will have to be done.  It would be a great deal better if we could get the real assistance of the profession than to be up against a hostile and reactionary feeling which would simply create a conflict and make the matter more difficult to carry out.  As far as those who will be put to a certain inconvenience owing to the fact that they <Col N="740" /> have been educated in English schools or in Northern schools are concerned, I think the answer is that first of all there is no reason why Irish boys or girls should be educated in English schools.  God knows there are plenty of educational establishments of every shade of religion that are quite competent to educate the Irish people for Irish life.  If we can persuade the Northern schools, by passing this little measure, to teach Irish in their schools so much the better.</P>

      <P>An argument was put forward here by a Deputy that it would be a hardship upon Irish barristers who wanted to practice at the English Bar if this Bill were passed.  I wonder how much longer are we going to continue that particular form of extravagance and spend money on educating our best brains for the purposes of export.</P>
