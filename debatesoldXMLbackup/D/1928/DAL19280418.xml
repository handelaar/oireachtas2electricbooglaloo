      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works received a petition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect of the drainage of the Griese River, and have had the proposal investigated by an engineer and a land valuer on their behalf. As a result of consideration of these officers' reports, the Commissioners decided to submit the facts of the case to the Minister for Finance and the Kildare County Council with a view to obtaining free grants towards the cost of the works.  The Minister for Finance has agreed to give the necessary free grant, and the matter is being submitted to the Kildare County Council.  If they also agree to give a grant, the Commissioners will prepare a detailed drainage scheme and submit it to the votes of the occupiers.</P>

It is at present being considered by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, whose observations I have asked for.  I expect to be in a position to introduce this Bill at an early date.  A Bill dealing with the age of consent is in an advanced stage of preparation, and as soon as certain aspects of this question which cause some difficulty have been finally considered I shall be in a position to bring forward proposals for legislation. The third matter referred to by the Deputy, namely, legitimation, is also under consideration, and I hope to introduce a Bill dealing with it in due course.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether it has been decided to give preference in future to leaving certificate and pupil teacher candidates for entrance to training colleges, even though they were not placed so highly on the list of successful candidates as others competing at the entrance examination; if so, whether the position of candidates who have been preparing for scholarship and entrance examinations for the past three or four years has been considered in the light of that decision; and whether, in view of the shortness of the notice, he will consider allowing all candidates to compete on equal terms for at least another year.</P>

      <P>It has not been decided to give preference in future to leaving certificate candidates.  It has been decided to give preference to candidates from preparatory colleges and to pupil-teachers both of which classes are specially trained for entrance to the <Col N="10" /> training colleges.  In both cases the candidates must have passed the leaving certificate examination as a condition of their entrance to the training colleges.  The entrance examinations for the training colleges are held for the purpose of assigning candidates to the vacancies that still remain in these colleges after the successful candidates from the preparatory colleges and the pupil-teacher centres have been assigned.  The pupil-teachers and preparatory college pupils, therefore, do not compete at the entrance examinations and the case could not arise in which they would be placed lower on the list of successful candidates at such examinations.</P>
      <P>Full consideration has been given to the position of candidates who were preparing for the entrance examination prior to the introduction of the new scheme.  In view of the need of getting the best trained candidates into the training colleges it is not considered desirable to make any change in the existing arrangements.</P>

      <P>I understand that the colliery proprietor referred to is willing to erect a ropeway for carrying coal to the siding of the Arigna Colliery railway, but no question of a ropeway for towing boats has arisen.  The effective use of an improved Lough Allen canal would need a ropeway to carry coal from the collieries to Lough Allen, but it is unlikely that the traffic which at present could be expected to use the canal could bear the cost either of improvements to the canal or of the ropeway. The canal is part of the Shannon Navigation which the Commissioners of Public Works are bound to maintain as a navigable river.  Its effective navigation depth is 3 feet 6 inches, permitting the passage of cargoes of about 30 tons.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the development of the Lough Allen Canal have been under consideration for some time.  There is, however, little prospect that the traffic which from present information could be expected to use the canal would be sufficient to remunerate the substantial expenditure that the necessary works would involve, and the matter has accordingly been deferred pending information as to whether a scheme propounded for the development of the Arigna area <Col N="12" /> and relying mainly on railway transport was to be carried out.  Radical changes were made last year in the scheme originally outlined, but in neither shape has it reached what could be described as the practical stage, and no new traffic can, therefore, be relied on.  The Committee of officials that visited the district in 1926 duly submitted a report which, for the reason that it contains information supplied to the Committee in confidence, I am not in a position to publish.  If the Deputy so desires, I will consider whether it is possible to supply him with a summary of the report, giving its main conclusions and the reasons for them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that, partly in consequence of the increase in the cost of institutional treatment as a result of post-war conditions, and partly due to serious evasions of the compulsory provisions of the Act by healthy persons, the Sanatorium Benefit Fund under the National Health Insurance Act is insufficient to provide for all insured tuberculosis applicants the benefit and treatment considered necessary for them by the medical adviser to their insurance committee; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to ensure that insured tuberculosis persons <Col N="20" /> shall receive the treatment medically advised in their cases, for the provision of which they have paid their contributions.</P>

      <P>In the case of certain insurance committees the funds provided under Section 16 (2) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1911, have been found, in fact, to be insufficient to provide sanatorium treatment for all the persons making application therefor.  Section 16 (3) of the Act provides that an insured person shall become entitled to sanatorium benefit only if the insurance committee recommends the case for such benefit. The number of persons so recommended will vary according to the extent of the funds available by each insurance committee.  The matter generally is under consideration in conjunction with the recommendation contained in the Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Health Insurance and Medical Services.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil approves of the &lsquo;Rules of the Circuit Court&rsquo; made by the Minister for Justice on the 16th day of March, 1928, under Section 66 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924); and that it is expedient that the said rules shall come into operation on the 1st day of August, 1928.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a motion that the Rules of the Circuit Court which have been drafted by the Rule-Making Committee should receive Parliamentary sanction, as without the sanction of the Dáil and the Seanad these Rules do not come into operation.  The volume containing the Rules is a very bulky volume indeed, and I would venture to suggest to the House that in order that public time may be saved as far as possible in the discussion we should not formally discuss these Rules to-day, but that we should postpone discussion of them for about a fortnight.  It would facilitate matters very much, I think, if any Deputy who found fault with any Rule would kindly communicate with me and let me know the Rule with which he found fault and the defect which he found in it.  As I say, this is a very bulky volume, and it contains a great number of Rules.  Although I have gone through the Rules pretty well, I think that I cannot yet claim that I have got a complete mastery of every one of them and of every one of the details in connection with them.</P>
    <P>I therefore venture to ask any Deputy to give me notice of any Rule which he thinks might be amended. We are all interested in the Circuit Court Rules and in having them as good as possible, and it is entirely a non-controversial matter from the Party point of view.  The House is aware that I have no power to make Rules of my own, nor has the House any power to make them.  Rules are made by a Rule-Making Committee.  They are the only body who have the power, and these Rules do not become operative <Col N="32" /> until they have been approved of by both Houses.  Therefore the power of the House really consists in vetoing, not in constructing new Rules.  I need hardly say, however, that I am strongly of the opinion that if the House expressed its view that a Rule should be amended the Rule-Making Committee will take that matter naturally very much into consideration.  I should say that the Rule-Making Committee have given the most unsparing attention to the production of these Rules. I do not claim they are perfect.  I do not think that any rules of this nature of a new kind can be perfect.  Defects in any rules, no matter how skilfully drafted, will inevitably show when they have been in actual operation, but I would venture to think that the Rule-Making Committee have done their work, not only painstakingly, but most successfully.</P>

      <P>We on these Benches are satisfied with the suggestion made by the Minister as to postponing these for a fortnight and that amendments might be put in in the meantime.  I take it that he means that if we disagree with any Rule or if Deputies consider that any Rules should be amended, amendments to these can be put before the Dáil.  If we are to take it that this Rule-Making Committee has absolute power to make Rules and that we have no power of amendment except to veto them, it leaves us in a very peculiar, if not unfortunate, position. A great many of the Rules, as far as I can see, deal with matters of practice, and could be more or less agreed to, but there are others which in their present form entail, some of us think, unwarranted expense and also considerable delay which previous procedure did not entail.  There is also disappointment that the Minister, notwithstanding the experience that he has had, and the general dissatisfacation throughout the country with the system obtaining of having appeals from the Circuit Courts on stenographers' notes, is still apparently adhering to that practice.  As the Minister is aware, representations have been made to him on several occasions as to the dissatisfaction <Col N="33" /> that exists with regard to that procedure, but, notwithstanding that, he has not seen fit to incorporate any change in the Rules now before the House.</P>

      <P>If I might say so, the error in the argument is that the Circuit Court has been operating really under the County Court Rules up to the present, and the County Court Rules were not satisfactory <Col N="34" /> for a court that has no connection with the County Court.</P>

      <P>I understand the position of the House in this matter is this: the House has no power to amend these Rules; they must be accepted or they must be rejected.  I understood from the Minister that if any member of the House wished to make a suggestion as to a change or alteration in the Rules as they are at the present moment he would be prepared to receive such suggestions in the next fortnight and submit them to the Rule-Making Authorities for consideration.</P>

      <P>Is that only merely on the construction of the Rules, or will the House have any say as to the amendment of a particular Rule, unless they oppose all the Rules?  I gather that is what the Minister said. I think something similar was said when the District Court Rules were introduced. I am not clear about that, but I understand the House was told that they should accept the Rules, and that they were taken in globo, and that the House could not criticise a particular Rule.  The Rules were passed through the Dáil and sent to the Senate.  They were returned from the Senate to the Dáil on the ground that the Senate would not be allowed to alter certain Rules, and these came back to the Dáil for amendment.  Could not the same procedure be adopted now? Where Rules are defective or calculated to cause hardship, could not these Rules come before the House for consideration?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that it is by Statute the Rules are made.  The Rule-Making Authority was created by Statute. I think it is better that the Rules should be made by a Rule-Making Authority rather than by the House. How on earth could the House draft and consider and debate each one of these Rules?  If they did so they would have time for nothing else.  The old Rules, of course, were always made by the Rule-Making Authority, whether they be the Rules of the County Court or the High Court, without any discussion in the House of Parliament.</P>

      <P>That is the position now.  The position is that a Statute passed by the Oireachtas created the Rule-Making Authority, <Col N="36" /> and merely leaves to the two Houses the power to approve or to fail to approve of the Rules when made.  If a particular Rule does not meet with the approval of the House, the situation is exactly what Deputy Ruttledge said in his last statement, namely, that the Rules may go back to the Rule-Making Authority, through the Minister, and they may be altered and new Rules would then be put up for approval. But the House is not in a position either to approve of a certain number of Rules only, or to amend the Rules. The word amendment has been used. It is really a matter of suggestion.  The actual amendment of the Rules can only be effected by the Rule-Making Authority.  Therefore, amendments to the Rules cannot be sent into the Clerk in the same way as amendments to Bills.  That is the situation.</P>

      <P>My attention was being drawn to the section of the Act which governs the Rules of Court and the relation of the two Houses to these Rules when the Deputy was previously putting his question.  The Section, I think, is 101:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No Rules of Court made under this Act shall come into operation unless and until they have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and have been approved by resolution of each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Rules must be approved in globo, taken together and approved in the terms of the motion on the Order Paper.  If the Deputy considers that the Rules should be gone through one by one and a motion of approval for each Rule proposed, he is under a misapprehension with regard to the procedure. It is suggested that if one Rule is disapproved of the whole must be disapproved.  No decision of the House would change a particular Rule.  The suggestion is that if in the discussion of the Rules one Rule or a number of Rules are disapproved of by the House, the Minister may make the suggestion to refer them back to the Rule-Making Authority.  The House, of course, has power to reject the Rules simply because it objects to one or more, but it rejects the whole, not a part.</P>

      <P>Does it not amount in practice to the fact that by rejecting the Rules we can amend them?  We can then keep rejecting and sending them back until they are altered by the Rule-Making Authority to a form of which the House will approve.  That would seem to me to be using a steam hammer in cracking a nut; that the House, instead of inserting its own amendment, is put in the rather invidious position of rejecting the whole in order to criticise a part.  That seems to me to be the position: that if we object to any Rule we must reject that Rule and then reject the whole of them. Then they would come up again for approval and, so far as I can see, if there was a majority that disliked ten Rules it would be in a position to send them back time and again, and the only safeguard they have is the fact that there is a majority prepared to carry out any instructions given in relation to the matter.  I think the position is quite clear and that we have power to alter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-section of the Bill to which I have tabled an amendment relates to the licensing of petrol pumps which do not qualify for a certificate under the Bill.  I take it that the purpose of the sub-section is to ensure that there will be in the shortest possible time a uniform instrument for the sale of petrol throughout the country, and the infliction of the least amount of hardship on the traders concerned. In other words, it is sought to arrive at a balance between the interests of motorists who use the petrol on the one hand, and on the other the traders who sell the petrol.  In considering this we have to take into consideration, as the Minister said on the Second Reading of the Bill, that 18,000,000 gallons of petrol were sold in this country last year, the greater proportion of which, I think, was sold through the medium of instruments known as petrol pumps, of which there are 1,392 in the country.  Of the 1,392, 825 without alteration were eligible for a certificate under the Bill, and that 523 of the remainder, even with alterations, could not be brought under the Bill, in so far as they would not be eligible for a certificate.  In the case of these 523 pumps the principle of their construction is such that the Minister under the Bill could not give them a certificate to the effect that they were proper measuring instruments for the sale of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that if these pumps are inaccurate, as they are, the inaccuracy is bound to be in favour of the trader, and not in favour of the motorist.  If the inaccuracy is the other way round the trader is going to get rid of his pump as quickly as possible, because he is losing on it.  If he finds that he is gaining, as he is gaining, it is the motorists who buy petrol will be the losers.  The suggestion in the Bill is to provide that these inaccurate pumps will be licensed for the sale of petrol for a period.  The question of hardship comes in when the length of the period during which the licence will operate is taken into consideration. As I said, it should be the object of the Dáil to strike a balance between the good of the community, which would undoubtedly be served by having standard instruments of measure throughout <Col N="42" /> the country, and a certificate from the Department of Industry and Commerce as to accuracy, and the desire not to inflict hardship on traders who bought pumps at a time when they were considered quite in order and suitable for trade in this country.  The suggestion contained in my amendment is that the licences to be granted to these inaccurate pumps should not be for a period longer than two years. There are 523 pumps according to the Minister in this category.  A number of these were sold to traders by oil companies, whose oil is sold in the pumps, on the instalment system, the instalments being so arranged that they were in fact little more than rent.  The oil companies would still be anxious to facilitate the sale of their oil after the Bill comes into operation, and would be fairly certain to take care that pumps, if condemned, would be replaced so as to ensure that there would be no reduction in the amount of their oil sold. There are traders who bought these pumps outright and own them, and it is with them we should concern ourselves to ensure that they would not be put to any undue loss.  We must keep in mind the fact that the pumps are inaccurate, that a man who pays for a gallon of petrol from these pumps is not getting a gallon, and that the trader is making a profit which he is not entitled to make.  At the same time we do not want to close down the traders' pump completely and put him to the loss of the price he paid for it.</P>
    <P>We suggest that a two years' period should be the maximum for the good of the community that should be given for seeing that proper measures are being used, and the interests of the trader can be balanced on that basis, that within two years after the passing of this Bill, which will be within two and a half years after the most recent of these pumps has been bought, they should either be shut down altogether or completely rebuilt in such a manner as to bring them within the terms of the Bill and to entitle them to get certificates.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated on the Committee Stage that he would give us information on the Report Stage regarding the number of pumps concerned and the different types.  The normal life of a <Col N="43" /> pump is undoubtedly longer than two years, and there are different classes of these pumps in operation, some of which might be near enough to accuracy to make the alterations required very small.  These are undoubtedly the pumps that would be altered as soon as the Bill comes into operation, and they can get certificates.  I ask the Dáil to bear this in mind, that it is pumps that cannot be altered to make them sufficiently accurate to come under the Bill that it is proposed to licence, and it is these inaccurate pumps that we suggest should not be allowed to be used for the sale of petrol for a longer period than two years.  I would be glad, however, to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter, particularly as to the number of types of pumps concerned, so that I could see the idea behind the amendment that he proposes, that the maximum period should be such as, either generally or specifically, might be prescribed by him by regulation.  It is for the Dáil to say whether there should not be an overriding period.  We think that in the case of pumps that are hopelessly inaccurate and that undoubtedly defraud the consumer every time he buys petrol, the period should be less than two years.  We have no objection if the Minister wants to reduce it, but we think that two years should be the longest period for which these inaccurate pumps should be allowed to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two remarks of Deputy Lemass that I take exception to right away. The aim of this particular clause is not to ensure a uniform type of measuring instrument; it is to ensure that amongst the different patterns it will be certain that there will be no inaccuracy, that is to say, that there will be a protection to the public as against false measure. The Deputy has also spoken of inaccurate pumps, and he said that the inaccuracy will always be against the consumer.  But it is not the intention of my Department to license any inaccurate pump.  If a pump is found to be inaccurate no licence will be granted. But what has to be considered is the protection of the public and allowing <Col N="44" /> the public to see, by the particular type of machine used, what measure is supposed to be given.  The main point that really arises in regard to most of these measuring instruments is: Is it visible? Is it possible for the buyer to see the amount he is getting?  Is there anything visible to him from which he can get evidence with regard to the amount given to him?  If pumps are found to be definitely inaccurate no licence will be given.  There are certain pumps of a particular pattern and they cannot come up to the very strict requirements that are necessary for gaining a certificate. Outside that, but certainly still within the limits of accuracy, although not within the limit of visibility of amount given to the public, we wish to be allowed to certify.  As to the overriding period, if there is to be an overriding period&mdash;and I object to it on consideration&mdash;the period would have to be somewhere about nine or ten years. It certainly should not be less than eight years, I think, when one remembers that in this you are making provision for a maximum period and providing for all pumps.  I suggest to the Deputy that it is in fact true that what is in my amendment gives better protection than any overriding maximum, because the suggestion here is that there should be regulation, but the suggestion in my amendment is that the regulations should state specifically for a particular class, or even for units within a class, a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be open to the Deputy hereafter, once the regulations are made, to get the regulations, to see what are the particular pumps that are given, say, some period outside the period of two years that he suggests, and by method of Parliamentary Question, from time to time to find out what changes are being made with regard to these, what are the regulations enforced in the way of accuracy, in the way of visibility to the consumer and so on, and there is a much readier way of getting at the individual pump than by this overriding maximum.  If one takes an overriding maximum it must be one that seems fair to the pump most recently brought into use or to the one that has the longest commercial life. That would undoubtedly let in a very big number of pumps which should not <Col N="45" /> be given that lifetime, and I think it is better to have a regulation, applied either to a class or to units within that particular class, because we have found that on an attempt to make an examination such as I promised, it was really impossible to get these things considered until the individual pumps come up for examination.  It has been quite impossible to get any enumeration of the classes that I endeavoured to find.  We found that even within a class itself it is quite possible to make variations, depending on the life of the instrument and certain other considerations. I suggest that the two years' period would be quite unfair as a maximum period.  If there is to be a maximum period I would suggest something in the region of eight years, and I personally think that an eight years period would be far too long for a big number of these instruments.  I therefore suggest to the Deputy that if he and the House accept my amendment there would then be room, if any Deputy gets complaints as to a particular type of measuring instrument, to have the matter raised here on the regulations enforced by my Department by way of a question, a discussion on the adjournment, or by a motion.  Certainly, when the regulations are issued and when the individuals within a class to which the regulations are applicable are made clear, there will be a better basis for discussion, a better opportunity to bring in an amendment for a change, and the amendment for the change, could then be put down in the regulations if the regulations are objected to. I have to confess that I have not been able to get the enumeration I promised by reason of the difficulty we experienced when the matter came to be considered, because we found that it was not suitable to divide merely into the classes of pumps, that variations were possible in the individual pumps in a class, and we hope we will not have to prescribe a particular period for a class of pump.  There will be regulations in so far as it is reasonably possible, limiting even individual units in a class.</P>

Will it be the same in relation to a pump, or will it be that during the intervening period the owner of a pump will be free from responsibility?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the penalties are exactly the same for any type of measuring instrument.  I understand the procedure with regard to, say, an ordinary weighing machine, which is used for weighing out any matter sold by weight is that if on inspection it is found to be deficient there is the possibility of a prosecution for having used a deficient weight for some period before that.</P>
      <P>Presumably the law being the same, the penalty would be the same in regard to these particular measures, but I cannot answer that point absolutely clearly at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point the Minister spoke of was this: That it was <Col N="47" /> not so much a question of the accuracy of the machine as of the provision of means by which the consumer of goods could know that he was getting what he was paying for.  There are certain types of machines by which one knows, the fact that one visibly sees the petrol. What I mean is, the petrol is pushed into a transparent vessel and runs up to a level mark.  What I want to know from the Minister is if he is confining himself to that kind of visibility or whether he intends to avail of any other method of indicator which would show that the petrol has travelled through a definite cylindrical length. I want to know if that would be sufficient for him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not confining yourself to what one might call the physical visibility of the pump?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously not. What I said was this, that in the ordinary measuring instrument what is looked to is not merely that the amount is delivered which is the amount that is to be sold, but that it is clear to the purchaser that such is the case.  In the ordinary way, that is shown by the visibility of the container, which rises to a certain point.  There may be other methods, but the real defect with regard to most of these 500 pumps is that they have nothing at all which shows to the consumer what he is getting. That is the main defect in the 523 pumps&mdash;that there is nothing visible. When one comes to consider some other method of measurement, such as running the liquid through a tube of a particular size, I am not at all sure that that method can be regarded as giving a security to the purchaser of seeing what he gets, unless it be that there is a cut off so that he sees it filled and emptied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examination showed that the difficulty with regard to most of these pumps is that a very great number of them can be manipulated, and that, while pretending to give a certain amount of liquid, they can be manipulated to give less than that amount.  We have <Col N="48" /> to set out against that.  Of course, if we found one that was clearly inaccurate in the amount that it gave, I think what would be done there is, it would be wiped off the books altogether.  The great difficulty, however, is to get after the particular type of instrument which, while pretending to give a particular amount, can be manipulated so as not to give that amount at each discharge.  I think, as Deputy Lemass has explained, that there is sufficient protection in the method that I have indicated.  When regulations are made one can see the applicability of different types, and there can be questions and answers going on here with regard to other classes or units about which people have had complaints, or in regard to which suspicions arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two points raised on the Committee Stage that I would like to deal with.  One question related to the fact that a particular section of this Bill was an amendment of a section of an earlier Act, and that it had been re-enacted in the amended form.  I have considered that point, and have found the difficulty in connection with it to be this: The section which it is proposed to amend is Section 2 of the Act of 1878.  So far as this Bill amends a section of the Act of 1878 it is quite simple to do that.  It only means copying the old wording and cutting out certain portions of it.  But the difficulty in regard to this particular section is this: that that section in the Act of 1878 had been earlier amended by an intermediate Act, and if we are going to read into this Bill the further amendments made to that section, then we would have to re-enact and put into <Col N="49" /> this Bill the various sections amended by the intermediate Act.  What would happen, therefore, is this, that there would have to be such a system of cross references not only to the amendment made in that particular section of the Act of 1878, but to other sections of that Act, that it would not be by any means a simple matter.  In any event that is not a desirable form of legislation. It has been put to me that it is much simpler to deal with the matter as I propose here than to make all the provisions that would be entailed by the other method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point made was on the question of charges made for adjustment of weights and measures and of weighing machines.  There has been consideration given to the possibility of including in the Bill provisions in regard to charges.  Again, it is difficult&mdash; I alluded to it on the Committee Stage &mdash;it is almost impossible to think of the variety of adjustments and repairs that would have to be done, and it is impossible to think out here and now the charges that would be legitimate under the varying circumstances in different parts of the country.  This Bill for the first time gives the power to make certain statutory regulations for the guidance of inspectors.  We propose to include in these regulations certain points which we hope will remedy the grievances that have been complained of, and to make it quite clear to traders that they are not bound to accept anybody recommended to them by the inspector.  The position will be this, that they can get the work done for themselves and have the repairs tested afterwards by the inspector.  If Deputies who get complaints from people in their areas with regard to these matters would let me know what is alleged I can have the matter looked into.  I say that because it may be that in certain areas there are certain people taking advantage of the ignorance of traders and others with regard to what is entailed on them by the law in regard to repairs.  If Deputies get such complaints in their various areas I would be glad to have them from them, because then I can get the areas from which the complaints come better investigated, and the traders in these areas properly and definitely instructed <Col N="50" /> with regard to what is required of them.  I am not moving any amendment with regard to these two points.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if there is any chance the Minister would have the Act applied to the collection of this year's rates.  Only a few days of the financial year have passed. The situation in a great many towns is getting worse every year so far as the collection of rates is concerned.  A huge amount of arrears is being carried forward year by year, and for that reason I ask for a consideration as to the advisability of making the Act applicable, if possible, to the collection of this year's rates.  Possibly there may be legal difficulties in the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises a rather serious problem.  I was doubtful when the Bill was going through as to whether it was going to throw a serious liability on the owners of houses.  From what the Deputy has said there is no doubt that that liability is going to accrue as a result of this measure.  That being so, I would like a little consideration given to that particular aspect of the measure, because anything <Col N="51" /> that is going to throw a further liability on the owners of houses is going to postpone the getting of houses, that is to say, people are not going to invest money in houses if they are going to incur liabilities greater than they have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The further liability that the Deputy was anxious to transfer from the tenant to the landlord under this Bill.  It is proposed that the liability for rates should be put on the owner of the property and not on the tenant, as it is at the moment.  The Deputy has pointed out to us, as one who has a good deal of experience in this matter, that at present there is a very considerable difficulty on the part of the local authorities in collecting the rates from tenants.  Under this Bill it means that if the local authority cannot get the rates off the tenant the landlord will have a very poor chance of getting them.  The result will be that the landlord will be saddled with this additional liability, and consequently people will be very slow to invest money in houses with a liability of that character accruing.  That was an aspect of the question I was doubtful about, and I am very glad the Deputy has intervened to show us the seriousness of the situation.  I suggest that while this measure may be of advantage in the county boroughs and in the urban areas, it is very doubtful as to whether it is going to be of any advantage in the rural areas.  The Minister, I suggest, should apply this measure to the county boroughs and urban areas before he extends it to the rural areas. He has a similar privilege with regard to the valuation of houses, that is to say, there is a provision in that case that while all houses under £8 valuation come within the jurisdiction of the Act, the Minister has power to extend the valuation to £12.  I think there ought to be a similar provision in this case, and for that reason I suggest the Minister should limit the application of this measure and give it a trial before he extends it generally in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>I must confess I am rather at a loss to understand the attitude taken up by Deputy Good at this stage of the Bill.  I am not suggesting that the landlord should take any further liabilities in so far as the collection of rates is concerned.  Deputy Good ought to know that a certain position prevails in practically every town to-day.  I explained, on the Second Reading of the Bill, that up to a certain period the landlords were collecting the rates on behalf of the local authorities. They were included in the rents and were handed over to the local authorities, but some time after the advent of the Rent Restrictions Act they ceased to pay rates at all, although they were collecting a great proportion of the rates in the rents.  That has contributed to a state of absolute chaos in the various towns.  We are not asking the landlords to pay the rates on behalf of the tenants.  Those of us who have encouraged the Minister to bring in this Bill consider that the landlord should have power to collect the full rate and include it in the rent.  That is all that is being asked for.  I think Deputy Good has taken up a wrong attitude in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Corish, it was quite clear even a couple of months ago that it was not practicable to have this Bill applied to the rates for the current year.  The various landlords will have a certain amount of adjustment to do in determining the amount of rates to be paid in respect of each particular small holding they have to deal with, so that even if the Bill had been actually passed into law by the 1st March last I would hesitate in the interests of the success of the Act to throw suddenly on to the landlords the amount of work that would follow in that respect.  The Bill has not yet passed through the Seanad.  It must be clear to the House that it would be impossible to apply the Bill to this year.  The problem the Bill proposes to solve is of such importance that it is very desirable it should get a clear start, so that anybody who has to perform any function in connection with the matter, whether local authorities or owners of houses, will have plenty of time to make preparations and so avoid confusion in the matter. Deputy Good was replied to by Deputy Goulding.  I do not think any heavy obligations are going to fall on the owners in connection with this Bill.  It would be wrong at any rate to magnify them without clearly showing what the circumstances were.  It has not been shown in the discussion on the Bill that the work that will be thrown on owners will be very great.  Deputy Good suggested that the Bill would not be of any great service in rural areas, but I think that the rural occupier is as familiar to the general run of Deputies in the House as any other class in the country.  It has been suggested that there is a difficulty in regard to rural occupiers.  I feel as regards any difficulties so far as rural occupiers are concerned, I would be put up against those by the more rural Deputies if there were any serious difficulties.</P>

      <P>Deputies will observe that the Estimate for the Land Commission for the year 1928-1929 shows a net increase of £49,499 as compared with the Estimate for 1927-1928.  The items of increase are under sub-heads H, I, K, amounting to £81,200 in all.  The sub-heads showing decreases are A, B, F, and J, amounting to £22,599.  I propose <Col N="55" /> to go through the sub-heads separately and to explain the objects and meanings of each, and to indicate the reasons for increases or decreases, as the case may be.  Sub-head A is for salaries, wages and allowances, and this sub-head amounts to £243,901, showing a decrease of £10,599 as compared with last year.  The reduction in the amount of the salaries, wages and allowances is due principally to the fall in the cost-of-living bonus, together with a very slight reduction in the staff.  The salaries are shown in the Estimate, and I do not think it is necessary, at this stage, to discuss them, as Deputies can see these figures for themselves.  The basic salary, of course, is given in each case. The total amount of the bonus is given at the end of the Estimates.  Sub-head B&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash;shows a decrease of £1,000 as compared with last year.  The reduction is mainly due to a modification in the cost of travelling and the rates of subsistence allowance. These travelling expenses are incurred chiefly by inspectors and members of the Survey staff.  There are about 159 members of the Land Commission staff travelling the country, either on inspectorial or survey duties.  The scales of travelling and subsistence allowances are fixed by the Minister for Finance, and these are the scales paid to the officials of the Land Commission staff who travel throughout the country. Sub-head C is for incidental expenses. That is a very small item and really refers to the inspectors, chain-men, advertisements, uniforms, and so on. Sub-head D is for the Office of Public Trustee, and the sum of £773 is for additional expenses for the Office of the Public Trustee.  The present Public Trustee was appointed in pursuance of Section 52 of the Land Act of 1923, and, in addition to performing the duties of Public Trustee, he is acting as Assistant Examiner of Title as well. He is only entitled to act as trustee where all or part of the trust fund emanates from sales of land under the Land Purchase Acts.  There are, approximately, three hundred trust accounts, and there are a very large number of investments standing in the name of the Public Trustee.  The dividends from these investments are received, <Col N="56" /> disbursed and distributed by the Public Trustee.  The capital value of the investments under his control amounted approximately to £1,100,000. In addition to acting as Public Trustee and Examiner of Title, he is also responsible for the administration of the Land Act of 1927 so far as it relates to Land Bank and Committee cases. Under Sub-head E&mdash;Solicitors' Department, Salaries and Allowances&mdash;there is a decrease of £537.  The staff is given in the Estimate.</P>
      <P>The reduction there is also mainly due to the fall in the cost of living bonus.  Sub-head F&mdash;Solicitors' Department, incidental expenses:&mdash;The Estimate in this case is for £5,000 showing a reduction of £1,000 as compared with last year.  This includes the costs incurred by the Solicitor to the Land Commission in proceedings taken by him in the Circuit and District Courts in Dublin for the recovery of moneys through defaulting annuitants in respect of land situated in Dublin as well as against defaulters who reside in the County Dublin in respect of lands elsewhere in the Saorstát.  The Land Commission solicitor performs the functions ordinarily performed by the State solicitors elsewhere.  He is paid a salary, and the expenses given in the Courts and the other receipts are paid into the Land Commission accounts and are taken as Appropriations-in-Aid.  The Appropriations-in-Aid under this head amount to £3,000, so that reduces the actual expenses under sub-head &ldquo;F&rdquo; to £2,000.</P>

    <P>Sub-head G is for contributions towards the charge for excess stock. This sub-head provides for a contribution made by the Saorstát Government under the Ultimate Financial Settlement for charges for excess stock under the Acts of 1903 and 1909.  This contribution has been fixed under the Ultimate Financial Settlement and it amounts to £134,500.  Sub-head II is for payment under Section 11 (7) of the Land Act of 1923 and shows an increase of £2,000.  This sub-head provides for the payment of interest and sinking fund on land bonds issued in respect of contributions by the State to the standard price in the case of sales under the Land Acts of 1923 and 1927.  The reason for the increase this year is that under the Land Act of 1927 which gave <Col N="57" /> the Land Commission the power to add compounded arrears of rent to the purchase money, vesting arrangements are proceeding much more quickly now and consequently the issue of land bonds has been greatly accelerated.  That explains the increase in this item this year. Sub-head I, Improvement of Estates, shows an increase of £49,200.  That increase is inevitable when Deputies remember that we are acquiring and distributing lands now much more rapidly than we were able to do it hitherto. Last year for instance we distributed 60,000 acres of land acquired under the 1923 Land Act alone.  That is quite apart from the land acquired by the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners.  We divided 60,000 acres last year, whereas in the previous year we divided only 35,000 acres.  That shows clearly and proves clearly that it is necessary to spend considerably more money on improvement works when the division of the land is proceeding more rapidly than when the division proceeds at a moderate pace. We hope to accelerate the pace at which land is to be distributed and consequently to spend more money on improvement works this year.  This money is utilised for the division of untenanted land, and new holdings, for enlarging existing holdings and equipping them with fences, drains, roads and other necessary improvements such as building out-offices.  Out of this item there are also paid certain instalments to the Board of Works by way of repayment of loans advanced to the Congested Districts Board.  This item also has to bear the cost of Health and Unemployment Insurance of employees engaged in improvement work.</P>
    <P>There is no amount set down under this particular head this year for the general purposes schemes in congested districts, but as the item appears perhaps it would be well to explain briefly why it was included there last year.  It was originally introduced in the Land Commission Vote to enable the Land Commission to meet the commitments of the late Congested Districts Board in respect of contributions which it offered towards schemes of public utility undertaken by local authorities and other bodies throughout the country.  The expenditure in <Col N="58" /> connection with these schemes has now been terminated, the work either having been completed or not having been proceeded with.  Last year there was still a small expenditure incurred for the upkeep of certain nurses' cottages erected or purchased by the Board for the accommodation of Lady Dudley nurses.  There are a number of the cottages throughout the Free State, and it was customary for the Congested Districts Board to make a slight contribution each year for their upkeep. For the future this money will be paid out of the Improvement Vote, and consequently this sub-head will disappear from the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J deals with advances to meet deficiency of income from untenanted land purchased under the Land Act, 1923.  Deputies will remember that a few weeks ago we had a very lengthy discussion in the Dáil on the Supplementary Estimate introduced for the purpose of making good the deficiency in income derived from untenanted land.  I explained very clearly or that occasion the object of the Vote, and I do not think it is necessary to repeat it now.  We estimate that next year there will be a deficiency of £25,000.  The Supplementary Estimate was for a deficiency of £35,000, but that was spread over a period of a few years.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K refers to payments under Sections 42 and 46, Land Act, 1927. The money under this sub-head is required for the purpose of Committee cases.  It is to pay the interest on the capital advances arising out of the re-sale of land under these two sections. In the Committee cases the payments will probably amount to £5,700.  In the case of the Land Bank estates the arrears alone amount to £15,000, and the annual charge will be about £7,600. The item of £30,000 includes £15,000 for arrears.  That amount will disappear out of the Estimate for next year, but there will be a sum of at least £15,000 included in the Estimate year after year as a perpetual charge for making good the deficiency in acquiring land either got by the Land Bank or otherwise during the years 1920, 1921 and 1922.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L deals with telegrams and telephones.  There is no change in last <Col N="59" /> year's estimate.  The amount remains the same, and I think it is normal considering the enormous amount of work the Land Commission have to do, and the huge number of calls that have to be answered every day.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M. refers to deficiencies on realisation by Government Departments of land bonds.  The amount is £2,500, exactly the same amount as is included in last year's Estimate.  This sub-head is introduced for the purpose of making good deficiencies caused by the redemption of Government charges, by the transfer of land bonds at their face value.  In the case of the redemption of the Board of Works loans, the bonds received by the Board of Works have only their market value. The present sub-head provides for the difference between the face value and the amount actually realised by the bonds.  That amounts to £2,500.  The loss on unoccupied holdings comes to £100.  That is dealt with in Sub-head N.  This sub-head is for the purpose of making good any loss which may arise where, owing to default in the payment of land annuities, the Land Commission have to take over a holding and incur expenses which are not realised on the eventual sale of the holding.</P>
    <P>In Sub-head O&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;the total amounts to £98,940.  I think the items in the sub-head more or less explain themselves and I do not know that it is necessary at this stage to enter into any detailed explanation of the items.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Supplementary Estimates some few weeks ago I dealt very fully with the problems of land distribution.  I gave statistics on that occasion showing the rate at which we were acquiring and distributing land to-day and showing at the same time the nature of the problem that confronted us.  I do not propose to repeat those figures on this occasion, but I have prepared a summarised statement showing the work the Land Commission has actually accomplished under the Land Purchase Acts since the transfer of the Land Commission to the Free State Government on the 1st April, 1923.  At that particular period there were a number of pending sales relating <Col N="60" /> to estates acquired under the 1903 and 1909 Land Acts.  By pending sales I mean sales in connection with which purchase agreements actually had been signed but the vesting arrangements remained incomplete subsequent to the transfer of the Land Commission to the Free State Government. As regards the completion of pending proceedings in the direct sales between landlord and tenant under the 1903 and 1909 Land Acts, purchase moneys amounting to over £3,500,000 have been advanced for the purchase of 431,000 acres, comprised in 14,250 holdings vested in purchasing tenants.  In addition, purchase moneys amounting to £230,000 have been advanced for the purchase of 44 estates comprising 46,000 acres which have been vested in the Land Commission to be re-sold eventually to the tenants.  That is so far as pending proceedings were concerned and those are all proceedings relating to the 1903 and 1909 Land Acts.</P>
    <P>As regards the re-sale of estates previously purchased by the Estates Commissioners or the C.D.B., an area of 508,000 acres has been vested in 15,000 purchasers on re-sale for a total re-sale price of over £3,000,000.  The area of untenanted land on estates which have been divided since the Land Commission was transferred to the Free State Government is 125,000 acres.  That briefly represents the activities of the Land Commission since its transfer in connection with proceedings under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909.  With regard to the Land Act of 1923, including National Land Bank, Committee lands and resumed holdings, 220,000 acres of untenanted land have been acquired for a price of £2,605,000.  Of this area 140,000 acres have been divided and the allottees placed in possession. The division of the remaining 80,000 acres is being proceeded with as rapidly as possible.  In addition 180,000 acres of untenanted lands are in process of purchase by the Land Commission under the 1923 Land Act and inquiries are being made as to the suitability for purchase of a further area of some 700,000 acres under that Act.</P>
    <P>Of the tenanted land coming under <Col N="61" /> the Land Act of 1923 135,000 acres have been vested in the Land Commission in respect of, approximately, 3,000 holdings, representing a total purchase price of £1,400,000.  Further, an area of 480,000 acres in respect of, approximately, 13,500 holdings representing a purchase price of £4,070,000 has been provisionally gazetted.  That in a nutshell represents the activities of the Land Commission since the 1st April, 1923, under the Land Acts of 1903, 1909 and 1923.  Under the recent Land Act of 1927 (Section 2) the Land Commission have now been given power to add to the purchase money of a holding any uncollectable amount of arrears of rent.  This enables the Land Commission to fix the appointed day without waiting for payment in cash of the unpaid balance of compounded arrears. It has greatly expedited the work of vesting the tenanted land.  In the last six months, as an indication of the progress that has been made, partly in consequence of the passing of this Act and partly in consequence of certain arrangements that have been made in the Land Commission with the object of speeding up the work of vesting tenanted land, 1,880 holdings have been vested comprising 18,000 acres as against 191 holdings representing 80,000 acres in the previous six months.  That, I think, is a fairly good illustration of the extent to which we have speeded up the work of vesting tenanted land.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1927 removed many anomalies and difficulties contained in the Act of 1923 but the operations of that Act are certainly going to throw a considerable amount of work on the Land Commission.  Already under Section 11, which is the section relating to fee farm grants, a huge number of applications have been received from owners of land in different parts of the country.  These applications will have to be considered eventually by the Commissioners and decided upon in a judicial way.  In addition to that, some thousands of applications have been received under Section 16 which is the section relating to sub-tenancies, as sub-tenants can now be declared in the same way as tenants under the Act of 1923.  As I say a huge number of applications have been received and these tenants, as tenants <Col N="62" /> coming under Section 11, will have to be dealt with by the Commissioners in the usual judicial way.  We are likely to experience in the coming year a considerable increase of work consequent on the operations of that Act.  I think I have dealt with all the points that are likely to arise in a discussion on the Estimates and I do not propose to say anything more at this stage.  As I have said, the Land Commission administration was discussed very fully a few weeks ago.  There was scarcely a phase of Land Commission activities left untouched by Deputies and I do not know that any Deputy can say anything very new on the subject on this occasion&mdash;I certainly cannot&mdash;and I must wait until I hear the discussion which is likely to follow on the introduction of this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to throw some light on the Land Commission. I do not know if I can.  We might be more forcible, perhaps, if we went back over the debates in former years and say the same things as have been said about it previously.  Perhaps the same things will be said about it again next year.  We are glad to see that the Land Commission has reduced its salary bill, but it is very hard for any Deputy, who has not the leisure to go into the Land Commission and spend a few days there seeing what they are doing, to know what should be the staff of that Department.  Any Deputy with whom I came in touch feels that we are not getting value for the Land Commission, that things are not being done with the speed and efficiency with which they should be done.  We have come to the conclusion that the place is over-staffed and, perhaps, over-paid.  I am not going to delay on the question of salaries, as our views on that are fairly well known.  We consider that the highly-paid men in particular are a luxury for this country as long as it is as poor as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I get on, perhaps, to the work done by the Land Commission for the last few years we would be able to form our own conclusions as to whether it is over-staffed.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave figures about the work done in the Land Commission during the last three or four years, but they <Col N="63" /> were a little bit confusing.  I got a letter from the Land Commission in answer to a question about the amount of land vested and unvested, the amount taken over under various Acts, and the amount of untenanted land divided and so on.  Although that question was answered on 2nd April&mdash;and I daresay the figures which the Parliamentary Secretary gave to-day may be regarded as up to date&mdash;I cannot understand the discrepancy between some of the figures, even allowing for the work done by the Land Commission during the intervening fortnight.  I think it safer, therefore, to rely on the written figures before me which were supplied by that Department on 2nd April.  According to these figures, the amount of tenanted land which had been bought under the various Acts up to 1909 was about 10,000,000 acres. There have been about 1,000,000 acres added to that amount since 1st April, 1923.  That was at the time when the Land Commission was taken over by the present Government.  Under the 1923 Act we have only had 110,000 acres, according to my figures, vested. That is the particular item to which, I think, we should draw attention.  We have been told by the Parliamentary Secretary that last year 60,000 acres were vested under the Act of 1923.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. RODDY Mr. RODDY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. RODDY</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;divided.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Parliamentary Secretary said &ldquo;vested.&rdquo;  The amount of tenanted land under the Act of 1923 would be 110,000 acres for the last four years, according to the list of figures supplied to me, so far as I can understand them.  There are still about 4,000,000 acres of tenanted land to be dealt with by the Land Commission sometime, but unless they increase their efficiency and get on with the work more quickly than they are doing we are not going to see the land of this country dealt with in our life time, nor will the next generation see it finished. As a matter of fact, at the rate at which we have been going during the last four years, so far as I can find out by a sum in simple division, it will take 120 years to get it finished.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will prove, <Col N="64" /> by the way it has been speeded up, that by a system of geometrical progression that 120 years will be cut down considerably.</P>
      <P>With regard to the untenanted land, under the 1923 Act they have allotted 135,000 acres according to my figures, and they have, as a matter of fact, about 978,000 acres in some sort of progress. On some of it they have fixed a price, negotiations are proceeding in respect of other portions of it, and another part is subject to inquiry.  They have a million acres of untenanted land which they have at least found on the map, and they intend to divide it in the near future, or some time.  But we have no idea whatever&mdash;although I tried to find out in the question I put to the Parliamentary Secretary, I have not been supplied with the information &mdash;of the amount of untenanted land which remains apart from that, and which will have to be dealt with at some time.  We are altogether at sea as to how long it may take them to divide up the land that still remains to be divided&mdash;whether it is going to be 20, 40 or 50 years.  At any rate it is going to last a number of years at the rate the Land Commission is proceeding at present.  We have been assured by the Parliamentary Secretary, and I have been assured in the answer to the question I have already referred to, that on account of the provisions of the 1927 Act things will move much faster, because they will be able to add on the arrears to the purchase money, and will not have to wait to have the arrears cleared off.  That may be.  Perhaps things may be better.  All we can do, I suppose, is to hope for better things from the Land Commission for another year or two.  A year or two will make very little difference to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very serious complaint from one section of the population, the section of non-judicial holders.  We may take it for granted that the judicial holders are paying what was regarded, at one time at any rate, as a fair rent but the non-judicial holders can claim that they are not paying a fair rent. The only possible way out for them is to have the vesting done in their cases as quickly as possible.  I think the Land Commission should have pity on those <Col N="65" /> people and try to take those cases first. They should have those cases adjudicated upon and have a fair rent fixed in order to give them a chance of making a living out of the land, a thing which it is very hard to do at present and which it is impossible to do when they are paying exorbitant rents. There is no doubt that there is a large staff in the Land Commission.  It may be that they are getting on more quickly with the work now, but a considerable amount of the time of that staff is taken up with the collection of land annuities which are being sent out of this country. The Parliamentary Secretary in introducing this Vote should have given us some idea of the cost of the approximate proportion of time taken up by his staff in the collection of these land annuities under the Acts up to 1909 so that we would have an idea of what it is costing this country to collect land annuities which are going to the British Government and what his Department is costing this country in respect of operations under the 1923 Act&mdash;dividing untenanted land and purchasing and vesting tenanted land.  Then we would be able to discuss this question in a proper way but in default of that information we can only come to the conclusion that at least a good deal of time must be taken up in collecting some millions of pounds a year and in some cases in sending many notices before the annuity is paid, uttering threats of various sorts to those people who do not pay their annuities and in bookkeeping and so on for the benefit of people outside this country.  I do not know whether any Deputy in this House is quite satisfied that this country is able to afford a service of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>ACTING-CHAIRMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite all right, but it is expenditure which cannot be amended without fresh legislation. The general theory on the Estimates is that everything relating to the Department can be discussed, but anything which requires fresh legislation cannot be taken up on an Estimate. The Estimates refer to the administration of existing Acts but the Act is a matter which cannot be discussed.  The Deputy is perfectly in order in discussing whether the administration is carried out economically or otherwise, but he is not justified in discussing whether the Act on which it is based is an Act which should have been passed.  The distinction is quite clear.</P>

      <P>No.  About the handing over of these land annuities, the Executive Council, or the Minister for Finance, I forget which, is authorised to hand over the land annuities to the British Government under a section of the 1923 Land Act.  It is a very vague section, and as far as I know there is no compulsion whatsoever on anybody to collect the land annuities.  It was for that reason that I asked why should anybody ask the people here to pay these land annuities?  They are not compelled by any Act of Parliament or any agreement with the British Government, as far as we know.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. RYAN Dr. RYAN">
      <NameTxt>Dr. RYAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising this point to try and get the better of the argument.  I thought I might be allowed to go on with it on the plea that there was no compulsion to collect them.  However, I leave it at that.  Perhaps we may have another opportunity of raising this matter.  I mentioned that the figures I got on the 2nd of April from the Parliamentary Secretary did not correspond in many respects with the figures which he read out to-day.  His figures may be up to date.  If the figures which he supplied me with on the 2nd of April and the figures which he read out to-day are both correct, I must say the Land Commission have done extraordinary work for the last fortnight.  If they go on at that rate they will have all the land bought up within the next few years, because there is a very big difference in the figures.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give me some idea of how the discrepancies arose.  I might also make the complaint that in the question I referred to I asked how much land was bought out under each of the Acts.  The reply stated that so much was bought out <Col N="68" /> from 1870 to 1909, but it did not give the information I wanted, and this is the reason: I have an idea&mdash;I may be wrong, and if so the Parliamentary Secretary will very likely tell me that I am&mdash;that most of the land bought out under the Acts passed by the British Parliament was from 1909 onwards&mdash;at any rate from 1903 onwards.  So that if we take the rate at which the land was being bought out from 1903 to 1923, we would in all probability find that the Land Commission were working as hard anyway, perhaps harder, during those years than they have been working from 1923 to 1928.  If I had been supplied with the information I asked for I would not have made that point, and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would not have had to shake his head at me, as he has.</P>

I would also like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an assurance&mdash;and this is a matter that affects us very much in the country districts&mdash;that these people who are agitating to have their holdings vested, and whose holdings are non-judicial holdings, will get preference over the others.  They claim that they are paying rack-rents.  In the old times they had a Land Court to go to, but now they have none, and I think they should get the preference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter I should like to refer to is in connection with the reinstatement of evicted tenants. When a large portion of land is purchased by the Land Commission, and when they put people on it who they say are evicted tenants, in many cases they evict a person already in possession of a house on that particular estate.  I do not think that is a proper policy.  I do not see the use of putting in one evicted tenant at the expense of another, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary in future to try and <Col N="69" /> avoid a policy of that kind.  It has happened in two or three cases in my constituency. In one case the Minister was good enough, when I drew attention to the matter, to refrain from doing that.  There is another case now on the same estate which I make special representations about.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to refrain from doing things of that kind.  It is certainly not good policy to bring a person from one area to another, evict a person already on the estate and throw him out on the road in order to reinstate an evicted tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The two great reasons for the Land Commission going slow with regard to the vesting of tenanted holdings have now disappeared.  The question of congests and of untenanted lands has to a great extent been dealt with.  A good part of the work in connection with estates has been done, and the problem is almost dealt with.  I will not refer to the other cause.  It is one that can be anticipated by anybody who gives the matter any thought. To my mind, therefore, the road is now clear for dealing with the tenanted estates.  If we are to expect, in view of the increased staff of the Land Commission, anything like the same output of work as we had under previous Acts, most of the estates should be dealt with within the next twelve months, and not within the next ten or twelve years. Under the 1909 Act, for the first time we had payments made in stock.  The cause of the delay under previous Acts was the difficulty in finding money and the fact that stock had to be floated in the market.  That disappeared altogether under the 1909 Act.  I was able to force sales in my own county under the 1909 Act in connection with four estates, and within 12 months after the agreement being made the vesting orders were made.  Under the 1923 Act payment is also made in stock, and the only question that arises is one of title, together with some small incidental difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Land Commission is not going to give full value for this money let it stand aside and let some other power be put in to do the work.  I have great hopes that in twelve months the story will be different, and if it is not different <Col N="70" /> there will be other voices raised in this House, to know the reason why. The two great causes have disappeared. One I will not refer to, and the other has been almost dealt with.  One of the great troubles we had with regard to untenanted property was the local agitation to buy the land at any price. They forced the Government.  The Government was in the position of having paid too much for the land in the case of most of those estates, but they had no choice.  They were forced into it owing to local clamour to buy the property.  They bought it and paid too much, and there is too much of an annuity charge on most of the holdings on such estates.  It is a common thing to have 30/- or 35/-an Irish acre charged for land that under a judicial rent would only bear 12/- to 15/- an acre.  These lands, as a matter of fact, if purchased under any of the previous Acts, would have had a judicial rent of anything from 15/- to £1 an acre, which would bring down the annuities to anything from 10/- to 12/6 an acre.  Under this untenanted land distribution the same class of land is bearing a rental of from 30/- to 35/- an acre and, on top of that, buildings and fences have to be put up. I pity the Land Commission and I pity the tenants responding to this clamour for buying and dividing land at an improper time.  If they were buying now instead of four years ago the prices would be different.  There is no use going into that matter now, but it seems to me the State will have to bear a big share of the loss in connection with a lot of this property bought out.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Gorey that too much money is being paid for land, and I am afraid that, as a nation, we have been rather unfortunate from that point of view, I suppose, since the Land Acts came into existence.  At one time people with a certain mentality would always tell you that the people's agitation did this.  They agitated.  The other element, the landlord class, seemed to have been exempt from any particular blame, but I know, and a good many will agree with me, that the <Col N="71" /> landlord element were always a much more highly-organised body of men. They were in the position of getting better information, and it is a doubtful point if they did not connive to a certain extent at bringing such a state of affairs about.  I cannot feel that it is fair to blame people who have really a natural wish to obtain the land.  When times are bad and depression exists they have not much hope.  They do not see any change of the markets or of the value of what the land produces.  Therefore, they really have not the heart to agitate, and that, to my mind, has been one of the disasters in land purchase in Ireland.  The tenants and the people generally always bought when the market was highest.  Under the 1923 Act no doubt land has been bought practically at the peak price.  It will be many years in Ireland before land reaches that value again.</P>

      <P>Not alone in the matter of land has that been the case, but it is the case also with other commodities. From 1923 things started to drop.  Deflation has not yet ceased. It may be practically on the point of reaching its level.  There is no doubt about it that in these years land was bought too high, but, unfortunately, I suppose there was no power to prevent that from happening.  Agitation did spring up, and that agitation was only natural.  The people wanted the land because they saw what the land produced was valuable.  I agree with what Deputy Gorey says that later on losses undoubtedly will have to be faced in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I will just say a few words upon the method of the division of the land.  I have noticed in parts of the country farms of land divided up and given to tenants who have residences or houses on those particular farms.  I notice that in very few cases did any of the tenants get farms beside their houses.  I noticed that tenants were taken from other districts and brought in there and given farms beside the other tenants' houses.  That does not lead to an economic state of affairs.  I believe that an effort should be made in these cases to give land as close as possible to the houses of the particular tenants.  Another point that I have met with is the question of migrants.  I know that my constituency is the constituency that is expected and, I believe, is capable of absorbing a good many migrants.  That is more or less a reversal of the policy that once prevailed in this country.  I dare say the ancestors of the migrants were forcibly sent from the Eastern portion of Ireland, <Col N="73" /> and particularly, perhaps, from the County Meath.  It is but justice that the congestion be relieved in the West by placing men on farms in the County Meath, but I would suggest perhaps a little change in the method. These men are faced with big difficulties. They come into a district that perhaps may be a little hostile.  There is a reason for that, and it is just to see if that can be eliminated that I raise this point.</P>
    <P>These men get round about 80 acres of land.  In some cases a farm of 600 or 700 acres is divided up amongst them. I believe that if you put one or two migrants on 600 or 700 acres of land and divide the remainder amongst the natives there, it would lead to greater harmony than prevails to-day.  The next point involved is the question of uneconomic holders.  It is but just that they should get an enlargement of their farms but then I fear another class is being left out of consideration, that I call the eligible landless men.  I believe that the claims of these men should be taken into serious consideration, because a big proportion of them are capable, have a little capital and have experience.  It is not right to allow them to lose heart, come to the conclusion that they are not going to get any chance, and, perhaps, compel them to seek a living in another country.  I do not understand why some of those men were turned down because, to my mind, the object in dividing land is that people should get it who are capable of making a success of the division.  What I mean is that a successful tenant would increase the value of the land to the highest percentage possible.  That is an economy to the State.  I believe that if more care and attention were given to the selection of tenants there would be fewer failures.  After all, I suppose the object of the Land Commission, and of the Government, should be to make this country at least an 80 per cent. or a 90 per cent. success.  I believe that it is very important that the question of eligible and uneconomic tenants, as well as the treatment of migrants when they come to this part of the country, should be taken into serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, <Col N="74" /> let me pay the one compliment I have to pay to the Land Commission.  I have many grouses with them but I have one real compliment to pay to them, and that is in the matter of giving time for the payment of annuities.  Where I have a good case for an annuitant to be allowed some time to meet his liabilities I never approach the Land Commission without receiving a good deal of consideration. But, I am not at all satisfied that the Land Commission is speeding up the division of untenanted lands as quickly as it might.  In my constituency I know from experience that there is a good deal of land still that might be easily divided up by a little exertion on the part of the Land Commission. The one great fault of that is that there is a good deal of land out of production which, if divided and given to the uneconomic holders and landless men, would probably be in production now, and would probably have something to say to this much discussed adverse trade balance.  I am not at all satisfied with the progress made, although I think I heard a speech some time ago intimating that the Land Commission had practically disposed of all the undivided land.  I am not satisfied with that, and I am anxious to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say, why there is not a greater speeding up of the division of untenanted land amongst uneconomic holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to call attention is the way in which the Land Commission take over estates. One meets a case occasionally where first of all a Deputy gets into touch with the Land Commission, and points out that such an estate might be divided amongst a townland or parish where there are uneconomic holders, and suggests that it might be taken in hand and done expeditiously.  I have one such case in my mind where the Land Commission was so informed by Deputies.  I found that the Land Commission stated that such a place could not be suitably nor effectively divided, and would not be much use to the uneconomic holders in the district.  What happened?  The best portion of 300 or 400 acres was sold in lots and now. after a lapse of eight or ten months, when the best portion of the estate has been sold the Land Commission sends <Col N="75" /> down inspectors to see if they can acquire it for the uneconomic holders in the district.  Surely that is not the proper way to deal with this matter. Clearly the people who bought three or four divisions of the land bought the best.  It was disposed of in lots, and now the Land Commission endeavours to dispose of the comparatively worthless portion of that estate to the uneconomic holders and landless men in the district.  Further, there are cases of untenanted lands where there are old buildings and houses&mdash;I have a few in my mind&mdash;with forty or fifty acres attached.  The Land Commission stated that this land would be let with the houses so as to make the taking of them an economic proposition, as otherwise the valuation of the houses would be too high for anybody to take them. I find that after some years the Land Commission cannot get people to take these houses, and they have to suggest the demolition of them and the sale of the material.  Now, the trouble is as to who is to get the small divisions around them which, if they were divided with the first portion of the estate, would have offered no difficulty whatever.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the collection of annuities by the Land Commission, I have a suggestion to make.  The annuitants do not know exactly how they stand towards the Land Commission in several cases.  I know a good many cases where the tenant, or annuitant, would get a demand for the current annuity, and while he strains his resources to meet that, he finds that the State Solicitor sends him a process for some annuities that were due for two or three years previously.  We find that a good many people who cannot be charged with endeavouring to make political capital out of any mismanagement of the Land Commission&mdash;such people as District Justices&mdash;make the statement, with regard to the position in which annuitants find themselves as to the payment of their annuities, that they do not know exactly where they are.  I must confess that I have gone as closely as I could into some of the accounts presented to me by annuitants in my constituency; I have endeavoured to find out how they stood <Col N="76" /> with the Land Commission, but I could never be clear in my mind as to what they did owe.  Cases are handed over to the State Solicitors, which puts costs on the annuitants, and sometimes when the annuities are £3 or £4 the costs are nearly half that.  These people should know exactly where they stood before such claims are issued.  The Land Commission ought to make it perfectly clear to them what they owe and in what fashion they owe it&mdash;how many years are due.  I do know, as I said at the outset, that the Land Commission is prepared to meet reasonably any person who makes a fair offer and who shows an earnest of his intention to pay his annuity, but I do say that there are a good many of them who do not know what they actually owe, a good many of them who think that when they get a demand note for the current annuity it is probably the end of their liability.  That is not at all the position. The position probably is that the State Solicitor is hatching a process which will probably put a few more pounds on them in costs.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Land Commission is speeding up the division of untenanted land as it might, and that it is taking the necessary steps to see that land that might be divided among uneconomic holders is not split up and sold to people with a good deal of money, who are buying what are legally the rights of the uneconomic holders, then having the Land Commission, after the lapse of eight or ten months, purchasing the comparatively worthless residue of the estate and endeavouring to get the uneconomic holders to accept it.  These are not cases of imagination; they are concrete cases that I know of, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give such matters consideration, within the next year anyhow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. FAHY Mr. FAHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that personally I have experienced great courtesy from officials of the Land Commission whenever I have had occasion to go there on public duty.  I think that many of them work very hard and that some of them are over-worked.  But the history of that Land Commission office might explain many things.  It has been responsible, I maintain, for <Col N="77" /> the waste of public funds for about twenty years.  The method of recruitment of the staff was responsible for that to a large extent.  Some of them came in whenever they liked and left off duty whenever they liked.  I do not mean the permanent civil servants; I mean the men who were recruited from outside years ago, often from the land-lord's agent type, and put in there.  As a matter of fact, it used often to be said that when a stranger came in to the Land Commission they did not know whether he was going to be a temporary clerk or a land judge until he was there a couple of days.  Their chief qualification often was that they had been very good in collecting rents for absentee landlords, who succeeded in getting them positions in the Land Commission.  Jobs seemed to have been given to them indiscriminately.  They then became land experts, perhaps land lawyers of a certain type.  What expert knowledge of land they had or what was the extent of their legal knowledge I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that there are eighty-eight officials on the inspectorate staff now, with £43,000 in salaries, exclusive of travelling expenses, which, I think, are bulked at £34,000.  I think that the House should be informed as to what exactly these inspectors do.  What are the qualifications necessary for the post?  What examinations have they passed, Civil Service or other, to qualify for such posts, or how were they recruited?  It might be instructive also if it could be told what were the previous occupations of these men on the inspectorate staff.  If they have no particular qualifications, then their salaries are altogether too high, or perhaps some of them should not be there at all.  There were, I think, twenty-six inspectors costing £11,000.  Some of the lists looked too large, so they were divided down and graded, and they do not all appear in the one list now.  We have another class, called surveyors. There seems to be a number of surveyors. I do not know exactly what their duties are or what qualifications they have.  I would like to know what the qualifications for land surveyors are and how they are recruited, what academic or practical qualifications or <Col N="78" /> experience these men had before they were appointed.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial side or the expense of administration I think that economies could be effected by transferring the Collection Department to the Minister for Finance, to whom the money goes eventually, and that the Record Branch should be amalgamated with the Land Registry Office, because the Land Registry Office is doing similar work, in fact often identical work. I believe that a Government expert was put in there to try to speed things up and to get rid of the arrears, and he got a duplicate system of registration which has caused more work and more confusion.  I think economies could really be effected by transferring the Collection Department to the Department of Finance and amalgamating the Record Branch with the Land Registry Office.  The work is very similar in both Departments, and I think there is duplication of staff there and unnecessary duplication of work by having two distinct offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the demand of Deputy Ryan that the Land Commission should endeavour to expedite the vesting of the land purchased under the 1923 Act.  I would also like to call attention to the position of certain tenants who purchased under previous Land Acts and who are not satisfied that fair judicial rents have been fixed.  I have been in communication with the Land Commission about one case, and there are other cases of a similar character.  These people were brought into the court; they were told that a fair judicial rent was being fixed, and now they are asked to believe that because a contract had been entered into that rent should hold.  But the fact is that in some of these cases the people had no option but to accept the rent which the landlord was then&mdash; as has been pointed out by other speakers&mdash;by the strength of his organisation able to force upon them.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what steps are usually taken by the Land Commission in arranging for the re-valuation of these holdings, the owners of which have complained that a fair rent was not fixed.  In the case I refer to the rent was fixed in <Col N="79" /> 1909, I think, and it is substantially the same rent as was paid in the 'eighties, although the tenant is entitled to a reduction of 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>On these Estimates, we are told by the Press, the public expects the Fianna Fáil Party to show where reductions could be made.  I will not go over the ground that was traversed before in respect of this Estimate.  I will simply say that I am not satisfied that the statement that the Parliamentary Secretary has made, and which is somewhat similar to the one which was published in the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; several months ago, is sufficient justification for the staff that is being employed.  Deputy Fahy has pointed out that there are a large number of surveyors.  Well, if the surveyors are doing useful work, I am sure that nobody on these benches has any objection to their being well paid.</P>
      <P>It is well known that surveyors and engineers, after leaving the university, are very poorly paid in comparison with other professional classes.  There is no harm, however, in letting the House know why the staff should have been increased in that Department.  In the British time there were only 50 surveyors and now there are 75.  As regards inspectors, I am not going to deal with the resident inspectors, but rather with the temporary inspectors. There are 29 temporary inspectors estimated for during the coming year, and I want to know how it is that these officials who are only temporary should be costing so much.  Some of them are getting £600 a year and some £500, whereas the highest officer amongst the surveyors is only getting a maximum salary of £600.</P>

      <P>Seeing that the whole question of the handing over of the congested districts to the Department of Fisheries as well as the re-distribution of that particular Ministry will soon be up for discussion the House, I think, would be glad to have some information as to what particular schemes are in operation in the congested districts or are proposed during the coming year.  I take it that the decision to hand over the Land Commission to the Department of Fisheries was not come to in a moment.  It is nearly two years since the Gaeltacht Commission made its report.  During that period the Government has had plenty of time to discuss the recommendations made by that Commission.  Estimates are now before the House for the work of the Land Commission during the next twelve months, and I think it is not too much to ask what is being done in the way of preparing schemes for the congested or Irish-speaking areas.  We have also an amount of £134,500&mdash;contribution towards charge for excess stock.  This item represents a payment to the British Government.  This is the <Col N="81" /> amount of money payable by the Free State in respect of bonus and excess stock.  It may be of interest to Deputies to know that an amount for the same purpose is not being paid in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I understand that when this agreement was made with the British that a contribution of £160,000 a year had previously been paid.  It was then decided, I do not know why, that this payment of money for excess stock and bonus was a Free State liability, or at any rate, that it was a Free State liability to the extent of £134.500 per annum.  If it were a complete Free State liability I am surprised that the British Government did not succeed, when they were driving such a good bargain for themselves in other respects, in making us pay the total amount, but apparently they were quite satisfied to get the £134,500 instead of what they had been previously getting, namely, £160.000.  The amount which Northern Ireland is responsible for in respect of excess stock and bonus is not paid to the British at all because land annuities, as we know, are held in Northern Ireland, and the Exchequer there is responsible for the incidental expenses, including the payment of these charges.</P>

      <P>I was just going to give expression to the wish that the Executive Council would afford us an opportunity of discussing the whole matter at an early date, because although, as Deputy Hogan and other Deputies have pointed out, we have been met very fairly by the Land Commission in certain cases of individuals which we have brought before them, and although we have not a great deal to grumble at in the way they have met us, still there is a very large number of people of whom we have knowledge who are in sore straits on account of the charges and claims made upon them.  That is largely on account of the arrears which have become due since the troubled period.  I think that, as well as affording these people an opportunity to pay up and of looking upon their cases in a spirit of reasonableness, the House ought to have an opportunity of going into the whole question as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies who have made complaints regarding the cost of the collection of annuities.  Some cases of extreme hardship have come under my notice to which I wish to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Small farmers owing one year's or a year and a half's annuities have been proceeded against.  In one case the total amount of the decree on the annuity due was £13, to which was added £5 costs. There are similar cases where the costs are entirely out of proportion to the amount of the annuities due.  Some effort should be made to lighten these costs on the unfortunate people, who find it hard enough to pay the annuities without being burdened by these heavy costs.  In some cases the neighbours of those against whom decrees have been enforced for arrears of a year or a year and a half owed three <Col N="83" /> or four years' annuities, and, though they have been decreed, the decrees have not been enforced.  There is another aspect of the question.  In portion of my constituency the river embankments have broken down in the past three years.  On Monday morning I saw a considerable area of flooded lands.  The seed-sowing machines were practically submerged, and one could see only the tops of them in these flooded areas.  The potato and corn seeds had been sown, and of course these will be absolutely useless.  These lands to which I refer were under three or four feet of water.  That happens very frequently, and not every hundred years.  These floods, when they occur in the spring, mean that the people lose their seed, and when they occur in the autumn they lose their corn.  I have seen sheaves of oats and hay floating down the Blackwater.  These people have no redress.  The embankments should be kept in repair for them.  I understand that in the Land Act of 1927 provision was made for this, but it has not been put into force.  Many of these people have been decreed for lands they have been unable to till.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another grievance from which these people suffer, and which should be taken into account.  They hold they have the first claim on the fishing rights of those rivers.  They do not want them for nothing; they are quite willing to pay for them.  I think if the fishing rights have to be transferred they should go to the tenants at an agreed price.  It would be distinctly unfair if these people who are content to pay for land that is useless to them owing to flooding by the rivers should have the fishing rights of those rivers given away over their heads to strangers, thus depriving them of any benefits that might be got from the rivers that destroy their lands.  Some Deputies referred to the division of land in the different counties, and to migrants coming in from outside districts.  We all agree that every effort should be made to remedy the state of congestion in the West, but if migrants are brought into counties from outside areas there is a danger that it might create a mild form of land war on the part of <Col N="84" /> those landless men who hold they have first claim on the land in those counties where it is being divided.  The cases of those men should be considered when land is being divided.  There are many farm labourers who would be efficient workers on the land and could work a farm efficiently.  They certainly could be depended on to till land and they are very hardworking.  Their claims should be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Goulding in protesting against the policy of the Land Commission in pursuing, unnecessarily in many cases, people for the recovery of Land Commission annuities without giving fair consideration to proposals which these people have to put forward for the payment of the amounts due.  I do not think it is quite right when a State Solicitor gets a direction from the Land Commission to issue processes for the recovery of annuities due that he should proceed to carry out that instruction in face of the fact that some of the people concerned had called upon the State Solicitor and put up to him reasonable proposals for the payment of the amounts due.  One of the State Solicitors in my constituency considers when he receives instructions from the Land Commission that he cannot entertain any proposal that comes to him from any person who is being sued.  I know cases where poor people who find it very hard to get the money to pay have gone to this State Solicitor&mdash;I do not want to name him here&mdash;and he had not the courtesy to speak to them when they called on him to make proposals for payment.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will issue instructions which will make it possible for State Solicitors to see people who call on them, and to discuss with them proposals they have to put forward for the payment of the amounts due, and not to act on the instructions to sue regardless of any proposals put forward.  I agree with the Deputy, and with others who have referred to the matter from time to time, that the Land Commission is a happy hunting ground for solicitors for the recovery of excessive costs.  I think this is a matter that should be looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Cases have been quoted on several occasions by Deputy White, of Tirconaill, which show the way the State Solicitor carries out his duties in that particular county, regardless of the costs and consequences to individuals concerned.  Other Deputies have also cited cases supported by facts similar to those mentioned by Deputy White. I think State Solicitors should be satisfied with the fairly good salaries they receive from this State without trying to recover twice that amount by way of excessive costs from people who are called upon to pay Land Commission annuities.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the fact that he has provided an increased amount for the improvement of estates in this year's Vote.  I think any money given for that purpose could be well and usefully spent by giving employment in carrying out drainage work and other improvements on estates acquired and divided under the 1923 Act.  I wish to call attention to certain aspects of that part of the Land Commission work which has come under my notice.  On a few occasions I had inquired of the Land Commission why they should divide estates and hand them over to people considered suitable without making roads, so as to enable them to go in and work those lands.</P>
    <P>I recently had to put before the Land Commission an appeal for time for a tenant in a case where the Land Commission was suing an individual for the recovery of the annuity due. What was the position in that case? Nearly two years ago this estate was divided, and it was divided without having made roadways into it and without carrying out any drainage.  In this case a man got 21 acres of land, but there was no road into that land. The Land Commission were prosecuting him for the annuities on a piece of land that he had never got an opportunity to work.  If the money that is now being passed is to be used in the proper way the improvements should be carried out before the land is handed over to the people concerned. In the county of Offaly the improvement work has been done in a proper way.  In Leix, on the other hand, no improvement work was carried out until a row was raised by some Deputy <Col N="86" /> from the constituency.  Then there is a chance that the work may be done in a year or two after the land has been handed over to the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look over the files and see if he can find any complaint of that kind in Leix, and to make it clear to the people responsible that in future the improvement work must be done before the people are put in possession.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary upon providing the increased amount but I would ask him, after the money has been allocated by the Dáil, to see that the improvements for which that money is allocated have been carried out, and that the money will be spent within this year.  As a member, and recently appointed Chairman of, the Public Accounts Committee, I have discovered that this House has been asked to vote sums of money for the improvement of estates.  Other Deputies who are members of the Public Accounts Committee will agree from what has come before us that in some instances the money that has been voted has not been spent to the extent of, in one case, £40,000.  That is to say, the money expended on improvements was £40,000 short of the amount voted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is a figure of £323,200 in the Estimate this year, and it appears to have been fairly accurately worked out, but if it is not a figure picked up from their imagination, and if that figure is to be voted now, let it be voted on the understanding that the money will be spent within the year for which it is being voted.  We have had already surpluses in a large way at the end of the year.  The ordinary Deputy is ignorant of these matters.  I was ignorant of them up to a certain point until I got a certain amount of experience.  When one sees those Estimates made out one would imagine that the officials of the Land Commission had gone into the minutest details to find out how much of this money would be spent.  If these Estimates are drawn up accurately, let the money be spent as carefully as possible on the work for which it is being voted now.  I have got a serious complaint to make, and I think it is a serious matter, a matter for just complaint in the Dáil, and that is that it should be possible, through laziness or <Col N="87" /> through mal-administration of some kind or another, that in this county estates should be divided and the land handed over, but that yet the people to whom it is allotted have not been able to enter upon that land owing to the want of suitable improvements being carried out, and that even then the Land Commission should instruct the State Solicitor to sue in the Circuit Court for the annuities on this land which the individual who is sued is unable to work.  That is a bad state of affairs, and it justifies me in making a complaint under this head, while at the same time congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary in having provided the money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the cost of the collection of land annuities, but he was ruled out of order.  We have also heard references during the course of this debate to the cost of collection.  Only in one case could we have any sympathy with the costs not being fair, and that was in the case that Deputy Goulding has pointed out, where the tenant is forced to pay huge costs in proportion to what his rent would be in certain conditions. The Land Act of 1923 specifically laid down that the Land Commission was to make reasonable deductions in respect of the cost of collection of compounded arrears of rent under Section 19 (4) of the Act.  These deductions were never made, and there seems to have been a conflict for a number of years between the Department of Finance and the Land Commission on this matter.  In the Public Accounts Committee this matter was under discussion, and we were not satisfied with the attitude adopted by the Land Commission in this particular item.  On the one hand, we have evidence in a minute from the Minister for Finance to the Land Commission to the effect that a huge staff was at one time employed in the collection of these compounded arrears, and that no deduction was made whatever from the landlords who received these moneys.  Since then the system has been changed, and these compounded arrears are paid over a period in the same way as land annuities. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the <Col N="88" /> arrears were collected and handed over to the landlords without any cost to them, while the State has to pay for the cost of their collection.  If I am wrong in this matter the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me.</P>

      <P>We, on the Public Accounts Committee, gave particular attention to that five per cent. to which the Parliamentary Secretary refers. That five per cent. that the Parliamentary Secretary refers to was paid to the agent of the landlords originally for collecting that rent to hand over to the Department, but no deduction was made from the landlord.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether I am right or wrong.  The five per cent. was paid to the agent.  The Public Accounts Committee's Report is here.  It has been circulated and we will probably have a discussion on it later.  But I believe the matter of the cost of the collection that has been talked about was ruled out of order as it was not specifically stated in the Act. I would like to hear some explanation as to why the cost of the collection was not deducted.  I am convinced that the cost of collection of these compounded arrears should be recovered from the landlords who received the rent.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take any part in this debate at all, for I always considered that the city man knows very little about land.  The only thing I wish to say in rising to speak to the Estimate is to reply, very briefly, to Deputy Briscoe, who has just sat down. There has been trouble for some considerable time over the cost of the collection of these compounded arrears, but Deputy Briscoe knows as well as I do that the Land Act of 1923 fixed, in the first instance, the purchase price of the land.  Under this Act the Land Commission decided that no charge should be made for the collection of compounded arrears.  It was suggested to-day that the cost of collecting these arrears or the cost of the collection of the annuities in lieu of rent could reasonably be transferred to the Department of Finance.  I think the case to which Deputy Briscoe has drawn attention is a clear refutation of that <Col N="89" /> particular argument.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General in his Report on the Land Commission has drawn attention to the mode in which these arrears are being collected.  Deputy Briscoe is perfectly right, as far as I know, in the statement made that no costs have been charged for the collection of these arrears.  But I was sorry that Deputy Briscoe finished at that point.  In my opinion, Deputy Briscoe should not have stopped at that point.  Deputy Briscoe knows as well as I do that the position has now been regularised under the Land Act of 1927.</P>

      <P>I think that the point that does concern the House is that a certain discrepancy did occur but that owing to the operations of the Committee of Public Accounts this discrepancy will not occur in the future. I have ventured to draw the attention of this House to the fact that the position has now been regularised and that those compounded arrears will in future be added to the purchase money.  No doubt about it there has been no charge made and I do not know whether Deputy Briscoe is correct in stating that under the Act of 1923 powers existed.  I am not going to question the point emphatically but differences of opinion on this side of the House as to the validity of the charge did arise. Therefore, I do not think that anything can be gained at this juncture by dealing with that particular matter.  The thing is that this particular discrepancy in the matter of cost not being deducted, cannot in the future occur and will not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. MAGUIRE Mr. MAGUIRE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested as an explanation for the high price paid in many cases to the landlords for their interest in the land that it was due to the pressure made on behalf of the tenants and to representations made to the body known as the Irish Land Commission.  That body in their generosity <Col N="90" /> and in their anxiety to facilitate the farmers made haste in purchasing the land and they purchased it at too high a price.  If that were the explanation, the attitude of the Land Commission at a later date is difficult to find an explanation for.  I refer to the unreasonable manner in which they persecute farmers and compel them to pay land annuities.  It has been admitted by advocates of the Land Commission that they paid too much.  The ruthless manner in which they persecute farmers to make them pay land annuities would very badly correspond with the generosity that we have been told about in regard to the purchase in the first instance of the land.  As far as I am aware there has been no form of generosity on the part of the Land Commission, and I have fairly wide experience of the methods of the Land Commission with their tenants.  On the contrary, there has been every form of unfairness and, as an instance, I will just quote one concrete case which is typical of hundreds I know of and I am sure there are thousands of the same sort around the country.  I refer to a holding of land on the Whyte Estate, Co. Leitrim.  The rent of the farm is £21 9s. 0d.  Arrangements to purchase the farm by the Land Commission were made with Mr. Justice Ross.  The lands were then in the Land Judge's Court. This took place in 1911.  In the same year the tenant made application to have a judicial rent fixed.  The case came into Court and the judicial rent was fixed at £13 11s. 0d.  The Land Commission carried through their negotiations and in the ordinary way could have given a reduction of 7/- in the £ in this case.  They refused to give any reduction at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that at the time they negotiated the sale of the estate in 1911 the rent was then £21 9s.  The tenant had applied to have a fair rent fixed before a competent judge, and with competent valuers engaged.  The fair rent was fixed at £13 11s., but the Land Commission considered that was too much, and consequently they refused to give him the benefit that in the ordinary way would accrue to him as a tenant.  He was deprived of the advantage solely for the reason that it would deprive the landlord of something in <Col N="91" /> the way of the price that the landlord would get.  That may not have been in the Land Commission's mind, but anyway it is the result of their action. That is an extraordinary case, and it is typical of many others.  It does not bear out the suggestion that the high price was paid for the land because of the generosity of the Land Commission and their anxiety to facilitate tenants in getting land quickly.  The landlord is benefited in that case as in practically every other case.</P>
    <P>I know of several cases where land was purchased for sub-division amongst tenant farmers.  These farmers were cajoled in many instances by the Land Commission, and they were encouraged to leave smaller holdings, more cheaply rented, and take up what appeared to be more profitable larger holdings.  After some years those farmers found themselves in their new holdings crippled with an extraordinary rent out of all proportion to what the land was able to bear.  Many of these people came to me as a public representative to see if the Land Commission would take back the land and relieve them of their impossible burden. So far the Land Commission have nothing to their credit but the distribution of land.  They purchased land at too high a price, with the result that the rent placed on the land makes it impossible for the occupying tenant to work it economically, and makes it impossible for him even to meet the rent.</P>

The facts of the case are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The rent of the holding at the date of purchase of the estate by the late Congested Districts Board was £21 9s. 0d., and the price paid for it, and therefore fixed for re-sale, was based on this rent. Subsequently the tenant had a judicial rent fixed at £13 11s. 0d., which was far below the rent purchased, less the customary abatement allowed to tenants. No abatement could, therefore, be allowed to Michael Kilduff off the new rent, and the Court of Appeal decided that he is not entitled to such reduction...&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MAGUIRE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the dates now, but it was within the last ten years.  Reference has been made here to the cost put on the tenants by the Land Commission in suing for land annuities.  I have no doubt at all that there are instances where the Land Commission have no alternative left but to sue; but I do claim there is no necessity for the Land Commission to put costs on tenants who had not paid their last December rent up to the 28th March last.  I have instances of where tenants whose rents were due in December sent their land annuities on the 23rd March.  There were no civil bills issued, but the Land Commission returned the annuities and told the tenants they should go to the State Solicitor who had the cases in hands.  No court would be held until June next.  I have a few particulars with regard to that court area for last year, and they are of interest.  I think 124 cases were tried for defaulting land annuities.  Of this number some 54 were sued for a sum under £1 each, and the cost in these cases was 11/6.  The balance was for sums from £5 to £10.  It will take some explanation to explain away why these costs should be put on the unfortunate tenants.  Land annuities which were due in December, but which were forwarded by the tenants on the 23rd of March, were returned with an explanation <Col N="93" /> that there were costs incurred and that the tenants would have to deal with the State Solicitor.  The Land Commission have certainly been very generous in their promises to the tenants.  I have experience of their inspectors, when they came to farmers asking them to sign documents to facilitate the closing of the sale of an estate, promising them magnificent things which were never realised.  These promises have still to be kept.  I have instances in which these inspectors misled the people by forcing them into contracts which were unjust and immoral. I referred on a previous occasion to the Land Commission making arrangements in which the tenants were led to believe that they were to pay a certain price, and they signed agreements on that understanding.  Since I referred to this matter previously I have had hundreds of letters from people on various estates saying that they are in a similar position.</P>
      <P>I dealt already with my own farm, in connection with which arrangements were made to purchase it seventeen years ago.  The advance on the farm was £400, and we were led to believe that that was the maximum price to pay off the landlord's interest. For seventeen years I have paid a half-yearly annuity of £7 15s. 9d.  As an investment that is worth £330.  What I will have to pay will be over £700 instead of £400, which the owner at that time was told would be the purchase price.  That is not the action of a Department which is in sympathy with the tenants.  It is the action of a Department which has been guilty of fraud and misrepresentation so far as the country people are concerned.  I will insist on having these grievances rectified in this House, but if the House turns a deaf ear to them I will tell the House that the tenant farmers who, in the past, were able to deal with grievances which were unjust will be able to do the same to-day.</P>

      <P>I thought you wanted to make a point of it.  That has been my experience of the Land Commission.  They have been most unfair to the tenant.  They have not been generous in the matter of fixing prices. They have not been fair in the matter of fixing rents.  They have been unfair in suggesting to the farmers that the price arranged at a certain time was the price they would have to pay, but they have not kept that bargain.  They have not kept their word to the evicted tenants.  I know several evicted tenants who hoped that when the Land Commission came in they would be able to get back to the land from which they were evicted or to some other land. Many of them have lost hope and have gone abroad.  Many of them expected that they would be called back some day and be awarded a patch of land on which they could live.  Nothing, however, has been done for them and there has been more disappointment among them than among any other class of people who fought for the betterment of the country.  As regards congestion, we were told that the Land Commission would take people from congested holdings and place them in suitable land.  Last week at a railway station in Leitrim forty-three people left for America and eighteen of them were heads of households, some of whom left their children and wives behind.  That is the way congestion is being relieved.  These people were not going to America on a holiday and the Land Commission have done nothing in the way of trying to find them larger holdings.  So much for the work of the Land Commission.</P>

    <P>I referred on a previous occasion to other portions of their work.  I referred to their administration of public money.  Unfortunately I was not in order at that time, but I presume that on this occasion I can refer to it.  My complaint refers to the administration of the public money known as the relief work money spent in relief grants. Portion of it was spent a very short time ago.  I went on to show that in one concrete case this money had been misappropriated by a man who signed <Col N="96" /> himself as the President of the Cumann na nGaedheal Club.  I will not delay the House by reading the letter again. I have read it before.  The result of that work was that this Chairman or President of the Cumann na nGaedheal had clearly the disbursement of this money.  He disbursed it in a rather shady way inasmuch as he entered into a contract with a neighbour of his for liberty to have a road made over his land.  Having made that contract at least you would imagine that he would be honest enough to stick to it or that the Land Commission officials would see that the contract was strictly adhered to.  They did not.</P>

The work was started before the last June election, but this year, when the Road Grant came along, the road was not finished.  It was set aside because it was not found convenient to carry out this agreement I have here.  That is very much in contrast with the distribution and allotment of money in other districts.  I have here particulars of a case in another area in which a sum of 16/2 was deducted from the workers engaged on certain work.

      <P>I hope when the Deputy has heard these statements he will cease to be a member of Cumann na nGaedheal.  That is another concrete case, and I am prepared to give more evidence showing that there was mal-administration of public funds.  A grant was made to start a road going through part of a county.  The Commissioners' inspector went there, and incidentally he met a man in the locality and he asked him would he act as ganger on this road.  The man said he would not or that he could not suggest the name of anyone who would. After a little while the inspector met another man on the road in the same district and asked him would he act as ganger.  He said that he would.  The inspector then ordered him to apply to his supervising ganger, who happened to be leader of the local branch of Cumann na nGaedheal.  He asked him for the necessary papers and books, but he refused to give them.  A third party, having heard of the matter, went at once to the local organisation and pulled the wires, with the result that the works have not been started yet, although the ganger was appointed by the inspector from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the facts and some of the ways in which I have known the Land Commission to administer their work.  I have already referred to the manner in which they are pressing tenants in the collection of annuities.  I will give another case which is typical of hundreds.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary asked me a question, which perhaps I would be able to answer now, as to whether I had any evidence in these cases.  I referred to a case where land annuities were due to be paid in December last, but they <Col N="99" /> were not paid until 23rd March.  The annuity was sent on direct to the Land Commission, who sent it back with notification that the tenant would have to pay in addition the expenses of the State Solicitor.  The case to which I refer is that of Michael Dolan, of Latoon.  He sent his land annuity, due in December, on 23rd March.  It was returned to him with the statement that he would have to pay the local State Solicitor's costs.  Another concrete case is that of Mrs. Maguire, of Cornamon. In 1922 she paid her land annuities to the State Solicitor, which were due in December.  The receivable order was not returned after the December payment. In 1923 she was sued for two years' annuities.  She held the counterfoil from the post office and was able to show she had already paid.  She was proceeded against, and on two occasions was brought before the court. The judge asked the solicitor for the Land Commission to have the matter investigated and settled.  Nothing was done, but on the next occasion the tenant was ill, was not in court, and judgment was given against her.  These are instances of many similar cases which I could go on enumerating ad lib.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House, I am sure, is aware, a Commission has been sitting to inquire into the condition of town tenants, and the report of that Commission we expect will be received some time next <Col N="100" /> week.  I anticipate that that report will be a very far-reaching one, and will go minutely into the whole question of the relationship between tenants and landlords in towns.  In these circumstances I would venture to suggest to the proposer and seconder of this Bill that this is not a very opportune time for discussing this measure.  It would, I suggest, be better to wait until the report of the Commission is before the House. In the meantime, however, I see that a certain class of tenant would lose the protection of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest Act in June next. It would be too much to anticipate that the report of the Commission would be received and considered, and that legislation would even be introduced, much less passed, through the two Houses, before next June.  In consequence we would be prepared to extend the time limit of £30 houses, or houses over £30, from June, 1928, until June, 1929.  Before that time I am satisfied that the report of the Commission will be received and considered and that legislation dealing with the entire question will be introduced. I see that if the report of the Commission would safeguard in possession of the houses they now occupy some of the persons who would cease to be safeguarded next June, it could be unfair to these persons, because there had been a short period between the expiration of the present Act and the introduction of the new Bill, during which they might be put out of possession, that they should be deprived of their rights under existing or contemplated legislation.  In consequence we would be willing to accept this Bill, provided that in Section 4 the words &ldquo;June, 1929,&rdquo; were inserted instead of 1934, and that the last part of Section 4&mdash;&ldquo;and as if clause (c) of the said paragraph were deleted&rdquo;&mdash; were also deleted from the Bill.  That would mean that if Section 1 of the Bill stood, if Section 2 were deleted, if Section 3 were allowed to stand, if Section 4 were amended, as I have suggested, by putting in the figures &ldquo;1929&rdquo; in lieu of the figures &ldquo;1934,&rdquo; and if the last few words, &ldquo;and as if clause (c) of the said paragraph were deleted,&rdquo; were deleted from this Bill, we would be prepared to accept it.  That is to <Col N="101" /> say, that next autumn the entire of this question can be debated and considered by the House under the new legislative proposals which will be introduced certainly before June, 1929.</P>

      <P>Perhaps if I intervene at this stage it might save further discussion on the measure.  I take it that the Minister's suggestion is that he does not propose to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, on the understanding that I am prepared to accept the amendments which he announced. I might say that our chief object in introducing the Bill was because the Government had given no indication up to the date of its introduction of their attitude towards the houses which were coming from under control in June next.  That was the real urgency of the measure.  We knew that there were something like 5,000 houses which would be decontrolled next June, and the occupants of these houses were anxious to know what their position was.  No indication of that has been given by the Government.  The proposal, I understand from the Minister, is that he is willing to agree that those houses which would come from under control in June, 1928, under the existing Act will have the period of control extended for them to June, 1929.  The Minister mentioned £30 houses, but I take it he means houses which would come from under control in June, 1928, under the present Act&mdash; that is, houses from £25 to £30 in some cases.</P>

      <P>We hold our own views with regard to control and as to the measure of control that should operate in the matter of rents while conditions remain as they are, but this proposal of the Minister brings us a certain distance along the way.  While not giving away any of our views as to what we consider should be the law in these matters with regard to control, I am prepared to meet the Government to the extent which the Minister states, because it will give us a year's breathing space at any rate.  If the Minister promises to bring in a Bill dealing with the whole question of the relations between landlords and tenants, in the autumn session of this year, we can <Col N="102" /> fight out the whole issue on that.  In the meantime, the promise which the Minister has made will relieve the situation so far as these five or six thousand tenants all over the country are concerned, and our object in introducing the measure will have been to a considerable extent achieved.  I would be prepared to give the undertaking that I will accept the amendment if a Second Reading is given to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>We are satisfied with the arrangement that has been come to.  We have had many representations made to us by people in Dublin and elsewhere who would have been affected if this arrangement had not been come to, or some such Bill as that proposed by the Labour Party had not been introduced to continue the protection of those tenants coming out from the protection of the Act as it stands.  The Minister for Justice promised that the Commission that has been sitting upon the question of town tenants and their grievances will report in the course of a week, and that that report will receive the early consideration of the Government, and then I presume legislation will be introduced.  I take it that in any such report and legislation there will be protection afforded to the people who would otherwise be improperly and unduly affected if the law as it stands were allowed to remain unamended.  Everyone knows while there is such need as there is just now, and as there has been for years, for adequate houses, not alone in Dublin, where the need is felt to a greater extent than in other places, but all over the country, it would be a grave injustice to many people if the Rent Restrictions Act were withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe the protection these people have, such as it is, under that Act ought to be continued until legislation is introduced and the position safeguarded, or until houses are provided in adequate numbers by the Government or otherwise to enable competition to bring down the rents of houses that are already considered too high.  We are satisfied that the passing, as an unopposed measure, of this Bill will give the people that protection until such other legislation as may arise out of the Town Tenants Commission <Col N="103" /> report will be introduced.  I imagine that a year from June ought to be quite enough time to have the matter thoroughly considered by the Government to have legislation introduced and passed.  At any rate, we are prepared to wait and see what the nature of the report will be and the recommendations it will make, and what the nature will be of the legislation to be introduced by the Government later on, provided that in the meantime proper protection is guaranteed under the Bill to the tenants concerned.</P>

      <P>While I am strongly opposed to the continuance of the Rents Restriction Act, as I was opposed to the measure when it was before the House on a previous occasion, and while I am satisfied, in view of the experience I have had on this question, that one of the things that prevents us from getting the houses we are all so anxious to get is the existence of the Rents Restriction Act, yet, in view of the statement made by the Minister for Justice that it will be necessary to discuss the whole problem later on in the year, I am not disposed to take up the time of the House in discussing the problem now.  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I am prepared to accept, in the circumstances, the statement made by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little difficulty in my mind.  This Bill is not a Town Tenants Bill, or a Bill which proposes to amend the Town Tenants Act. I presume the legislation the Minister refers to will be a Bill arising out of the Town Tenants Commission and dealing with town tenants.  I would like to know if it is the Government's intention to embody in that Bill its proposals dealing with the relations between landlords and tenants in general and not merely in relation to town tenants, because one class of the community that would suffer by the cessation of control would be the rural tenants, who would not be covered by a Town Tenants Bill.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Lemass, I cannot, of course, not having seen the report, definitely state what the report will <Col N="104" /> contain, but I do undertake that legislation will be introduced dealing with the question.  If there is any class of tenants in the country whom our Bill will not affect, it will be open to Deputy Lemass to move an amendment to that Bill, and the whole matter of relations of landlords and tenants, not what I call town tenants cases, will be opened up.  There are, you may say, roughly, two classes of houses.  There are agricultural holdings which stand in a completely different class altogether and which are protected.  Then there are dwelling houses, the vast majority of which are in towns.  There may be some of them not in towns, and the words &ldquo;Town Tenants&rdquo; may not be applicable to them, but while I cannot foresee exactly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The business houses are almost all in towns, not the whole of them, no doubt.  There are business houses in country districts, but they have always come in, more or less, under &ldquo;Town Tenants.&rdquo;  The old Town Tenants Act dealt with business houses, to some extent, in country districts. The whole matter will be open for discussion, and when you have a question of the relations of landlord and tenant, it certainly could not be ruled out as being foreign to the issue to introduce any amendment you wished to have in legislation dealing with every class of house.  As far as this particular Bill stands, I agree with Deputy O'Connell, and I recognise his attitude.  He is accepting my suggestion without prejudice.  If he finds that our Bill is not drafted or amended as he would wish it to be, he has a free hand to act and to introduce this measure in identical terms again before next June.</P>

It might be quite a sound procedure to give this Bill a Second Reading and to amend it in the way suggested, but I would like a little time to consider it.  I would suggest that, instead of taking the Second Reading now, it should be put down as first business to-morrow.

We in this country have advocated for years the right of self-determination from the political side.  Surely if it is necessary to have self-determination on a political question it is more necessary to have self-determination for parents as regards what they think best for their children.  I am not going into the arguments that other Deputies more qualified than I am may raise on the question of the introduction of vaccination into England by Doctor Jenner.  I simply point out that over 5,000 people in County Wicklow, and 20,000 in Wexford, <Col N="107" /> have objected to having their children vaccinated.</P>
      <P>A large amount of expense would be put on the ratepayers by enforcing the Act, and the punishment on the parents can only be inflicted once.  If they go to jail for refusing to comply with the law as it at present exists they cannot be punished a second time because a child is not vaccinated.  All those in favour of vaccination may point out that smallpox exists in England, and that an epidemic may break out in Ireland, but the fining or imprisonment of parents is not a preventative.  Medical men who are in favour of vaccination state that, in their opinion, the serum will act as a preventative for seven years.  If that theory is correct, then to be consistent these medical men should advocate that everybody should get vaccinated every seven years, instead of inflicting punishment and hardship on children.  I have no medical experience, but I have ten or twelve years' experience on a public board; I have seen cases where poor, ill-nourished children were forcibly vaccinated, and I have seen the after-effects and the sufferings of these poor children as a result of vaccination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession and medical authorities are not unanimous on the question that vaccination is a preventative against smallpox.  I am a member of a certain committee, and I know that medical men recommend the injection of tuberculin as a cure for tuberculosis. We know that that does not cure it any more than vaccination prevents smallpox. If the medical profession would help the people by getting them better housing, by solving the housing problem, by clearing out the slums of our cities and even of our towns, if the medical profession would impress on the Medical Department of the Department of Local Government the necessity for dealing with other diseases in the same way as they impress on them the necessity for enforcing the Vaccination Act, I say that we would not have the large and increasing number of people dying from consumption. Eminent medical men have placed on record their considered opinion that even the existing vaccination laws in Great Britain should be repealed, that <Col N="108" /> vaccination should be abolished altogether, because they have found from experience that those who have been vaccinated are as liable to be attacked by smallpox as those who have not been vaccinated.  I will refer to what happened in India, where there are many epidemics each year.  A Royal Commission reported that 3,000 soldiers were vaccinated, and that 391 of them died from the results of vaccination. Australia, where the population is almost entirely unvaccinated, has been practically free from smallpox.  The argument will be advanced here that there is a mild form of the disease in England, and that, on account of being so near our shores, there is a possibility that it may spread to this country.  A report appeared in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on the 26th January stating that 15 medical men held a post-mortem examination on a man who was vaccinated, and they were unable to agree on a verdict as to whether he died from vaccination or smallpox.  The employer of the man in question gave him the option of being vaccinated owing to the outbreak of a mild form of epidemic. At any rate, a post-mortem examination was made by 15 doctors, and they were unable to come to any decision. Medical men differ on this question.</P>
    <P>Deputies may not agree with this Bill, but the problem of the unvaccinated people&mdash;those who have a conscientious objection to it&mdash;will remain. The authorities will not be able to force the people, even with their laws, to have their children vaccinated, as it is their belief that it is against the interests of the children.  All the laws that may be made will not force the people to have their children vaccinated.  I could quote various medical and lay opinions to show that vaccination is not at all a preventative of disease.  We need not go to England for them, but can come nearer home to the late Dr. Russell of Dublin, who, in a series of articles, gave it as his considered opinion that vaccination had not proved a success, even in this country.  As I pointed out, this debate will give rise to controversy on the medical side, but I ask the Minister to accept this Bill.  It is not an anti-vaccination Bill, as parents in favour of vaccination can have their children vaccinated.  It is not right, however, to <Col N="109" /> impose it on those who conscientiously believe that vaccination is injurious to the health of their children.  It is in order to give these people the right that wealthy people have at the present time that the Bill is introduced.  I have had personal experience that when wealthy people can produce medical certificates to prove that it is injurious to the health of their children to have them vaccinated, the matter rests there, while the poor person is prosecuted, as he has no fee with which to bring in a medical man to state that it would be against the health of his children to have them vaccinated.</P>

      <P>There have been more deaths from measles and diphtheria in England than from smallpox. If there are 20,000 in Wexford unvaccinated and over 5,000 in Wicklow, is the Minister for Local Government going to enforce vaccination through the Boards of Public Health?  I tell him that he will not, that he will fail.  I believe that if the Minister can prove to the people that vaccination is a preventative, he should leave it to <Col N="111" /> them voluntarily, as they are the best judges of what is best for their children. As far as I know the parents of Ireland, they are prepared to make every sacrifice, and to stint themselves in every way, for the betterment of their families.  Surely if it could be proved that vaccination is a preventative they would not take up the policy that is adopted at present, of not having their children vaccinated. Statistics can and will be given, and I know that Deputy Sir Séamus Craig is anxiously waiting to get up and dispute everything I have said on behalf of the medical profession.  I would like to ask him how can he account for the fact that the late Dr. Russell, of Dublin, changed his opinion from being a whole-hogger in favour of vaccination to that expressed in the series of articles which have been published?</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to accept this Bill.  Its acceptance will mean that some right is being given to private members.  Otherwise the theory will go out that unless you are a whole-hogger supporter of the Government, or that you sit on the Government Benches, that there is no possibility or chance of a Private Members' Bill being passed by the House.  It was only during the last year that the Medical Department of the Local Government Department attempted to enforce this particular Act in the Saorstát. There are Ministers sitting on the Government Front Benches who, in 1919, sent out circulars in connection with this vaccination question.  At that time the present Minister for Local Government was on the military side, but the President and some of the other Ministers sent circulars out&mdash;I received some of them myself&mdash;telling us not to obey this particular law amongst many other laws that we were not to <Col N="112" /> obey at that time.  These circulars contained a decree of the Dáil at that time repealing the compulsory vaccination clause, giving us the right to make a conscientious objection, telling us not to go into the British courts, and not to recognise the orders made at that time by public bodies in connection with that matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. EVERETT Mr. EVERETT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EVERETT</NameTxt>
      <P>We admit that.  There are a great many people who have changed from the decisions they gave out at that particular time and in the opinions that they hold to-day compared to what they held then.  The circular was sent out.  The President was Minister for Local Government at the time.  There was some instruction given that we were not to enforce that particular Act, especially when we got control of the public boards.  I think that was in 1919.  The Minister can find out whether that is correct from the minutes sent up by public bodies at the time.  I have a distinct recollection of the matter.  I was in a position to receive those circulars at the time, and that was the instruction given to public boards.  The people have a conscientious objection to vaccination, and their opinions in 1927 were the same as they were in 1919.  The Minister may try to enforce the Act, but he will not get the people to obey the law.  We have certain men in Wicklow offering to go to jail rather than comply with the Act.  Some of them have been fined, men in receipt of home help, but they will go to jail rather than have their children vaccinated.  If I have any say in the matter, and if I am at liberty in June, you will have men going up for the elections signing forms stating that they will not be prepared to obey this particular order of the Local Government Department.  Rather than do so, they will be ready to be fined and go to jail if necessary.  They will refuse to <Col N="113" /> remain on public bodies if this Act is going to be enforced.  On certain matters there is a good deal of talk here from time to time about England.  In this Bill I am only asking for the people of the Saorstát that they should have the same rights and privileges as regards the Vaccination Act as they have in the British Empire.</P>

From a limited experience of nine years practising in rural Ireland, most of it in the dispensary service, I must say that I never saw a case where a child suffered from the effects of vaccination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'DOWD</NameTxt>
      <P>The condition of things in Wexford will, I dare say, be mentioned by more Deputies than Deputy Everett.  I would ask Deputies to remember that the reason we have no smallpox in Ireland to-day&mdash;the great reason&mdash;is because of the success of the compulsory Vaccination Act. That is the fact.  It is because vaccination was compulsory in Ireland, and because the children here were vaccinated, that we have no smallpox.  In England, where the conscience clause, such as we are asked to accept now, is in force, you have sporadic outbreaks of smallpox and sometimes very large outbreaks.  If statistics are looked up it will be found that smallpox is practically always, in these epidemics, confined to the unvaccinated, and where the vaccinated do happen to contract smallpox they get it in a mild and limited form.  But the people who contract the bad form of smallpox which leads to death are the unvaccinated. These are figures that I am sure can be got from the vaccine section under the Department of Local Government by anyone interested in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not and should not be a matter of conscience; it should be a matter of what is right or what is wrong.  If it is right in the interests of the public health to enforce vaccination it should be enforced and should not be a matter of conscience.  Deputy Everett spoke of delicate children.  The fact is that no delicate child has to be <Col N="114" /> vaccinated until it is in a fit condition for vaccination.  I am certain that if a child is suffering say from skin disease, or is debilitated and is brought to a dispensary doctor, it is not vaccinated. The vaccination is postponed until the child is in a fit condition for it.  As to whether it is right to vaccinate or not, it may be claimed that vaccination is not a preventive of smallpox.  In the Great War there were over 8,000,000 men in the British military forces.  Every man, no matter what his rank, was vaccinated and was also inoculated against typhoid fever. During that war, when men were assembled in such numbers under active service conditions, smallpox was unknown because of the success of vaccination as a preventive, and in the same way typhoid fever was unknown.</P>
    <P>In the Boer War, Great Britain lost more men in smallpox and typhoid fever than they did from bullet wounds, and you will realise the importance of vaccination from the fact that in the European War where men were engaged in millions instead of thousands smallpox and typhoid fever were unknown. In considering whether it is right to vaccinate or not it would be well for the House to know a few points.  Smallpox virus is the most deadly known to medical science.  It can strike at a distance of one mile.  It was a regulation in the old British Local Government Department, and in the present Department, that a smallpox hospital must be placed at a distance of half a mile from a town with a population of 500 inhabitants.  These two simple facts go to show that the virus of smallpox is so deadly that elaborate precautions must be taken. Deputy Everett mentioned the fact that a rich man by getting a certificate need not have his child vaccinated.  I do not think I need say anything about that, except that the poor man has got as much protection for he can always take his child to the nearest dispensary and the child will not be vaccinated if it is unfit.</P>
    <P>It has been said of medical men&mdash;I hope it will not be said here&mdash;that they want to retain vaccination for the great fees they get out of it.  They get the substantial fee of 2/- for every child they vaccinate.  They have to sterilise <Col N="115" /> the instruments, keep the child about fifteen minutes in their house, put on a pad, enter up the name in a book, at the end of every quarter write up about ten books and consult ten more books, and send returns to the Local Government Department, the County Board of Health, and the rest of it.  They have about one-eighth of a penny for every word they write.  I submit that Deputy Everett has not made a case for the conscience clause.  It is better either to have vaccination or have no vaccination. The matter of conscience should not be in it.  It is a matter of right or wrong, and whether it is in the interests of public health that we should insist on vaccination or not.  I submit that in the interests of public health it is our duty to insist on doing what is for the good of the community.  The parent may have a reluctance to see his child scraped by the cruel doctor, and all that, but that is over-rated.  When the operation is properly done, as I am sure it is by all dispensary medical men in the country, the so-called pain and torture caused are nil, and the after-effects when the operation is done under aseptic conditions are negligible.  No case, I submit, has been made for the introduction of this conscience clause, and, therefore, I oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrVincentJWhite" hpid="Dr. WHITE Dr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Dr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much I was not present when Deputy Everett was making his case against vaccination for smallpox, but with all due respect to the Deputy, I would ask him where has he got his laboratory, where has he got his test tubes, and on what part of the Wicklow hills does he carry out his experiments as regards the efficiency of vaccination for smallpox? I do not know whether Deputy Everett denies that vaccination is a specific against smallpox, or whether he makes his case only against compulsion.  A few words as to the efficiency of vaccination may not be out of place.  I doubt very much if you will find six medical men in the whole of Ireland who will deny that vaccination is an absolute specific against smallpox.  In countries like Germany, which abuts on the western frontiers of Russia, smallpox was an absolute plague some years ago.  The German Government dealt <Col N="116" /> very drastically and rapidly with the recurrent epidemics there.  They isolated the cases of smallpox in tents, and they vaccinated or re-vaccinated all doctors and nurses who came in contact with the afflicted people.  In a very short time the eastern frontiers of Germany, and Germany itself, were absolutely free of smallpox.  I could quote other cases ad infinitum to prove that vaccination is a specific against smallpox.</P>
      <P>As regards compulsion, every one of us every day has to bear with compulsion. Here in this Dáil we are under the thumb of the Ceann Comhairle, and if we do not obey him we are called to order very quickly.  A point I want to bring out, with all respect, is that when it comes to legal problems the man in the street, and I am one of them, has to look to legal men for light.  I recollect on former occasions where legal light was required to be thrown on certain matters I found I was a bit muddled when the legal gentleman discussed the subjects.  I think when we come to a medical subject or any special subject with which people are accustomed to deal and that call for special study that the people who follow those subjects are best qualified to give an opinion on them.  In this case I cannot see how the man in the street can acquire the special scientific knowledge that is necessary to pass an unprejudiced opinion on a vitally important matter like vaccination. I came in towards the end of Deputy Everett's speech and I heard him make reference to the sufferings of the child when he is being vaccinated.  Well, vaccination is a very trivial operation, and when properly performed causes little or no pain to the child.  In fact when I am vaccinating very often the children smile at me.  I want to state very definitely that we have our Sandymount Institute here, and the lymph that is used in vaccinating the children of this country is physiologically pure in every respect, and before it goes down the country it undergoes numerous tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore nobody can have any objection or raise any objection and say that the lymph is impure.  It is statutory that infants should get vaccinated within three <Col N="117" /> months of their birth because if they are not vaccinated and an outbreak of smallpox takes place they die very rapidly, much more rapidly than adults. I listened only to the end of Deputy Everett's speech.  I was not present all the time he was making his case, but from all that I heard I submit that he has not convinced me at any rate to vote for his Bill and I am open to conviction about this matter.  I am thinking of what would happen here if several cases of smallpox were to break out.  I do not want to create a scare, but it is an ever present danger.  We must recollect that for the last couple of years you have had an epidemic of smallpox along the western seaboard of England.  You have boats coming constantly to Dublin, Waterford and other ports.  I think on recollecting the terrible havoc that smallpox used wreak on the population of Ireland in years gone by, every safeguard should be adopted against this disease.  I would suggest with respect that special instructions be issued by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to get the Port Authorities to tighten up the regulations that govern the examination of vessels as regards the health of their crews when they come into our ports.  Anyone who looks at this matter from a detached point of view must admit when he recollects, or when he throws his mind back to seventy years ago and pictures to himself the terrible havoc, disfigurements and death caused by smallpox in those days, that he will not have an instant's hesitation in saying that there should be any question of compulsion, that such a clause is not necessary at all, and that it should be compulsory on everyone in the Saorstát to be vaccinated, and, if necessary, re-vaccinated again seven years after his latest vaccination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a great responsibility as a medical man in trying to prevent such a terrible disaster as may possibly arise and destroy young children in the Saorstát.  I have no great sympathy with Deputy Everett.  He knows what he is about. If, when he is going to run the risk of getting smallpox, he gets smallpox he can do so.  But I am seeking to do something to safeguard young children who <Col N="118" /> are not able to study these matters, and who will be the people who will take the smallpox if an epidemic occurs. They will be the people who will die from it.  I have no knowledge of Doctor Russell, who has been quoted here, but I do know about Professor Trousseau, one of the greatest of French physicians, and he says on this matter of inoculation against smallpox:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The discovery must remain unchallenged as one of the greatest benefits conferred by medicine on humanity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He proceeds to analyse the report of an epidemic in 1853 in a small town with a population of 2,600, and he says that no cases of smallpox occurred in vaccinated subjects under twelve years of age.  The longer the interval since the primary vaccination the greater was the severity of the disease when it did occur, but it was ascertained that in general the disease was essentially milder in those who were vaccinated as young children, and that the duration was less than half its usual duration. There had been no fatal cases amongst patients vaccinated.  Ten deaths occurred among the unvaccinated.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the figures given here already.  In 1926, in England and Wales, there were 10,141 cases of smallpox. In those who were vaccinated not a single case occurred in children under twelve years of age.  There were only eight cases between twelve and fifteen years.  Of those unvaccinated at that same period from childhood to fifteen years of age there were no less than 4,640 cases of smallpox.  If you allow those figures to sink in I do not think there is any need for anyone to go further in seeing what the effect of vaccination is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again particularly allude to the fact that children are safe if vaccination takes place.  The reason why the conscience clause is in the English Act depends upon a particular cause.  The medical profession was not properly represented to press the case.  In the second place, there was an idea gone forth that if the people were allowed to avail of this conscience clause that other people would allow vaccination to take place without any objection whatever. <Col N="119" /> There is no doubt that the conscience clause is responsible for the large epidemic at the present time in England; there were 15,000 cases last year.  Deputy Everett referred to the cost of the enforcement of the Act. Let me for a moment ask what the cost of the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic is amounting to?  If the authorities in Wexford knew that they had a preventive for foot-and-mouth disease would they reject it?  Again, I am pleased that there has been no smallpox in Wexford, but there is no doubt about it they are living on the edge of a volcano.  We have had 15,000 cases of smallpox in England last year.  A man or woman who is infected with smallpox has eleven days in which he can travel where he likes.  He has no symptoms of the illness.  Then he is ill for two or three days, at the end of which the rash comes out.  What happens to him after the rash comes out? He gets up and thinks he is getting better, and he is then scattering the disease far and wide.  Reference has been made to the question of measles. No sanitation is going to check either the outbreaks of measles or smallpox. They are air-borne diseases, and no good can be effected as far as sanitation itself is concerned.  Sanitation has dispelled enteric fever.  It has, to a large extent, reduced diphtheria, but sanitation will not do the same thing for these two diseases.  It was stated here this evening that if the Department of Local Government and Public Health would only turn its attention to sanitation there would be no necessity for vaccination.  I am surprised to find these statements coming from Deputies from Wexford, who, I understand, are the only people who have refused, up to the present, to consider the question of the appointment of a county medical officer of health.  I hope I am wrong.</P>

      <P>If I am wrong, then I apologise and withdraw.  I say it is an extraordinary thing to find Deputies from Wexford saying: &ldquo;We want to effect better sanitation, and that will do away with smallpox,&rdquo; and <Col N="120" /> then they refuse to do what sensible people know is necessary in order to effect proper sanitation in the county. I have said so much about sanitation, and Deputy O'Dowd has alluded to another point, that certain other diseases have yielded extraordinarily well to inoculation.  I refer to tetanus. Formerly tetanus was regarded as almost incurable.  If a man got a fall where there was any farmyard manure, he was almost certain to get his wound infected with tetanus.  Now, when a man gets wounded, as in the Great War, we give him an inoculation immediately, and no tetanus occurs.  The effect of vaccination is no greater and no less in the case of smallpox than in the case of tetanus.  I admit that the immunity dies out after a certain time, but I have shown that there is immunity probably up to twelve years of age.  If medical men had the power you would have re-vaccination at puberty and at 30 years of age.  I have been re-vaccinated. Each time I was brought in contact with smallpox I was vaccinated. I would have been a criminal if I had not been vaccinated.</P>
      <P>Let me now refer to a statement that was broadcast that syphilis and tuberculosis are given to children through lymph.  In former days when children were vaccinated from arm to arm, there was a possibility that syphilis might have been inoculated into the child. But calves are not subject to syphilis, and as far as syphilis is concerned there is no risk in using calves' lymph.  It must be remembered that these calves are tested with tuberculin before being used.  If they show the slightest sign of disease the calves are destroyed and not used.  Calves are inoculated; then the serum is taken from them and glycerine is added.  Glycerine does not destroy the virus of vaccination, but it destroys all the subjects that produce suppuration. If you scratch your hand and expose it to the air, pus will form.  The organisms that might be present in lymph that would cause that are destroyed by glycerine, and, therefore, glycerine is used in connection with calves' lymph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vaccination is a very important thing, and I would like to be loyal to my own profession.  I must say that if any disease occurs it must be attri- <Col N="121" /> buted usually to want of care and cleanliness in the method of vaccination.  I vaccinated 25 children a couple of months ago in a poor school.  Those children were not laid up for an hour.  They never complained in the slightest degree while I was vaccinating them, nor were they laid up.  They did not show any signs of illness.  I have vaccinated hundreds of children in my day and I can conscientiously say that I never saw a child suffer any aftereffects from the vaccination.  I say that quite deliberately.</P>
    <P>As far as this conscience clause is concerned, it is dishonest, because it means that people who have no knowledge of the matter are going to sign a paper that the vaccination will injure the health of their children.  They cannot give an honest certificate of that kind.  The people who have no knowledge cannot do so, and I say quite definitely that such a thing would be dishonest. I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that if a child is delicate it should not be vaccinated until it gets stronger. The younger a child is vaccinated the less it feels the vaccination.</P>
    <P>There are cranks; there are always cranks.  In connection with every discovery we have had people out against it.  They were, perhaps, out more against the Listerism that has revolutionised surgery and that has made surgery capable of investigating all parts of the body.  They were against it when Lister was preaching his doctrine of cleanliness in surgery.</P>
    <P>If you are going to give a conscience clause of this kind to people in regard to vaccination, why not give it to your milkman?  Milkmen are known occasionally to water milk.  Why not give them a conscience clause to water milk? Occasionally children get indigestion from using milk without being watered, and it is necessary to water it.  Why not let the milkman water it as he likes?  Why not give a conscience clause to the publican to add a little more water to the whiskey, because he knows that people are sometimes laid up from drinking whiskey?  I believe the subjects are on the same footing. Here is an example more to the point about the elasticity of a man's conscience. <Col N="122" /> There was a Scotchman at a ferry, and the charge for crossing was 2d.  A poor traveller arrived on a Sunday morning and when he brought out the ferryman he said, &ldquo;I want you to take me across.&rdquo;&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the ferryman, &ldquo;but I could not conscientiously break the Sabbath under a half-crown.&rdquo;  That is one type of elasticity of conscience.</P>
    <P>I agree with what was said by another Deputy, that it is neither a hardship nor a punishment.  These are the two words that Deputy Everett used.  There is neither hardship nor punishment inflicted on young children when they are vaccinated.  We are willing and ready to do this in order that prevention of the disease may take place.  I am not a bit surprised that 15 doctors could not agree whether a man died from vaccination or smallpox; I think it is quite possible, and I do not contradict the Deputy who said that.  We do not know any preventative for measles as we do for smallpox. Measles is an air-borne disease and is extremely prevalent.  It is impossible to segregate cases or prevent people getting it.  A measly child has a lot of days to run about and infect everybody with whom it comes in contact before it is detected.</P>
    <P>I would prefer Deputy Everett to bring forward a Bill to deal with the Vaccination Acts and to have done with it.  This conscience clause is not honest, and it is this clause in the English Act that has brought about a large epidemic of smallpox.  Why should we not have cases of smallpox?  I had a case of bubonic plague in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  The man came on a steamer from Madrid.  Then we had several cases of dysentery.  There you have cases of plague and dysentery brought to our port.  Why would it not be possible for some people suffering from smallpox, who do not know they are affected, to land here and infect members of our population?  I trust the Second Reading of this Bill will not pass.  I am sorry to disagree with Deputy Everett; he is always a very nice, pleasant companion, but I would have liked to see him showing a little common sense in not bringing forward a motion of this kind.</P>

      <P>I am not going to say very much on the subject.  It has never affected me personally.  None of my children has been vaccinated, and I do not think that they are likely to be.  I have been vaccinated twice myself, and whether it did me any good or not I do not know.  I have been seeking light on the subject, and I consulted a number of doctors in the last few weeks, and my experience has been that in regard to this question of vaccination, like many other things, doctors differ.  I have been receiving&mdash; and I suppose others have been receiving them too&mdash;innumerable circulars from some anti-vaccination societies, and they have quoted doctors, presumably doctors of repute and doctors with innumerable lists of degrees signified by initials after their names, as authorities against vaccination.  I have made up my mind, at any rate, to vote for the Bill.  I do not know what my friends on these Benches will do, but I think they are divided in opinion about it too, even the doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confirmed in my decision to vote for the Bill as I know that in County Wexford during the last twenty years there has been a live agitation against vaccination.  During that time I do not know what the number of children would have been who were not vaccinated, but there must be thousands, at any rate, in that county alone, not to speak of other parts of Ireland where there has not been agitation but where, nevertheless, children are not vaccinated and where there has not been an outbreak.  In my recollection there has been only one outbreak in Dublin, and that was, I think, in the year 1897.  I was a schoolboy then and I was revaccinated as were all the other boys in the school.  That outbreak, according to my recollection, was brought into the city by some sailors, and I think it found its way to only three or four persons. I do not think that the Local Government Department can be very serious about the matter, because, if they were, they would have made more serious efforts in the last four or five years to enforce the Act in places where there were deliberate efforts made by local authorities to put the Act into operation.  Probably the doctors have been pressing them, and they have now <Col N="124" /> awaked to the fact that something must be done.</P>
    <P>In the last year there have been a number of prosecutions in Wexford. Prosecutions will not, I believe, have the effect of putting the Act into operation to any great degree.  I knew the individuals who started the campaign in Wexford twenty years ago.  One of them was a prominent member of the Cumann na nGaedheal and was a leading light in the anti-vaccination movement.  These people preached that gospel and it has taken root in the county.  I do not believe that if the fathers and mothers of children were imprisoned for not having them vaccinated it would have much effect, so firmly has that gospel taken root and entered into the minds of the people there.  I do not doubt Deputy Craig's figures, and whatever smallpox there may be in England there is none here.  That may be due to the fact that vaccination has been the rule here since the Acts have been passed.  Seeing that there is no smallpox here and that that disease has been for all practical purposes wiped out, I do not see why we should not give the liberty of the conscience clause to those who demand it for conscientious reasons.  Those who wish to have their children vaccinated can do so.  Those who have seen, as I have, cases where infants suffered great pain and hardship as a result of vaccination should be allowed in the case of their own families, if they so desire, not to have their children vaccinated.  If they care to take the risk of contracting smallpox it is up to them.  I for one, and I think a number of the Party on these benches, will give hearty support to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for vaccination has been very clearly put by the medical Deputies on every side of the House and, as a layman, I agree entirely with what they said from my own experience of epidemics both at home and abroad.  Deputy O'Kelly alluded to an epidemic in Dublin in the year 1897.  I remember an epidemic in the years 1878 and 1879 in Dublin. That was as bad an epidemic as ever occurred in any place.  There were some streets in which it was so bad that people were kept from going down <Col N="125" /> them.  To the best of my belief, however, the mortality was not at all great. At that time I think vaccination was carried out much more strictly than it is now.  Personally, I came in contact with a great many cases of people who contracted smallpox.  I did not develop it myself, an escape which I owe to vaccination.  Comparatively few people died from it because the Vaccination Order was carried out with extreme strictness.  I have also been in India, and I have seen the effect of smallpox there.  Deputy Everett mentioned that 391 people died in India as a result of vaccination.  He did not say when that occurred.  India is a pretty big place, and the methods of treatment there were different to what they would be in this country, at least in my time.  There would be greater difficulties there in administering the Act and in carrying out vaccination than there would be in other countries.  From my experience no place would give one a stronger desire to see vaccination carried out than India.  There you see people going about heavily marked with small pox.  The kind of smallpox that used to be there was a kind that had terrible lasting effects on people even when they recovered.  I have seen one or two cases of people whose appearance became very unsightly, to put it in parliamentary language.  All that, in my opinion, would have been avoided if vaccination had taken place. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I desire to call the attention of the House to the failure or, if you like, the inaction of the Department of Industry and Commerce to intervene in a dispute which may eventuate in a lock-out of a number of Cork Corporation workmen as the result of proposals for a reduction in their wages by the City Commissioner. I do not propose at this stage to go into the merits of the dispute.  My purpose is to find out what are the powers and functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce in matters of this kind.  Hitherto it has been customary for that Department, when acquainted <Col N="126" /> with disputes, pending or in existence, to endeavour to reconcile the differences between the employer and the employees.  It has also been customary for trade unions to notify the Department of disputes pending or in existence. In accordance with the customary practice which, as I have said, hitherto obtained, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union communicated with Mr. Ferguson, the very courteous and able Secretary of the Department, in the following terms:</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>A demand has been served by Commissioner Monahan for a drastic reduction in wages on our members employed on Corporation work in Cork City.  A conference took place last Thursday between our Cork officials and Mr. Monahan, but no agreement was reached.  Seeing that the workers concerned yielded to a cut of 4/6 per week in 1925, and to a further cut of 2/- in 1926, the present demand for a general reduction of 6/- is regarded with the keenest indignation, and if it is imposed a stoppage of work will be inevitable.</P>
      <P>That letter was dated 16th April.  Today the following communication was received from the Department of Industry and Commerce:</P>
      <P>I have your note of the 16th inst., on the subject of the threatened dispute in Cork City as a result of proposals made by the City Commissioner for a reduction in the wages of Corporation workers.  You can understand that this Department is not free to take action along the lines generally followed in ordinary industrial disputes owing to the fact that another Government Department, the Department of Local Government, has certain responsibilities in this matter.  Any communication on the subject of the intervention on the part of this Department would have to be addressed by you in the first instance to the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P Just="Right">(Signed) R. C. Ferguson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government Department, in answer to communications, state that they have no responsibility in the matter and they cannot intervene.  In view of the fact that Cork City is faced with <Col N="127" /> a stoppage of public work without any attempts on the part of the Ministry&mdash; attempts, as I have already pointed out, which have been usual up to this&mdash;to intervene in a matter of this kind, I would ask why the usual procedure has not been followed in this matter, namely, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his representative should not intervene as they have been asked to do by the union representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that Deputy Anthony in a few remarks he made has modified somewhat the words he used earlier this evening.  I was rather appalled when I heard him speak of a notice calling attention to the refusal of the Department of Industry and Commerce to intervene in this dispute. To-night he has got a much better phrase.  He called it the &ldquo;failure&rdquo; or the &ldquo;inaction&rdquo; of the Department. He answered it himself to a certain extent by reading the letter which was sent to the Department by the Transport Workers' Union.  It is clear now from that letter that there was no invitation to intervene.  It is just an ordinary intimation to the Department of a dispute which is likely to lead to a stoppage. He has read the answer which was received.  The letter was received on the 17th and the reply was written on the same date.  In addition to that I am not sure whether Deputy Anthony is aware that there was a consultation between the official of the Trades Union who wrote that letter to my Department and one of my Departmental officials.  How far Deputy Anthony is aware of that and how far I am at liberty to speak of it I do not know. If I were to go into it I would have to give my view of that interview that took place with this representative of the Trades Union.  I think it better not as this might be regarded as giving a wrong view of the attitude he took up at that particular interview.  He was a representative with whom we have always had the best possible relations. However, there was an interview.  I only stress that matter and point to the fact that the matter did not end with the notification that a strike was likely to take place and with the letter from <Col N="129" /> my Department setting out that there were certain difficulties.  The difficulties were gone into at the interview. The letter is not in very definite conflict with what the Department for Local Government would say.</P>
      <P>It is pointed out that the Department for Local Government has a responsibility in the matter.  Deputy Anthony said that the Local Government Department has denied that it has any responsibility in the matter.  I cannot say if they did say that, but I think what they did say was that the Commissioner was clothed with all the powers, judicial rights and responsibilities of the old Corporation and the attitude of the Commissioner was that of an elected Corporation. Even if there was an elected Corporation, my attitude in this matter would have to be the same.  My Department does intervene in industrial disputes. It intervenes at times without any request being made by either party but generally it intervenes only when a request is made.  I have no power to force parties to come together, but generally when a request is put up they come together.  There is the other fact that my Department does not intervene when it is clear that one of the parties is not likely to come into the conference. In this particular instance I feel that it is not an ordinary industrial dispute, and I feel that one of the parties is in the place of a local authority.  I feel that the Department of Local Government to some extent&mdash;I do not like to have to define at this moment what the extent is&mdash;stands between me and one of the parties in the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel that any useful purpose would be served at the moment by any attempt to intervene.  I may say further that there have been attempts made by local people to bring about conciliation, and I have no reason to believe that any attempt on my part would meet with greater success than has, so far, attended, or is likely to attend, the efforts of local people.  The information that I have gives me no indication that there is any basis upon which agreement could be reached.  If Deputy Anthony gives me any indication privately&mdash;I would rather not have the matter discussed openly&mdash;that there is any possibility of agreement between the contestants in the dispute, <Col N="130" /> then, although I still hold that the Local Government Department stands between me and intervention in this case, I will see how far I can go.  I hesitate to go into any dispute where my entry might complicate matters still further and might not ease the situation.  The information I have at present is that intervention would not be of any use.  I want to avoid any discussion as to the merits.  Obviously, if there is a case for intervention, and if I am to intervene later, it is better I should not discuss the merits.</P>

      <P>I was very brief in my remarks in order to give the Minister time to reply.  In view of the fact that there is a conflict between two Departments&mdash;the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Local Government&mdash;will the Minister give me an assurance that he will accede to the request sent him by the representatives of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union?  If he is prepared to accede to the request contained in the communication from the Union that will satisfy me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No request has been made to me yet.  The letter Deputy Anthony refers to contains merely a statement that a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; has been announced.  It is a mere notification that a dispute is likely to take place. The letter states that a demand has been served by Commissioner Monahan for what is described as &ldquo;a drastic reduction in wages.&rdquo;  The letter goes on to say: &ldquo;A conference took place last Thursday between our officials and Mr. Monahan, but no agreement was reached....  The present demand for a general reduction of 6/- is regarded with the keenest indignation and if it is enforced a stoppage of work will be unavoidable.&rdquo; That deals with that point.  As regards the other point, I am not aware that any dispute has arisen between my Department and the Department of Local Government and Public Health with regard to our respective powers in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. ANTHONY Mr. ANTHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he was not responsible. I have on several occasions <Col N="131" /> acted with the Ministry in matters of this kind.  The usual form was gone through of notifying the Department, which was taken as equivalent to a request for intervention.  That has been the custom.  I have acted with the Ministry in Cork in settlements of disputes, and I think the procedure from which some good results have accrued might have been followed on this occasion.  I do not know what the chances of success would be, but I think the usual procedure might have been tried.</P>

That only states that we cannot act, in this particular instance, as freely as we could in the ordinary type of industrial dispute.  There is no refusal.  The Department is ready to intervene at any moment that it thinks intervention is likely to lead to any good result.  But those circumstances do not obtain at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter I should like information upon. It arises out of the Minister's statement. The Minister obviously makes a distinction between this case and what he calls the &ldquo;ordinary dispute.&rdquo;  It is not clear to me why that distinction should be made.  This Commissioner is acting in the name of the old Corporation. Am I to take it that if there was a dispute likely to occur between a local authority and its employees, the Minister would not consider it his duty to intervene in order to obviate that dispute if he thought he could obviate it?  Would he hold the opinion that because the local authority functioned under the Local Government Department he should not intervene?  The distinction is not clear to me, and I do not see any reason why it should be made.  I cannot see the difference between one class of dispute and another. The Minister's object in intervening in these disputes is to act as conciliator. He has no power to force one side or another into the conference.  He tries to bring the parties together and he acts as mediator.  I do not see why he should not use his good offices in a dispute between a local authority and its employees just the same as in a dispute between a private company and its employees.</P>
      <P>There is just another point.  The Minister said that one of the reasons why he did not intervene in this particular case was that he saw no use in offering his good services if one of the parties were not likely to come into the Conference.  Are we to assume that the party in this case not likely to come into the Conference was Commissioner Mr. Monahan?  I take it that is what he meant, because, as I gathered from Deputy Anthony and the correspondence he read, it would appear that the very fact that the Workers' Union notified the Minister did indicate that they would be pleased if he did intervene and that they would be prepared to come into the Conference.  I take it the party not likely to come in is the Commissioner, Mr. Monahan.</P>

      <P>At that moment I was stating that there were cases where we could not intervene.  I did not mean that to have any application to this.  I did not state it with that intent.  As to the question the Deputy asked me, I would not accept it as a general rule that because people were under the control of a local authority, or, to some extent, paid by them, and the local authority did not want my interference, I would not interfere. But obviously the chances of success are prejudiced if, say in the case of a local authority paying road workers, the local authority states: &ldquo;We do not want you.  We think we are quite right.  We do not want intervention.&rdquo; Obviously there would not be a chance of a successful intervention.  But the case I am making generally is, in so far as the Department of Local Government has a certain function&mdash;I am not going into the details of how far their powers go or exist&mdash;in so far as it has a certain authority with regard to local authorities, I have made it my practice always to ask that Department, and to take its advice, before I intervene in anything which has relation to a local authority.  I ask their advice.  I do not say I always take it. I think it is only right that one Government Department should communicate with another in the sphere that particular Department is responsible for. In this case the matter is somewhat complicated.  I want to get back to Deputy Anthony's question.  I have not refused to intervene in this dispute. There have been a few letters to us and one interview.  Those interviews can go on, and there is a possibility that they may result in intervention in the end, but I would not have myself taken as now saying that I see any case for intervention at this moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the position clear with regard to the Department of Local Government.  Deputies on the Labour <Col N="134" /> Benches will remember that recently I had approaches from them with a view to stopping the state of affairs that existed where the Local Government Department prescribed certain rates for certain workers under local bodies urging that the local authorities were the people who controlled local circumstances and that they ought to be allowed to pay the rates they considered were proper for the particular class of work which was being done in accordance with general conditions in their area.  In going into the general circumstances of the case I realised that was reasonable.  As a matter of fact, with a view to making the position from that point of view clearer and in furtherance of the policy of the Department to disentangle as much as possible petty matters in our relations with and control of local bodies I have had the whole question considered, including the position of minor officers under the local bodies.  An Order has been prepared and is practically ready for issue placing the responsibility for conditions and terms of service and pay in respect of the minor officers of local bodies entirely on local bodies themselves. So, as far as I am concerned as Minister for Local Government at the moment, it is my desire that the Department here shall not be rate fixing, shall not attempt to fix the rates of pay for workers or minor officials of local bodies.  In that spirit I would hesitate as Minister for Local Government at the appearance of a dispute over wages between a local body and its workers to interfere until either an application from one side or the other or the development of any particular set of circumstances decided me in favour of intervention.  I know nothing of the Cork dispute, and nothing that would bring me into the situation at this particular moment or which would suggest to me that I ought to approach the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring him into it.  I desire that in so far as the workers and minor officials of local bodies, their rates of pay and conditions of service are concerned they will be, so far as we can possibly arrange, de-centralised in their control from the Department of Local Government and left to the people responsible for local government.</P>

I have already stated that I am asking, not alone on behalf of the people I directly represent, but on behalf of the Cork citizens generally, that the Ministry should intervene at this moment.  It may serve a useful purpose now, and I also suggest that there is no use in waiting for things to develop.  They may not develop in the way the Ministry assumes they will develop. I personally ask that the Ministry should intervene.  I may say I have no authority from the union concerned to ask that, but I ask it as a citizen of Cork.</P>
