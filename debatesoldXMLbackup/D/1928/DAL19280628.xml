      <P>We had a considerable discussion upon this Bill as it passed through its various stages, and now that it has come up for its final consideration we think that before it passes out of our control another effort should be made, in fairness to the people, to state the arguments against the Bill and to try and induce the majority of this House to change their attitude concerning it.  We have been told that our opposition to this Bill is due, in the first place, to our lack of intelligence, and in the second to our laziness in so far as we have not given the matter proper consideration.  No doubt, when the Minister for Defence was exercising his superiority complex and deploring the lack of intelligence manifested on those benches, he thought that he was advancing good and sufficient arguments to override the opposition to the Bill, but there is very little intelligence required, fortunately perhaps, to know that this Bill is one of a very serious nature, and one designed to effect, to a considerable degree, the future course of events in this country.  It is not possible that action of this nature could be taken by an Executive without leaving its effects upon the general attitude of the people towards that Government in particular, and towards the Constitution in general.  We have pointed out that during the history of this Constitution important events happened in this country that are now history, and in relation to every one of these events it was the <Col N="1684" /> stock argument of Government Deputies that the Constitution was a democratic one, that it provided for the exercise of that thing we heard so often repeated, the will of the people, upon matters affecting the people's interests. It does not need intelligence to know that this Bill is designed to take from the people certain rights which they possessed in the past which were considered in the hectic youth of the Government to be necessary for the development of a proper civic spirit amongst our people.  It does not need intelligence to know that the design behind this Bill is to clip the wings of the nation and prevent the nation having a weapon which could be used for the furtherance of the national movement.  It does not need intelligence to know that the introduction and passage of this Bill through the Dáil is only another step in the march of Cumann na nGaedheal, heads up, into the Empire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had many discussions on the various stages of this Bill as to whether or not the interests of democracy are served by providing machinery by which the people can initiate or reject legislation by a majority vote or referendum.  I hope that Deputy Tierney and Deputy O'Sullivan, who were busy yapping about this thing yesterday when Deputy de Valera was speaking, will make themselves heard upon this stage of the Bill.  I trust particularly that Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;I do not see him here now&mdash;will take the opportunity he has now to put in more definite form the various sentiments he was trying to express by way of interruption yesterday.  Deputies on the opposite benches are no doubt anxious to preserve, or they will say they are anxious to preserve, whatever democratic rights the people possess.  Deputy Tierney particularly is no doubt anxious to ensure that democratic government will continue in this country.  He remembers the day, no doubt, when, armed with a rifle and hand grenade, one in each hand, and a bayonet between his lips, he went out to fight for democratic government in Easter Week.  He was not too proud to fight, to do his part on that historic <Col N="1685" /> occasion, and is anxious to preserve the fruits of victory for the Irish people now.  Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;when the end of his days has come when he wraps a Union Jack about his breast and sinks to sleep in the bosom of the Empire, when he is asked the historic question, &ldquo;What did you do in the Great War, daddy?&rdquo; will be able to reply that, having fought the Black and Tans from an armchair in Vaughan's Hotel, and haveing been ejected from the Free State Army on account of his imperialism, he came into the Dáil and voted for this amendment of the Constitution, and secure, like the happy warrior, secure and confident in heaven's applause, he will be able to sink to slumber undisturbed.</P>
    <P>The opposition to this Bill is perhaps crude, is perhaps unintelligent, is perhaps the result of laziness, as the Minister for Agriculture told us, but it comes from the same source, it is derived from the same inspiration as that which sent Deputy Tierney out to fight so valiantly a few years ago for the overthrow of undemocratic government in this country.  Those who gave all their time and their leisure, those who gave all they had to force the events which ultimately led to the establishment of this State are no doubt pleased to see the manner in which this State is developing. The members of Cumann na nGaedheal who were doing all the fighting when members on this side of the House were under the beds&mdash;Deputy Shaw, who, I think, led the van in Mullingar until England took her foot off the stone, and, as he said, the vermin began to crawl out from underneath, and the other Deputies opposite who fought for liberty and freedom when the post-Truee heroes on this side of the House were doing nothing are all going to reap the fruits of their victory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that each debate in the House should stand by itself.  If Deputy Lemass, on the Fifth Stage of this Bill, would confine himself to the Bill he would be doing a service.  The Deputies he has mentioned have not spoken on the Fifth Stage, and I would suggest that he should deal with the arguments against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think it should be clear to the House that implications of this kind are such that they should not be introduced. They do not carry us any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect to your ruling I will confine myself, in the first place, to the arguments advanced in support of the Bill and, in the second place, to the reasons why it should be rejected.  As far as I have been able to discover from the speeches made from the front bench opposite, the arguments in support of the Bill are in the first instance that the sections which it is proposed to delete are undemocratic.  The interests of the Commonwealth of Nations require that this Bill should be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, as I pointed out in the beginning of my remarks, the arguments for the Bill were supplemented by other arguments.  The Minister for <Col N="1687" /> Defence told us that if we were intelligent we would support it also.  The Minister for Agriculture told us that if we were not lazy we would support it.  I have been endeavouring to inform the Minister for Defence that it is not necessary even to have the mass of intelligence which he possesses to be able to see that the effects of this Bill are going to be bad and not what he claims they will be.  The Minister for Defence seems to think that by providing the machinery of the Initiative and the Referendum that the majority of the people could make their will effective occasionally and that that would be helping to bring about a reign of anarchy in this country. Democracy and anarchy have become synonymous in the mind of the Minister for Defence.  He seems to think that if the Referendum and Initiative were retained for the people it would ensure that ultimately anarchy would rule in this country.  Anarchy is another word which has been in constant use for the last three or four years&mdash;anarchy, disorder, disruption and all the rest of it.  I think the Ministers opposite&mdash;the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Agriculture, the President and all the rest of them &mdash;know these words in all their implications. They have used them at every cross roads and every street corner in the country.  It appears there was anarchy in the country in 1922 with all the deplorable consequences which we are now told will flow from the retention of these sections of the Constitution. It existed before this Constitution was enacted; in order to stop that anarchy and to ensure the survival of democratic government in this country this Constitution was enacted.</P>
    <P>This Constitution, the imposition of which on the people terminated the reign of anarchy, provided for the Initiative and Referendum.  It must be undoubtedly a very humiliating experience to the Government to have to come to this House to-day and inform the Deputies that they were very foolish, very young, very inexperienced and very unversed in the ways of government when drafting this Constitution. I would like to have had an <Col N="1688" /> opportunity of looking up the files of the newspapers shortly after this Constitution was enacted when, instead of confessing their youth, inexperience and inability, the Government were trying by word and suggestion to convey to the people the idea that only seven, eight, or nine men could be found capable of being entrusted with the machinery of government, these seven, eight or nine men being, of course, the Executive Council.  They were giving it out then that all the wisdom, all the experience, all the ability, and all the discretion contained within the four shores of Erin were concentrated in the Front Bench opposite, but they have to come now and admit that that was so much leg-pulling, that their estimation of their own ability in those days was over-estimation, that they had to introduce this Bill and pass it, on the plea that it is an indication of their previous indiscretion, of their inability, and inexperience. That must, as I say, be a humiliating experience for them.  They are, however, bearing up well under it. The humiliation does not seem to have affected them very seriously.  They are confident, no doubt, that they are striking a blow for liberty, morality and religion&mdash;perhaps the President will tell me the rest of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had time to memorise it.  I think there are very fine expressions in that.  If I could have memorised it I would have introduced them now, but I hope to do so in some subsequent debate.  I am glad that the Minister has paid attention to the oratory.  It struck me, in the course of this Bill, that the Government, <Col N="1689" /> particularly the Minister for Finance, had given very careful attention to the manner in which the Constitution could be evaded and had thought out exactly how an unscrupulous Executive could impose its will on the people despite the people.  In a speech delivered the other day he gave us a lecture on the various procedures which could be adopted to override the people and to ensure the carrying out of the will of an unscrupulous Executive. If the Minister for Finance had given half the consideration to the enactment of the Constitution and the preservation of the people's rights, which he appears to have given to the manner in which the people's rights could be overridden, it is very likely that this Bill would not now be before the House.  If the Government had embarked upon a policy which is designed to curtail the liberties of the people and to curtail their rights in affecting the course of legislation, it would be well if they placed all their cards on the table at this stage.  We know that they were considering at one time the alteration of the system of election by proportional representation.  Apparently that is not so now.  That is one of the youthful indiscretions which the Government in its old age is prepared to stand over apparently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not possible that the inexperience and inability of the Front Bench in the years 1922 and 1923 may have had much more serious results than the mere introduction of Articles 47 and 48?  A benevolent dictatorship, government by an aristocracy of intellect, no Government at all, the sinking of our national individuality in the glorious traditions of the Commonwealth of Nations, are all alternatives which might suggest themselves to Deputies opposite to the present system of Government.  Now, as I said, the Government has passed the boundary between virile manhood and senile decay and will be able to look back in its dotage to what it did in the hectic days of 1922.  It will be able to see every direction in which it played unsafely.  It is, of course, natural for old age to play for safety every time, and it is natural for the Cumann na nGaedheal Executive in their old age to be anxious to ward off <Col N="1690" /> the danger which they foresee of a resurrection of national feeling amongst the people, and to see that every avenue by which that national feeling could be released to remedy the wreck of the Free State Constitution must be closed up.  Really, however, you are not getting safety.  The dangers you are creating in your senility are just as serious as the dangers which you faced in your youth.  If you get a steam engine, fill it with water, light a fire under it, and close up every avenue in which the steam could escape, something will happen.  The water will turn into steam, the pressure of the steam on the boiler will continue to increase, and, if you keep the fire under the boiler replenished with fuel, there is bound to be an explosion.  If you attempt, as you are attempting by this Bill, to close up the avenues by which the steam of national feeling can find a vent you are risking an explosion.  That is not a threat.  Deputy Tierney seems to think that it is my function in this House to act as a sort of Greek chorus and point out the terrible consequences likely to flow from every act of the Executive.</P>
    <P>I am not threatening when I say that Bills of this kind are likely to result in explosions.  I am drawing lessons from history, lessons from the history of our own country, namely, that whenever national feeling was forcibly suppressed, when the dominant party kept its foot on the safety valve and attempted to hold the sentiments of the people within too narrow a boundary, an explosion always resulted.  Sometimes it did damage and sometimes it did not.  The question which we have to ask ourselves is: &ldquo;Can we risk creating a situation in which an explosion may be caused?&rdquo;  We hope, of course, that the evils which this Government are doing will not live after them, because they undoubtedly will be replaced by a more scrupulous or unscrupulous Executive&mdash;I do not know which, because the words have lost their meaning&mdash;an Executive that will have a keener regard for the people's interests and a keener realisation of the facts of the situation.  It is possible that our attitude on this Bill is due to the fact, as the Minister for Agriculture politely informed us, that <Col N="1691" /> we were so lazy we did not consider it in all its implications.  We have had plenty of time to consider it, and if it were possible that that time has not been sufficient, that we were so lazy that on the Fifth Stage of this Bill we could not find an opportunity of learning the truth about it, is it not in the interests of the country to postpone the Bill so that Deputies on this side of the House, who are much lazier than those on the other side, will have time to make up their minds and ascertain the facts?  Will it not be in the interests of the Government to postpone the Bill for a month or two if, as a result of that postponement, it will be unanimously passed by the House?  If our position is due to our laziness, the Government has an opportunity by pandering to that laziness of making a diplomatic stroke and taking a great statesmanlike, step by securing the unanimous consent of the Dáil to the Bill.  I became convinced, as the debate on the Bill progressed and as the different speakers rose, that every one of them knew that it was a bad case, that every one of them knew that it would take a lot of explaining to the people to show why these rights should be taken from them, but, as I think Deputy Boland has said, they were being driven hard.  It was necessary that the step should be taken.  It is necessary that our allies in England should be reassured concerning the situation here.  It is necessary that we should be able to show that we have taken every precaution and blocked every channel by which even a revival of national feelings might come, by a Bill which is forced through the House by the Government majority.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to re-state the arguments against the Bill.  There is no reason whatever why power should be taken from the people in the first place, in certain conditions and conditions of considerable difficulty, to give or withhold their consent from the enactments of this House.  Article 47 of the Constitution provides a check.  It is not a very effective check.  It is not an immediate check upon the work done by this Assembly.  As one with some experience in the matter, an experience <Col N="1692" /> which no Deputy on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches has had, I can assure the Government that the collection of 85,000 signatures of voters on the register is not such an easy task.  It is not an easy task to get 85,000 signatures, over which you can stand, appended to a petition and to have that petition prepared in a manner so as to remove any doubts about its validity. It is not such an easy task to get an organisation in the country that would ensure that the signatures will be taken and brought before a Peace Commissioner and vouched for on oath before him.  No matter what the President may say about only one-twentieth of the voters on the Register being required to ensure that a Bill will be sent to the people on Referendum, after it has been suspended in the Dáil, I am convinced that only in respect of a Bill on which national feeling has been thoroughly aroused would it be possible to do it at all.  It would not be possible to have a Referendum every year or two years.  There is no Party in this country who would be able to keep in existence the organisation that would be required to have it done.  There is no Party in the country who would be able to get these 85,000 signatures on a Bill which was not of vital national interest.</P>
    <P>The check, therefore, which is provided by Article 47 is, as I say, a check which can only be exercised in days of national crisis.  It can only be exercised under circumstances in which popular feeling is thoroughly aroused and to say that the abolition of Article 47 is necessary to prevent frivolous obstruction of Government business is mere nonsense.  I defy Cumann na nGaedheal to get 85,000 signatures of voters on the register in support of this Bill.  If they believe it can be done easily, if they believe that a small section of the people could as a result of this Article seriously interfere with the work of the Dáil, let them put it to a practical test, let them get the attitude of the country and see if they can get 85,000 signatures over which they can stand, of people who are prepared to support this Bill.  They got more than 85,000 votes at the last election and surely if these people have not deserted them altogether owing to their recent <Col N="1693" /> action they will be able to get one-fifth of the number who voted for them at the elections.  Let them try it.  I do not think they will.  The same remarks apply to Article 48.  It was with some difficulty that the petitions which were presented here were prepared.  It is not fair to assert that that Article, any more than Article 47, can be used for unnecessary matters.  The Article provides that 50,000 voters on the register must petition before a Bill can be initiated.  Let Cumann na nGaedheal try to get 50,000 voters on the register to express their approval of any of these Bills and see how difficult it will be.  Then they will begin to realise that all their arguments in respect of these Articles of the Constitution fall to the ground.  They will begin to realise that only in respect of measures which, as I say, arouse popular feeling to a very great extent, only in respect of measures which are of vital importance to the country, can these Articles be brought into operation and you have it provided that in exceptional circumstances and in respect of matters which do affect seriously the lives of the people some check will be exercised on the actions of this House, on the actions of the majority of the House.</P>
    <P>If this House fails to take steps in respect of some important matter, Article 48 gives the people machinery by which they can themselves take steps to ensure that the matter would be brought to a head.  If the House, or a majority of the House, introduces legislation designed to alter either the political or the economic conditions of the country in a very vital particular, Article 47 does provide machinery by which the people can express their approval or disapproval of that legislation, and, mind you, that approval or disapproval cannot be expressed except in respect of a Bill which has received the votes of a majority Party here.  To pretend that the powers given by the Article can be exercised for frivolous purposes is sheer nonsense.  The Bill must be passed here; it must not be a Money Bill.  It must not be a Bill necessary for the immediate preservation of public peace and safety.  It must be a Bill of sufficient importance that, having got the vote of a majority <Col N="1694" /> here, it will be possible for 85,000 voters on the Register to sign a petition in order that an expression of their opinion may be given concerning it.  The machinery provided by these Articles is very stiff.  It will take a lot of energy to make it move.  It is not machinery that is likely to run away of its own accord, like an old Ford car.  It would require the driving force of popular indignation or popular desire to make it move at all.  I cannot see that the Government's case in respect of the Bill has any substance in it.  It is so obviously devoid of substance that we are forced, unwillingly perhaps, to the conclusion that there is some motive behind its introduction which has not been revealed to this House.  It is perhaps too much to hope that even at the Fifth Stage that motive will be revealed.  Perhaps Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;I notice he is here now&mdash; will give to the House the words of wisdom which he was ejecting in short sentences yesterday when Deputy de Valera was speaking.  He is a man of considerable experience in any case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>We were the subject of it.  Perhaps on some other occasion I shall be able to reveal to the House exactly how the benevolence of the dictatorship was manifested to us.  Deputy O'Sullivan will, I hope, not let this Fifth Stage pass without saying something concerning it.  After all, a man of his eminence and experience is not going merely to give a silent vote on an important measure of this kind. We can understand other Deputies on <Col N="1695" /> the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, machined as they are into a unit, walking into the Lobby and casting a vote in respect of this Bill unreasoningly, without giving any indication as to the motives which actuated them, without any word of explanation.  Surely Deputy O'Sullivan is not that kind? Surely he must have thought the matter out in the secrecy and silence of the night and arrived at some reason, some argument, which convinced him that it was necessary that this Bill should be passed?  As I said, he yapped considerably when Deputy de Valera was speaking but in a manner that did not give the House an opportunity of catching the gems of wisdom that were falling from his lips. I hope that when I have concluded, and he will have a clear field to himself, he will stand up and expound at length the wisdom which is in him, if any.</P>
      <P>This Bill, of course, is of a nature which is not likely to come frequently before the House.  It is not often that Constitutional Bills are introduced.  Of course, we have had a burst of them in the last two or three weeks, and the time may come again when there will be another sheaf presented to eliminate or alter various other Articles.  Those who have the benefit of legal training and of vast experience will I hope seek to educate their less enlightened colleagues when such Bills are introduced. Deputy O'Sullivan knows probably better than any of us that there are circumstances under which the people cannot be trusted to think for themselves; he knows that it is occasionally better to drive them than to lead them.</P>

      <P>If the doctrine of the flock of sheep is confined to this side of the House, we will be very anxious to get an explanation of this Bill.  As a matter of fact, I was of the opinion that the Government had been frightened by the words of wisdom which appeared in a certain leading article of the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; and realised the amazing vista of lawlessness and irregularity which was opened up by the prospect of Articles 47 and 48 being brought into operation, and had decided that, like a flock of sheep, the people had to be herded into another pen, because it had been revealed that there were certain portions of the railings of the existing pens which were weak and which might possibly collapse, with the result that the sheep might escape from the benevolent and guiding care of Deputy O'Sullivan and his colleagues.  Heads up into the Empire, Deputy O'Sullivan, we have got to go; we are on the march at last; you have to lead the van, carrying the flag that braved a thousand years the battle and the breeze; you have got to justify the faith that is in you; you have to tell your unfortunate troops that you are leading them to the promised land of the Commonwealth of Nations.  If we are going to throw away the weapons which we were once told would enable us to achieve the freedom which we hope for, the freedom to achieve freedom, at any rate, surely there must be some reason for it.  Surely Deputy O'Sullivan, the man who, as I said, fought the Black and Tans with vigour from an armchair in Vaughan's Hotel, is not going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope this House will take this last opportunity of rejecting the Bill.  I hope they will realise that, instead of avoiding danger which they see, they are really creating the danger, bringing the danger much nearer.  I hope they will realise that it is not by curtailing the rights of the people the stability of the State can be secured, that if they want the State to survive they have to base it upon the freely-expressed will of the people; that if <Col N="1697" /> they want this order of things to exist, it can only exist as long as the Irish people are prepared to tolerate it, and if they are going to take from the people the weapons provided by this Constitution for the alteration of the existing status, the people will on some future occasion find other weapons for achieving the same purpose.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to disappoint Deputy Lemass in anticipating my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, but I have been anxious to intervene in this debate.  On the Second Reading Deputy Aiken was so busy pointing out the failure of Ministers to answer that he gave me no opportunity of getting in.</P>

      <P>They can.  I take it this is, in a sense, a continuation of last night's debate and that it will not be out of order to refer to certain statements made last night.  There was a statement made by Deputy O'Connell that I do not think was entirely understood by the Dáil.  He referred to a resolution of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and I think Deputy Tierney and other Deputies were under the impression that that was a resolution passed by the Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell pointed out that it is not a resolution passed by the Union, but a resolution on the agenda to be discussed in August of this year.  We all know that resolutions appear on Order Papers but never become anything more than resolutions on Order Papers, and that there are some here.  In view of the fact that the vast majority of the countries composing the Inter-Parliamentary Union have not got the Initiative and the Referendum, and have taken no steps to get either of them inserted in their Constitutions, it is very probable that the resolution will be defeated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my recollection goes, delegates go there representing different Parties.  They do not represent the Free State, but the Oireachtas.  I presume if Deputy Fahy went he would vote in favour of the Initiative and that Deputy Tierney, if he went, would vote against it.  Delegates are not bound to vote in one particular direction.  They act as free individuals. I do not think I need say more about Deputy O'Connell.  He made the point fairly.  This is not a decided opinion expressed, but a resolution placed on the Order Paper and which will be discussed and may be accepted or rejected.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera, speaking last night, said that we were destroying two fundamental Articles of the Constitution. I do not think that that is the case.  One reason why these Articles are not, and cannot be, fundamental is that it is not necessary to bring in any legislation to replace them.  If you take away part of the foundations of your house, you will have to put in a steel girder or concrete piles or something to take the place of the foundations.  But if you take away a balcony&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Deputy Aiken's point&mdash;that the house is going to be made to fall.  Now we know.  I will come back to that.  It would be necessary in other Articles, dealing with the election to the Seanad, to make other provisions.  There you are putting in the girder or the concrete piles&mdash; something necessary to take the place of what is taken away.  In this case these Articles can be taken away without replacement, and in my view they can be taken away without danger to the house.  I agree with Deputy de Valera when he said that we should not deal with the matter from the point of view of debating points or small issues <Col N="1699" /> like that.  I would go further than Deputy de Valera and say that in dealing with this matter it is undesirable to deal with it with passion.  The question is essentially one of machinery, and one that should be discussed coolly rather than with passion.  I want to consider the contingencies that would arise if the Bill were defeated at this stage.  If Deputy de Valera's Petition had been accepted and a Referendum taken on the question of that Petition and that the Referendum had been unfavourable to it, what would Deputy de Valera's attitude have been?  Would he have taken that as the final verdict of the people, or would he have looked into his own heart and decided that some, if not all, of the majority had not a right national attitude and that the people had no right to do wrong and, therefore, he would continue to carry on his agitation without regard to the result of the Referendum?  The Referendum is valueless unless it is final.  The only use of it is to get a question settled, and unless its result is taken as final, and all parties in the State, including those outside the Dáil, are prepared to take it as final, it is absolutely no use in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal from Deputy Lemass about the people's rights.  I do not know why the people of the country should possess rights in common with the people of Switzerland which are not, however, enjoyed by the people of France, Germany or the citizens of the United States as a whole. By passing the Bill we shall be reducing ourselves to the degraded condition of those citizens of the United States who do not inhabit Oregon or half a dozen of the Western States.  It is noteworthy that in the United States, where they have tried the Initiative in various State Constitutions, there has been no movement to have it inserted in the Federal Constitution.  Their experience of it, apparently, has not been so favourable that they desire to make it part of the supreme legislative machinery. In regard to the body which deals with external affairs, and in the main with taxation, and which deals with the making of Treaties, there is no Initiative, and so far as I can ascertain, <Col N="1700" /> no desire to include the Initiative in its Constitution.  I do not think that our people will suffer very much in liberty or in loss of rights if they are in the same position as the people in the United States.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera spoke very frequently about the will of the people. How is the will of the people expressed upon this matter?  Is it expressed by about half of the Fianna Fáil Party coming here and voting against the Bill while another half does not think it worth its while to do so?  Or is it expressed by the action of the people at the general election when this issue was before them as part of the Government programme?  A Bill was introduced to abolish the Initiative in August of last year.  I spoke on that Bill, and Deputy de Valera has done me the compliment of reading my speech and quoting from it on more than one occasion. I do not think he will contest the fact that I made it clear in that speech that I regarded the Initiative as useless and unworkable, and that it ought to be abolished.  I made my position clear before the general election, and everyone, every voter in the country, knew that part of the Government policy was the bringing in of a Bill to abolish the Initiative.  I have made my position quite clear, and although the Fianna Fáil Party were kind enough to devote a good deal of their newspaper space to advertising me&mdash;what they believed to be my views&mdash;one thing they forgot to say was that I was opposed to the Initiative.  I do not ever remember seeing that.  That was one of my crimes that escaped notice.  My attitude on the Initiative was made quite clear to my constituents, yet while that was so I obtained a substantially increased number of first preference votes at the election.  It did not appear that my constituency felt very strongly on the matter.  Knowing that the abolition of the Initiative was part of their policy, the Government have been returned by the country, not in a large majority, but with a sufficient majority.  It does not appear that the people of the country as a whole felt very strongly upon the matter.  That was nine months ago.  Has the situation changed since?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> What is the index by which we can judge whether the people are feeling very keenly on a question or not?  I venture to think, in the case of most Deputies, it is expressed by the state of their letter bag and by their correspondence. I do not know what the experience of other Deputies is on that matter, but since these Constitutional Amendment Bills were introduced, I have not had one single letter dealing with the subject from anyone in my constituency.  I know I am asking for it.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact I have not discussed the matter with the Government.  The Bill came as a surprise to me, but on it I was perfectly <Col N="1702" /> clear.  I do not believe that my constituents are opposed to this Bill, or were opposed to it in September of last year when they elected me.  I have had no indication of any change in their attitude, and I support the Bill because I believe that the Initiative and the Referendum make it possible for an organised minority to override the will of an unorganised majority.  That is, to my mind, contrary to all Parliamentary government and therefore I think that Article there ought to be abolished.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper is certainly to be congratulated.  The ex-Censor of the Black and Tan regime has brought round to himself a Government which pretended to be a national Government.  He has brought it round in favour of an attack upon the national initiative of the Irish people.  This is a serious moment, because it is the final stage of a Bill to bottle up the Irish people.  Deputy Lemass has pointed out what would happen to a steam engine when the valves are closed.  Those valves are being closed deliberately.  I do not know if the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is blinded by Party spirit to such an extent as not to see that they are doing the enemy's work.  They are in the hollow of the hands of Lord Birkenhead.  He is the dictator of this country.  He is the man who is saying that there should be no Initiative and no Referendum in Ireland.  Nothing in the Constitution is going to remain which will give Ireland an opportunity of doing anything except bursting itself.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cooper says, if you take away the essential part of the foundations of a house, what happens?  He was going to say that you could put in something else, but Deputy Aiken drew more quickly the real conclusion. The house falls Men with the mentality of Lord Birkenhead require in Ireland always a condition of instability, threats of a fall and a smashup, and they are going on a good Scriptural text: &ldquo;The house that is divided against itself, how can it stand?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The majority of this House is to settle this matter.  The Minister for Agriculture said that the sovereignty of the people is expressed in the majority of this House.  That is exactly the argument which Lord Clare and Lord Castlereagh used to pass the Union&mdash;no matter how the majority is scrambled together, no matter how it is brought together, led by men like Deputy Cooper, who has his own convictions; he has never changed, and I respect him for it&mdash;but it is on all fours with the position of the House led by Lord Clare and Lord Castlereagh.  The majority is as binding, morally or constitutionally, on the Irish people as the majority following of Lord Clare and Lord Castlereagh. Deputy Heffernan, in a contradiction of a statement that I made, I gathered, said that the bargain between him and the Government was not an individual matter.  That the bargain was not between him and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but it was a bargain <Col N="1706" /> between his Party and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This question of the Initiative and the Referendum is not being argued on its merits.  The attack made on it is not an attack on the merits or demerits of the Referendum and Initiative.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party has made up its mind to get rid of it on a particular occasion when it crosses their policy of insisting upon the retention of Article 17 in the Constitution.  Therefore their action is entirely dominated by that.  Their arguments against the Referendum and the Initiative are simply gathered together haphazard.  No serious indictment has been made against the Referendum and Initiative.  No real excuse has been given for getting rid of it at this stage.  Whatever may be said for it, or may be said against it, <Col N="1707" /> it is almost idle to discuss the Referendum and Initiative on its merits.  But they bring a Bill to destroy the Referendum and the Initiative exactly at the moment when an attempt is made to put it in force, throwing odium over the whole proceedings.</P>
      <P>Suppose for instance in the present electoral struggle in America, one of the parties was sufficiently powerful to change some fundamental part of the Constitution in such a way as to paralyse the progress of the other party, and if some national principle were behind that other party how would the world consider it?  How we would point the finger of scorn and ridicule at it? That is the way this question has to be regarded, not purely as a question of the merits of the use of the Referendum or the existence of the Initiative.  If you see a game of cards going on between three of four people and if two or three people amongst them see one man cheating at the cards what happens? There is generally violence at that stage because if men do not play the game according to the rules there is no alternative except violence.  It is not we who are not playing the game.  We have in this matter played the game according to the rules and we have followed step by step the game and the rules as laid down by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and their dictator. The Referendum was put in there according to the Constitution and we said we would make use of it.  The minute we do make use of it it is destroyed.  And in destroying it the intentions behind those who are able to dictate to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have to be borne in mind. Behind that Party in driving them there is a bigger man with longer experience of tyranny, and the subtleties of British tyranny.  There are behind them Lord Birkenhead and his colleagues, men who have experience and ability. These men are able to hold in the hollow of their hands the Cumann na nGaedheal Party and the Government and they can continue the condition of misery in which we have been suffering in this country during the last few years.</P>

Ach ba mhaith liom a chur i gcuimhne do Chomhaltaí Chumann na nGaedheal gurab é an Dáilcheanntar in ar togadh Major Cooper mar Theachta ná an ceanntar in ar togadh Walter Long, 30 blian ó shoin.  Ba mhaith liom a chur i gcuimhne do na Teachtaí atá, nó a bhíodh, ar thaobh na saoirse gur fada an lá ó bhí muinntir na taoibhe theas de Chontae Atha Cliath ar thaobh na saoirse, go raibh na mílte duine annsin nár aontuigh leis na tuairimí a bhí againn agus ag furmhór Chumann na nGaedheal ó bhliain a 1916 go dtí bliain a 1922.</P>

Agus is maith an gleus é an Referendum chun an méid saoirse atá againn do leathnú.  Dá mbeadh saoirse iomlán ag an tír iomláin, thiocfadh linn a lán atharuithe do dhéanamh san mBunreacht nách féidir linn do dhéanamh anois.

Ma leanann an sgéal mar atá sé, b'fhéidir go mbeadh Teachta in án a rá, i gcionn tamaill, go bhfuil furmhór na ndaoine in aghaidh saoirse na tíre.  Tá na milte daoine imithe as an tír le déanai.  Má's rud go mbeidh an chomhacht ag na daoine atá in aghaidh na tíre agus má leanann an imirce mar tá, i gcoinn fiche blian b'fhéidir nach mbeadh i bhfurmhór na daoine ach daoine gan sprid gur cuma leo saoirse no daoirse.</P>

      <P>I should like briefly to reply to the point referred to by Deputy Cooper concerning the question raised by me in respect of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  Deputy Cooper disposed of that, or thought he disposed of it, by saying that it is more or less an irresponsible motion put on the Agenda by an irresponsible body.  In any case he disposed of the point by saying that it is open to anybody to put on a motion of this kind.  I quoted it yesterday as showing the tendency that there was among various Parliaments in Europe. If Deputy Cooper took the trouble to study the last bulletin that was issued by the Union he would have seen that this motion is not on the Agenda in the <Col N="1711" /> name of any irresponsible body.  It is presented in the name of the Permanent Committee of the Union for political and organisation questions, and if he turned to page 60 of the Bulletin he would see a very important report, from which I will take the liberty to read a paragraph.  It is a report of a sub-committee on which there were representatives from various countries, including Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Yugo-Slavia, and there is this important point to be noted, that the majority of these representatives, all of them except one are from countries in which there is not at the present time this Referendum and Initiative.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and who are looking towards these proposals to revive a system which, they admit, is going into disuse&mdash;that is, they are reviving it in the interests of keeping alive a Parliamentary system of government. I take it that everyone in this House is in favour of a Parliamentary system of government, not necessarily a party Parliamentary system, and most of those in this House know that there is a tendency in Europe to get away from Parliamentary government, to break up that system, and to introduce other and new systems which, to many of us, are objectionable systems.  I will quote from this Bulletin:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task before the Sub-Committee was not an easy one.  It was nothing less than to formulate a brief declaration of faith in the future of the parliamentary system, regarded not as a system cramped <Col N="1712" /> within an outworn frame, but as a system capable of developing and of adapting itself to the needs of the present day.  During its well-occupied sittings the Sub-Committee examined the working of Parliament in the light of the experience of its members and of the conclusions of the five experts in political science&mdash; the names of whom are then given. It concluded by preparing a preliminary draft resolution containing some proposals which it considered would be of a nature to give rise to a useful and interesting debate at Berlin.  This draft was adopted, with a few alterations, by the full Committee for political and organisation questions.</P>
    <P>Now, these experts in political science, whose duty it is to examine, as they are doing, the tendency of nations in this respect, have recommended this motion that I spoke of for discussion, and among other things they have recommended the institution of a legislative Referendum and a popular Initiative.  That may or may not be passed, the nations may not be ripe to adopt that, but I quote that as showing the tendency that there is amongst people to give thought to these matters, and we, who have these provisions in our Constitution, are going in the opposite direction.  That is the point I made, and the point I am making still.</P>
    <P>There was just one other point in Deputy Cooper's statement which I would like to deal with.  I referred to it before, but I think it is necessary to emphasise it again.  He stated that every voter at the last election knew that the abolition of the Initiative and the Referendum was part of the Government's policy.  I wonder how many who listened to Deputy Cooper believed that, and the Government themselves, although they thought it necessary to issue a manifesto of half a page in the newspapers, thought so little of it, thought it so unimportant, as part of their policy, that they did not mention it in their manifesto.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this subject, Deputy Cooper mentioned something that has often been mentioned in this debate, that if one were to remove certain fundamental parts of a building, that building would collapse. Of course, he suggested putting in a steel girder, or something else.  I asked for information here one day from the President, but the Ceann Comhairle rightly told me that the President was not supposed to give me the information that I asked for, although if the President wants to try to put this Bill across us I think it is up to him to give us the information. The question was this: How are we to know what is a fundamental Article of the Constitution, and what is not?  We, in our youth and innocence, might come along, just as a fellow would try to pick a winner, and we might stick a pin in the Constitution and say: &ldquo;There is a fundamental Article,&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is not a fundamental Article.&rdquo; We have nothing to guide us.</P>
      <P>There are other Articles in the Constitution evidently that are fundamental, but these Articles are absolutely useless.  As a matter of fact we were told by the Minister for Finance that these were faddist theories, and how the Executive Council, the supermen, allowed these faddist theories to be introduced into the Constitution beats me.  The two things do not seem to go together at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it that certain Deputies can point to a certain Article of the Constitution and say: &ldquo;This is a fundamental Article&rdquo;?  Those Deputies could come along and in the same breath say &ldquo;Here are two Articles which are absolutely useless in effect. They are not fundamental Articles. Away with them.&rdquo;  Where did they get their inside information from? How do they know that these two Articles which must be removed are not fundamental Articles?  We would like a little inside knowledge, if the President could afford to give it to us.  It has been stated by Deputy Cooper that the index to all this is the fact that there is a certain majority in this House on the benches opposite. He asked us how had the opinions of the people been expressed on this, and he pointed to his own constituency. <Col N="1714" /> Now, I hold that we can prove a certain statement which was made here by going about it logically.  A statement was made that this was outside interference.  Very good.  There is a certain majority in this House who will probably machine the Bill through, and that majority was elected, not, remember, because it was thought that this Constitution was in need of a change: they were elected simply and solely because the people, in all the elections that they have gone through &mdash;this may be denied&mdash;were threatened with &ldquo;immediate and terrible war.&rdquo; Hence, as a natural conclusion we have to admit that there is outside interference if this Bill is passed.  The President may say that that is not a logical argument.  I would like to ask the President if he would be prepared to go to the country, on a Referendum or a general election, and say: &ldquo;This Dáil is a sovereign assembly.  You are the sovereign people.  You are the final arbiters of your own fate.  You can do with the Constitution exactly what you wish?&rdquo;  That is the will of the people.</P>
    <P>Will the President go down to the country and tell them that; or will the President say: &ldquo;Here is a Constitution, and although the Dáil is a sovereign Assembly, and you are the people of the Free State, and are a free people, you have no right to change that Constitution&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;There are certain portions of it which cannot be changed.  You cannot do it&rdquo;?  If you cannot do it there is outside interference. What story will the President tell the country either now or in the future?  We would like to hear a statement from him as to what his attitude will be.  Deputy Tierney sometimes succeeds in letting the cat out of the bag and, although the cat is hidden to the best of the Deputy's ability, the cat pokes its head out sometimes.  In referring to an Article of the Constitution he said that if the Fianna Fáil people can get the country to change or abolish this Article of the Constitution and take the consequences, very good.  Mark you, &ldquo;the consequences.&rdquo; Whenever this particular Article is mentioned there is always talk of consequences. This is a sovereign Assembly.</P>

      <P>Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution are about to be abolished flippantly.  Bills have been thrown in here and have sprung up &ldquo;like flowers that bloom in the spring.&rdquo;  They are useless, faddist theories, and yet Bills have to be introduced and pushed through this House in an effort to prevent something that they might do, something that is so serious that it might bring about war, or earthquakes, or something else&mdash; funny faddist theories, useless Articles of the Constitution that might do all this damage!  Is it as a result of the carrying through of what is contained in Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution that the country at some time in the future might say: &ldquo;Away with them&rdquo; to the members of the front benches opposite?  Is it that the Government see a vision in front of them, as a result perhaps of a Referendum, of the gates of Merrion Street closing behind their heels for the last time? Does the President see a vision of Deputy Cooper and himself meeting outside for the last time?  I suppose the President will, to quote the words of Milton:</P>
      <P>Oh, be'est thou he, but oh!  how fallen. Who in the happy realms of bliss Joined with me once, now misery hath joined in equal ruin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooper wanted to know if we over-estimated his weight in the counsels of the Government.  I do not know if he was speaking literally or figuratively, but he has backed a winner both ways because he certainly has weight in the counsels of the Government. And, although he is only one member of a constituency, he represents, to my mind, quite a big section <Col N="1716" /> that has quite a big pull, and that pull is being exercised to the fullest to abolish Articles in the Constitution which might result ultimately in the abolition of other Articles of the Constitution which would again ultimately result in the showing up of the Government.</P>

      <P>Before the debate ends on this matter I would like to say a few words.  Deputy Cooper, when speaking, said that matters of this particular kind ought to be considered and debated without heat or passion.  Now, it is very easy for Deputy Cooper to consider these questions without heat or passion.  He is in a very happy position here.  He has seen largely the policy for which he stood in the past being adopted in a way more successful than any of his dreams about its success could have been.  But some of us here are in quite a different position.  We see that this is one of the final steps in a long series &mdash;to use the softest words that we can on the matter&mdash;of betrayals.  He said that this is not fundamental and could not be regarded as a fundamental Article of the Constitution.  Of course not.  From his point of view the fundamental Articles are those that we will find, if we refer to the Index and look under the heading of &ldquo;King.&rdquo;  To him these are the fundamental Articles, the Articles that have been imposed from outside by threat of war, the Articles that are intended to keep, in so far as any Articles or any Constitution can keep, the people subject to the will of a foreign power.  To him these are the fundamental Articles, and we can quite understand that as long as these are untouched that he sees no danger of the house falling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He asked me would we be satisfied if there was a Referendum, and if we would take that verdict as final.  Do we take the verdict of every general election as final?  Must we take as final the fact that the people have spoken in one way at one time, and are the people never to be allowed at all to change their minds?  Have the people no right, if they find out that they made a mistake, to go back to the right road, the road off which they were deceived, when they find that those who <Col N="1717" /> were leading them had proved themselves false, even if we say that their falseness only went to the extent of being false prophets?  I think that if we want to get some rule on matters of this kind we can only accept this: that force should not be used when a verdict of that particular kind was given, that we should not stand for force, but that every other method that was available should be used.</P>
    <P>As far as I myself am concerned, I have in the past, and I am prepared to stand by it in the future as in the past, said very definitely, and clearly understood in my own mind, that if we want to avoid the use of force, then whether we like it or not, even though we can clearly see that the judgment is not right, that we have no other way of settling matters of national importance in dispute without violence except by taking the decision of the vote of the people properly obtained.  I strove for that from the beginning.  A phrase that I used has been very often quoted against me, though in fact if it be examined it could never have been quoted against me.  I said at the start, when the Treaty came across, that there was a Constitutional way of settling our differences, and so there was if it had been followed.  But the same tactics by which this Constitution is being torn up, without any regard whatever for those who regard the Constitution as a sacred thing, a thing for which men have given their lives&mdash;the very same tactics made it impossible for anybody to stand up and say that force was out of the question.  The Constitution that was torn up, the Pact that was formed with the express purpose of trying to give the people an opportunity of settling that question, was torn up, over-night war was declared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am taking the question relating to the Fifth Stage of this Bill.  On a debate on the Fifth Stage of such a Bill I cannot allow the Minister to make a case because of something that was said by the other side now or at some other stage of this Bill or upon some other matter or at another time, and reply to it now.  I have told Deputy de Valera that he cannot go into the matters which he has been going into, that they are out of order and I am going to insist on that.  But I am not going, because Deputy de <Col N="1719" /> Valera got in a few sentences, to allow a debate to develop on a matter which it seems to me is altogether without limit and could not possibly be concluded to-day or to-morrow or next week or next month.  That is simply the position about the matter.  The history of the country is what is at issue, and while people may want to go back to 1922 there are members of this House who have the same right as Deputies and not one whit less than the President or the Leader of the Opposition who might conceivably desire to argue, and have endeavoured to argue at different times, that the deception of the people, instead of beginning in 1922, began in 1918 and a good deal earlier.  These arguments are no more relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a good understanding of these things myself, and I feel that they cannot be argued on this Bill, nor do I see how they could be argued on any other Bill. Certainly questions of the kind cannot be argued on the Fifth Stage of this Bill.  I agree that there is a tendency to endeavour to get these things in from time to time.  I am not particularly concerned about that tendency, and I am not particularly grieved about it.  I understand it, but there is no doubt that we cannot, on the Fifth Stage of this Bill, debate these matters, and I have asked Deputy de Valera not to go into them.</P>

      <P>The President suggested that a motion be put down so as to allow the discussion of these things.  I cannot give a ruling on that matter now, as I should first have to see the motion.  The view of the Chair is, so far as it is entitled to have any opinion in the matter, that if a motion were put down and the matter were relevant, the Chair would allow all the relevant matters to be discussed, but the Chair can see great difficulties in the framing of such a motion, and can see very little value to the House or anybody else in the discussion of such a motion, or the matters it will raise, for the questions at issue are questions of facts, and we have no machinery for determining them.  It would simply mean Deputies repeating arguments, and at the conclusion no one would be more convinced than before.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Chair thinks it is not relevant to say when we are told that these Articles are not fundamental that they are fundamental Articles, and that they are so because of their history. Are we only going to take every question as if we had been born only overnight, and as if the past was not to be used in any sense to guide us, as if the promises of the past which put the present majority in power, and put them in the position to introduce these Bills, were not to be used to remind them of their obligations and contracts?  If that were so, surely it would be impossible to do anything except to come here and vote.  I was dealing with the fundamentals of the Constitution, as mentioned by Deputy Cooper.  He said these Articles were not fundamental. I pointed out that as far as he was concerned they were not, that the Articles which he regarded as fundamental would be got in the Index under the heading of &ldquo;The King.&rdquo;  These are the Articles which Deputy Cooper regarded as fundamental.  I take it the majority of the members on both sides &mdash;I am not speaking of the constituted majority at the moment&mdash;are not going to take that view.  I believe I am <Col N="1721" /> speaking for even a number of those on the Cumann na nGaedheal benches when I say that we regard those Articles that he would regard as fundamental as having been imposed from outside, that they were imposed under threat of war, and that as such we are not ever going to regard them as fundamental.  The ones that are fundamental to us are the ones that are being taken away here.  These are the ones that give ultimately to the people of Ireland the right to decide questions on which there have been differences of opinion, and he knows quite well that in other countries where the Initiative and Referendum are used these are devices that are intended to give the people an opportunity of separating great issues from small ones and coming to a definite decision upon these issues.  We would have been saved a great deal of bloodshed in the last four or five years if there had been in the Constitution we have been working under an Article which stated that matters of a certain kind were finally to be submitted to the people.  If we had such an Article a great deal of trouble would have been saved.  I believe we are, by wiping out these Articles, heading for the same sort of a thing on another occasion.  Could we not have wisdom enough to think at least of the past, even if we cannot talk about it, and use it to guide us on the road which we propose to travel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, I have been challenged time after time, and held up as the one person, or one of the principals of those who were opposing the will of the people.  I have said there was a constitutional way at the time of the Treaty of settling our differences.  I believe there was, and my one hope was that methods of that kind would have been adopted.  I was going over the past to show that in my action now I am as consistent on this question of constitutional right as then.  I want to see that these powers of final reference to the people should be preserved.  We have to consider the Initiative and the Referendum as if we were simply in some class on politics and as if we were talking with these experts Deputy O'Connell spoke about in the abstract. We have to consider whether the Initiative was good or bad, or whether it <Col N="1722" /> is an addition to or interference with the institutions of representative government.  I know it could be argued I have seen the arguments for and against, and personally I do not think we would gain anything by arguing this question in the abstract here.  We have to consider our own circumstances, our own peculiar conditions, and to ask ourselves whether or not it is suitable here, and not merely whether it has been found to work well in the United States, where it was adopted, whether it is working well in Germany, or whether it is working well in Switzerland.  We have our own conditions, and anybody associated with me either now or in the past knows full well I have not been accustomed to deal with any questions as purely abstract questions, but rather to deal with them in the light of our own peculiar circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is why I have harked back on this question a good deal to the past, and not repeated out of some book on politics in the abstract arguments given there for and against the Referendum, because in the long run we ought not to be guided by these, though the experience of other countries is not to be despised.  In these matters we ought to be guided purely by our own conditions. On the general question of the Referendum some have said it has been found useless in other countries and has been given up.  The point was made from the opposite benches, which Deputy O'Connell admitted, that the members of this Inter-Parliamentary Union who brought forward this as a subject of discussion were in favour of it and the experts, or those who were there with the experts from other countries where it had not been adopted, but that, of course, they did not know what it is&mdash;that they were ignorant on the subject, that they were in the same state as the gentlemen in the opposite benches were in their youth five years ago when they were all little children, all inexperienced youngsters trotting about five years ago, just playing at government, that these men Deputy O'Connell spoke of had the same lack of practical experience and were mere theorists.  Very well, probably what those have found is that their own Parliamentary institutions with which they <Col N="1723" /> are closely acquainted are not perfect, that there is a great need for checks of the kind that the Referendum would be, that it would offer a means of advance against a grouping of Parties, and so on, to the bargains that are made between Parties such as the Initiative would afford.  Further, if we want to know whether it is the opinion of those who have tried it that it is good or not, I think, when I was speaking on the petition I quoted the opinion of Lord Bryce as to the working of the Initiative and the Referendum in Switzerland.  I can find the quotation, if anybody wants the exact words.  The substance of it was this:&mdash; That it was found to work reasonably there, that there was a tendency in favour of it there and whilst there were some that were inclined to extend its operation there was nobody who wished to destroy it or end it.</P>

The whole trouble as it appears to me is that the gentlemen who say they are quite ready to go in with their heads up into the British Empire are never to have the right to say that they are to come out; that is a power altogether above the people.  The people's power can be invoked to put to death people who refuse to go into the British Empire but oh, no, the will of the people must never be used to extricate those who have gone in.  If there is any meaning to a treaty of this particular kind that is the meaning of it.</P>

      <P>Here is Lord Bryce's summing up:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Switzerland the people are entirely content with the Referendum. No one proposes to abandon or restrict a section or wishes to extend it; the Initiative receives more general approval from the wise than 30 or even 15 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is his summing up, not one of the arguments pro and con, but his judicial summing up of the way in which the Referendum is found to work in Switzerland.  Now, Switzerland, before it adopted this method of Referendum, was noted for its corruption, at least so the book says.  I was not there at the time, and cannot say anything from personal experience, but so the books tell us that deal with democracy, its dangers and the correctives that have been found to work fairly well in the last generation or so, and to-day Switzerland is held up as the model of what a democracy should be.  Now, there are various forms of the Referendum, as you know; at least it is used in various ways.  In some of the cantons, in some of the places where it is used it is optional in the sense in which it is here.  A certain proportion can cause it to be invoked. In other cases it is necessary that a law be put to a Referendum of the people.  In some cases it is purely optional, and in others it is obligatory. It is purely optional in the sense that it is not invoked on every occasion, but can be invoked on important occasions. It may be arranged so that it would not be abused by making the condition sufficiently hard.  When this question of the Referendum and Initiative was before the Provisional Parliament that was the sole aspect considered.  Not a single person stood up and said they were opposed to the Referendum and Initiative as such.  Deputy Cooper would like us to believe that they were only put up as frills of fashion.  I think the way he put it was that we would like this Constitution to appear well and we had it dressed nicely, as we would like to see our wives dressed, and so on.  Very well.  I do not think <Col N="1725" /> that was the purpose of those who drafted the Constitution originally.  I gave you the names of them at the beginning.  For those who say that they were faddists, here are some of the faddists; not merely were they members of the Provisional Parliament, not merely was Lloyd George one of them, he did not exercise his blue pencil over it.  He knew the purposes it was to be used for, and he was wise enough to see that it remained there until it had served his purpose.  The right time had not come for him to use his pencil.  One of the faddists is the gentleman who occupies the Viceregal Lodge.  The next one of our faddists was John O'Byrne, here in swaddling clothes at the time.  He is at present a Judge of the High Court, and is very careful of the dignity of the Courts.  Another faddist, of course, was the Chief Justice, who signed one of those drafts, too.  We have Justice Murnaghan, now also of the Supreme Court, another faddist who got his position like they all did by competitive examination Justice Fitzgibbon is another one, another faddist, a Judge of the Supreme Court who happened to be here in the Provisional Parliament when this matter was going through. These are the faddists and all those who were here in the Provisional Parliament. They want to say now that they were in their swaddling clothes.  They confess that now, but when they were going before the Irish people, as was already pointed out by one of the Deputies, they were all men who were full of wisdom, able to look ahead for the nation, able to study all those things that would develop out of the Treaty.  The only thing was that they took mighty good care to turn the attention of the people in one direction only, and to hide from them, as they were able, assisted by the Press, the danger along that particular road.</P>
    <P>This question of the Initiative and Referendum could be discussed in the abstract.  We could sit down here as a number of political theorists and ask ourselves whether the Initiative and the Referendum are necessary to supplement modern Parliamentary institutions or not, but I do not want it to be considered in that way, because I <Col N="1726" /> believe in the long run what we want to know is whether the Initiative and Referendum can fulfil and will fulfil any good purpose in our own country. That is the question, and no other one, that is to be decided.  I hold that it would serve a very good purpose.  Both of them could be used, if wisely used, to serve very good purposes, but the one in which I was interested most, as I indicated at the very start, is the one which gives the people the right to initiate legislation, and in particular to initiate the certain type of legislation that is necessary to get them out of the difficulties in which they found themselves, the type of legislation necessary if we want to re-unite this country and get the people marching ahead to make this country what they dreamed it would be some years ago.  That is what I want the Initiative for.  I believe it is the best way to secure that objective if it were there.  The Irish people would take the step to make this Chamber a representative assembly, and once it was a representative assembly, as far as I am concerned, if there were final reference to the people in it, I want no other House as far as this particular Constitution is concerned. I believe we could here, if there was a final reference to the people available, settle acute differences of opinion; we would need nothing else but this House, with its members elected on proportional representation, but we should have it completely representative. It would not be representative so long as Article 17 is in the Constitution, and I proposed to use the Initiative when the machinery was set up, as it should have been set up if the Constitution were followed, to proceed to the people and ask them to use that Initiative to get rid of Article 17. There would have been a campaign in the country about it, I dare say.  All the arguments used before would be used, but I am confident that people would understand the position and deal with that single isolated question, which is one of the purposes for which the Referendum and Initiative could be used as distinct from an election by concentrating on that single question. Its consequences and all the rest could be discussed, and we could get a clear <Col N="1727" /> verdict, and I believe the clear verdict would be to make this House really representative.</P>

That is going to be taken away.  It is clear and definite from the action that the Government have been taking all the time that their policy is to prevent the people taking those steps which were used by them at the time as inducements to the people to put them into power. They said to the people: &ldquo;We can use this as a stepping-stone.&rdquo;  They even said that by getting the rifles, these rifles could be used.

      <P>The argument simply occurred to me as a natural one when we are seeing that the policy of the Executive is to deceive the people, to tell them there is a straight, open road, and then when they get them on to that road put up every barrier they can against further progress.  That is the position.  Because the people might take this particular action, the people who were given lip service, or their representatives, are to be debarred from taking it.  It is not enough that it should be possible to bring the consequences before the people, to tell them that there would be dire consequences. They would have every opportunity of putting that before the people.  They could intimidate the people, as they tried to do before.  They would have every opportunity, and I have no doubt whatever, by their attitude here, that they would avail themselves of it, at least there would be a feeling in the hearts of the people who wanted to move forward that the people could get the opportunity, and that is being denied them, except they choose to do it at a general election, when not merely that question but a host of others would be involved.  When parties come back after a general election each one of them says you are pledged to this and that; you promised this, that and the other thing, and nobody can point and say definitely this is a thing on which you have been elected. I defy anybody after a general election, no matter what the question is, to say it was on that question they got a clear verdict of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a matter of this kind, if the Referendum were used you would get a clear-cut decision of the people on a clear-cut issue, which could not be burked by anybody.  But that would not suit the present Executive.  They talk about the will of the people and the supremacy of the people, but when there is an opportunity of putting a question clearly to the people they run away from it, as they ran away from it when by the Pact a similar chance would be given to the people.  They did not want it; they wanted to have all <Col N="1729" /> the opportunities of confusing the people they could get.  Our opposition, then, to this ought to be quite clear. We are not in favour of the Referendum as a purely abstract thing.  We are in favour of it because it would be valuable to the people of this country in the position in which they find themselves as a result of what has happened for the last four or five years.  I think Deputies ought to be very slow to cut away that chance that there is of settling the acute differences which exist to-day just as deeply and as fundamentally as they existed five or six years ago, to give an opportunity to have these differences resolved in a peaceful manner.  If you are going to have a rigid Constitution and if you are going to prevent the people from overleaping these constitutional restrictions, you may have the old position which is matter of history repeated. If you are going to have a rigid Constitution and deny the people the power to overleap it, then you are going to have results such as we have had for the last four or five years.</P>
    <P>You are going ultimately to have people who will say &ldquo;Away with all these.  We are simply slaves, we are simply tied within this thing, and we will cut our way out as best we can.&rdquo; Do the Executive want that sort of thing?  No doubt they will have the big battalions behind them.  There were times during the last four or five years when it seemed to me that they were trying to challenge contests on these particular lines, because they knew they had the big battalions, they had illimitable forces that they could call in as auxiliaries at any time they wanted, and that they were really challenging people to a struggle of that kind because they felt they would be militarily successful, and in the end people would be so cowed that anything could be forced upon them.  I say the things that would not have been dared four or five years ago are being dared to-day, simply because they feel that the people have been beaten, the people have been cowed, that they are weary and tired.  But there are always reactions on occasions like that.  There is the usual swing of the pendulum.  It goes at one time from great activity back to a period of <Col N="1730" /> apathy, and then on again to activity. My experience has been such, and I imagined it would have been shared by those on the other side if their hearts were at all for the people, that I do not want to see civil war in my time, or in the time of anybody else, if I can avoid it.  This country is so small that I believe if it is going to make any progress at all it can only make it by united action amongst the people. Therefore, we want to get to some basic thing on which we can agree.  I made the statement at one time that in the long run a Constitution is some set of rules under which political activity is carried on, some set of standard rules, basic and staple, under which the different parties that work politically can work.  Can we not get to some stage like that in which we will have some fundamental rules that the different parties will agree to accept? Apparently we are not getting to that stage.  We are getting more and more into the position we were in four or five years ago when a certain thing was imposed on the country.  That is to last for all time; it is never to be changed or modified.  If it were of any use I would appeal to everybody on both sides not to take away this way which would be so useful at any time there were critical questions, not to take it away hurriedly like this for no other reason but because a proposal was made here strictly in accordance with the Constitution, a proposal that a certain petition should be acted upon. That seems to be the only reason why this thing is being rushed at this particular time.  There are a couple of years within which the Constitution can be amended, by either this House making itself a constituent assembly for the time being and enacting whatever changes may be necessary, or else by getting a convention called for the purpose.  It can be changed.  Why should not the changes be made in a genuine fashion that will command some respect?  The effect of this is to make the people see that they are in a trap.  They see the doors being closed against them.  You make them feel desperate, and they say: &ldquo;Very well, as every way by which we can reasonably and without force get out of this trap is being barred against us, there <Col N="1731" /> is nothing for us to do but to prepare for the days, near or distant, when we will be able to break down all these doors.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That even two and a quarter hours before this Dáil parts with control of this measure, some period arbitrarily selected, two and a half hours or any other period, should be regarded in itself as a sufficient argument by which this Dáil should be silent for all time upon this measure. I do not accept it.  We do not accept it in this House.  It will not be accepted in this country and no matter what form and ceremony we go through to-day, no matter what rules and regulations, what majority and other things are used to enforce it, this thing which to-day you are attempting to bury shall rise up again and slay the powers and forces which to-day under this form you are attempting to bury&mdash;the continuous control of the people of this country, the people of the Twenty-Six Counties over the Twenty-Six Counties.  They shall fail. Not two and a half, not twenty-two and a half, not twenty-two hundred years will rob this people of what they are determined to have some day, somehow, somewhere, by some means, continuous <Col N="1732" /> control over their own lives and their development.  That is the power which it is impudently suggested is a matter of such amazing and hurried urgency that we should get rid of it after two-and-a-half hours' discussion before we lose control of this measure; that is so obviously sufficient it should be accepted by agreement.</P>
      <P>What is the power which is being taken away?  The power of this portion, this one of the <i>disjecta membra</i> of a broken island, to use continuously, negatively, and positively this instrument of the Dáil for the purpose of developing its physical life, its economic life, and rebuilding its national life.  Under this interesting provision we are to screw down the safety valve. We are going to give technically the power into the hands of the majority to do what it likes.  Take away this power and there is no power inside the Treaty if that is gone, no power inside the Treaty which is for the benefit of the ordinary people of Ireland which a majority of this House cannot permanently take away from them.  Is there any member on the Government benches who is prepared to challenge that, that within the Constitution every power which is in the people can be taken away from them by exactly the same machinery and exactly under the same conditions as this power to control the Dáil is taken away from them? That is what you are giving them in this Bill; when the Bill leaves your hands you have no control over it.  It is only part of a price, but once it leaves your hands remember you have no control over it and the people have no control over it.  Proportional representation. It can go.  The present constitution of electorates.  That can go. The nominal freedom of the judiciary. That can go.  There is no single power left in the people which a mere casual majority in this House, so long as it obeys Deputy Cooper, so long as it has behind it the forces in the Seanad and in the Dáil which belong to and are controlled by Deputy Cooper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has got to go into the hearts and minds of every single elector and it is going there no matter what you do to prevent it.

      <P>Is there any member of the House who is in a position to deny that every member who goes into the division lobby to vote that we shall lose control, on the Fifth Stage of this Bill, goes in to vote that there shall be set up a Constitution in this country under which a casual majority can, and ought to, take away from every individual member of the electorate any liberty, any right, any power, any property which a casual majority of this House thinks it pays them to take away?  That is one side of your Constitution as you have got it.  What is the other?  You have no power to do the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> The Constitution of this country consists, after this is gone, of a single clause, that a majority in this House, in co-operation with a majority of the Seanad, can do anything it likes and that England likes also.  That is the whole situation in a single sentence. That is what you are voting for to-day. That is what every member of the electorate ought to know you are voting for, and that is what the majority of the electorate, if you went to them, would not allow you vote for.  If you go to them now under the conditions in which they can deal with one clear issue, apart possibly from some of the select of Dublin, apart from the constituency in which 17,000 first preferences could be got for Castlereagh, and put that clean issue that we to-day are reconstructing the Constitution with a single phrase, the phrase that I have given you, not one single man who would stand for that Constitution would be returned to the Dáil.  But you have the opportunity of altering the rules of the game.  You have the opportunity of putting something between you and that verdict of the people.  You can play round with the machinery of the Constitution, and you are doing it.  That is the sort of thing that you are doing behind the smoke-screen of a syndicated Press.  That is the sort of thing that you are doing behind the fact that the people do not know, but that is the kind of thing that, when the people are told what has happened, will send you to a long overdue oblivion.</P>

      <P>This is to bury the Referendum. They will bury it alive. They cannot kill it.  Stronger powers, more treacherous powers, better paid powers of evil in this country, have time and again tried it, and history has shown us that what they thought was the corpse upon the dissecting table has risen again, alive and virile, young and hopeful, confident and faithful to walk down the road which its death was supposed not to allow it to travel.  You are not going to get rid of the Referendum <Col N="1735" /> by a little trick of this kind.  You are not going to get rid of the people by fooling them about, within the little technicalities of the Constitution by permission of the Seanad.  You are not going as the price, the blackmail price, of giving control over this Dáil to the Seanad to get rid permanently of the control of the people over this Dáil.</P>
      <P>I want the Referendum for a reason possibly which may not be common. I want it for what it is openly and obviously.  I want it for something else. I want it as a buffer State.  One of the reasons for the occasion, as distinct from the cause, of the abolition of the Referendum was that it was suggested that it should be used for a particular purpose.  I for one find it very difficult to examine any machinery except in relation to its possible products, and I am going to ask you now to examine the Referendum, the existence and the non-existence of the Referendum and the Initiative in relation to the particular product, which, because it was intended or supposed to be intended to be used for it, the Party majority on the other side have paid a blackmail price to someone else to get rid of. Assume for a moment that the people of this country did want a fundamental change in that portion of the Constitution which at present is held to be Treaty-barred.  How are they going to go about it?  How have they gone about it?  There was the case of the Boundary.  We picked probably the most inefficient man in Europe to represent us upon that Boundary Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come back to the time when we attempted, by some other machinery than the Referendum or Initiative, to deal with portion of this Constitution which was Treaty-barred. I am going to suggest to you that the Initiative and the Referendum combined do give a better way of dealing with portions of the Constitution which are Treaty-barred than any other methods, certainly than the method which was adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in that particular case was that a body or Committee of <Col N="1736" /> the Cabinet went over to London.  We are dealing now with the Initiative for changing a Treaty-barred condition of the Constitution.  They came back on Monday, I think.  At any rate, they presented this Dáil with a Bill to change a Treaty-barred constituent of that Constitution, and asked them to pass it that day by agreement.  No notice, no consultation with the people, no attempt to get the people to give them either strength in resistance or wisdom in council!  The most fundamental issue that could possibly be offered to this House and this country under the Constitution: the legal recognition of the existence of two legally constituted separate and distinct States in Ireland.  The method was to come here without consultation with the people and ask the House to pass, for the first time in the whole history of Ireland, recognition by any Irishman of the possibility of the legal existence in Ireland of two separate and distinct States.  It was suggested that the provisions of this Referendum should operate, and the President said: &ldquo;Get your 100,000 and we will go ahead.&rdquo;  He thought then that we could not get either the 100,000 or within this Constitution the number of men and their signatures which would enable that constitutional machinery to be set in operation.  He said: &ldquo;Get your 100,000 men and the country shall decide.&rdquo;  But when he discovered that we could get that machinery, then the President went back upon his word, proved false to his pledge, threw away his own challenge, and said that upon a Party in this House shall lie the responsibility, and not with the people of Ireland under a Referendum; the power of deciding that we shall recognise, for the first time in the history of Ireland, that Ireland as a legal entity shall cease to exist, that the name is not there any longer, that we shall be a sovereign Parliament of one of the fragments of Ireland.</P>
    <P>What would have happened under the other method?  Our people could have come together and decided; they could have brought their counsel to the common fund.  Does anyone suggest that there is an acceptance in any part of Ireland of the fact that the Twenty-six Counties is sovereign?  Because if <Col N="1737" /> it does, it means that my father's birthplace&mdash;Antrim&mdash;is outside of my country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the fact that there are two different ways. Take the particular issue which was brought to the House&mdash;Article 17&mdash;I am not dealing with its merits in any way.  Are we going to adopt the same way when a majority comes into this House?  Are we just going to pass a Bill by a Party majority abolishing it, and, as we can quite clearly within the whole rules of the House, put it through its Five Stages and send it to the Governor-General, and put this Dáil directly as a Party majority up against the other signatory of the Treaty?  Is that wise?  Remember, that when this is gone that is the only way&mdash;a hard shell, a clean issue, to be fought out face to face and at once.  Or before we take serious steps of that kind, are we going to have the machinery which will enable us to rest whatever verdict this House may come to upon the open authority or the openly ascertained will, under the most democratic system, of the people in the Twenty-six Counties? Assume for a moment that there is a Treaty-barred provision in the Constitution which you desire to remove, which is the better way: to go to the co-signatory backed by a Party majority in this Dáil or backed by that open evidence of the popular will on a single, clearly ascertained issue in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case that you have.  You go to the country and you find a majority in favour of a particular provision. It may not be big enough; it may be technically big enough.  You can still operate under that if you choose to bring your law right up to the point at which it is inoperative. The Constitution Act definitely envisages the fact and makes an arrangement for the passing of laws for that purpose.  It envisages that you will do it.  You get a majority of 400,000 to 200,000, as the President says, for a certain provision.  It becomes inoperative even if we carry out the provision. You go back again and you get 700,000 to 200,000 for the elimination <Col N="1738" /> from the Constitution of a Treaty-barred provision and again it is inoperative. You go back to the people again and you come to them with fifteen hundred thousand people&mdash;a public opinion slowly, diligently, openly and honestly built up, built up of knowledge; fifteen hundred thousand votes against two hundred thousand or whatever the figure is.  Is that going to be inoperative whatever this Constitution may say?  Here you had a machinery for building up in face of the world proof that the people of the Twenty-Six Counties are behind, definitely, openly, democratically, in a properly-ascertained manner, over a continuous period, the demand for the elimination from the Treaty of a Treaty-barred provision.</P>
    <P>What sort of a position would the President be in or the Minister for Finance or others if they went to that other signatory to the Treaty and said: &ldquo;That thing is inoperative under the Treaty, inoperative and incapable of fulfilment under the conditions you proclaimed to the world as a standard Constitution of this Confederation of British free peoples&rdquo;?  What will be their position if they go to the world and say: &ldquo;This is what we are demanding; this is how we have demanded this; this is the period for which we have demanded it; this is the machinery by which we have demanded it, and under this free Constitution of these free nations of the Britsh Empire it is possible for it to be denied&rdquo;? What is it that is on trial then?  Is it the will and wisdom of our people, or is it that democracy and liberty in the Constitution under which we live? which is it that is on trial?  The wisdom of the Irish people or the continued existence of the British Empire? You have power under this if you choose to use it.  I am not in favour of using it to the full, but rather slowly, cautiously and wisely.  If I had that power in my own hands.  I for one would not be anxious immediately to use it.  Speaking now personally, if I were using my own discretion, I would say I have this immense instrument of immense potentiality in my hands, and I would not risk misusing it.  I have there a power of intensive evolution within that Constitution&mdash;the <Col N="1739" /> Constitution of every other, nominally, at any rate, constituent member of this family of nations&mdash;I have there a power of evolution which, if it is controlled and stopped and hampered, can only be stopped and hampered at the peril of the whole system into which it fits&mdash;a power of evolution which must bring to Ireland liberty or must bring to the British Empire destruction.  That provision cannot continue to exist in the Constitution of this country or in the common Constitution or relations of other people to them, and be operative without producing either liberty on the one side or destruction on the other. They have the choice.  They put that provision in.  That provision wisely, slowly, cautiously, carefully used by a united people on the Irish side will either bring to this country liberty within that Constitution or it will destroy the source of authority outside this country from which that Constitution springs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If you destroy this you destroy the means of large evolutionary change by which the liberty of this country can be attained.  That is the issue for you now.  That is the issue for every man in the country.  Either you are going to hold control and keep it in the hands of the people, continuous control over this Dáil, or you are going to take it away from them.  You are going to leave in the possession of these people the instrument that can be used in the largest possible way if used cautiously for the development of our national freedom.  Are you going to take that away from them?  Are you going to be supreme?  Is a Party majority, so long <Col N="1740" /> as it agrees with the Seanad and with England, to be capable of making any possible change in the Treaty or non-Treaty&mdash;barred conditions of this Constitution? And are the people to have no power or control whatever over their own liberties except those that are conceded them by a Party majority in this House?</P>
      <P>You are faced with the biggest question of a democratic character that has ever or, I think, ever will be put to this House.

We are but the links, the momentary stopping points of human progress in Ireland.  In dealing with this Bill and this provision we must deal with it with a full sense of the responsibilities that rest upon us to see that the great hopes of the past may be fulfilled in the future and not be sterilised in this our evil day.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that 700 head of cattle shipped from Waterford to Norwich, England, via Bristol and Birmingham&mdash;which latter place was an area infected by foot and mouth disease at the time&mdash; were held up by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company at Birmingham because two beasts were down in one of the waggons; that, as a result of the unloading of these two beasts at Birmingham by the railway company, the British Department of Agriculture ordered the detention of all the cattle for a period of fourteen days; whether his Department has made any representations to the railway company or the British Department of Agriculture with a view to compensation being made to the owners, and, if so, with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are substantially as stated in the first part of the question, except that the number of cattle held up in Birmingham was much less than 700.  I understand 167 was the actual number of cattle consigned from Bristol which were held up in Birmingham on 12th January last in consequence of some beasts being removed from the railway trucks.  The movement of these cattle to Norwich entailed, however, the detention there of some 700 cattle in all. On 10th February last my attention was drawn to the matter by the Cattle Exporters' Association who had been in correspondence with the Town Clerk of Norwich and with the railway companies concerned; and I then, having <Col N="1754" /> had inquiries made from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, caused the railway company to be approached with a view to an amicable settlement of the matter.</P>
      <P>At the end of April last there appeared to be a fair prospect of the matter being so settled, but I cannot say how it stands at present.  As far as the British Ministry are concerned I am satisfied that there was no alternative to the detention, not only of the cattle arriving at Norwich from Birmingham, but also of the cattle already at Norwich with which they came in contact.  The 167 cattle from Bristol were free to pass through the foot and mouth disease infected area about Birmingham, provided they were not untrucked in the area; but being untrucked they became subject to the suspicion attaching to all animals in the area, a suspicion which naturally involved all animals with which they became associated when&mdash;contrary to law&mdash;they were moved to Norwich.  In this country in similar circumstances precisely similar action in regard to detention of the animals concerned would be taken by the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the owners of the cattle have an action against the railway company in England concerned or not.  That is a matter, of course, on which they would want to get legal opinion.  If any action lies it is against the railway company, and the owners of the cattle are in the same position as anybody else whose rights, whether they exist under contract or not, have been violated.  We do not come into it, and the English Ministry of Agriculture does not come into it.</P>

      <P>As Mr. O'Donnell is believed to be in close association with certain criminal organisations, he has frequently been arrested by the Gárda on suspicion of being in possession of documents relating to such organisations. Owing to the short notice I have received of this question I have not been able to obtain a complete report in this matter, but I have learned that O'Donnell was arrested on yesterday and detained for some time.  I have no information as to the number of occasions on which he has been so arrested and detained.

This man asked the police what he was charged with, but he got no answer.  He was told to wait until Superintendent Ennis came. Superintendent Ennis can never be found for about four hours.  I suggest that this is a new system in the persecution of citizens.  You have the other system obtaining whereby you can keep a man in jail for about 12 months without trial, but I think this is even worse. O'Donnell has been arrested twelve times since the 6th June last.  On some occasions he has been kept in for four hours, and he could never get any information as to why he was arrested. He was searched on almost every occasion, and if there had been any incriminating documents found upon him I presume he would have been charged. The Minister said that he was suspected of belonging to certain criminal organisations, or did the Minister say that he belonged to them or was suspected of belonging to them?</P>

      <P>The passage of a Resolution in this or in similar terms by the Dáil and by the Seanad is the means of securing that the Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, which has for its object the removal of Article 47 of the Constitution on the ground that it is undesirable and dangerous, will not be held up by virtue of the particular Article which it is intended to remove. The speeches which have been delivered by some Deputies against this measure are themselves a fairly clear indication as to the intent and purpose of certain Deputies in the event of a Resolution of this sort not being carried. In view of that situation we have got to consider what would be likely to be put before the people in the event of a petition being served in accordance with the Article which it is proposed to remove by this measure. Might I bring to recollection some of the statements which have been made in the course of the debate on the Bill almost from its inception?  Just a few things stand out prominently which merit our consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have not been lax in bringing up some of the statements I made during the General Election, and in quoting them here in the House, but none of them has been so industrious as to find out what was said in connection with these two Articles.  I find on looking up some of the statements I made that I addressed myself at meetings to those two Articles, one in Cork on the 13th September, 1927, and the other in Kilkenny on 9th September, 1927.  We stood not alone for a particular policy or line of policy during the General Election, but through <Col N="1759" /> the courtesy of those who were opposed to us we were invited to stand practically over everything that had happened in recent times here and in the country.  On those issues the result of that General Election is fresh in the minds of the people here.  Following upon that is the usual course by which the President of the Executive Council is nominated by the Dáil, and he in turn nominates the other members of the Executive Council.  The Dáil then proceeds to do its business by majorities, which is the well-known democratic method.  According to what we have heard here during the past few days it is very desirable that the majority in a Parliament, according to the extraordinary doctrines we have heard during the last few days should only concern itself with what will please, convenience and placate the minority.  That is not my interpretation; it is not the interpretation of the people of the country; and it is not the interpretation which will commend itself to any people who have any idea of democratic rights or freedom.</P>
    <P>Examining some of the statements made in opposition to this measure, I find there has been a disposition on the part of those opposite to say that it is not and was not intended that the Referendum or the Initiative would be lightly used, though Deputy Ryan was candid enough to admit that questions that might not commend themselves to this House, such as the reduction of the liquor duties tax, might be presented to this House by certain persons so interested. On that question you would have not alone the trouble and expense in the first place of getting up the Initiative, but, secondly, in the event of the Dáil not accepting the recommendations of those who had an interest in having the liquor duties reduced, to put that as an issue to the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was going on to say that one of the things which would be promised the people in connection with the Referendum on this particular <Col N="1760" /> Bill, that that particular item and every other item of social reform which any person in the country had propounded would be presented as a reason why the Initiative should be kept, and in the background would be the proposal that this is the only method of getting rid of Article 17 in the Constitution.  In respect of that, from our experience during the last few days, and our knowledge of the various attempts to create heat and friction over that matter, we would have the public peace, the public health and public safety endangered. That is a thing that as long as I have any responsibility for administration in this country I will see is not going to happen.  That was one of the principal objections to this measure, that it closed the door in respect of taking out Article 17 of the Constitution, that we had here pictured for us during the last few days.  It is no longer love of this country but hatred of another country which constitutes their patriotism.  I do not subscribe to that conception. This resolution is necessary for the public peace, health and safety, and I move it accordingly.</P>

    <P>The gentlemen who went out on that cry when they were panic-stricken a short time ago ought not to be in a condition of panic to-day.  Now, apparently, they are panic-stricken lest the people should be appealed to, lest the people should have the opportunity of deciding whether they should give away and surrender the powers which in the last resort would enable them to keep an unscrupulous <Col N="1761" /> Executive within check.  We heard some gentlemen this morning talk about the dignity of this House.  I wonder what respect has the proposer of this motion for the dignity of this House, for the dignity of any individual in this House who does not want to subscribe his name to a lie?</P>

      <P>If you wish to get a synonym of that kind for it, all right.  It is quite obviously, manifestly untrue and false.  There is no immediate danger from which the people have to be saved by the passing of this motion.  They have to be saved from themselves, I suppose.  I was wondering what excuse was going to be given by those who proposed this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was listening to see was there any reasonable excuse that could be given for it.  The excuse is because heat was generated here that it was dangerous that this question of the rights of the people should go before the people. When here in this House a debate was in progress on the military resolutions, the result of which was the putting to death of 77 young Irishmen, this was the excuse that was given for it by the proposer of this motion, who thinks now there is such danger in referring this to the people that we must pass a lie or manifest falsehood, as the Ceann Comhairle prefers it to be called, in order that the people should be saved from themselves.  The President of the Executive Council, speaking on the introduction of these military resolutions, said that these resolutions were necessary because of the action outside, which was a direct challenge to the authority of the people.  Who is directly challenging the authority of the people now, and challenging them and trying to deprive the people of that authority not after consulting them and asking them, but after trying or proposing to this House anyhow that we should do it by means of a subterfuge or lie?  At least the men who challenged it before did it openly and honestly; they did not attempt a subterfuge or lie for it. That is what is proposed here, and we are, in cold blood, every one of us, <Col N="1762" /> being asked to come and subscribe to that.  I do not wish to quote from the dead, and consequently I leave some of this matter to be read by anybody who is interested in the reasons that were being put forward there for the execution of young Irishmen.  I will ask some of the Deputies here to come and read the speeches made by the late Vice-President when these motions were being introduced, and I leave also aside for anybody who wants to read them and satisfy himself on them the statements made by some of the other gentlemen who are over there.  The people are being asked&mdash;no, they are not being asked, we are told that they were told last June that they were going to be deprived of these rights and that nevertheless they returned the Executive.  The people were told these Articles were to be cut out.  Why?  Because we outside this House were trying to use them as a means of getting in here honourably, without having to pretend or appear to acknowledge allegiance to an outside power.  They were not talked of so much when it came to the next election, because we happened to be in.</P>

      <P>It is all right, the general election was the time that was put up.  Probably.  It was only when it was made quite clear that we were going to use that particular machinery, the only way open to us in the Constitution, in order to get in here and allow those we represent to be represented properly, that the question for the first time was raised of taking out Articles 47 and 48.  When we came in here there was no question of the removing of these Articles.  There was a Bill on the stocks which had passed a certain number of stages.  There was no question of reintroducing that Bill. It was only when we, in accordance with that Article, produced in this House the 96,000 signatures, not merely 75,000, but 96,000 signatures, to a Petition asking that that Article <Col N="1763" /> should be put into operation that there was a question of removing it.  You are trying to do the very same thing by this series of amendments as you are trying to do by this resolution; the resolution is an attempt to fool the people into thinking that you are acting constitutionally, when you know perfectly well that you are not.  The present attempt by these Bills to get out of the obligations of Article 48 will not impose on anybody who tries to see beyond the surface.  I hope this attempt by means of an obvious falsehood to get justification to prevent this Bill being sent to the people will fail. If ever there was a Bill that had a right to be sent to the people, that justified a Referendum, it was this Bill, because if you did get the authority of the people to act without the Referendum, to take these out, there would be some justification for your action.  If the people wish to surrender the powers of being the final arbiters, well and good; but as long as these Articles are in the Constitution you are not entitled to deprive people of these powers.  I say the action of the Executive in those two things is absolutely unconstitutional.  We on those benches have not, as we indicated, very much respect for the Constitution, but at least we were honest and told the people we had no respect; but the gentlemen on the opposite benches went out and asked the people to support them because they were supporters of the Constitution, of the guarantee of the people's liberties and these Articles were pointed to.  If you went to one of your political opponents and spoke in private with him and argued with him about the nature of this Constitution you were met with Article 47 and told: &ldquo;Look how democratic it is; look at Articles 47 and 48. If the people want to do anything they can do it&rdquo;; but the same audacity is going to be used on this occasion to get a majority who happen to be attached to this particular Party to forget all considerations of honour and decency and pass this lie.</P>

      <P>I honestly confess that I feel myself in very great difficulty in finding arguments to use <Col N="1764" /> against the proposition which has been moved by the President.  It is difficult to argue against a motion of this kind where a statement which is so obviously incorrect is put down in the form of a motion and we are seriously asked to pass it.  It is quite difficult to find arguments, and it is quite useless evidently to put up any argument as to why a motion of this kind should not be passed.  It is quite clear that the Government are prepared to stoop to anything in order to get their way in this matter.  I remember discussing this very question about a week ago as to the future of this Bill or the possibility of a motion of this kind being moved.  A certain member of my own Party said it was just possible that the Government would do this.  I scouted the very idea that they would stoop to a thing like that.  I said they would never do a thing like that.  I am speaking sincerely and honestly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I could not think, even knowing them as I do, that a motion of that kind would be put before this House.  We are asked to say if the people of this country are asked to vote on a simple issue to answer a simple question, yes or no, that they will immediately destroy the peace of this country.  I say that is a slander on the Irish people.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  The President goes to America and other countries. Many people here are in the association with people of outside countries for the purpose of securing peace and other things.  It has been his and our boast that the blessings of peace have been brought to this country.  We are now told that we are so little removed from a state of disturbance that the discussion of a political question like this is going to plunge the country into disorder.  I do not believe it.  I do not believe that the President himself believes it.  I do not believe that any member of that Party believes that the discussion of this thing will endanger the peace of this country.  Last year we had two general elections.  We had public meetings of all kinds all over the country.  Let the President stand up and say that the public peace <Col N="1765" /> of the country was in danger.  He knows it was not.  What becomes of the right of assembly?  Is that Article of the Constitution going to go altogether?&mdash;the right of the people to assemble peacefully and without arms to discuss political questions.  What danger does the President foresee when he asks this House to pass a resolution of this kind?  Where is the danger? What is going to happen?  Let us follow out calmly what is going to happen if this resolution is not passed by both Houses.  Sixty-two members of this House, if they desire to do so, will have the right to sign a certain petition asking that this Bill be held up for ninety days.  Sixty-two members of this House represent a very considerable number of the people of this country. If we base it on the numbers mentioned in the Constitution to the effect that one Deputy is supposed to represent some 20,000 or 30,000 of the people, sixty-two members of this House will represent one and a quarter million people of this country.  That is a considerable proportion of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They ask that this Bill be held up for ninety days.  In that ninety days there is a right given to one-twentieth, I think, of the people of this country to sign a petition that this measure be referred through machinery that is already there in our electoral Bill to the people.  If one-twentieth of the voters on the register sign that petition and asked that the Referendum should be put into operation with regard to this particular measure, then the Referendum is put into operation.  If the President is so sure as he says he is that the people want these Articles out&mdash;he states that definitely&mdash;then the people will express their wish in that direction and everybody will be satisfied.  He thinks if a political discussion of that kind were to take place in the country that the public peace would be in danger.  That is surely too much to ask us to believe.  I think it would be good for the people of this country to discuss political issues of that kind, and to learn to discuss them in a calm and peaceful manner.  The people that are preventing them from doing that are not doing what is best in the interests <Col N="1766" /> of the people.  It would be far better to let them discuss them instead of to be always having the people, as it were, tied to their apron strings.  They feel that they are constituted as the political guardians of the people, and that the people must not have the right to discuss these things.  If there is to be political discussion in the country over these matters, does the President seriously think that that is going to endanger the public peace?  The questions will be misrepresented, he says; the real issues will be misrepresented. Has the President ever fought a general election?  Has it been always the case at the time of a general election, or a bye-election, that the real issues were correctly represented by one side or the other?  I am sure the President is no child in these matters.  I feel strongly that this proposal is not worthy of the Executive.  It is, as I stated, a slander on the country.  It is nothing else to say that the provisions of our Constitution could not be carried out without endangering the public peace of the country.  I certainly will protest as strongly as I possibly can against a motion of this kind being carried.</P>

Once this matter has been raised it must be settled with as little delay as possible if there is not to be a breach of the peace.  Without wishing to lay too much stress upon it, I do say that the tone of the discussion in this House, the arguments that have been used, and the violent accusations that have been thrown out, do show that if the discussion of this particular matter was carried into the country it could not be peaceably carried out.</P>

It certainly would be sufficient to prevent any fair discussion on the matter throughout the country.  The Deputy talks about the rights which the people have.  If there is anything in these particular Articles of the Constitution that are being removed they are duties that were contingently, at any rate, thrust on the people without being asked for.  There was no public demand for setting up machinery for the Referendum.</P>

      <P>These duties were contingently thrust on the people, and they shall be no longer thrust on the people, but if there is desire for a change, that change can be effected. I have already stated that it is our intention to amend Article 50, but even <Col N="1768" /> if it were not amended, if there was a substantial majority of the people strongly in favour of such a constitutional change, they would still be able to carry it out.  It is proposed to make it easier.  None of that would be said. It would be represented in the country in such a way as inevitably to cause great excitement and heated feeling, and it would be said that here was the last chance of effecting a constitutional change being taken away.  I know very well, and I think that any Deputy who calmly considers the matter will feel, that the sort of argument and discussion which is being carried on here would undoubtedly, if carried on in the country, lead to serious breaches of the peace.  For that reason, once the Bill has been inaugurated, once the issue becomes a live one, it was contemplated that it was one of the questions that should not be carried to the country in the way in which this particular change has been carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind there is no answer to the statement made by Deputy O'Connell and, certainly, the last speaker has furnished none.  The sole reason, so far as I could gather, as given by the Minister for Finance, why this portion of Article 47 should be invoked on this occasion is that, because of the temper and tone of a certain party in this House, when certain questions are raised here, there is likely to be a disturbance of the peace in the country.  Does he mean to say that when scenes occur in this House they are inevitably going to be reflected in the country, and that on every occasion on which a Deputy may get out of order, or, perhaps, be suspended in this House, the subject matter for which he was suspended will be a source of danger to the future peace of the country?  That is what his argument amounts to.  I think it is positively childish, to say the least of it, to suggest that this portion of Article 47 should be invoked in regard to this measure.  I want to make my position clear.  I have stated already, and I state again, that I will never be in favour of the Initiative.  I was never consulted about it.  I shall never be in favour of the Referendum.  I was never <Col N="1769" /> consulted about it, but I took my stand on the Constitution, as it was, on every platform and at every election at which I came forward since this Constitution came into being.  I have declared myself as a supporter of it.  I am in favour of amending the Constitution and of doing away with the Referendum and Initiative contained in it, but I am in favour of doing that in a constitutional way and according to the Constitution. I think that to invoke Article 47 in the manner in which this proposal of the President invokes it to-day is entirely unconstitutional.  It cannot be, and it has not been, seriously suggested by either of the Government's spokesmen that there will be serious disturbance and disorder in the country if the Bill is allowed to take its ordinary course.</P>
      <P>How do we know that a certain proportion of members of this House will insist on their right in holding it up? How do we know that the Seanad would do likewise and, even if they do, I say it is our bounden duty to allow the Constitution to take its proper course, and I believe that if that action is taken by either the Seanad or the Dáil, and if this Bill is held up and if it goes to a Referendum, the sending of this Bill itself to the country by way of Referendum will kill Referendum in this country.  That is one of the principal reasons, apart from the constitutional one, why I am in favour of allowing this Bill to take the course of any other ordinary Bill passed through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had previous experience of emergency Acts.  We have had the Public Safety Act passed through this House, and we have had it declared on that occasion that it was necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety that that Act should be immediately passed. At that time I thought there was no excuse for that proposal, but at the same time there might have been some scintilla of excuse for what was called, if it was not in fact, a Public Safety Bill.  There is, however, no excuse for a Bill which merely proposed, in accordance with the Constitution, legitimately to alter that very Constitution itself.  I certainly cannot support the proposal which this resolution demands <Col N="1770" /> of the House.  I cannot find where this Bill, if allowed to take its ordinary course, would disturb the public peace and safety of the realm.  As Deputy O'Connell has said, we have had two general elections during the last year. Since I came into this House I heard no such language as that used on the hustings, and is it to be suggested that the Irish people would not be able to conduct themselves as well in reference to a change in their Constitution as they were in reference to matters of very acute and intense interest which were before them during the last two general elections?  I think the suggestion is hardly worthy of consideration. With Deputy O'Connell, I think that such a proposal, which I hope was hastily arrived at by the Government, is beneath them.  I think it is beneath any constitutional Government.</P>

I cannot, for the life of me, see how the Government's position can be defended, and certainly up to this, as instanced by the Minister for Finance, it has not been defended.  The only reason which he has given why this extraordinary course is being adopted is because there have been a few brawls in this House on the Fianna Fáil Benches.</P>

      <P>This motion declares that the Bill abolishing Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety, and when the Deputies opposite go into the division lobbies that is what they are voting for.  They are voting it to be their conviction that in the constituencies which they represent it is necessary that this Constitution Bill should be made operative in order to preserve the public peace and safety in the immediate future.  I hope Deputies opposite will tell us exactly how public peace and safety in their constituencies are going to be imperilled if this Bill is not passed.  I hope Deputies opposite will tell us exactly what particular section of the community is going to be imperilled if this Bill is not immediately passed.  I hope they will not sit there like dummies and then go into the Division Lobby and give a mean unreasoning vote, unsupported by any argument when the Government Whips chase them in like sheep.  I hope the Deputies in Dublin city will tell me, as a representative of the city, how the peace of the city is going to be endangered by the rejection of the Bill.

      <P>The President stated that the reference of this Bill to the people was undesirable and dangerous. It is undesirable and dangerous to get the people to express by their votes whether they want the Bill or not. That is from the President, who, shortly prior to the execution of Erskine Childers, said, &ldquo;We are going to see that the rule of democracy is going to be maintained, no matter what the cost and no matter what intellectuals may fall by the assertion of that right.&rdquo;  We are going to assert the rule of democracy in 1922, no matter what the cost and no matter what intellectuals may fall by the roadside in consequence of the assertion of that right.  The rule of democracy to-day is undesirable and dangerous.  This is 1928.  The intellectuals are in their grave, many others are in their grave, and the assertion of the rule of democracy is now undesirable and dangerous.</P>

      <P>I took a note of it.  I understood the President to say that it was undesirable and dangerous that Article 47 of the Constitution should be availed of to prevent the enactment of this Bill.  If he is prepared to withdraw these words.  I am prepared to give him an adequate opportunity.  He used the words &ldquo;undesirable and dangerous.&rdquo; Article 47 of the Constitution provides the machinery by which the will of the people may be ascertained on this Bill, and it is undesirable <Col N="1773" /> and dangerous that that should be done!  I hope that some semblance of the truth concerning what is happening now will filter through the paper wall of the Press to the people.  It will be a great eye-opener to them.  We are very glad to see this discussion taking place.  We like to see the last of the people's illusions concerning the freedom they got and the defenders of that freedom killed.  We are glad to see all the veils that covered Cumann na nGaedheal stripped from them, so that the people can see them exactly for what they are.  As long as he had the responsibility, says President Cosgrave, he would not allow any action to be taken which might result in the abolition of Article 17 of the Constitution. These are not his exact words, but they are the substance of them.  He has come out at last exactly for what he is, the custodian of the rights of the English King in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as he has the responsibility for government in this country that oath of allegiance, that acknowledgment of the superiority of an alien authority, is not to be imperilled.  It is well that the people should understand the new alignment of forces which has taken place in this House and the new direction which is to be given to the Government's policy.  We hear nothing now about freedom to achieve freedom; we hear nothing about a Republican Constitution; we hear nothing about all the lies that were used to induce the young men to join their Army and to shoot their fellow-countrymen.  As long as he has the responsibility, as long as they have authority, nothing will be done which will result in the removal of that degrading Article of the Constitution by which you are forced to acknowledge the authority of His Britannic Majesty in this State.  The speeches on this side of the House, says the President, make clear the intentions of the Deputies to invoke the powers of this Article and to refer the Bill to the people.  It has become a matter of immediate concern to the public peace and safety because somebody, some section of irresponsibles in this House, are thinking of ascertaining the people's will upon one of your Bills; because a number of Irregulars on this side of the <Col N="1774" /> House have sufficient regard for democratic rights to use the machinery still existing in this Constitution to get a vote of the people as to whether or not they want this Bill.  We think this Resolution is manifestly untrue, and that it is an attempt to steam-roll the people's rights and to force through this Dáil a Bill which they have not the courage to put before the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was equally illuminating.  Once this matter has been raised, it must be settled as soon as possible to prevent a breach of the peace.  Once the people get to know what is doing there must be haste and urgency; there must be no delay, because the people would be likely to act. Once this matter has been introduced into the House, there might possibly be a breach of the peace if it is not rushed through with indecent haste.  Some Deputies opposite have, I think, sufficient decency left in them to be ashamed of what their leaders are doing.  I hope they will take the opportunity given to-day to express their shame, or else avow themselves to be sunk in the same pit as the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also informed us that there was no public demand for Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution.  Was there any public demand for the Constitution?  In what way was that public demand for any section of the Constitution made manifest? You brought that Constitution over in secret from England and you forced a civil war on the country; you rammed it down the neck of the people, and you cost this country in blood and treasure more than it can recover in a generation to make the Constitution law.  Then you come along and tell us that there was no public demand for certain sections of it, certain sections which were put into it to gull the people&mdash;the sugar on the pill&mdash;sections which were used to secure yourselves in office, to give yourselves the power by which you could introduce Bills of this kind into the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree.  Deputies will remember that only this morning we were discussing the Bill with which this motion is concerned, and that the arguments used in favour of it were very different, if not contradictory, to the arguments used this evening.  This morning we were told that Articles 47 and 48 were faddist theories, that they were frills upon the Constitution, that they were of no importance, that they represented the result of the youth, inexperience and inability of the Government five years ago, and that we were really improving the Constitution by deleting them.  Deputies who were convinced by these arguments and voted for the Bill as a result are no doubt astonished now that the same Minister who moved the Bill comes here to move this motion and to represent as being essential to the immediate preservation of the peace and safety of the State the passage of this Bill.  The removal of the faddist theories, the frills upon the Constitution, the unnecessary provisions of this morning, has become necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace.  Surely not every member of Cumann na nGaedheal is a fool?  There must be some who realise exactly how they are being taken in.  There must be some who realise that they will not be able to stand before the people on the strength of those arguments?  Or do you think the people are all fools? Do you think that you have gone one better than Abraham Lincoln, that you will be able to fool all the people all the time?  &ldquo;Immediately necessary for the preservation of the peace and safety of this State.&rdquo;  I could mention every Deputy opposite by name, and I hope they will tell us exactly why this Bill is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety of this State.  If they do not believe it, I hope they will have the moral courage to go into the Division Lobby and vote against it.</P>

      <P>It is important for the people of the country to know that the back bencher of Cumann na nGaedheal, the ordinary representative of the people, the man who has been sent up from Galway, from Roscommon, from Nenagh, from West Cork and from East Cork, has said no word, has sat dumb, and allowed merely his own Front Bench to make up his mind for him and speak for him.  You are up <Col N="1777" /> against a frigid and calculated lie, and the silent members on the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal are asked to go into the Lobby and declare that that frigid and calculated lie is the truth, because in the declaring a frigid and calculated lie the truth they are able to dish their political opponents, they are able to take away from the people control over this Dáil.  They are prepared to save themselves the necessity of going back and convincing the people; they are able to save themselves from the necessity of going and meeting us on the hustings and hearing us give exactly the same reasons to the people that they do not dare to attempt to answer here.  That is what the dumb driven cattle of Cumann na nGaedheal are going into the Lobby to vote for, and that is why I would infinitely rather give way and hear the ordinary representative of Cumann na nGaedheal, the ordinary representative of the people&mdash;five hundred thousand odd of them&mdash;who have sent them here to have wills, to have ideas, to have voices and opinions of their own, and to make their own contribution to the development and the existence and the strength of this State, not merely to be echoes of the caucus on the Front Bench.  It is significant that Fianna Fáil Deputy after Fianna Fáil Deputy has to rise, and that though we stand and wait, not a single ordinary man on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches has the courage to have or express an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urgency, immediate urgency, violent urgency; the public safety in peril if you do not have immediate urgency. No evidence of it whatever, except party political necessity.  There is immediate danger of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  There is distinct definite danger of the existence of everything that the Cumann na nGaedheal Party stands for if they do not pass this Bill at once.  There is danger if they leave themselves to the people, immediate danger.  That is the danger to be guarded against and in which this Constitution, bad as it is, is to be scandalised.  Keep the people out of it, do not let them lay sacrilegious hands upon this Constitution for which so much blood and treasure has been <Col N="1778" /> spent.  Keep the people away from it, that is the danger; there is no other danger.  Members sitting on the Cumann na nGaedheal back benches shall never be allowed to submit this thing to their constituents.  Their constituents are of such a character, their morale is so low, their respect for their members is so small, their regard for the decencies of public life is so nonexistent that Deputies cannot discuss these matters in their constituencies. That is what Deputies opposite are saying.  Every man who goes into the Division Lobby and says this great constitutional question cannot be considered and discussed in the face of the people without endangering the public peace of this State is insulting his own constituents and doing a thing that he would not dare to do unless safeguarded by the removal of these Articles, and the particular overlay on this Bill in the passing of time that will enable them to forget the insult that was thrown back into their teeth in return for the vote they gave to the dumb driven cattle on the benches of Cumann na nGaedheal.  The President says that in Cork on the 13th September and in Kilkenny on the 19th&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>The 9th.  The President said a lot of things.  Does the fact that the President said that mean that he came here with a mandate to do it? On what date did the President say he was going to abolish proportional representation? On what date did he tell the people how at a certain by-election he did not get the amount of support he would have got if he had abolished it? Did he come here with a mandate also, I ask Deputies on the back benches of Cumann na nGaedheal, to gerrymander the constituencies in any way he liked and to tear out of the Constitution what they have boasted was one of its democratic elements?  How has he a mandate for one thing and not for another?  Has he merely to quote something he said somewhere, somehow, sometime, and so long as he has a majority, no matter how fundamental the alteration that he wants to carry, he has a mandate and a right and a duty to do it?  That is the sort of argument that cuts deep into <Col N="1779" /> public peace in this country.  That is the sort of argument which will, if it is believed, turn the people into looking for other ways.  Personally this story of mandate to do all sorts of things, founded upon some obscure utterance of the President's in an obscure place to be quoted when it suits him and to be hidden when it does not, carries no conviction whatever to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We lose control over this measure, and it is suggested that we should freely do it because contingently some time, this year, next year, or some time, whenever it suits the political Party necessities of the Government opposite they are going to amend in some way, somehow and in some direction Article 50 of the Constitution. We are to buy this pig in a poke.  We are to trust to the President, to trust to what we know of his method of manipulating the Constitution, and to keep his word for the carrying out of that.  The greatest constitutional issue, greater altogether than this, because this is only part of the machinery, a great piece of the machinery, but on that fundamental matter of setting up in this country two States he gave an offer.  He said, get your men to operate this portion of the Constitution and you can go ahead, but when he found it could be done he went back of his word. We are to accept the word of such a man with such a record.  But the elision of Articles 47 and 48 is going to be compensated by the expansion in some direction at some time of Article 50. Does he realise that under the Bills passed through the House, under the extension of time that we are giving as part of the blackmail bargain to the Seanad, that they can hold up his amendment of Article 50 until it ceases to be operative under the Constitution and until he cannot put it in under the Constitution?  Did the President explain that to Deputies of Cumann na nGaedheal?  Did he tell them that the promise he made to them is contingent upon the Seanad not using the powers which he is giving them deliberately under another Bill for the purpose of making it inoperative?  Is that what he does not want us to tell the electorate upon the hustings?  Does he want us to go to the country and tell the people <Col N="1780" /> what power they are actually losing under this Bill?  That is the danger&mdash;a danger to everything the Cumann na nGaedheal stands for to-day, the danger of the great betrayal, the danger of the building up in this system over the head and the authority of the people something that even the people altogether will not be able to get out of it except by use of means which are not contemplated in any civil Constitution.  They do not dare to go to the country; that is the immediate danger, not to the State, not to the public safety.  The President just managed to drag in these words at the end of his speech, just managed to drag them in by the scruff of the neck, that is all he could do.  He could not show they had any connection; he had just dragged them in.  That is all he did; this frigid and calculated lie.</P>
    <P>It is suggested&mdash;and I do not know whether it is speeches like the speech I am delivering now and the speeches that have been delivered in this House &mdash;that these speeches are going to be a danger to the public peace, health and safety.</P>

      <P>No, not lightly used.  If this instrument is left in the hands of the people to be used by them as I believe it will be used, responsibly for high matters of national interest, how on earth is it going to interfere immediately with the public safety and public peace?  Does this House really want that there shall be no means by which upon the larger Treaty-barred issues of the Constitution the people will be unable to express their opinions without coming to an immediate clash?  Do they really want that there should be taken out of this Constitution the means by which&mdash;without coming to a definite and immediate clash with the co-signatory of that so-called Treaty&mdash;we can put before the world the visible demand of the people of this country that there shall be changes in the Treaty-barred portions of that Constitution?  Will the keeping of that power in our possession produce immediate dangers to the public safety of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down in the country paid organisers of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation were saying that we were a Party <Col N="1781" /> of accomplished liars.  We can return that compliment because this frigid and calculated lie is a frigid and calculated lie upon the surface.  Every man who hears it, and every man who endorses it, and every man who goes into the lobby in support of it, knows that it is what it is&mdash;a lie, a barefaced lie, and nothing but a lie.  There is no necessity whatever for Article 47, we are told. The Seanad would under no condition, we are told, interfere with the liberty of the people.  The Seanad would not hold anything up from them.  They came to this House and asked for the Public Safety Act, which took out of the Treaty and which took out of the Constitution all the primal safeguards for personal liberty, they demanded it on twenty-four hours' notice from the Seanad, the very Seanad that passed round notes among themselves not to alter it by one single comma and by not one single word, for fear it might go back to a Dáil which was then in possession of a majority to defeat it. If that Seanad had held up that for them there might have been some justification, there might have been some respectability, from the national point of view, in regarding that as an institution which, in return for taking away its power from the people, should be put above the Dáil, which was capable of passing a Public Safety Act in the way it was.  But it did not.</P>
    <P>Under this thing you are giving the power out of your hand.  You are losing control of the greatest democratic instrument in the Constitution, and you are doing it, not in the interests of the public safety, but in the interests of the continued existence of a Party and for what that Party stands&mdash;the betrayal of everything for which what all that is best in the country stands, and which makes for everything that is for the public safety and interest of this country.  Unworthy of the Executive some one said.  Worthy of the Executive!  Worthy to be its gravestone.  When its epitaph comes to be written it will be a very merciful and overstrainedly merciful epitaph which will simply label them &ldquo;duds.&rdquo; It would be a strain upon honesty to put merely that title upon their graves. They are men who have taken every <Col N="1782" /> sacred thing they have laid their hands on and turned it into a Party purpose, coined it into a Party purpose, and to-day they are calling upon the public safety of this country, which they have no more regard for than they have had for anything else that is holy and sacred in the country.  They are calling upon the public safety to shield and to cover faces in the most shameless misuse of the Constitution for Party and partisan purpose that has ever disgraced the history of any legislative assembly.</P>

I ask the Parties to examine that aspect of the situation. There were a good many things said, and the Labour Party put up a point of view, and Deputy Redmond put up a point of view, and I ask them, if we are bound to have a Referendum on this Bill, to consider for a moment the position of having Deputy Flinn going from Galway to Nenagh&mdash;he will keep away from Cork for good reasons which are connected with the last election&mdash;to have the Deputy going to Galway and Nenagh and other parts of the country talking the sort of &ldquo;blather&rdquo; that we have listened to here this evening.  I have listened to Deputy Flinn's speech very carefully.  I seldom listen to his speech and I try to go to sleep.  I listened carefully to this speech, and I could not get a single point out of it&mdash; not one.  I tried even to get one.  In the beginning, when the Deputy came to the Dáil with a certain reputation for oratory.  I used to listen to him, but gradually I came to discover that I could not get a point from any speech that he made.  He has ranted there for the last half-hour in the House and talked about &ldquo;duds.&rdquo;  He has carried on in the same way as a cheap jack <Col N="1783" /> would on a market day in the country.

When I used the word &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; I used it to describe the action, as I consider it, of the Executive Council in invoking Article 47 of the Constitution for the passage of this Bill as unconstitutional. What I mean by that is this, that it was a misuse of Article 47, to my mind.  Article 47 or that portion <Col N="1784" /> of it which is being invoked now, was never meant for any kind of a Bill but an emergency Bill which was necessary for the public safety of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite follow the Deputy's meaning.  That is not the sense in which it has been constantly used from those opposite benches. There is constantly the pretence put up here, which is not meant for the consumption of Deputies in this House, because speakers know that the Deputies are better informed, but it is meant for the country, that we are taking unconstitutional action.  We cannot take unconstitutional action.  We have an excellent judiciary and an excellent police force, and if we attempt to take unconstitutional action we can always be dealt with.  I claim every right&mdash; good, bad or indifferent, direct or indirect&mdash;that we have got under the Constitution.  I claim the right to use that in favour of the policy which we are trying to carry out.  We will make no concession to the Party opposite in regard to fundamentals.</P>

I do not think you could get a majority in this House for it, and until you get a majority of the House to take away the right of election every four or five years, then the people have that safeguard.  Meantime, do Deputies seriously suggest that the people of this country want to have all sorts of false and dishonest political issues raised year after year between general elections?  Does any honest man in <Col N="1787" /> the country, any man worth anything to the country, any man who has the interests of the country at heart&mdash;or any woman, for that matter&mdash;want these dishonest political issues raised in this country&mdash;this country that needs more than all else a rest from politics and a chance of settling down and getting to hard work, the work that will leave the country free to improve its agricultural industry, to deal with unemployment and to attend to the other problems that could be and ought to be dealt with?</P>

      <P>This is all neurotic; this is a form of neurosis.  Deputies should remember that hysterics of that sort do not prove anything, but tend to the discredit of the person who engages in them.  It is all very fine to discuss this matter in an academic way, but I say that I am speaking for the people of the country here when I say that every honest man wants a rest from politics.  There is not an honest man or woman in the country who has any real hope for the future of the country while these political issues are being discussed.  There is not one of them who does not want to see this country getting a chance to settle down, to do the work that will really make us independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of this country are beginning to realise what independence is. The people are beginning to realise that you require a lot more than political forms to become independent, and that you have a chance now to become comparatively independent.  No country is absolutely independent; independence is conditioned by economics and other things, but, comparatively speaking, you have everything you need here to build up the country industrially, economically, <Col N="1788" /> agriculturally, and in every other direction, provided that the unfortunate country will get a chance of having a rest, that these false and dishonest political issues will be laid aside and not drawn across the path of the plain people who want to work.  Everyone needs that.  But what was the origin of all this pother that went on last week?

That is their anxiety, because Deputies on the opposite benches realise that they are <Col N="1789" /> utterly incompetent to deal with any issues except political issues.  I have been listening to them for a long time, and with one or two exceptions&mdash;and they are not the most vocal Deputies&mdash; on the other side they have shown themselves to be utterly incompetent to deal with any of the economic issues that come up.

We are told here that we should take no action, good, bad, or indifferent, on what has occurred in the Dáil for the last three weeks.  Of course, that would suit Deputies.  There is nothing like having it both ways, nothing like a campaign of studied insolence and obstruction, openly and avowed, and at the same time not taking the consequences of that.  We are perfectly entitled to assume that, looking across at those Benches, remembering the scenes of to-day, the scenes that were attempted, and also comparing them with the language which I heard five years ago, and which was an exact parallel.  I listened to threats from those benches opposite.  I listened perticularly to threats from Deputy de Valera and Deputy Flinn&mdash;I do not mind him; he will not be there when the threats are coming off.  I listened to threats from Deputy de Valera on a few occasions&mdash;I have on the question of urgency there&mdash;stating again and again that unless this is left in the Constitution there will be shooting.

Would you carry that to the country in an appropriate way when we would be having this Referendum that the whole country wants?  We are not taking the chance.  You would, if you thought it would pay.  I am not saying that we are not capable of dealing with any disorder that arises, if it does arise, but it is a perfectly fair question for me to ask, looking at what has occurred, looking at this gross flouting of the parliamentary rules we have here, looking at the conduct of Deputies opposite, and the suggestions and threats and insults, every weapon that could be used, and every suggestion that could be made, this is a perfectly straight question for me to ask: Are these to be carried to the country, with <Col N="1792" /> the adaptations that would be necessary? Our answer to that is that we are not going to take the chance.  Nobody in this country wants another general election on a question like this.

      <P>&mdash;it is time for us to come back to the terms of the motion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That it is hereby declared that the Bill entitled the Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, 1928. <Col N="1793" /> which has this day been passed by Dáil Eireann is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety.</P>
    <P>With the passage of a Bill deleting an Article in the Constitution, which provides and confers upon the people a certain right, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture tells us the people value it so lightly that not five per cent. of them are concerned whether it is retained in the Constitution or not. That is his private opinion.  I would like the Minister, or some member of the Government Party, who proposes to follow him, to answer the argument against this motion, which was put forward by the Minister, that there is an Article in the Constitution which the people think so lightly of that, unless it is deleted immediately, it will endanger the preservation of the public peace and safety.  That is the motion we are considering.  We are not considering what Deputy de Valera said, or is alleged to have said, six years ago&mdash;I do not want to repeat what I said at the beginning&mdash;by a person of the calibre of the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who admittedly is one of the most unscrupulous politicians in Ireland. What we are concerned with is what is happening in Ireland to-day. If this motion does not go through, what cataclysm is there that will engulf the public safety, what man's life, and what man's property will be endangered, if it is not adopted by the Dáil?  We have to consider this question each one for himself, and if there were any independent Deputies present, untrammelled by considerations of Party and still free to exercise their own judgment in the matter, I would put it to their own individual consciences to ask themselves whether the words contained in the motion, which has been proposed by the President, are true in fact or are false.  That is what you have to decide.  I think Deputy Redmond put his finger upon the issue. It is unconstitutional to use one portion of Article 47 to delete that Article without referring it to the people.  It was held, and held by me on the Second Reading, that this Article was one of the fundamental Articles of the Constitution, in so far as it had been referred <Col N="1794" /> to in Article 50, in terms which I will again recall.  Referring to future amendments of the Constitution it says:</P>
    <P>Any such amendment may be made within the said period of eight years by way of ordinary legislation and as such shall be subject to the provisions of Article 47 hereof.</P>
    <P>What does that indicate?  That no matter what amendments may be made in the Constitution, Article 47 would still remain, and that all other constitutional amendments hereafter proposed and accepted by this House might be referred to a Referendum of the people.  The President, in the course of his speech, said that the principal objection which had been urged to the Bill referred to in this motion is that it closes the door to the removal of Article 17.  That is admittedly the real purpose of that Bill, to secure in that Constitution certain Articles which are repugnant to the general mass of the people, and are revolting to every man of honour who knows the history and the evolution of the oath.  But this Bill is going to fail, because whenever the Irish people do desire their freedom, whatever the President may say, whatever Deputy Thrift and Deputy Cooper may think, the Irish people are not going to be held prisoners in the paper bag of this Constitution. That is the service&mdash;and possibly we have reason to be grateful to him&mdash;that the President has done to this nation.  He has shown us how easy it is, by the use of a merciless majority, to tear up the Constitution, and he may be certain that the precedent which he has set will some time or other be availed of.  They think they are wise in their generation.  Against the rising tide of Irish nationality they are building a paper dam to preserve and to secure what the late Vice-President referred to in terms of contempt as &ldquo;the trappings and insignia of a foreign monarchy&rdquo;&mdash;the symbols of Irish serfdom and Irish slavery.  They are not doing that.  Make no mistake. We have directed the attack at the President and the members of the Executive Council, because they appear to be the immediate instruments of this, but we are very conscious that all the time they are not doing that of their own volition, they are doing it at the dictation <Col N="1795" /> of others.  I wish there were some of them here for once to listen to some plain truths because another time will come when the Irish nation will speak to them, not by the voice of men pleading in this Dáil for the rights of minorities, but will speak to them, remembering that in this vital issue, when a fundamental right of the people in this Constitution was being taken from them, Trinity College and those who are associated with Trinity College stood where they always stood, on the side of England and against Ireland in every matter.  The Minister may sneer.</P>

      <P>This faction, although it is a minority in this country, to-day enjoys a position of unexampled power and privilege.  It is powerful within the counsels of the Executive Council.  I might go further and say to the Minister that it controls the Executive Council, and I challenge him to deny it.  To serve the purpose of that party, to secure its support in the House, the President introduced this Bill.  Was there ever in all history so disgraceful a bargain, that the rights secured to the people by the Constitution should be stolen from them by the Government, taken without their consent, and virtually, on account of the attitude the Press has taken up, without their knowledge, stolen from them and used to purchase the support of a faction whose votes are necessary to maintain that Government in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There never was and never will be a bargain of that sort that did not <Col N="1796" /> inevitably and eventually drive those who made it to the potter's field of politicians.  Clare and Castlereagh are not the only Irish politicians who found dishonoured graves.  I have referred to the price which the Government has had to pay in order to secure themselves in office, in order that they might carry out and make dominant the political principles which the Minister for Lands and Agriculture avowed here openly, for the first time I believe in this House, a few minutes ago.  This man who does not want dishonest political issues raised in Ireland, who says that the people are sick of politics and want to have a rest from them, is afraid to put before the people an issue which is not, in the sense in which the word is being used as a term of contempt or as a sneer, a political issue, but a big fundamental issue&mdash;he is afraid to put before the people a principle to which the Government you have to-day gave lip service in their Constitution.  This Minister will not allow the people to vote and decide whether, in fact, they want to have the last word and the final judgment upon the action of the Executive Council, not five years afterwards when it may be too late to save the country from the ill-consequences of that action, but at the moment when the action is contemplated and before it is carried through. The people are not to have the last word upon such an issue.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture says that it is a dishonest trick to ask that they should, before this House passes a Bill which proposes to delete the Article of the Constitution that provides that every amendment practically to the Constitution shall, if a significant minority in the House require it, be submitted to the people for a final verdict.  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who avowed himself a politician so unscrupulous, so determined and so incurably a politician that he was determined to use every article of the Constitution, every trick and every artifice which that twopenny lawyer's mind of his, as he said himself, could think of in order to defeat the policy of the minority party in this House, says it is a trick.  I make bold to say this: that not only is it the policy of the minority party sitting here on the <Col N="1797" /> Fianna Fáil Benches as avowed Republicans, but that it is the policy of those sitting on the Labour Benches who, I verily believe, are Irish Nationalists.  It is also the policy of a good many who, still misguided and still afraid to stand up and to assert their native manhood and still afraid to stand up for the rights of their country, nevertheless follow that Minister with distrust and with uneasiness, at the same time believing in the same fundamental principles of Irish nationality that we do.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who thinks that the people are tired and sick of polities, because he himself is sick of politics, sick and tired of the politics which he expounded in order that he might rise to position and power on the ladder up which he has climbed, now when he finds himself entrenched in a position which some years ago he never dreamed of occupying, wants to kick that ladder aside and to say to the people: &ldquo;Forget everything I told you and forget everything I preached to you, and above all things forget what I told you six years ago&mdash;that this Constitution which we are framing is going to be a weapon that you can use to secure the full measure of your rights,&rdquo; to secure, as the late Kevin O'Higgins himself said, &ldquo;the things that you have written upon your banners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was going on to refer to the fact that there had been a bargain made in this House, a bargain which I said was a disgraceful and dishonourable bargain, and a bargain which I believe will ultimately end in disaster for those who have been parties to it.  The minority in this House think that they have secured something by that bargain. That thought is wholly illusory and vam.  They have secured nothing. When the majority of the Irish people, as I said at the beginning, declare for freedom, nothing that is in the Treaty, nothing that is in the Constitution, no power vested in the Seanad and no power vested in any officer of this House, no instrument of that Government is going to stand between them and their rights.  The chain that Deputy Cooper set the Executive Council to forge for the Irish people will melt like a rope of snow, but before that <Col N="1798" /> happens something else will have disappeared. The Imperialists, notwithstanding the power which the present necessities of the Government has endowed them with, have purchased nothing, nothing of any permanence and nothing of any value.  They have purchased nothing, but for the first time they have given all.  The only practical safeguards that a minority had under this Constitution were the safeguards provided by Articles 47 and 48.</P>
    <P>The character of the people, according to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, was a great safeguard, but the character of the people, the justice and the sense of equity which is innate in the people, never can become operative when Articles 47 and 48 are removed. Those who sit on the Benches on this side know from sad experience that there is no safeguard whatever in the character of this House and of this assembly.  This House is not a legislature. This House is not a deliberative assembly.  This House is the instrument of a caucus which dominates, controls and determines for the majority Party in this House.  Let us realise what constitutional government has come to. Since we came into this Dáil, was there ever upon any single vital issue a free vote of the House taken with the Whips off, when every man might vote as his own judgment and conscience dictated? Has that ever been known?</P>
    <P>Many of you have been here for the last six years.  Did any one of you, on any vital issue of truth and justice where a man's conscience had to decide for him, ever have the privilege of exercising that conscience and voting according to its dictates?  When the time came, as Deputy Lemass said, you were driven like sheep by the Whips into the Lobby.  Is not that the great defect of representative government at present?  There is no open decision.  The decision is by a caucus sitting in secret for a purpose which it never divulges, and the decision is made effective by the majority in this House.  That is my answer to the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, and I tell him that, as the experience of the past few weeks has proved to us beyond denial, there is no safeguard in the character of the Deputies here, that the majority which could deprive <Col N="1799" /> the people of the rights conferred on them by Article 47 of the Constitution, without allowing that important issue to be submitted to the people directly in order to have the peoples' own unmistakable verdict on it, whether by five per cent. or fifty-five per cent. they declare for it, does not matter. But the majority that could do that, and is capable of it, that has the power under Article 50 of prolonging the life of this Parliament indefinitely, and suspending every member of this Party indefinitely, and of proclaiming a military dictatorship if it cared to do so, is what we are living under.</P>
    <P>This Constitution has been time and again suspended.  This Constitution never became a reality.  It was never given full, complete, and unequivocal effect.  When there was a measure that infringed Article 6, when there was a measure which affected the liberty of the person, which under this Constitution is declared to be inviolable, the President produced a resolution in the self-same terms as he has produced the Resolution to-day, and virtually suspended the Constitution in order that he might govern without it.  We are told that there are certain fundamental Articles in the Constitution, but that Articles 47 and 48 are not fundamental Articles.  Would any person in this Dáil tell me what are the fundamental Articles of the Constitution?  We are told we are a free people living under a free Constitution, and yet we are told that the Articles which make the people undeniably and effectively sovereign over this Government and Dáil are now to be taken out of the Constitution on the grounds that they are not fundamental to the Constitution and can be dispensed with.  What are the fundamental Articles of the Constitution? Are Articles 2, 3, 4 and 5 fundamental? Article 6 has been suspended time and again.  Apparently one fundamental Article is Article 17, which compels every representative of the people sitting in this House to take an oath of allegiance that &ldquo;I will be faithful to His Majesty King George.&rdquo;  The Article of the Constitution which cannot be abrogated or deleted by this <Col N="1800" /> House, the only fundamental Article I know of, according to the arguments that have been put forward in justification for these Bills, and in justification for the motion, is Article 17 of the Constitution, &ldquo;That I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V., his heirs and successors by law.&rdquo;  When was that throne ever faithful to this people?  What claim has it on the allegiance of this people?</P>

      <P>I agree, but I was going to prove that, if the arguments put forward by other Deputies had any validity, the only Article in the Constitution that has any significance is the Article which compels every representative of the Irish people who is true to the innate motions of his heart, to the dictates of his mind, who feels a pride in the history of his country and the nationality that has come down to him from his forefathers, every Deputy here who as an Irishman, is proud of Ireland and who stands against foreign oppression, to dishonour himself before he can sit in this House and discharge his duties as a public representative.</P>

      <P>According to the arguments that have been put forward from the opposite benches, that is the only fundamental Article of the Constitution. The President has declared, as I have said before, that one of the reasons why he is asking the House to pass these Bills and to adopt this motion is that he may close the door to the deletion of Article 17 of the Constitution by instruments provided in the Constitution for that purpose.  I take it that that is the President's argument, that that is the justification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What is the catastrophe that <Col N="1801" /> threatens to overwhelm us, for surely there must be something?  The terms of the motion are extraordinary: that unless Articles 47 and 48 be deleted from the Constitution the public peace and safety are in danger.  Will the President justify the terms of that extraordinary motion of his?  Behind that mask of the politician there is a man who has a heart and a conscience, and who can decide for himself between truth and falsehood, irrespective of the Party interests he seeks to serve, and I ask him by the eternal verities of Heaven&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask him can he say in all sincerity within himself that the passage of this Bill is essential to the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety?  I ask him to drop for a moment the mask of the politician, and as a man who can decide between truth and falsehood upon the facts, to point to one incident in the past three weeks in this country that would show that the public peace and safety, as implied in the terms of this resolution, are in danger.  That does not mean to say that if we were to have a brawl at a street corner a Bill is to be rushed through to stop that brawl. There has not even been a brawl at a street corner.  There is no indication in the Press which supports the Government, and is anxious to support them, that the people are so clamorous for this measure; that unless it is passed through the Dáil with indecent haste there will be a revolution, that the people will storm Leinster House, that they will surround the President in his residence and call upon him in the name of the people to pass this measure depriving them of their rights which the President guaranteed to them and sealed that guarantee with the blood of his own countrymen six years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have anything more to say.  I do not think it is worth saying anything.  We came to this House driven to it, as I said before, by force of circumstances.  We came here not of our own volition, but to use this Constitution in a peaceful way to ask the people, by the exercise of the franchise, <Col N="1802" /> to amend that Constitution, so that it would be made acceptable to every Irishman who lives under it.  We came here sincerely desirous of serving this country, anxious to put aside the history of civil turmoil and strife which had, if you like, disgraced the last five or six years.  We came here realising with Tone that only a united people could win freedom for this nation.  We have found every avenue to that barred by every trick and artifice, as the Minister for Lands and Agriculture admitted, that they could devise or resort to.  They endeavoured to make it impossible for us to proceed by constitutional means.  I am not going to make any threat, but I do know, as I said before, that once the Irish people make up their minds to be free nothing in that Constitution, nothing in the Treaty, no power now vested in the Seanad, no power conferred upon any officer of this House by that Treaty is going to stand between the Irish people and the realisation of their age-long desires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems hardly necessary to add anything to the discussion that has gone on here during the day. It is obvious that no real arguments have been put up by the Government Party who defend this motion.  The effect of the motion is, on the pretence that there is danger of commotion, rebellion or riot of some or other kind in the country, to rush through this legislation in such a way that all power to have it called back again would be taken away from this House, that the die will be finally cast, and that this safety valve will be closed down for ever.  It seems to me that an occasion like this, where the issue undoubtedly is a big one, would call forth some bigness, some generosity and some element of statesmanship, if there is any such, from the Government benches, because since we came into this House we have played the game pretty squarely.  We have done our best to show that we have a real interest in the affairs of the country.  We do not give way to any member on the opposite benches, let it be the Minister for Agriculture or the President himself, in our desire to do what we can while we are here to advance the interests of the people.  It <Col N="1803" /> was for that reason we came here; also because we believed we had these safeguards which the President attempted to do away with when he tried to pass certain legislation, which would mean one-third of the electorate of this country would be deprived of all representation on the lines on which they were proceeding.  We took certain steps; we came in here believing there was some remedy, some way out, that of the stepping-stone which men on the other side have apparently slipped on, that there might be some part left, that whatever was there would remain, that we had now reached the position of a desire for peace, concord and all the rest the President speaks about, and that we had reached a position that if we did not agree on certain things we could agree to differ.  We felt the methods laid down in the Constitution for the ultimate advance of this whole people to freedom, these methods and constitutional regulations, should be left there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought that would be the case, and now it comes as a startling surprise to find that the President, who talks so loudly about religion, honour and public morality, who had these things flying on his banners down the country, goes back on all these.  He spoke loudly about them.  He wanted us to believe that he and his Party stood for the honour of compact.  We hope he will not throw away this last chance.  If there is any bigness in him he will rise to the occasion, and say that as well as honouring compacts with the foreigner there are people in his own country with whom he should do something to honour his obligation.  There is a large section of people disgruntled and discontented because they feel these things which were promised &mdash; these aspirations which we thought would be fulfilled in due course, this path towards freedom upon which we were to march under the new Dominion &mdash; have not come to pass. These people have their ideas; there may be apathy and a lack of national spirit in the country, but assuredly that period will pass and there will be a new rising up if there is anything at all in the Irish Ireland movement, anything at all in the past traditions, assuredly <Col N="1804" /> the new generation will come forward with a national spirit and will demand to walk away.  We want to leave that way open to them.</P>
    <P>There was no immediate urgency in this matter.  Even if the Referendum were left there you would require a majority of the voters on the Register or two-thirds of those who had voted to carry it.  Was that not sufficient for the Cabinet, in addition to their majority here and a majority in the Seanad and the new powers they propose to bestow and the safeguards of proportional representation &mdash; are they not satisfied with all these things?  Have they so far forgotten themselves?  Are they so very weak and threatened with impending defeat that they have to come along, five or six years after, when we are anxious to have concord and when things are settling down, with this thing which will do more to create bitterness than anything else since the Civil War?  I say not alone has the President not given us a clear deal in this matter, but we have not been granted fair play, and the rules of the game have not been played as the people who sent us here and we understood they would be played, but the President has deliberately tried to take advantage of us. He has tried to make us believe that you can set a boundary to the onward march of the nation by passing his resolution after discussion of a few hours, that you can put an end for all time to the spirit of 1916 and 1920 and the spirit that persists still on his side of the House as well as ours.  He is quite mistaken and it cannot be done.  No justification whatever has been made for this.  I need only say as far as the preservation of the peace is concerned that this Bill by its passage will do more, not to create an immediate menace to peace or feeling of insecurity in the country, but will do more than anything else to give credence to the rumours that have been abroad that the Government Party have been slowly slipping into real imperialism, that instead of taking up a stand somewhere in order to advance towards the full national goal, instead of having got renewed courage from the fact that they have support here on all questions of general national interest, on questions in which they could legitimately <Col N="1805" /> demand our support, instead of advancing steadily in the proper direction, they are still being pulled by the tail by the old Unionist minority of this country.</P>
    <P>I want to say one word more in conclusion with reference to the threats.  I notice that the Press, in a report of a speech I made here yesterday, has the caption &ldquo;Threats&rdquo; and &ldquo;More Threats&rdquo; underneath.  The statement that I made has been either deliberately or perhaps without malice interpreted to mean that I said there was a danger of conflict as between a military dictatorship and a constitutional dictatorship which is an absolute twisting of the argument.  What I said was: you had a position in this country before we came in here, you had a military dictatorship outside looking for control and you had inside a constitutional dictatorship also which endeavoured to ride roughshod over the wishes of the people and which, in spite of the fact that it had to pass through a certain ceremonial and had a certain form of procedure, was passing legislation without any reference at all to the real desires of the people.  I said it was time to put an end to that and that instead of precipitating a struggle between this House and the Seanad we should take our stand on the bedrock of national principle; that however we may disagree at the moment we are ultimately out for the same object and that is to do the best for our country and for freedom; that if we cannot see eye to eye we should not at any rate close the door.  The President should take this opportunity of putting his name down possibly in the annals of our country as a man with some foresight; a man in whom there was something.  He has missed opportunities in the past, but he shows, and the attitude of his whole Party to-day shows, that a small man and big issues go very ill together.  I ask Deputies not to look at this matter from the small and narrow Party point of view, but to look at it from the history of their country and of the rightful aspirations of their people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to approach this motion from the point of view of someone coming into the House <Col N="1806" /> and listening to the debates which have taken place here within the last few days, some one person who is interested rather in the peace and work of the nation than in the immediate political issues, or shall we say in the immediate cross-current of political views.  I would have heard to-day's speeches from the Government side showing a most extraordinary morbid fear of certain political events.  I would have found their minds entirely devoted not to constructive measures but to changes in the political institutions in this country, purposes which are absolutely unwarranted and uncalled for at the present time.  I would have listened in vain not merely to-day or yesterday, but for many days past, if I had attended the House as a visitor, for some real measure being brought in to cure the unemployment in and emigration from this country.  I might have expected that the rushed tactics which have been adopted here on the false grounds of urgency in political matters would be applied to remedy the real evils of the country, some attempt to put the findings, say, of the Food Prices Tribunal into force or some attempt to make a real inquiry into the big problem of how to give cheap credit to the farmers &mdash; a matter in which the Government has wholly failed.  I might have expected to hear something about many of the other really great problems with which the nation is faced.  Instead of that we have the President getting up and in a short speech &mdash; I might say an unanswerable speech, because he said nothing that could be answered &mdash; telling us that for the sake of the peace and security of the country it was necessary to use rushed tactics that are diametrically opposed to the liberties which he is embodying in another Bill which we discussed yesterday.  If he was consistent, at least he would give the Seanad the opportunity of exercising the new power that he is granting to them &mdash; the power of delay for twenty months.  He would allow the Seanad to exercise that power in dealing with this Bill, but not only will he not do that, but he goes further &mdash; he removes the possibility of the safeguard of 90 days provided in Article 47 and the safeguard at least on this measure, of <Col N="1807" /> getting the views of the Irish people on it.  This Government that believes in the will of the people when they talked about the will of the people in 1922 deceived not only the people but the pastors and the bishops of this country to such an extent as to draw them into public statements of a very serious nature.  I hope the men with that point of view, who took the responsibility then, will look into the conduct of the Government at the present time and make their decision as to whether they consider men who can go back upon all they said are men of character who should be ruling in this country. Deputy Hogan said that the only safeguard we had in this country &mdash; he left the people out of it &mdash; was the question of character.  Of course that was the old argument used by those who believed in a fancy franchise, in an aristocracy plain and simple.</P>

      <P>It was the Minister for Agriculture.  Apparently he has gone away from the plea of consulting the will of the people as a safeguard.  He falls back upon the old argument used by people who believed in aristocratic forms of Government, as the last ditch, I suppose.  I would like to see some basis of understanding between the various Parties in this House.  I do not like to see this House, or the nation, being turned into a house of hatred, because that is what is happening.  I think most certainly all the members of this Party would be glad if never again there was a reference made to the various unfortunate happenings of the past five or six years.  It is not in that way that any of us are really now interested. We may use past actions in order to drive home an argument about the present conduct of our opponents, but we do not raise these questions here in an idle way, and we are never first to raise them.  Personally, I would be glad if they were never raised again.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1808" /> I am far more interested in the strengthening of the Irish nation; I am far more interested in seeing the problem of unemployment dealt with, the problem of real poverty and the gradually decreasing purchasing power of the people which is the most dreadful problem that faces us.  I do not want to see those problems dealt with in any slavish or purely materialistic way, because I do not believe that you can have a nation prosperous which is not free or going towards freedom, any more than a man can expect to make good on his farm if he has not got good title, because when he has not got good title he may have a rackrent put on him over which he has no control.  The whole history of the agrarian question in Ireland exemplifies that point of view, namely, that as it was necessary for the Irish people to get good title in their land before they could become prosperous, so it is necessary for us to get the element of good title in national principle before we can expect to deal with such problems as credit, purchasing power, prices, and the rest.  These things must go hand in hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the argument put forward by the Minister for Agriculture, and what I wanted to emphasise was that the hectic political activity did not come from this side of the House, but from the other side and that economic problems were being neglected.  When the Minister for Finance was speaking I could not help thinking of his attitude towards the people.  He recognises the people as masters, I suppose, but there are things which a master must not be consulted about because they might make him angry and might disturb his peace.  It is just as if a servant smashed a valuable piece of crockery, and, in order to maintain the peace of the household, feared the jurisdiction of the master and hid the valuable piece of crockery. That is the attitude of the Minister for <Col N="1809" /> Finance.  He will not consult the people when the people have a right to exercise their authority.  In other words, he is willing to recognise the authority of his master only when it suits his convenience, and he will run away from him when he is afraid that he will get the punishment which is his due.  The Minister for Agriculture actually put it forward as a serious constitutional argument that this measure of the Government was justified, if only to avoid the ranting, as he said, of Deputy Flinn.  I think that this House deserves a little more respect than having an argument like that put before it.</P>
      <P>After all, even if he disagrees with the speeches made on this side, even if he finds that some speeches more than others are unpleasant to him, even if he comes to the conclusion that some Deputies make the kind of speeches which he does not like, surely the Minister does not offer that as the only argument he could offer for setting aside the normal operations of the Constitution. He told us that we had a remedy in the courts.  He did not elaborate the sort of remedy that was. He did not tell us what authority the Judicature has over the conduct of the Legislature, nor by what machinery a mandamus order of the courts could be enforced against the conduct of this House.  He suggested it and said that that was our proper remedy.  He said that what this country wants is a rest from politics, that we were only raising this question to distract the people from the poverty of our economic programme. If he wants to get the country a rest from politics let him and his Government postpone the enforcement of this measure.  We shall give him the rest he wants from that sort of politics. If he carries out the normal operations of the Constitution he will get all the rest he wants and all the harmony he desires from this side of the House. We are willing to co-operate in every way to increase the purchasing power of the people and to end unemployment and emigration in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that to say anything on this motion is useless, since the President and his Party will not make any attempt to defend their <Col N="1810" /> attitude in bringing it forward.  Evidently before they brought it forward they decided that they would not defend it in any way, so that they must have a guarantee from the majority of their members that they would be prepared to vote for it.  They must have had a guarantee from their muzzled members that, no matter what they bring forward, they will support it.  I wonder if any of those who vote for the motion have read it.  If Deputies opposite are muzzled from speaking and expressing their views, surely they are not muzzled to prevent them reading the motion they are asked to vote on.  It contains only five or six lines, and the least that Deputies might do for their constituents is to read motions on which they are asked to vote.  Having read that motion no Deputy, in justice to his constituents, should vote for it.  We have been listening to a certain amount of hypocrisy dished up by Deputies opposite for the last few weeks.  There has been a lot of heat, but if it has been introduced it is because the Party opposite, especially the Front Bench, have been preaching nothing but hypocrisy from the beginning.  From my position here on these Benches I can almost see the leer of hypocrisy coming through their faces.  You can easily see that they are not in earnest about what they are saying.  They have, I suppose, to put up a fight, and they are doing it as best they can. Deputies behind them know that it is bluff.  They have to vote no matter what happens.  There has been some talk about insults to the dignity of the House.  They should realise that whatever little dignity is due to the House has certainly been dragged in the mire owing to their conduct.  I have been in the country during the week-end.  I met people who are supporters of the Free State Party, and I know what they think of the attitude of their Party in the House.  They want to know what are they doing and why they are not tackling the questions which the country wants to have tackled.  Has there been an upward curve, or has the country turned the corner since we began to sit all night and now to sit all day?  Have we <Col N="1811" /> tackled questions affecting the farming or business community?  Have we got down to bedrock?  Have we left out of consideration things which the country do not want, and are we doing the things which the country requires to have done?  We have not been doing the things which the country wants because the Government insist on keeping the House sitting all night. What have we been doing?  Saving the country from a war by tearing out the much boosted Articles of the Constitution, Articles which, according to Ministers as they went through the country, were the very things upon which the people gave them their support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, because the people of the country are waking up to the situation, and because there is a possibility of the people demanding that these Articles of the Constitution should be put into force, the Government say that it is against public peace and order if we do not immediately pass this Bill.  That is certainly the kind of hypocrisy that will bring no dignity to this House.  If there has been any heat since these matters were introduced, it is because the Government have created that atmosphere by bringing forward motions of this kind which cannot be said to have any respect for the Constitution, and if there are to be any heated scenes in future, it is only because such motions will be brought before the House.  In the first place they know that there is no demand or no urgency for these measures.  For the past few days we have been discussing a Bill in which the Government propose to give the Seanad the right to hold up a Bill for a year and a half. Now they say that if a Bill which has been only passed to-day is not put into immediate operation there is grave danger to the public peace.  I think that even the back benchers on the Government side cannot believe that nonsense and hypocrisy, but they cannot give any other excuse for putting it through.  They said that even the heated scene to-day &mdash; the Vice-President gave it as an excuse &mdash; was one of the reasons for bringing forward this motion, but has not this motion been on the Order Paper for some time? <Col N="1812" /> They just took advantage of the scene here to-day, and said that that justified them in bringing forward this motion.  The real reason is that they are afraid that if this Bill is not immediately made law, the country cannot be bludgeoned into accepting it, and that the country will realise what it means in the meantime.  The only way is to bludgeon the country into accepting it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Thrift is not here, but at the same time I realise that it would be useless for me to say anything to him if he were.  A few weeks ago he brought forward an amendment in opposition to a motion by our party for the Referendum, and he made a grand appeal for unity.  He drew tears from all our eyes, asking us to see that this long-drawn-out campaign should cease.  He asked us was there not other work to be done; were there not other things upon which we could agree to work, and why would we not tackle these things, but for the last three weeks, since the Executive brought in ten or twelve Bills, which do not deal with the things that Deputy Professor Thrift talked of, that have no relation to the relief of unemployment or the vital issues that affect the lives of the people, there was no talk from Deputy Thrift of the things upon which we might have agreed. The things that the Government are doing now are the very things that Deputy Thrift wanted to have done, and not the vital things which affect the Irish people, such as the provision of employment.  I can quite see that Deputy Professor Thrift had just to play the villain of the piece for the President in this matter.</P>

      <P>The President took advantage of the Dáil by getting Deputy Thrift to bring forward that motion.  I am afraid it is not much use appealing to Deputies on the opposite Benches to oppose this motion, because I believe they will not.  They probably have opinions of their own, but I feel it is little use in asking them to vote against the motion.  They had their private <Col N="1813" /> meeting, and perhaps the President gave them reasons for this motion that have not been given to the House.  He must have given them some reasons, because there are some men on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who, knowing them as I did at one time, I believe, would not vote for that motion on the plea the President has made to the House.  They will not do it if they are honest men, honest to their constituents and honest to the Constitution as it is.  If they want to give fair play to the people they will vote against this motion, otherwise they will bring off a mean trick on the country that no honest Irishman could stand over.</P>

      <P>This motion reads: &ldquo;That it is hereby declared that the Bill entitled `The Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Bill, 1928,' which has this day been passed by Dáil Eireann is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety.&rdquo; If this Bill is not passed, something dreadful is going to happen the country. There is going to be war or something else, some great cataclysm, some great disturbance in the country as the result of it.  The whole fabric of democracy will potter and decay, to quote the words of Deputy Cooper.  The President, some time ago, very valiantly indeed, stated in this House that he would not allow the people of this country to be threatened by any threat of force, but here the President comes along with a Bill, comes along with this thing here, and threatens the people with war if this amendment to the Constitution is not passed.  &ldquo;You are going to have war,&rdquo; says the President.  Then the President will allow the people of this country to be threatened by any threat of force?  Let loose the dogs of war. Does the President really think that the people of this country at this time of day are going to be taken in by claptrap like that, because if he does, he is an optimist; he is a prince of optimists. We have had the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, who seems to have adopted the role of Punchinello to the Government Party without the tragedy that attends Punchinello.  He told us on these Benches that we would get certain rights, what we were entitled to, no more and no less.  A Deputy on <Col N="1814" /> these Benches asked what were the rights and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture said &ldquo;The Treaty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this debate the rights that we were going to get were contained in the Treaty, no more and no less.  He did not explain whether it was the Treaty that originally existed or the thing that exists now.  The Minister for Finance said there has been no great demand for the Referendum or the Initiative or Article 47 or Article 48 of the Constitution. Yet 98,000 people have signed and placed before the House a petition under one of those Articles.  &ldquo;There has been no demand!&rdquo;  There was no demand from a quarter of a million nationalists of Ulster for the carrying out of Article 12 of the Treaty &mdash; none at all.  Their demand was ignored and Article 12 disappeared, and so did Article 5.  Yet the Minister for Lands and Agriculture tells us, &ldquo;You have your rights.  Those rights are contained in the Treaty.  You have no more and no less.&rdquo;  And we have the mutilated Treaty.  I wonder does the President or any member of the Executive Council think that any Deputy or any individual in the country is going to be hoodwinked by a motion like this; that if this Bill, which is intended to mutilate the Constitution &mdash; the Constitution that the President told us long ago could not be changed by one iota or one comma &mdash; is not passed there is going to be immediate and terrible war. Yet the President will not allow this country to be threatened with any threat of force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on these benches were taunted with having made threats, with having said that if certain safety valves were screwed down there must occur an explosion in the country some time.  It was perfectly true, and if it had been stated 700 years ago it would have been perfectly true, because every time there was a safety valve screwed down there was an explosion.  We have only to look back on the history of the country to see it for ourselves.  We have been taunted with that, and yet the President &mdash; the acme of perfection &mdash; tells us that if a certain thing is not done there is going to be a war.  We do not know who is going to make the war &mdash; we are not told that.  But it is necessary that <Col N="1815" /> the Constitution should be mutilated or somebody somewhere in this country is going to wage war upon somebody else. &ldquo;It is necessary for the preservation of the peace.&rdquo;  When the President was told that he got a majority in this House, on the occasions that he did get a majority, simply because there was a threat put before the people &mdash; because the people were told, &ldquo;There are certain things you shall not do, and one is that you must not fail to return us to power or there will be an immediate and terrible war&rdquo;&mdash; the President denied it.  Now, if we do not walk calmly and tamely into the Division Lobby and pass all these mushroom Bills that the President introduced, we are threatened with war.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; says the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  &ldquo;Let us get down to bedrock.  Let us get down to brass tacks and deal with the problems immediately before the country, the problems of agriculture, of unemployment and so on.&rdquo;  Who interfered with these problems or with the efforts to solve them?  Was it the Fianna Fáil Party?  Not at all.  The President comes along with a sheaf of Bills under his arm and in ten minutes he introduces them here, and since the President came along with his Bills we have been discussing them night and day.  We have not interfered with them, but if one of these Bills is not passed somebody is going to fight somebody else.  There were problems before the Dáil of unemployment, etc.  There were motions down, such as the one dealing with widows' pensions, that could have been discussed.  We were perfectly willing to discuss them on their merits &mdash; we would be willing to stay up all night and discuss them. Did we get an opportunity?  Not at all.  There was something which, at some future time, by the will of the people might have affected the grip that another country has on this country and might have affected the position of the Executive Council. Hence the President comes along with a sheaf of Bills and since that time there has been no motion discussed in this House regarding unemployment, widows' pensions, agriculture or anything <Col N="1816" /> else.  The President can get us to stay up all night to talk about his Bills &mdash; to mutilate the Constitution.  They told us that when they were framing the Constitution they were absolutely incapable and incompetent &mdash; that is what it amounts to.  The Minister for Finance admitted that two Articles which were supposed to give power to the people were only the &ldquo;pipe dreams&rdquo; of faddists &mdash; useless things. We have been told for the last couple of weeks that they were useless.  Still, because of these two Articles something might happen sometime.  Hence the President must interrupt the work of the Dáil, hold up the work of the country, hold up his own Estimates, and stultify the work of the people's representatives, in order that these Bills shall be passed.  Because there was delay in passing a certain Bill he tells us that there is going to be a war. How valiant he is if there is a threat of war from any section of the Irish people, but the President is not so valiant if there is a threat of war from any other country.</P>
    <P>Why should anyone in this country wage war against anyone else if this Bill is not passed?  The Minister for Lands and Agriculture &mdash; the Punchinello &mdash; has not told us.  In his usual bantering way he has tried to get the people's &ldquo;goat&rdquo;&mdash; I will put it that way &mdash; but he has certainly made no contribution to the debate.  He has given no strong reason for anything that has been put forward by the President.  I could not class the statement made by the Minister for Finance as an argument.  Surely the President is not going to have the audacity to tell us that he put up any argument?</P>
    <P>I know he is audacious and that he can pervert things in certain ways, but I certainly thought he had not the audacity to tell us that this is to be an argument for us.  Perhaps the President, if he gets an opportunity of trying to say a word or two later on, will tell us who is going to fight somebody else.  What is it all about?  I had some sort of notion that all the fighting men in the country were away in America. Where all the mythical legions are to come from is more than I know.  Perhaps the President would tell us and <Col N="1817" /> perhaps he would tell us again what is the urgency and hurry for all this. Why rush this motion along?  Why are we threatened with war if this thing is not done simply in the twinkling of an eye: it must be very urgent.  Does not the President know that there are 90,000 unemployed in this country, that these 90,000 are entered on the books of the Labour Exchanges without taking any account of the rest?  Does he not recollect that we have to vote money for several things that will be of benefit to the country?  Why could not the President go on with the job?  Why blame us for holding up the Dáil when he himself is holding it up with his footy Bills?  If the President or the Minister for Lands and Agriculture wants to come down to bedrock and deal with urgent problems that affect the country we are perfectly willing to go ahead with them and after a twelve hours' day if the President came here and said, &ldquo;We will have to sit on until eight in the morning,&rdquo; we will sit on to solve these problems.  But this does nothing to solve the problems of the country.  This is not the way the country should be held up in its work. By introducing Bills &mdash; if you like I will make you a present of the fact &mdash; to amend your own defective Constitution from your own point of view the Government is wasting time.  If the Constitution was defective from the point of view of having these Articles included in it they are wasting the time of the country now by trying to amend it. They have wasted three weeks of the country's time in trying to do something which should not have been done according to them.  Still, we have Deputy Thrift and the Minister for Lands and Agriculture and the whole bunch telling us, &ldquo;Let us get down to bedrock and discuss the immediate problems that confront us in the country.&rdquo;  If they want to put anything across the country quietly, if they want to give anything away the same as they gave our people in the North away, they say, &ldquo;Do not discuss politics; let us do that <i>sub rosa.</i> Carry on the good work.  Mind the bread-and-butter problems all the time, because we can keep on working the hidden hand behind the scenes.  We can do what selling is necessary and we <Col N="1818" /> can get all the damn good bargains necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the President, if he is going to wind up this debate, will give some reasons and some explanation to the House why this holding up of the country so long is necessary.  Perhaps he would tell us why he has left men walking the streets and starving, and why he has held up the Estimates, why he has held up every Deputy who should be doing the work of the country.  Perhaps he will explain that, and afterwards, if he succeeds in convincing his own automatic voting machine, as I would call it, perhaps he would go to the country and come upon a platform and convince the country that he was perfectly right in holding up the work of the country, perfectly right in seeing people starving because they were unemployed, and seeing the good work of the country held up in order to cut Articles out of the Constitution which should have been left in, or else never should have been put in.  They were put in there for the express purpose of &ldquo;pulling the wool&rdquo; over the eyes of the Irish people.  It has come to the stage now when the President thinks it is perfectly safe to remove the wool, and so the President has brought in two Bills to remove it; that is all there is to it.  The President thinks the time is opportune to tear away the mask and expose himself to the people.  Perhaps he will tell the people why he held up the country so long in having this removed, and why he is telling the country now that if we get the wind up and pass this Bill everything will be right, but if not we are faced with immediate and terrible war.  Perhaps the President will try to explain his own words, when he said definitely and clearly, &ldquo;I shall not allow the people of this country to be threatened by any threat or force.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To-day we buried Articles 47 and 48 of the Constitution, and those of us who were present at the funeral will recollect that the scenes which were enacted at that funeral were not scenes which one would expect to witness at any burial.  This evening, on resuming, we had sufficient evidence before us that the corpse which we buried in the forenoon session <Col N="1819" /> was a corpse of something which died an unnatural death, and already the spirit is haunting us, and consequently the necessity to exorcise that spirit.  Hence we have a Resolution from the President.  It is hoped that by that resolution, or motion, everything will be made safe for all time in the future.  In common with many of my colleagues on these Benches I again want to ask members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party to point out, or give some scintilla of evidence of the truth of their fears, that the defeat of this motion is going to lead to bloodshed in the country.  I challenge my colleague for North Dublin City to tell me how the defeat of President Cosgrave's motion is going to lead to revolution in the North City.  Except it is going to be the revolution of &ldquo;Shamrock shovels&rdquo; I cannot for the life of me think that there is any serious danger of the slightest disturbance of the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion in this House I did warn the Government that they were taking an action which was likely to lead to serious disturbance.  That was when we were debating the adjournment for a period of three months last November, and when we had ample proof of the fact that there were thousands of people in the city on the verge of starvation and on the verge of despair, in such a condition of poverty and misery that one really did fear, and had good cause to fear, that the peace might be disturbed and that the good order of the community might be disturbed, and when I put forward that view and appealed to the Government to continue in session, to continue to keep the doors of this House open and to continue giving us and any other Deputy in this House who desired to do so an opportunity of suggesting ways and means of alleviating those pitiable conditions, I was met with the sneers of the Ministers.  As a matter of fact those sneers are all we have ever received since we came in here.  Perhaps it is best so.  Let them continue sneering. The line of demarcation, at any rate, is being kept very clear between those who stand for the people's rights and those who either have not the courage to do so or who are deliberately <Col N="1820" /> conniving at denying the people their rights.</P>
    <P>The manner in which Article 47 and Article 48 have been abolished and the methods that accompanied their abolition are sufficient proof that we are under the heel of a tyrannical Government. Someone, I think, on one occasion named it the Cooper-Cosgrave-Jacob Government.  Those three interests combined are working insidiously day and night for the purpose of getting into their control all the resources of this country.  Presumably when the motion is passed they will have secured an obedient majority in this House to carry out their dictates whenever the necessity arises.  But I really do submit, in all sincerity, that it is fair and just to ask the Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, those who still have the audacity to go through the country talking to the people on occasions, to give us some statement in the matter, no matter how brief, justifying their support for this motion. The only point which the Minister for Agriculture made in supporting the motion, so far as I gathered, was that he feared if it were defeated the people would have to submit to the rantings of Deputy Flinn.  There are two ways of looking at that statement.  I think one can see it in the light in which the Minister did not intend.  The rantings of Deputy Flinn are nothing more or less than an expression of the desire in the hearts of the people for their rights.  That is the very kind of ranting which the Minister certainly does not want to hear.  He is prepared to take all necessary steps to prevent such ranting.  He has to submit to it here, however, but he hopes that that ranting will be so altered in its context that by the time the people see it in the Press, they will view it as ridiculous and without any point.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy who sat here listening to Deputy Flinn to-day, and who could not see and understand the various points with which he dealt, and dealt clearly and intelligently, is certainly not worthy of occupying a position in the Ministerial ranks.  With reference to the scenes which were witnessed here to-day, let those who regret those scenes understand the cause.  If they <Col N="1821" /> come to understand the cause, then perhaps we will be able to avoid it in future.  The cause of those scenes was the deliberate flouting of the people's rights by the Ministers in their action in bringing to a close the discussion on such an important motion.  That was a flagrant disregard of our view-point. I, at any rate, gather when that incident occurred here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCooney" hpid="Mr. COONEY Mr. COONEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COONEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, then.  I want to quote President Cosgrave, and if he were here present to remind him &mdash; but I see he is absent &mdash; that he gave an interview to the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; some months ago, in which he said: &ldquo;You can tell your people that all is well in the Free State.&rdquo;  Those were the exact words.  I committed them to memory at the time.  His statements in America were also worthy of recollection. He took the trouble when in America to endeavour to convince the people that he and his Ministry had secured peace, order and stability.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking here yesterday, made the very same statement.  &ldquo;We have brought you peace,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;We have established all the institutions of Government in this country.  We have established the will of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does he reconcile that statement with his attitude here to-day, and that of his colleagues, in asking this House to pass a motion on the pretence that if it is not passed we are going to <Col N="1822" /> have an immediate upheaval?  We are asked to pass a motion with reference to an alteration in the Constitution, the Constitution for which so many sacrifices were made, and to which, he alleges, they had won the people's allegiance either through love or fear.</P>
    <P>Talking of mandates, it is interesting to recall the fact that in the June election from various platforms we asked the people to give us a mandate to come in here without subscribing to a particular condition of entry.  We said that every vote cast for our candidates would be an indication of the people's approval of that method.  We challenged from those platforms any representative of the Government to come forward and deny the people the right to give us that mandate.  We challenged them from the platforms and in the Press, and never did we hear one Minister or one representative of the Government deny that the people had the right to give us that mandate. The fact that they returned some forty-five Deputies was proof that they did give those forty-five a definite and clear mandate.  We know how that mandate was treated and how those Deputies were received when they came up here.  That was one of the series of proofs of the respect which these Ministers have for the will of the people.  We can go on for another little while, of course, as long as this machine remains, protesting against and submitting to these sneers, to this contempt, deceit and cheating.  We can continue to do so, but, as the late Terence MacSwiney said, it is not with those who can inflict most, but those who can endure most, that victory will ultimately rest.  We are enduring here on behalf of the people insults from day to day.  We will continue that, because we are confident that the policy for which we stand, and the methods which we are following, both being founded upon truth, must ultimately win out.</P>
    <P>This is called, I suppose, a motion of peace.  I can use an appropriate quotation under that heading which was uttered on another occasion by the late Padraig Pearse.  It is an appropriate quotation, just by changing it from a motion of peace and using the words <Col N="1823" />&ldquo;a place of peace.&rdquo;  This is a place of peace where men are supposed to speak with all charity and with all restraint, but I hold it a Christian thing to hate evil, to hate untruth.  Those are the things which we have been listening to here to-day.  To hate evil, to hate untruth, to hate oppression, and, hating these things, we must strive to overthrow them.  The defenders of this realm have worked well, the late Padraig Pearse said, in secret and in the open.  They think that they have pacified Ireland.  They think that they have purchased half of us and intimidated the other half.  They think that they have foreseen everything. Oh, how true that is of the attitude of the Ministry here to-day.  They think that they have foreseen everything and provided against everything; but they are fools; they have left our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds its graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.</P>

      <P>We have listened to the great hero of the fight, Deputy Hugo Flinn, and we endeavoured to take down the great arguments he made as to why this motion should not be passed.  On these Benches we have a learned professor of a certain University and, as a matter of curiosity, I asked him to be good enough to take out the main arguments of the speech.  He told me the only arguments he could find were not actually arguments, but, at the same time, they were the main things upon which the whole speech was based.  The Deputy referred to dumb driven cattle and a frigid calculated lie.  These were all he put before us this evening as a reason why this very important measure should not be passed with the consent of the House.</P>

      <P>We were asked here to accept a petition from the opposite side of the House, a petition to violate a Treaty-barred Article of the Constitution.  I think it is time that this House should realise that the plot and plan of Fianna Fáil, insidious as it may have appeared in the guise of constitutionalism, was well known to those sitting behind the front benches on this side of the House.  We are not such a silly pack of fools as perhaps Deputies on the other side may take us to be.  We have some little intelligence left to understand the difference and to understand the wisdom or the folly of the two courses that have been presented to this House.  Two courses were presented to this House, one in the shape of a petition, and the other in the shape of the motion we are now considering.  If we had followed in the first instance this great piece of constitutionalism presented in the motion moved by the leader of the Opposition, what would have been the consequences to this country?  Deputy de Valera <Col N="1826" /> told us that we could, by constitutional means, remove this Treaty-barred Article from the Constitution.  Deputy de Valera told us that within the Constitution the people had certain rights, the exercise of which would solve all the internal dissensions of the country. Deputy de Valera knows as well as I do that there is not a scintilla of truth in that statement; Deputy de Valera knows as well as I do that the special Article which he wanted to remove from the Constitution was, as has been admitted by Deputies on the opposite side to-day, a Treaty-barred Article of the Constitution.</P>

In the debate on the Constitution (No. 10) Bill I was ruled out of order for dealing with Article 17, and I protested most vehemently when the leader of the Opposition dealt with that Article when I was debarred from dealing with it.  The same position is now presented to me.  If we are to reply to arguments put forward from the other side some liberty of debate must be given to us, and surely, we are not stretching the patience of the Chair in anything we say.</P>

We were asked to do one thing by the Opposition, and we are asked to do another thing in the motion that is now before us.  Each of these is relevant to the other.  It is almost impossible to discuss one without discussing the other, and I suggest that if I <Col N="1827" /> am to reply effectually to any little arguments that have been put forward from the opposite side I must deal with the case as it now stands.  If this issue is brought into the country and if I have to expound it to the citizens of North Dublin, what will I have to say to them?  Will I be afraid to meet members of the Fianna Fáil Party on constitutional issues?</P>

Will I be afraid to tell them that within the Constitution no such power exists as Deputies opposite claim?  These are the plain constitutional issues before us that are involved in this motion, and also in the Petition.  We will tell the people frankly that the Petition which was presented a few weeks ago had one object, and one object only, that was to disrupt the Treaty, to disrupt the Constitution and to disrupt the whole State.</P>

      <P>I suppose there are Deputies who do not look on this as being of very great importance. There are others who look on it as being, I suppose, of average importance, and a good few who look upon is as a very serious business.  The constitutional history of most countries is largely comprised of contests between people and governments for the people's rights.  The people generally succeeded.  They wrung their rights from kings and other forms of government. In Ireland, for the last five or six years, we seem to have more or less reversed the position, and the Government seem to have embarked on a campaign of wringing rights from the people.  This motion we are dealing with is one which should give rise to very serious consideration.  We have, for the last three or four months, at times embarked on serious economic problems.  We made efforts to solve these problems, and I believe that is really what the people of Ireland want. They do not possess a very large number of rights, but simply because their economic position is in such a state, they do not seem to have the heart to look for these things.  But I believe that this particular motion should not be necessary.  When the Constitution was being framed certain individuals, I suppose, proposed certain clauses. <Col N="1830" /> These men must have been convinced that they were good and would be useful things, or else they would not have been put there.  I do not think it is an argument that can be used, that these men were not sensible, that they were not statesmen.  I am quite confident that these men could foresee, and did foresee, that some great advantages could be derived from these clauses, but for some reason or other, when a section of the nation proceeded to make use of these clauses, and proceeded to test them, immediately we had all the economic policy thrown to the winds, and there was a mad rush to embark on amendments of the Constitution, and on bringing in motions for safety.  We have been at this for the last three or four weeks, and, as I say, the most important things have been left completely out of the question. Really I believe that the policy at the back of all this is a policy of mere political convenience.  These clauses would not have been put into the Constitution if it was not intended that some use would be made of them, and if it was not intended that the use that was to be made of them would be good for the country, so that it leads me to believe that it is simply a matter of political convenience.  I believe that the judges of this will be the people of the future, or some historian, who will be inclined to put it down to being a matter simply of political convenience.  What will be the feeling amongst the people of Ireland, who are really hard pressed &mdash; what will be the feeling in the United States, where they were told that we were prosperous, or, at least, that we had turned the famous corner, when they read that this Bill, passed by the Dáil, is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace and safety?  They, just as the people down the country, will, I am sure, begin to wonder where the danger lurks, where the danger lies of this terrible eruption that this particular motion is supposed to save. That is not the way to bring about the economic revival of the country.</P>

    <P>The real effect of this will be to tighten credit.  I understand it has been inclined to get a little freer lately. The real effect this will have, as I said, will be to tighten that credit.  Capitalists <Col N="1831" /> are not inclined to invest money in a country that has such motions as these tabled.  The reason given is that it is necessary to hurry this.  What is the necessity for hurry, or why should it be there at all?  If, as I said, the effect is to disturb credit in a country that is already famishing for the want of that credit, I believe it is a very wrong thing for this House to pass. It is strange that after all the talk we have heard, after all the good prospects that have been held out to us, we should be faced to-day with a motion of this description.  It is really a disheartening thing for a nation already disheartened.  There is no danger. They do not want any such precautions as these, because there is no danger of anything like a disturbance of public safety or of public peace.  We simply availed ourselves of what was there for the purpose of being availed of.  Why was it put there if it is wrong to avail of it, and why was not this Article taken out when the mistake was discovered, or when it was found that it was unhealthy and bad for the Constitution of this nation to have it there?  That brings me back to giving the same reason &mdash; I cannot find any other for it &mdash; that it is simply a matter of political convenience.  Another reason that I could give for it would be this: Young governments are inclined to embark on such expeditions. They imagine, I suppose, like young people, that they are complete masters of the art of government.  The art of government consists of a good deal of consistency.  It consists a good deal in creating in the people a belief that the Constitution is a sacred thing.  It has been taught that it is a sacred thing. It will not sound very well amongst the people if in a few days' time they are told that we are able to wipe away two or three clauses of this particular Constitution. The people will imagine, and quite justly that any number of clauses can be wiped away in the same fashion, and they can always say to themselves: &ldquo;Well, such-and-such a clause is there this week, but it will probably vanish next week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one thing that will weaken the whole position, and it is the one thing that young and inexperienced <Col N="1832" /> governments embark upon.  As I have said, the people expect consistency in Governments, that there will be a certain amount of consistency in the Constitution, and that the rights they had in the Constitution will be preserved and defended by their representatives. My reason for intervening in this debate was that I felt it was necessary that I, on behalf of the people I represent, should make my protest against the quick and unreasonable change proposed in the present Constitution. The people believe that not only had they rights, but that it was their duty to exercise them.  What has been the result of that?  That in two or three weeks the whole Constitution has been changed, and those particular Articles are wiped out just because the people attempted to take advantage of what they had a perfect right to take advantage of.  The Minister for Agriculture made some remarks on the necessity of giving up political discussions. We did not raise any political discussions here.  We did not raise this as a political discussion, but simply tried to carry out, in a perfectly legal and orderly manner, what we were led to believe we had a perfect right to do.  That is what has caused all these discussions that have taken place during the last three weeks.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture is right that political discussions should be eliminated, and that what the people need are purely industrial and economic discussions.  I say it is very difficult for people to settle down to industrial and economic discussions as long as the present Government continue amending and eliminating clauses from the Constitution, especially the clause that a portion of these people consider they have a perfect right to use and enjoy.  The Minister for Agriculture also spoke of decisions by the people on what are fundamentals. Now what is fundamental to the Constitution and what is fundamental to the people from the people's point of view is eventually what will win out. What may be fundamental to a particular Party under the Constitution is quite another thing.  The people are generally always wiser and are always right, and it is the people of this <Col N="1833" /> country who will eventually decide what is fundamental to them, and what they believe are the fundamentals will be the fundamentals of the Constitution. I agree thoroughly with the leader of the Labour Party that this motion is a blemish on the name of the Irish people, that it is a motion that should never have been brought in here. I believe it is a motion that will do harm to the credit of this country, and if it does that it is doing very serious injury indeed.  These are my reasons for opposing the motion.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all, but Deputy J.J. Byrne left me no option.  I flatter myself, whether it is a thing on which I should flatter myself or not, on being a constitutionalist, a full-blooded, die-in-the-ditch constitutionalist, and when I see the Constitution of this State being riddled, as it has been for the past few weeks, I am somewhat perturbed.  When I see the motion that is on the Order Paper to-day asking that this Bill should not go through the ordinary procedure and should not be referred to the people, I ask myself what is the reason for it. I must say that I got no answer whatever when listening to any of the Ministers who spoke.  I got no answer until Deputy J.J. Byrne spoke and, no doubt, as he always does, he voiced the true feelings and the true opinions of the Government Party.  He said that there were certain inter-dependent clauses in the Constitution over which we had no control.  These are his words, not mine.  Therefore, the Irish people who, we were told, had complete control in their own house, who had complete control over the Constitution, and complete control over their freedom and destinies, have no control over the Constitution.  The Deputy let the cat out of the bag.  He said that, seeing that we have no control over certain inter-dependent clauses in the Constitution therefore we must not submit these things to the people, and that is the reason I see why there is anxiety on the part of the Executive Council in getting this motion through the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not tell the people that, what certain parties in this country <Col N="1834" /> have been telling them for the past seven or eight years, is a terminological inexactitude.  I do not want to quote Deputy Flinn.  I want to use another phrase that we got from another place like the Constitution probably.  It is with some regret that I say that, because I did think that there was never any use in belittling what we had won.  I think there was never any use in making little of the Treaty or the Constitution framed within the Treaty.  I did think that we could make each advance a starting point towards something else.  I thought that we could model the Constitution so as to give us greater and fuller freedom, but now I find, on the words of the learned spokesman of the Government Party, that there are clauses in the Constitution that we dare not touch, that there are conditions governing us from outside, and that there are people of greater importance than the Irish people in this Constitution, that the Treaty is of greater importance than the Irish people, and that we dare not submit certain clauses of it to them.  That is exactly what Deputy Byrne told us, and it is a source of some regret to me that that is the case. That is the reason why I think we should not allow this motion to go through.  If there are clauses in the Constitution over which the Irish people have no control there should not be such clauses.  Deputy Byrne ought to be the last man to try and have them in a Constitution governing the lives and liberties of the Irish people. They should not be there without the sanction of the Irish people or having been submitted for their sanction.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with what is in the Constitution of the Dominions.  I am sorry that Deputy Byrne is leaving.  I endeavoured to hold on while he was speaking, and I thought that he might pay the same compliment to me, and I might be just as interesting.  I am not concerned with what is in the Constitution of the Dominions or in the Constitution of monarchies.  What I am solely concerned with, and what the Dáil should be solely concerned with, is what the Irish people think should be in the Constitution. We should not model our Constitution on that of Australia, Canada, or anywhere else, but upon what the Irish people think should be in it.  We should not be afraid to submit any Article of the Constitution to them and say, &ldquo;This is the freedom we asked you to sacrifice so many lives for.  This is the Constitution we asked you to engage in war for.  This is the Constitution which those who defended it and put before you said was the whole Constitution and every comma of the Constitution,&rdquo; knowing at the same time that there were clauses in it over which they had no control, according to the statement of Deputy Byrne. So, therefore, it is outside influence that still controls us and is still our master.  I wish to make my protest against this attempt to prevent the Irish people from having a say in any of the clauses of the Constitution.  They should have their say in them, and this attempt to take from them that right is the only reason I can see for this motion.  Therefore this motion is an attempt to muzzle the Irish people and prevent them from having their say.  That is the only thing that is in danger.  The public safety is not in danger, but the reputation, the character and the veracity of those people who stood for that Constitution is in danger, and that, I suggest, is the reason this motion is being rushed through the Dáil.  It is because there are inter-dependent clauses in the Constitution over which we have no control, that the reputation of the people who stood for that Constitution and recommended it to the Irish people knowing there were these inter-dependent clauses in it, that their honesty of purpose, their intelligence if you <Col N="1836" /> like, their life as a political Party, and nothing else, are in danger.  The public safety is perfectly safe, and the people are perfectly safe.  It is only the character of a political Party that is in danger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement that was most applauded here this evening was that by the Minister for Agriculture, a modern version of &ldquo;Get on with the work.&rdquo;  He said, and I think truly, that the country generally was fed up with politics, and that the people were much more concerned with questions of agricultural and industrial improvement at present.  Undoubtedly that is the case.  We here are not to be taken as not appreciating the desire of the people to get on with the work.  I believe we are at least as keen to get on with the work as the Government Deputies. I think I used the very same arguments as the Minister for Agriculture myself yesterday in regard to another Bill before the House.  I think I asked what was the importance of it, and whether there were not more urgent problems than settling the powers of the Seanad with regard to the holding up of Bills.</P>
      <P>Could not the present powers be left a little while longer, so that more urgent legislation could be attended to?  We appreciate the point made by the Minister for Agriculture, but we must remember that that cry to which he gave utterance has been familiar now for some six or seven years.  Notwithstanding all that the dominant Party have said on their platforms, and through their various organs of expression &mdash; the newspapers certainly have never missed an opportunity of pressing it home &mdash; there has not been that agricultural and industrial progress. The point arises then whether you can have agricultural and industrial progress merely by crying out for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are there not other things to do than merely talk about agricultural progress?  Are there not other things to be considered?  Are there not deeper motives in the people?  Are there not longings and yearnings higher than the mere desire for bread and butter?  Have they not to be satisfied before agricultural or industrial <Col N="1837" /> progress can be achieved?  I think the Government more or less realises that these longings do prevail.  The Minister for Agriculture is a realist, and as a practical man he has to take this into account.  He must be conscious of some mystic character in the people because we remember that only last Sunday week, I think, one of his fellow-Ministers went down in state to Tone's grave and gave an idealistic address on Tone, and he tried to connect up Tone with the present position in Ireland. I wonder was that done simply as a pastime, or was it a recognition that there was something in the people other than a desire for bread and butter?  If the Minister is the realist and practical man he pretends to be &mdash; the man that the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; praises him so much as being &mdash; is he not very impatient of that ceremonial at Bodenstown? I think that it is all a pretence of realism and practicality, and he too is uneasy.  He feels that it is not enough to say &ldquo;Get on with the work,&rdquo; that the people do not respond to a mere commonplace, superficial thing like that, for he is far too deep a man not to realise that that as a cry is a failure, that it gets nowhere, and that it attracts nobody.</P>
    <P>If he comes along with a programme that is repugnant to them, to their traditions and aspirations, no matter how willing they are, they will not welcome him if he has that programme as part of his policy.  I think it is quite safe to say that the Minister realises that, and that speech of his to-day was merely an effort to appeal to the superficial qualities of Deputies in the House, to appeal to the superficial inclinations and aspirations of people. Well, as I have said, the cry, &ldquo;Get on with the work&rdquo; has been going on. We are here very eager to get on with the work.  We feel stability is an important thing; it is more important to the people on these benches than to the Deputies opposite because many of us here are not, as many of the other Deputies on the other side are, men of property.  We have to live by earning our living and to those who are not professional politicians who have to live by day-to-day labour, stability is an important thing.  To me, anyway, it is a desirable thing, and I know <Col N="1838" /> many Deputies of my Party for whom I can say the same, but we know stability can only be attained on certain conditions.  We know what we have been doing this week and last week is not going to lead to stability, to agricultural or industrial improvement. There are many, low as the vitality of the country is at present, many thousands who are watching this debate and the progress of things here, and when they see what is being done this week they will not be encouraged, they will not feel that they have at last reached stability and done with politics.  So far from that, in my opinion it is going to be a very disturbing element.  The fact that such an unconstitutional thing can be done under the name of constitutionalism, the fact that a Government because it has a small majority in this House, can make use of that majority to carry a ridiculous motion like this without putting up a single argument to support it, without making a pretence that it has any truth or reality behind it, such action is going to make people disappointed. These people may not be the majority of the people, but they are key people; their influence is going to tell, and instead of establishing the Constitution, instead of making people feel that anyhow the way is now clear for evolutionary progress, that things are going at least to proceed in a normal way, I think a great many people will feel more disappointed and dissatisfied with conditions than ever. There will be very few in the country satisfied with the statement that if those two Bills were carried to the country and a vote of the people were asked it would lead to disturbance and disorder.  I do not think there are very many fools in the country who will be deceived by that cry.</P>
    <P>Two general elections were fought last summer, one under rather extraordinary conditions sprung at a moment's notice.  There was, I admit, on both sides very strong propaganda, in posters, newspapers and so on, of the matter appertaining to the election which tended to develop excitement if the tendency to excitement were there at all.  Yet, we found those two elections passed off in an almost model <Col N="1839" /> fashion.  Now within the past week there have been local elections conducted throughout the country and local elections have often led to something like disorder and to a great deal of excitement.  You find the newspaper comment is almost universally agreed that there was apathy on the part of people and that there was no interest in elections, 30 per cent., voted in some part of Meath, 32 per cent. in some other part and so on.  Yet the Government tell us that if this harmless Initiative and Referendum, this product of faddists like the Chief Justice, Senator Douglas, and Judge Murnaghan is to be explained to the people and they are asked to vote there will certainly be such excitement and disorder as will endanger the peace of the country.  Deputy J.J. Byrne and a few others may be deceived by it, but I think if one could see into the hearts of the Government's supporters at present, they do not feel too happy with the case put up for it. Certainly, when Deputy J.J. Byrne asked what was he to say to the electors of North City I felt like telling him that if he minded as little what he said to the electors of North City as he minded what he told a public meeting in Donnybrook last September it should not worry him much.  But I suppose Deputy Byrne's remarks did not influence a great many people and we need not worry about them.  Anyway, I have heard no case made out for this resolution.  I think if it is passed it is going to have a most unfortunate effect.  As one who believes in evolutionary progress; that great progress can be made here if things were conducted in a normal way, I believe it will be a most unfortunate thing if this resolution is passed and that it will create discontent and contempt for the Constitution and contempt for representative government. It will do nothing but injury, and if I thought I would influence anyone not to vote for it I would appeal very strongly to him to think, at least two or three times, before he gives his consent to the measure.</P>

      <P>It was not fair for the Government to suddenly announce that there was going to be serious disorder in this country unless there was a danger of serious trouble, probably revolution and rebellion, and to keep this fact hidden for years past.  I understood from the President that the dangerous people in this country had their teeth drawn, that murder was by the throat, and that we had reached a condition of stable government, that we had turned corners until we were as tired turning them as we are tired turning around the lobbies here.  He boasted down the country, and so did every member of his Party, that we had arrived at a stage when law and order were supreme, that there was no fear or danger that people would object to law in any way except the constitutional way.  Suddenly, and without any notice, he comes along here to this sovereign Assembly and tells us that there is an extreme danger of revolution and trouble.  Really, I cannot understand it, considering the amount of money that has been spent on the Army and the very efficient Civic Guard force that we have, considering the amount of money that was spent in stabilising the Government and the <Col N="1841" /> number of speeches that were made proving to the people that we had stable government.  We suddenly discover now that we have not, that there is grave danger that this State is going to fall unless a certain Bill is passed within a certain number of hours.  It is up to the President to take some precaution to prevent this state of anarchy or chaos or, as one of his Party said, &ldquo;chouse,&rdquo; arising here.  It is extraordinary, if this country is on the edge of a volcano, that we are going to allow games like the Tailteann Games to be played and visitors to be brought into a country that is in such a troubled state, that we are going to allow visitors from all over the Continent and from America to be brought in here, to endanger their lives for the sport of the thing.  It is strange that boxers are being brought over from Germany to box the Civic Guards, unless it is to train them for this terrible thing that is going to happen.  Then there is the reception for the airmen. Really, it is a very serious question, much more serious than the passing of this Bill.  I believe if there is such a danger of trouble in the country that the Tailteann Games, the Aonach an Ghárda, and all these receptions and sports should be stopped, and that serious measures should be taken to prevent this danger that is going to arise.  Another thing, there are a lot of innocent men like myself, Deputies up from the country, who should be allowed to go home.  If there is going to be such a serious state of affairs within the next few days I think we should be allowed to go home.  I am sure Deputy McDonogh will thoroughly agree with me in that, if he never agreed with me before.</P>

I was at home yesterday at an election.  I have heard a lot of people talking about the desire of the people to vote at elections, but yesterday in Galway scarcely 42 per cent. of the electors voted.  In the urban area some of the people refused to vote for the County Council.  They said they did not care about it or know anything about it. Yet we are told that these are the people who are so anxious to have another try at the Dáil.  What the Minister for Agriculture said here to-day is the thing that is going to influence the country.  The people want peace; they want to be allowed to go on with their work, and this hot air and nonsense we hear from the other benches goes for nothing.  What good do these men do?  I employ more men than the whole lot of them over there, and do more good.  Yet we have this little whipper-snapper from Carraroe giving cheek.  I do not intervene in those discussions.  All this discussion is simply a waste of time and for the purpose of obstruction.  We are anxious to go home.  Of course they have nothing much to do at home.  I do not want to take part in discussions that end nowhere, and the sooner you people on the other side realise it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Just as the President comes along and tells us about the furniture he has in his house, and as some other men come along and tell us about some other attributes we will have someone else coming along and telling us to go on with the work and not to mind this political talk.  The Minister for Agriculture told us here to-day that he had the key to the situation, why we were always wanting to have some political subject before the people, because we were afraid to come down to the economic subject.  First of all it is not our fault that these political subjects are before the Dáil. <Col N="1844" /> We did not introduce any of these political subjects.  We were quite satisfied to go on with the economic programme. These Bills were not brought in by us.  We are prepared to-night or to-morrow to discuss the motions down in our own names, to answer for economic programme if the Government are prepared to face us on it.  It is over three months since I asked the President for a special day to discuss a motion that is down in my name.  It has no political significance whatever. It is purely an economic matter.  But the President said he had not time, yet he has time to come along here and tell us that the Referendum and Initiative would endanger the public peace and safety.  There are other motions down here.  There is a motion in the names of Deputies de Valera and Sean Lemass asking that some consideration be given to the flour milling industry.  It is only within the last couple of weeks that a flour mill was closed down in Rathdrum.  That thing is allowed to go on.  Flour mills are closing down and men are thrown out of employment who are not lucky enough to have people like Deputy McDonogh to employ them.</P>

      <P>That is what I say, that the people in Rathdrum are not lucky enough to have persons like Deputy McDonogh to employ them.  While these people are facing unemployment we are brought here to talk about the Referendum and the Initiative being dangerous to the public peace and safety.  There are other resolutions on the Order Paper also, not only from our Party, but from the Labour Party. There is one which, if brought forward for discussion, might have a political tinge as well as an economic effect, but, if it could be carried out, it would save this country £3,000,000 a year.  The Minister for Agriculture accused us of keeping this political bogey before the people and of trying to get the people worked up on political subjects to keep their mind off the advantages to be derived from supporting the present Government.  Yet, as somebody remarked, for the last six or seven years, <Col N="1845" /> while all this talk was going on and while this programme was being put into force, nobody in this House or anywhere else could see an improvement in the economic conditions of the people. We have been accused by Deputy McDonogh and others about our conduct in this Dáil.</P>

      <P>The sooner the better. We have been taken to task here about our conduct, and were told that we could not conduct ourselves in this House.  Perhaps if we were imbued with a little of the courtesy of the President, and referred to our opponents as toe-rags, we might be all right.  We are opposing these Bills as best we can, and we believe that they are an infringement on the rights of the Irish people, and, if any of us have got into trouble during that opposition, we cannot help it.  There have been very few Deputies&mdash;I do not know any on the opposite side&mdash;who have got down to the motion before the House and tried to show what is the real danger to the public peace and safety if these two Bills are not passed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from some of the speeches on the opposite side that Deputies do not realise or do not know what this motion is about.  They do not <Col N="1846" /> realise that the motion implies that unless the Referendum and the Initiative are removed from the Constitution there will be an immediate danger to the public peace and safety, that unless these two Articles which have been in the Constitution for practically six years are removed there will be a danger to the public peace and safety.  That is what we are asked to vote on, on this question.  We are accused of threatening but I do not think we have ever made such a silly threat as that&mdash;that there is going to be public commotion or danger to the public peace and safety unless these two Articles are removed from the Constitution.  It has not been shown that there will be.  As a matter of fact Deputy McDonogh told us that there is absolute apathy at the local elections and that there is only between a 30 and 40 per cent. vote.  If there is going to be that apathy, if a Referendum is taken, where is the commotion to come from?  There might be some justification for this motion if Deputy McDonogh came back from the country and told us that the people were scrambling round the polling booths, that 98 per cent. had voted and that the other 2 per cent. were knocked out of action and could not poll, but that did not happen and there is no necessity at all for it.  But they have a reason of their own.  It is because the Government are afraid that there would be apathy amongst their followers to defeat this, if a Referendum were taken on the question.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Agriculture that there were not five people in the country to-day interested in the Initiative or the Referendum. Yet, these five people are going to work up what must amount practically to a rebellion if there is to be a Referendum. Five or six people are interested; the other 3,000,000 do not care about it, but these five or six people are going to endanger the public peace and safety if this question is put to a Referendum. That is the sort of argument put up from the Galway Deputies.  I do not know if we had contributions on the subject from any other constituency. Deputy J.J. Byrne from North Dublin did not deal with that aspect of the question.  He introduced himself as an authority on constitutional law and <Col N="1847" /> ruled anybody on this side of the House out as knowing nothing about constitutional law and he then went on to expound the subject of Dominion status. In that connection his exposition on Dominion status does give us an insight into what is really behind this motion.  What is really behind this motion is not that there is any danger to the public peace and safety in referring this particular Bill to the people, because everybody knows that a vote can be taken on that Bill with the greatest safety, but what the Government is afraid of, in case the Referendum and the Initiative were established, is their own safety.  That is what they are afraid of.  They are afraid of the <Col N="1848" /> public peace and safety, always meaning by the &ldquo;public peace and safety&rdquo; the peace and safety of the Government and the keeping of power by that Government. I do not remember that we used any threats on this matter; I have not heard any such threats used by anybody on this side of the House while I was present but I say that if they were used, we have certainly this to say, at any rate, that we did not use as silly and ludicrous a threat as the threat involved in the resolution before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  The Bill, I think, will be found by Deputies to be rather simple and uncomplicated. As to the main proposals, the first is with regard to the general powers, functions and duties of the Corporation.  Prior to the Local Government Act of 1898, all such powers, duties and responsibilities were vested in the Corporation.  After county councils had been set up under that Act, certain powers, duties and responsibilities were vested in county councils and, by analogy, these functions, duties and responsibilities were vested in the borough councils of different cities, and in the borough council of Cork.  So that at present we have certain powers, duties and responsibilities vested in the Corporation of Cork, and certain powers, duties and responsibilities vested in the council.  The Bill proposes to vest such powers, duties and responsibilities as are now vested in the Council in the Corporation, so that such powers, duties and responsibilities as are exercisable under the Council in Cork shall be vested in the Corporation.  It proposes that these powers, duties and responsibilities may be exercised in so far as some of them are concerned, on behalf of the Corporation through the Council, and that the others shall be exercised on behalf of the Corporation by the City Manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes a change in the mode of election, and the nature of the Borough Council that will be set up, and it proposes the appointment of a City Manager.  Generally, under modern conditions the problems that the communities of cities and urban areas have to solve, and the number of matters of a varied and intricate kind they have to attend to, are of such a nature that it has been found to require, in nearly all countries, a radical change in the type of machinery in order to get the work done.  In putting <Col N="1852" /> forward these proposals for the government of Cork City we are not influenced by any other considerations or by the experiences of any other country except this country.  The proposals are radical to a certain extent, but are not revolutionary.  They are not dictated by any experiences other than our own experiences here.</P>
    <P>The Borough Council of Cork that it is proposed to change consisted of 56 members who were elected in seven wards.  In one ward eleven members were elected; in two wards, ten; in one ward, seven, and in three wards, six.  In the 1920 election 46 out of the 56 members were elected with a quota of 306&mdash;that is, 46 of the 56 members required only 306 votes to elect them. The Corporation, as a whole, went out every three years.  It is quite clear under present circumstances that a council of 56 is too big to allow of close and prompt discussion of matters, and to have them dealt with in an efficient and satisfactory way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>AN LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>took the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>In the second place, where it was possible for a member to be elected to the Corporation by a quota of 306 and, in the case of ten by a quota of 208, it means that persons who are really representative, who would have the wholehearted support of a very large section of the city, as worthy of vesting responsibility in them for the management of city affairs, would find themselves in the Council on a level with a person who could only obtain the support of 200 or less votes in his own ward.  So that as well as the numbers being too great the real representative persons in the city, whatever class or section they represented, would find themselves on a level with people who, it must be clear, could not be regarded as so representative, and their work must of necessity be impaired by such a position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third place elections by wards must have blurred in members of the Corporation the city interests as a whole.  If they were of the type that took an interest in their own elections to the Council, rather than in the affairs of the city as a whole, there <Col N="1853" /> must have been a tendency to look after ward interests as against city interests as such.  The Corporation, as a whole, going out as one body every three years, created a gap in policy such as it seems advisable to avoid.  It has also to be taken into consideration that the old Council of 56 did a very considerable portion of its work through committees.  There were fifteen committees actually working in the Corporation and the work of these committees had to come before the council for ratification before their work actually came into effect.</P>
    <P>Then, on the machinery side, under the old system it is a fact that under our local Government organisation, as a whole, there is not a chief executive officer working under local authorities to control and guide the whole of the official staff in the councils.  In Cork there is a city engineer working more or less direct into the Council. You had a superintendent medical officer of health, an executive sanitary officer, you had an accountant who, to a greater extent, worked into the Town Clerk.  While the Town Clerk had an over-riding authority in a vague kind of way he had no clear statutory responsibility for the control of the staff and neither have the County Council Secretaries or any Town Clerks of boroughs.  There is, in fact, no such general control of the staff.  So that you had, in view of the work it had to do through its committees, a loose council system.  The different committees drew on their own sections of the staff, and, to a certain extent, the way in which the staff worked into the Council dissipated the staff in its organisation and the effectiveness of its work.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to replace a council of that type by a council of fifteen elected from the city as a whole, five being elected every year, so that in the first election, which it is hoped will take place towards the end of the year, five members will be elected.  Annually after that, in June, five members will be elected, each five going out three years after they have been elected.  So you will have a small Council elected by the city as a whole.  At present there are 27,236 local government electors in Cork.  At an election in which <Col N="1854" /> 75 per cent. would poll, the quota for the election of five persons would be 3,441.  That is, something approaching 3,000 votes at least would be required to put a representative on to the Cork Corporation, as against something like 300 under the system which it is proposed to supersede.  Then there is the yearly election, so that the Council would be a council of a size that would be thoroughly representative and would be thoroughly responsible because of the number of votes a person must get in order to be elected.</P>
    <P>It will be a size suitable for quick and nevertheless thorough deliberation. It will represent the city as a whole without any drawing aside of any part or section of the Council to ward interests or the interests that represent a part of the city alone.  With a yearly election you will have none of the desire to develop policies of one particular kind simply because the triennial election is coming along.  You will have a continuity of effort and a continuity of thought in the working out of the city's policy.  As well as that, the Bill proposes that a Manager will be appointed, and it proposes that such functions as are not directly reserved to the Council by this Bill, to which we will refer later, that these will be exercised by the Manager, who as well shall have control and direction of the staff. He shall be the chief executive officer functioning for the Council and for himself, and, in so far as he carries out some of the functions of the Corporation, he shall be the chief executive person controlling and directing the whole machinery of the staff that will be serving the Council.  Now it is proposed that certain of the functions of the Corporation will be reserved for direct exercise by the Council.  These functions are:</P>
    <P>(a)  the making of any rate or the borrowing of any moneys;</P>
    <P>(b)  the making, amending, or revoking of any by-law;</P>
    <P>(c)  the making of any order and the passing of any resolution by virtue of which any enactment is brought into operation in or made to apply to the Borough, and the revoking of any such order and the rescinding of any such resolution,</P>
    <P>(d)  the application to be made to <Col N="1855" /> any authority in respect of the making or revoking of any such order as aforesaid;</P>
    <P>(e)  the promotion or the opposing in the Oireachtas of any legislation affecting the Borough or any part of the Borough;</P>
    <P>(f)  the appointment or election of any person to be a member of any public body;</P>
    <P>(g)  Parliamentary and local elections;</P>
    <P>(h)  subject to the provisions of this Act, the appointment, suspension, and removal of the Manager and the granting of an allowance or gratuity to the Manager on his ceasing to be the Manager, and</P>
    <P>(i)  the determination of the amount of the salary and remuneration of the Lord Mayor.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains also a provision for such additional powers as two-thirds of the Corporation will recommend and decide at a meeting of which one month's notice will be given; such additional powers as they shall recommend should be reserved to the Council may be so reserved by the Minister with or without a local inquiry into the matter.  In the same way, subject to two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, such an order may be revoked or reserved powers may be transferred from the Council to the Manager.</P>
    <P>It may be presumed by some that certain powers are taken away from the Council which it is proper that they should have.  Very careful consideration has been given to the matter, and we are of opinion that these powers that have been quoted there cover anything that the Council may usefully require to have reserved to themselves for direct action.  If there are any other powers that should properly be regarded, or that experience might show might be better reserved for direct action by the Council we trust that experience in the actual working of the business of the Corporation under this arrangement will show what these are.</P>
    <P>The general effect, however, of reserving to the Corporation only certain <Col N="1856" /> powers is that it will give the Corporation time and opportunity to pay the fullest possible attention to the real big questions of policy and control in the city, so that the real big problem of the city will be thoroughly, carefully and fully investigated.  On the other hand, the provision of a City Manager with full powers of control over the staff, and the direction of the staff, will, we are satisfied, ensure to the Council that when it has reached decisions that it wants to carry out, it will have an effective and harmoniously organised machinery to carry out that work.  The effect on the general efficiency of the staff by having a Manager there who will be in complete control, and who will be in a position to take complete responsibility to the Council for it, must be beneficial. Hitherto, simply because of the loose organisation of the staff, and the various ways in which the different sections of the staff came in connection with different members or committees of the Council, merit did not always get the direct recognition that merit should get.  Circumstances of one kind or another tended to place the people who came in particular contact with committees and certain sections of the Council in a position for preferment that, under an ordinary sound and just organisation, they would not and should not come into.  In the same way when there were defects in the staff it often came about that public notice was drawn to these defects in the first instance without these defects coming under the review or check of any responsible officer.  And many an official was dragged into publicity and blamed in a way that was neither just nor desirable.</P>
    <P>If there are complaints to be found with the staff or with any part of the machinery of the Cork Corporation in future, the members of the staff will be assured that before there is any public criticism of them, either by the Council or elsewhere, these complaints will be thoroughly investigated by the Manager and any defects which might show themselves up in public can be remedied by the Manager before the trouble of publicity is incurred at all.</P>
    <P>The Bill arranges that where the <Col N="1857" /> Manager acts directly for the Corporation, where, under the old system the Council would act by resolution, the Manager shall act by Sealed Order.  It makes it one of the principal statutory duties of the Manager that he shall prepare the annual estimates, and it makes provision for a systematic consideration of these estimates by the Council at the proper time.  It makes provision that where the Council is of opinion that the estimates should be changed, and where in the opinion of the Manager such change would be prejudicial to the general interests of the City's work, the Council shall not take a decision on the matter but shall postpone the decision for fourteen days so as to allow a period of further consideration both by the Manager and the Council.  If after the expiration of fourteen days the Council still consider that the changes in the estimates that they propose should be made, the Council can make them.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the number of committees that were set up under the old Council. It would be possible I expect to do away with most of these committees.  At any rate such committees as the new Council wants to set up it has powers under the recent Local Government Act to set up. But the work formerly discharged by these committees may be much more effectively discharged by the Manager, who may be regarded for the purpose of certain classes of work as a constantly sitting committee who can be in constant touch with his officials.  He can have his material gathered to him for the purpose of decision without any restrictions with regard to notices of motions and such things.  Much of the work that would be done by the committees in the old days will be done much more promptly and much more effectively by the Manager under the present Bill.  In the very complicated working of City life to-day it is quite clear that prompt and frequent decision requires to be taken for very many matters that cannot possibly wait for the deliberation of a committee and subsequent ratification by the Council. There are other committees to which the old Borough Council nominated certain members of the Council.  The present Bill makes provision for the exception <Col N="1858" /> of one particular committee, that is a committee appointed under the County scheme prepared under the provision of the Local Government Temporary Provisions Act of 1923.</P>
    <P>The Council can appoint on such public bodies as it is due to appoint, or as in the old days it would be due to appoint, members of the Council, but under the provision of this Bill they can appoint persons who will not necessarily be members of the Council.  They will be persons who because of their particular qualification and particular experience can be expected to give the best possible type of service.</P>

If it is thought a housing scheme has to be carried out, or a waterworks scheme, the Council will first have to decide that such a scheme is necessary, and it will be the duty of the Manager to put up a scheme to the Council. Then it will be the duty of the Council to examine that scheme and decide that it is along the lines they consider proper before they vote money for it.  I think Deputies will find that in holding the powers of making the rates and borrowing money the Council retains full control over the Manager and his doings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>We are glad that at last local government is going to be given back to the people of Cork&mdash;very glad indeed.  We are rather sorry that it appears to be given so very grudgingly, as would appear from the fact that they are only to be allowed to elect five representatives at the start. I am in this rather difficult position in connection with this Bill, that we, as a Party, have not had an opportunity so <Col N="1860" /> far of considering it in detail.  We realise it is a very important matter, because it will probably be taken as a headline for local government elsewhere. We would like very much to have an opportunity which, up to the present, we have not had, of getting opinions from different parts of the country and having this matter really threshed out amongst ourselves before we come to deal with it here.  Speaking for myself, however, I may say that the general idea of separating the deliberative functions from the executive powers appears to me to be a good one.  It is an idea that I, personally, thought might be applied to a much wider sphere than merely to a sphere of city government.  I believe that when we come to examine this Bill in detail, when we come to examine the relations between the different powers that are reserved for the Council and the powers the Manager will have, and when we examine carefully where the ultimate control is to lie in all conditions, we may have a number of amendments to put in.  I believe on the whole these amendments will be of a scope that can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The first thing that strikes me is the grudging way in which local government is going to be given back. If we are going to have the deliberative and the executive functions separated, as I have indicated already, I favour that to the greatest extent that it is possible to have it, provided that the ultimate control does really lie in the hands of the people's representatives. When I examined the details that have occurred to me from a casual reading of the Bill, the first thing that strikes me is the grudging way it is proposed to give back to the people of Cork the right of governing themselves locally in their local affairs.  I think it is a wrong spirit and that it indicates the same idea that is obvious from all the Acts of the Executive from the day they got power.  Their whole idea is to concentrate as far as possible in themselves and now they want to concentrate in a very small body of people over whom ultimately the Minister here is going to have a great deal of control.</P>

      <P>The position is this, that it has been the practice to allow the municipality to divide the area under its jurisdiction into certain wards for election purposes, and in this case there is no Council to do so. Now, with five persons to be elected in the first year it will probably mean that there will be fifteen candidates and fifteen persons to be elected would probably mean forty-five candidates. I put to the Deputy the difficulty that there would be with a list of that size, unless the city were to be divided by the Local Government Department, and that is a thing that is certainly undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that thirty or forty names would be most confusing.  The alternative would be to divide up the city into north and south, or into three parts, and it would not be a desirable thing for the Minister for Local Government to undertake that task.  I doubt if he would like to do so.  It is a local matter, and it should be done on the advice of local persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that there is a certain amount of difficulty there, and at the moment I do not see a solution.  But at the same time I feel that it ought to be possible to get a solution so that there would not be at the start a Council of only five.  I might also say that, as regards the total number, I think that it is too small, if the functions of the Council are to be deliberative.  If their functions were to be of an executive character the number might be reasonable, but I think that <Col N="1862" /> there would be no harm at all in increasing that number.  After all, Cork is a fairly large city; you have a number of different interests in it that will want to be represented, and it would be only fair to give them representation. It seems to me that by this you are going to exclude the possibility of having the different interests that will be affected by civic government represented to voice their opinions.  That is my view.  I know that there are considerations of various kinds which go for limiting it to a fairly small number. The President has just mentioned one, the mere technical difficulty in regard to the election.  You have to choose between two evils&mdash;dividing up the City into wards, or having a large panel. As regards a large panel, if thirty or forty names are put before the people of Cork they will probably be local names, and in a campaign of that kind they ought to be able to recognise the different individuals concerned.  It would be a very different thing from a case where you had the whole country as an electoral area, as we had in the Seanad election, but even there I do not believe that there would really be so much confusion at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number I had in my mind was twenty or twenty-five.  That would be a fair number.  If you make allowance for those who will necessarily be absent from meetings, who would probably average four or five, it would reduce it to a working number of about twenty, if the number elected was twenty-five.  If you have fifteen you will have a number absent of necessity, no matter how anxious they are to attend, and that would bring the number in attendance down to about ten or eleven&mdash;ten or eleven men deliberating and really acting as a legislative body for the City.  I think that number would be too small, that the framers of this Bill and of this scheme have gone to the other extreme as regards the number, and for my own part&mdash;I am speaking absolutely for myself, without having the opportunity that I would like of consulting other members of the Party who are more closely acquainted with details of local government than I am, because I can only deal with general principles as far as my knowledge of local administration goes from being in the country for some <Col N="1863" /> years&mdash;I think that that number could, with profit and in the interests of the citizens of Cork generally, be increased to twenty or twenty-five.  If you had twenty-five you would have about twenty who, if they were really interested in their work, would be constantly in attendance, and questions would then be decided in a council where the citizens as a whole would be fairly well represented.  I do not know whether the people of Cork themselves would be in favour of what I say, but believing in giving the largest possible amount of power to the local people in local government, I would think that in a matter of this kind the people of Cork themselves would have a great deal to say.  I do not know how far the people were consulted on this.  Sections of the people probably were, but we know very well that the sections of the people who are influential enough to be consulted in matters of this kind do not always represent the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony will be able to say more about local conditions than I can.  I am simply talking as one who is interested in giving to the people of Cork the greatest possible control over their own affairs that can be given, consistent with the general interests of the country as a whole and with general principles.  I think that as regards the number, this Bill errs in making it too small for practical purposes.  As I said, if this Council had mainly executive functions I could understand that there would be a great desire to keep the number small, but they are to meet and they are to deliberate on matters of policy, on questions of rates, on the burdens which the people will have to bear, and on other matters of that kind. On that account I think, first of all, that the number is too small, and, secondly, I do not think that the reason given by the President is a sufficiently good one for having in the first year five, in the second year ten, and then fifteen&mdash;that is, that the full number of fifteen, small as it is already, in my opinion, will not have been elected until the end of a three years' period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very much better, I admit, than a period of three years.  But still I hold to what I said originally, that I do not think the difficulty about the division of the city into wards, and the objections to that, are sufficiently strong to have at the start only one-third of what is to be the total number.  I think that the Bill ought to be improved in that respect.  An amendment will probably be put down at the Committee Stage, because I do not think we are going to vote against the general principle of the Bill at this stage.  As far as we are concerned, each member of our Party will be free to take any action he pleases on it.  But as far as I am concerned.  I am not going to vote against this Bill at this stage, believing that good and sound arguments will be put forward from our side which, if arguments are any use, I believe will have weight with those who support the general principles of the Bill, and will lead them to alter it in such a way that it will be a better Bill than it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter about which, of course, everyone of us must be interested, and that is the question of the exact relationship between the executive and the deliberative body.  We want to make quite certain that the control will ultimately lie in the people's representatives.  I, for one, believe in giving the executive the greatest possible latitude for carrying out schemes, and in giving it all the latitude required in carrying out its executive work properly, but I hold that in every single case the ultimate authority must lie with the people's representatives, if they care to exercise it, and must lie continuously with them&mdash;that is, that it must not be a question of suspending it for a certain period; there must be continuous power in the hands of the people's representatives over the executive. Then there will be the question as to <Col N="1865" /> what powers the Manager is to have and normally to exercise.  That is very important too.  It will satisfy me if the representatives of the people can take back whatever powers it is proposed to give if they think it right, for one reason or another.  If the representatives of the people think that the powers are not being properly exercised, and if they can take back these powers I would be satisfied. These are things I will have to examine in detail before the Committee Stage, but I think, from a casual reading of the Bill, what I desire can be done on the Committee Stage.  The question of leaving to the Manager the right to fix salaries, superannuation and allowances is, I think, too great a power.  After all, the power of the purse ought to be ultimately in the deliberative assembly, and the power of the purse ought to be definitely retained by the people's representatives. To give that away would be a mistake, and I will be in favour of having that power retained by the people's representatives. I hope that no representatives of the people here will stand for any principle which would be contrary to that.  As I have said, I am only speaking in general terms on the Bill and on my own behalf.  I welcome the fact that we are at last giving up this idea of keeping all power centralised in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I want to examine carefully is the relationship here between the Ministry and the local council.  When the matter comes up again for detailed examination in Committee, if it seems to me that any powers are being reserved to the Department which are not necessary in the general interests of the country I will be against that.  I think the Department ought to interfere as little as possible with the conduct of local affairs, as any undue interference is bound to have the result of weakening local authority, and generally making for bad local government.</P>

A measure such as this, which is so much in conflict with the tradition and civic history of the ancient borough of Cork, will certainly necessitate a full and free discussion. There may be differences of opinion as to the wisdom or unwisdom of a city managership as against the old system of an elected corporation, but we have to face facts as we find them.

In Cork, at least, a considerable body of opinion is in favour of a larger Corporation.  The figures which the Minister mentioned, three fives, are figures suggested to him, I submit, by the most reactionary class in Cork city, and these are the people who, for a considerable time back&mdash; and I say this without any prejudice whatever against the City Commissioner&mdash;and I hope, personally, he will be kept out of this discussion&mdash;have urged the bringing in of a Bill of this kind.  That urge comes from a class that could never, under any circumstances, get elected to a public body, and to that particular body is due the dissolution of the Cork Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ANTHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the ultimate number reached at the third election&mdash;fifteen&mdash;is altogether too small for a city of such importance as Cork, and that, at least, we should have twenty-one or twenty-five.  So far as the range of the Bill before us is concerned I think it should present no difficulty.  I do not anticipate that you will have such a large number of people tumbling over one another to get into the Cork Corporation.  These men will be called upon to sacrifice a good deal of their time, and incidentally some of their money, and I do not imagine we are going to have such a very big ballot paper.  As was pointed out by Deputy de Valera, that should not present any difficulty to the intelligent voters of Cork who, I am sure, will give a lead to other places in Ireland when the poll takes place, and that there will be very few spoiled votes. There is a feeling amongst certain sections of the citizens of Cork that the city should be divided into two wards. I am in perfect agreement with the suggestion of having the city taken as one constituency.  As far as I can gather from those with whom I have come into contact for some weeks past, that feeling is pretty generally shared.  As far as that section of the Bill is concerned I am not going to oppose it, but as I have <Col N="1868" /> said the feeling is fairly largely shared amongst the citizens of Cork that the city should be divided into two wards, a north and south ward.  Other people submit that the natural division would be three wards, North, South and Centre.  I am not going to labour that point, because I think that ultimately agreement will be found amongst all the citizens that the city should be divided into two wards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers which the Bill proposes to vest in the City Manager are practically plenary powers.  Whilst I agree that there should be absolutely no unnecessary interference with the City Manager, at the same time I think that there should be a court of appeal, whether that court of appeal be the Minister for Local Government or the Corporation, to deal with decisions which may be of an arbitrary character come to by the City Manager.  I say that without prejudice to the existing City Commissioner, against whom I have nothing to say.  Amongst the powers under the Bill reserved to the City Manager are the giving of contracts and the affixing of the corporate seal.  These, to my mind, are powers that the City Manager should not have, unless of course with certain safeguards. Perhaps I might as well indicate now the safeguards that I would like to see provided.  For instance, there is nothing in the Bill which makes it incumbent upon the City Manager to see that the fair-wages clause is inserted in all these contracts, or to encourage the use of Irish manufactured goods.  As the outcome of the elaborate machinery set up in Dublin under the Central Purchasing Department which, I suppose, is intended to revolutionise the system of purchasing in connection with public boards, we had the spectacle a few months ago at a meeting of the Cork Harbour Commissioners of foreign wheel-barrows painted green, like the people, I suppose, and purchased because they were a few shillings cheaper than the others.  That was done by a Board professing to be Irish.  So far as Cork is concerned, we want to have certain safeguards introduced which will prevent that sort of thing happening again.  On the Committee Stage, I propose to move a number of amendments, <Col N="1869" /> one of which will urge that the ultimate number of corporators should be increased.  I shall also on the Committee Stage endeavour to have safeguards introduced ensuring that Irish manufactured goods will get a preference, and that in all contracts the fair-wages clause will be inserted, and that as regards all corporation employment trade union principles will be observed.  If safeguards of the character I have indicated are agreed to and put in the Bill they will go a long way to satisfy me and the people I represent.  I also intend to move on the Committee Stage an amendment to the effect that no member of the Dáil or Seanad be eligible for election to the Cork Corporation.</P>

      <P>I will give my reasons for that at the appropriate time.  I would ask the Minister, at the risk of having the elections for the Cork Corporation postponed, even for a few months, to delay the progress of this Bill for some weeks, if that can be done under Standing Orders, until the citizens of Cork have had an opportunity of examining the sections in it.  I am not going to suggest that because of that delay there would be much improvement made in it by way of amendment or otherwise, but the course I have suggested will, at all events, satisfy the citizens that this is not rushed or panicky legislation.  I think that the various interests in Cork City should have an opportunity of examining the Bill.  We have two Chambers of Commerce in Cork.  In fact, we have two of everything in Cork.  We have two Chambers of Commerce and two cattle trade associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will be able to see his way to meet me on that point so that the various interests in Cork city will have an opportunity of examining the Bill.  In making that suggestion, I do not want it to be taken that I am opposing the principle underlying the Bill.  There may be much to be said for the proposal with regard to the City Manager, but at the same time I would like to see the powers of the City Manager a little more curtailed <Col N="1870" /> than the Bill proposes, and the powers reserved to the Corporation somewhat fuller.</P>

      <P>This Bill seems to me to be a clear, sound, comprehensive and democratic Bill.  I am very glad that Deputy Anthony has spoken so well about it, seeing that he said that the Minister, during his visit to Cork, was apparently in touch with the most reactionary body in Cork city.  I take it that the Deputy meant that this Bill was the outcome of the brains of the most reactionary body in Cork city. I was glad to observe that Deputy Anthony has seen the light, and that there is some good among the people who belong to Chambers of Commerce and bodies like that.  Deputy de Valera complained of the grudging way in which, under this Bill, local authority is being driven back to Cork.  I think that is a wrong way for the Deputy to look at it, because just as a newly-built ship is slipped off the stocks into the deep water, instead of being dropped flat into it, this Bill will slide off by way of three elections into deep water.</P>

It is a Bill that will have tremendous influence on the future history and future life of Cork, and I think it would be a mistake to be in too great haste to push it through in order to get it under weigh in Cork.  So far, I am in agreement with the Deputy who has just spoken. I think that on the Committee Stage the Bill will require some amendment, but when we reach that stage we can deal with the amendments that we think it desirable to introduce.</P>

      <P>I think it is hardly fair to the Dáil to move the Second Reading of a Bill of this nature in the last hour and a half of a very long day's sitting, particularly in view of the fact that we had also a very long sitting yesterday.  I think that in the <Col N="1871" /> interests of the Government, of the Bill itself and of the character of the Dáil the Second Reading of this Bill should be adjourned to next week.  Deputies were here at an early hour yesterday and to-day and have had two long days' sittings, while the Dáil this week met on Tuesday at 3 o'clock, which has not been the usual practice.  Therefore, they have not had the opportunity of giving the Bill the consideration which it undoubtedly requires.  Deputies had to prepare themselves for the work which was before the Dáil during the last two days, and in view of all that I think the Government might agree to adjourn the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill to next week.</P>

It would be a rather serious outcome to the introduction of this Bill if there was such a condemnation of it that it had to be withdrawn on the Second Stage.  I understood that Deputy French was rather anxious it should be passed by October.  I do not know what his ultimate view of the Bill was, but I think he gave it to be understood that he favoured the Second Reading.

      <P>The only question is as to whether we may want to make amendments which may conflict with the general principles of the Bill. That is our difficulty.  There are important amendments which we think it right to move, but they may be ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle on the Committee Stage as being outside the principle of the Bill.  I have not been able to get definitely at the basis on which the Ceann Comhairle rules on these matters.  It is very difficult to find out what he regards as the principle of a Bill, and what it is he would regard as outside the scope of the principle of a Bill.  If we pass the Second Reading now we may find that certain amendments which we desire cannot be introduced on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill it would be well to indicate my personal attitude towards the general principles of the Bill, so that it would be clear to the Minister concerned what exactly are the points we would like to have dealt with on the Committee Stage.  The purpose of the Bill, in so far as it proposes to restore to the citizens of Cork a Council elected by the citizens of Cork with control over the functions of the Corporation, and in so far as the Bill proposes to provide for a division between the deliberative and executive functions of the Corporation, appears satisfactory. Whether or not it is wise to concentrate in the person of a single individual appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners and paid a salary fixed by the Minister over which the Council has no control in executive functions, is a matter to which I would like to give further consideration.  It appears to me possible that some other and better system can be devised.  The objections made to the size of the Council and the methods of election of the Council are, I think, sound.  Deputy Barry Egan appeared to be under the impression that the system of election provided for, that is, the system of election for the first Council, is intended to be a device by which control over local matters could be gradually restored to the citizens of Cork.  It is nothing of the kind.  The functions, powers and duties which the five members elected this year will exercise will be identical with those exercised by the full Council.  In so far as that is the case it cannot be taken as a gradual restoration.  It is merely a device to simplify the methods of election.  It does not seem to me necessary that this system should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> There is no reason why the full Council should not be elected the first year.  The fact that the panel is large is an objection, but it is not likely to prove as destructive of results as the size of the panel of electors for the Seanad.  All the persons whose names will appear on the panel will be those of prominent citizens of Cork, and known to the voters.  The difficulty in the case of the Seanad election was that the voters, generally speaking, knew only the people from their own counties.  In this case the difficulty that there was in connection with the election for the Seanad will not exist, and the voters of Cork will have little difficulty in picking out those citizens for whom they would like to record their votes.  It would be better from several points of view to provide for the establishment of a full Council at the beginning instead of a gradual constitution of it, and then arrange for the first five to be elected for one year, the second group of five for two years and the third group of five for three years so as to enable an annual election of five members to take place.  As regards the size of the Council I think that fifteen is likely to prove too small.  It will be the experience of Deputies and Ministers that you can destroy the efficiency of any body by increasing its size and also by decreasing its size beyond a certain minimum extent.  Discussion and deliberations by a small body become scrappy and inclined to turn into mere conversations carried out in a light-hearted manner which would prevent serious and well considered decisions being arrived at.  I think that if the general principle was accepted that there should be one representative on the Council for every thousand ratepayers of the city you would get a Council of a reasonable size, and provide for the fair representation of all interests and that would result in giving Cork a Council of 27 members. That number would be divisible by three, and such a system would work out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is either too much or too little.  It would also mean that there would be a fair attendance at every meeting of the Council and it would be of sufficient size to ensure that people taking part in the deliberations <Col N="1875" /> would do so in a serious manner, and not, as people do on committees, in a conversational manner.  It seems to be possible to advance fairly strong arguments in favour of not dividing cities into wards and having the whole election carried out by all the voters in the city.  Where the sub-division into wards has gone on to too great an extent it has resulted in the development of ward patriotism as distinct from city patriotism, and ward interests are likely to be placed above city interests as a whole.  Whether or not you prevent that ward patriotism having effect by this system of election is doubtful. The electoral area will be of a fairly considerable extent, and we know, in the bigger counties, for example, in which elections to the Dáil took place, the effect has been quite the opposite. In the County of Galway, which is the largest constituency, I think, in the country, it cannot be said that any of the Deputies elected, with perhaps one or two exceptions, represent Galway County as a whole.  Deputies Mongan and Tubridy represent Connemara, and some others represent North Galway and South Galway.  The same applies to other counties.  In Kerry, you have Deputies who are representatives of the Dingle, Cahireiveen or Killarney area and not representatives of the County of Kerry.  The work which these Deputies have to do is generally divided up on that recognised basis.  It is, therefore, probable that you will not avoid the development of that ward patriotism by this system of election. Whether or not that is true of Cork I cannot say from experience.  Certainly, if the same system were applied to Dublin I do not think ward patriotism would prevail, because you will have North City, South City and County Dublin interests operating no matter what the system of election is.</P>
    <P>In connection with the powers of the Council, I should like to see some effort made to enumerate in detail the functions of the Manager.  To say that the Council shall have certain functions and that all the other functions shall be exercised by the Manager is, in my opinion, an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the matter.  It should be possible to enumerate the functions of the <Col N="1876" /> Manager as precisely as the functions of the Council are enumerated.  If there are old enactments which the Government cannot get copies of, surely they cannot be of any great importance and, if repealed by this Bill, no harm would be done.  The known and necessary functions of the Manager could be enumerated.  The powers of the Manager which are defined here are set out in a manner which will cause some uneasiness. In the first place, the method of appointment of the Manager will be regarded by Deputies on this side as somewhat unsatisfactory.  I think the Council should have some say as to the choice of Manager.  This Bill provides that the Manager shall be appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners. We think also the Council should have some say as to the remuneration which the Manager will receive.  I do not know whether the Government are afraid that the Manager will be paid too much or too little.  In so far as the remuneration is to be fixed by the Minister, the method is unsatisfactory.  The sanction of the Council to that remuneration should be secured.  The Manager has also full authority in relation to the appointment and removal of officers and servants of the Corporation.  I should like if the Minister would inform us what power the Council would have, for example, to ensure that appointments to the clerical staff of the Corporation would be by competitive examination.  If the Manager decided on some other system, could the Council override his decision and insist on competitive examinations?  Would the Council be able to secure that promotion would be upon some definite system, dependent upon merit or upon the period of employment?  There should be some means by which general rules could be laid down by the Council, which the Manager would only be responsible for having carried out in detail.  The same would apply to the dismissal of officials.  There should be included in the Bill some provision by which an official who thinks he has been unjustly dismissed would be able to appeal to the Council.  I do not say that that right of appeal should be so freely given that it could be availed of in all cases, but there should be some provision by which any attempt at <Col N="1877" /> arbitrary or hasty action on the part of the Manager could be corrected by the Council.</P>
    <P>The same remark applies to the making of contracts.  It does not appear from the Bill that the Council would have power to insist upon the matters mentioned by Deputy Anthony, such as the insertion of a fair wages clause or the giving of a preference to Irish manufacture.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether or not it could be arranged that the Council could fix general rules of that nature, to which the Manager would have to adhere.  I think it is a dangerous precedent to establish that the Manager, who is to have the power of making contracts, should also have the power of affixing the official seal to give the contracts validity.  I think it would be wise if an amendment were introduced providing that the actual affixing of the seal and the giving of final sanction to the contract should be performed by the Lord Mayor and not by the Manager.  There are other matters to which we will draw the attention of the Dáil on the Committee Stage.  The matters I have mentioned appear to me to be the principal ones.  I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would give us his views on those questions and also if he would further consider them with a view to the introduction of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CASSIDY</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be said by some Deputies that discussion in regard to this Bill should be confined to Cork Deputies.  While this Bill applies to Cork City the possibility is that later we may have legislation introduced on similar lines in respect of other areas.  Therefore I think the discussion should not be confined to Cork City representatives.  We of the Labour Party strenuously opposed the proposal to abolish the Cork Corporation some time ago, as it took the election of members of the Corporation out of the hands of the people.  We considered that that was a very undemocratic departure.  We believe this Bill is democratic in parts but most undemocratic in other parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera that fifteen members of a council are not sufficient.  The objection to the number <Col N="1878" /> is stronger when we remember that there are to be only five members elected for the first year.  I was greatly interested in the reference made by the Minister to the fact that on the old Cork Corporation the 56 members were elected from seven wards, the number of votes required in some cases to elect a member being only 306.  The Minister thought that that was not sufficient for the election of a councillor or alderman to an important body like the Cork Corporation. The Minister does not seem to hold that view in all cases because, in respect of the Seanad, he thinks that ten votes of Deputies or Senators is sufficient to elect a member of that body.</P>
    <P>Under Section 10 of the Bill the Manager is already appointed.  I believe that is one of the undemocratic parts of the Bill.  I believe the Council should have the appointment of the first Manager.  It is laid down that the Council can appoint future Managers, but I think it is undemocratic to take out of the hands of the people's representatives the right to appoint a Manager in the first instance.  As regards the salary of the Manager, it is laid down that that is to be fixed by the Minister, but the salary of the Lord Mayor is to be fixed by the Council.  If you allow the Council to fix the salary in one case why not allow them to fix it in the other?  Reference has also been made to the making of contracts. I think that is a question which should not be left exclusively to the Manager. We have heard it stated very often in this House&mdash;it has not been contradicted&mdash;that in respect of relief work persons holding certain political opinions were favoured in regard to employment.  I do not say that that is going to happen in Cork, but it could happen if this particular Manager has the giving of the contracts.  I think the Council should have the giving of these contracts, and if we are going to give the Manager this power I hold there should be some court of appeal against his decision.  I never met this particular Manager personally, but from what I have learned of his action regarding Cork municipal employees, he is no friend of the working classes. <Col N="1879" /> We should not vest in him too much power.  He has the taking on of all other municipal employees.  I think that should be left to the Council. Those things are undemocratic.  While I welcome the return of the right of election to the people, I think there are many undemocratic sections in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. FLINN Mr. FLINN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FLINN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no theories on this question.  I am concerned only with two things.  The first of these things is to see that continuous, intimate and effective control over finance belongs to the elected representatives. The second thing is to see that the executive work is efficiently done.  Whether you have fifteen or twenty or twenty-five members of the Corporation is merely a question of machinery.  So long as it is perfectly clearly understood that complete, intimate and final control over finance, and all that that means in the sense of responsibility for the initiating of works and the control of the nature of the works done with the money, I am not very much concerned with the other matters.  If I had a choice between a big council and a small one I would be rather in favour of the small one.  I am not at all unfavourably impressed by the suggestion that we should begin with a somewhat smaller number than we will have eventually. I think there are a good many advantages in that.  I will approach the consideration of this Bill purely and simply from the point of view of securing that there shall be good municipal government in the city of Cork, that the people shall get value for their money, and that the elected representatives shall have control over policy. Every amendment which is put forward in relation to this Bill by anybody from any side will be decided, so far as I am concerned, by those considerations, and by those considerations only.</P>

      <P>If the Second Reading were postponed until Thursday next, we would be able to get a thorough examination of this Bill.  It is quite obvious to anybody that we, as a Party, have to consider this Bill from the point of view of our general policy &mdash; the point of view of giving the utmost control possible to the local authorities so far as that is consistent with general efficiency. Matters of detail will require to be worked out to see if they are in line with that.  We would be relieved from any anxiety about what would be possible on the Committee Stage if we had the Bill thoroughly considered in general terms before the conclusion of the Second Reading.  It would then be possible for us to frame amendments which would get substantial support from our own members.  It would be to the general advantage that we, who have general principles, should have an opportunity of discussing the Bill thoroughly.  That will really mean the saving of time ultimately.  I have no doubt that members of the opposite Party find that when they discuss matters of this kind amongst themselves it leads to simplification &mdash; that differences of opinion are composed and a general line of action decided upon. It would be a great advantage in considering the Bill to have no restrictions existing, as there would be if the Second Reading were passed.  I have already indicated that, so far as I am concerned personally, the general principle of the Bill would be accepted by me.  I believe that I could, on Committee, bring in amendments which would make sure that the views I have would be provided for in the Bill. My idea is that the Second Reading should be postponed until Thursday. We would be prepared to go ahead as soon as the Executive wants after that.</P>

I would like to assure the Minister that we have no great anxiety to have this Bill passed this session.  It will do no great harm to have it held over until next session.</P>

The different matters in the Bill have been under consideration since the beginning of this year.  In so far as the people in Cork are concerned, I have met anxiety on every side to have the Corporation restored there at the earliest possible moment.  I was anxious that the election would take place in the autumn and we might progress right away from that.  I would suggest for the consideration of Deputies that there is really nothing in the Bill from the point of view of principle that they would not put in themselves, having had full opportunity of realising the object of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As the Leader of our Party has indicated, we have not had an opportunity of expressing our views on this matter &mdash; at least of discussing it amongst our Party.  I hold views on this matter and <Col N="1883" /> I do not want to let it go out or let it be said that our Party did not take any action upon it.  I have a great objection to the whole system of local government as introduced by the present Executive and that is sought to be continued in this Bill, namely, that the whole grasp and full control is to be retained by the Executive in Dublin. I am speaking personally, as we have not taken any Party decision.  I stand for autocracy at headquarters in national affairs and for a bigger extension of freedom in local affairs.  I think that would be far more desirable than having the centralised control of local affairs in Dublin.  There has been a virtual dictatorship here in national affairs and I am more in favour of such dictatorship in national affairs than in local affairs.  That is a subject which I could develop and for which I could make a very good case, but what have we here in this Bill?  We are told that a Manager is to be appointed by the Corporation of the City of Cork.  Subsection 3 of Section 10 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as may be after the termination of the office of the said first Manager (whether by his death, resignation or removal from office in accordance with this section) and from time to time thereafter as occasion may require the Council shall appoint a fit and proper person to be the Manager and every such appointment shall be made subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the said Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the Council is not going to employ the Manager.  It would be better to say that the Council was not appointing the Manager than to say that it shall appoint him subject to the provisions of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act.  That means that the people who are to be elected in Cork are to be told what they are to do.  They are to give some sort of semblance of local sanction to the authority of headquarters.  I think this country is going right against the tide in this matter.  An extension of local government is very desirable, so that if the morale of the people is as bad as we are told it is it may be improved, and <Col N="1884" /> so that the people generally may take a more lively interest in their local affairs, and if there is all this corruption, surely there is enough talk about it to have a keen eye kept in future on every public representative.  Deputy Cassidy mentioned one serious matter, and that is the salary of the Manager. Sub-section (6) of Section 10 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There shall be paid by the Council to the Manager such remuneration as the Minister shall from time to time determine, and the amount of such remuneration shall be raised by the Council by the same rate as the rate by which the salary of the Town Clerk is raised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Council get the privilege of collecting the money, but the Minister is going to fix the salary. You can make no case for that.  You say that they are going to appoint him when, as a matter of fact, they are not. They are going to get orders to sanction him.  Therefore, why keep up the pretence that they are going to appoint him?  They are allowed to pay him, but they are not allowed to fix his salary, and he, I think, will be allowed to fix everybody's salary except that of the Lord Mayor.  That is a serious matter, and there is a principle in it for which I cannot stand.  I suppose I will have to obey the Party discipline.  I always do, but I take this opportunity before the Whips are on of expressing my views on this matter.  Therefore, I cannot agree to the Second Reading of this Bill, for, as I say, we have had experience of dictatorship here, and if I could possibly admire the present Government it would be for that one thing.  They did not care what anybody thought.  They did as they wanted, and they got away with it very well indeed. I think there is a lot to be said for autocracy in national affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, even though I had to suffer for it.  There is much power given to this gentleman, who is really not responsible to the people, because, even though the Council unanimously agreed to dispense with his services, the Minister for Local Government has a veto over the Council in that matter.  There is a good deal of <Col N="1885" /> camouflage in that, and you might as well spare the paper this Bill is written on.  As the general probably said when the war was on: &ldquo;I am the boss and am going to be the boss.&rdquo;  We respect that. This is not going to go through without a protest from me.  This Manager can do practically everything.  There is something to be said for the desirability of one person being in control of the staff, that is, when the staff are actually there, as it is desirable that there should be uniformity of control and that one person should be responsible for them.  I do know Mr. Monahan, and you have three gentlemen in Dublin who may be all right, but we have not yet arrived at the stage at which we have produced supermen. You are putting too big a temptation in the way of an ordinary human being when you put the appointment of every member of the staff of the Council into his hands.  It is not fair to the man himself.  You are putting in his way temptation which few human beings could resist.  This gentleman will not be put into a glass-case and kept away from people.  He is not a person who will not go to dances and social functions at which influence can be worked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no witness, but I am giving you my conclusions.  I will say that if I had the assurance of the Minister, if I had it in black and white, and nailed him down to it, then I would accept it, but he is not nailed <Col N="1886" /> down to it in this Bill.  We are told here that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Town Clerk shall in each year not less than fourteen days before the date on which the rates meeting of the Council is to be held send to every member of the Council a copy of the estimates of expenses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This gentleman is going to tell the people of Cork how much money they are going to spend.  I agree with Deputy Anthony that Cork is a beautiful city and should be entitled to rule itself, and if the citizens wanted this system that is going to be forced on them by a select few from Cork I consider that I would have no right to intefere, but I am perfectly satisfied that this is the beginning of a new departure or, at least, a continuation of the departure that took place when we got our alleged liberty some time ago. I disagree with some members of our Party that five members should be elected at a time.  I think that the whole Corporation should be elected together.  I can see no reason for retiring five members every year, one-third of the Corporation.  There is very seldom a gap.  Deputy Alderman Byrne is a living witness of that.  The old Council guards itself so well that a good portion of it is returned again. I do not agree with what Deputy Lemass said about ward patriotism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  We can agree to differ.  We do not differ on fundamentals.  I do not think he gave it the right name when he called it ward patriotism.  I think local patriotism is very desirable, and the more this Government delegates power to the people through the country, the less it interferes with local administration, and the less it maligns the people by stating that there is nepotism in every part of the country the better it will be for the credit of the country. You are continually reminding people they are not fit to get control of local affairs, but, as has been said repeatedly, there is a better type of elector concerned in the case of these bodies.  You have a more restricted franchise and, if anything, the representatives <Col N="1887" /> on those bodies should be far better than we are here.  I protest against this policy of centralisation of power in local affairs and I say that it is not fair to put into the hands of a human being a temptation such as is put into the hands of the City Manager here.  The Minister said that the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act is going to apply.  I would like to see that in the Bill, but in any event it will apply only to officers who would come ordinarily under the Act.  I suppose that will be only about one-third of the employees of the Corporation.</P>
      <P>There are a few other remarks which I wish to make.  The Bill states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Manager may by order signed by him and countersigned by the Town Clerk&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I dare say seeing that he has the appointment of the Town Clerk if the Town Clerk did not countersign he would get his marching orders; there would be a new Town Clerk in the morning&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;authorise the making of any payment out of the funds of the Corporation&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is terrible.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;in respect of any expense or on account of any liability incurred by the Council on behalf of the Corporation in the exercise or the performance by the Council or the Manager of any of the powers, functions or duties of the Corporation which are exercisable or performable by them or him under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here again you are giving the people the privilege of collecting the money and the Manager the privilege of spending it.  That is very good.</P>

      <P>It is not bad draftsmanship. That was done deliberately in the hope that in half an hour a Bill containing these principles should be allowed to be rushed through.  We will be told here when the same thing is being attempted for Dublin city, if we object to that principle &ldquo;Oh you let the Cork scheme through and what right have you to object to the Dublin scheme?&rdquo;  There is a point also here about the smallness of the Council to <Col N="1888" /> which I also object.  One of the Labour Deputies has also objected to it.  That is that a particular type of representative, who could only get elected in a certain proportion in the Dublin Corporation and probably the Cork Corporation, would not be able to pull their full weight in a big body as well as they could in a small body.  The next proposal you will have, if we let that go through, will be that only people who pay a certain amount of rates, people like Deputy Good, should have a vote at all.  Then we will be back again to the days of the old pocket boroughs, from which the Lord deliver us.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a different subject now to bring before the House but it is one which affects the vital liberties of the people of this State. Deputy Aiken&mdash;if he is a Deputy now; he may be an ex-Deputy for a week&mdash; and I asked the Ceann Comhairle to allow this question to be raised on private notice as it is a matter of vital importance and urgency and a matter affecting the liberties of the individual. It is the case of a gentleman well known both in Ireland and England and, in fact, on the Continent as a writer&mdash;Mr. Peadar O'Donnell&mdash;against whose life and health an unjust and a mean attempt is being made at the present moment.  I asked the Minister the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if he will state why Peadar O'Domhnall, of 39 Marlboro' Road, Dublin, was arrested to-day and released without any charge being preferred against him; if he will state the number of times during the last month Peadar O'Domhnall has been arrested and released in the same manner and what was the duration of his detention on each occasion, and also if he will state by whom instructions were issued for these arrests and the nature of the instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had not time to make inquiries, <Col N="1889" /> but I do not think that in a matter of this sort he requires much time, seeing that the headquarters of the police are within a stone's throw of his own headquarters.  The answer I got was:</P>
    <P>As Mr. O'Donnell is believed to be in close association with certain criminal organisations he has frequently been arrested by the Gárda on suspicion of being in possession of documents relating to such organisations. Owing to the short notice I have received on this question I have not been able to obtain a complete report in this matter, but I have learned that O'Donnell was arrested on yesterday and detained for some time.  I have no information as to the number of occasions on which he has been so arrested and detained. I do not propose to disclose the instructions which have been issued to the Gárda in any case of this nature.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not propose to tell me the number of times on which Mr. O'Donnell was arrested, so that there is nothing left for me but to tell the Minister and the House.  We admit that under the ordinary law a man against whom there is a criminal or any other charge is liable to be arrested and rightly so, but this is a case in which a man has been arrested fourteen times since the 24th April, and on almost every occasion he was searched.  I will read a list of the occasions on which he was arrested.  On Tuesday, 24th April, he was arrested at 7.45 p.m. and brought to Donnybrook police station and released at 11 p.m., after being searched.  Apparently nothing incriminating was found on him.  On Wednesday, 8th May, he was arrested at 7 p.m. and brought to Pearse Street and released at 11 p.m.  On Wednesday, 6th June, he was arrested at 12 o'clock and brought to Pearse Street and released at 4 o'clock.  On Thursday, 7th June, he was searched at Mullingar, not arrested apparently.  On Friday, 8th June, he was arrested at Dungloe, Tirconnail, at 7 p.m. and released at 1 a.m.  Upon all these occasions he was searched.  On Saturday, 9th June, he was arrested at 10.30 a.m., and released at 3.30 p.m. after being searched.  On the same day they called <Col N="1890" /> at 9 p.m. looking for him but he was not at home.  On Sunday, 10th, he was held up and searched, but not detained. On Monday, 11th, he was arrested at Burtonport when arranging a boat for a picnic at 11.30 a.m., and released at 3.30 p.m.  On Tuesday 12th, he was raided for but was not at home.  The police patrol remained outside the house and were relieved openly.  On Thursday, 14th June, on way to Dublin held up at Sligo.  He refused to go to barracks unless carried and was allowed off, but was searched.  On Sunday, 17th June, at Ennis, Co. Clare, he dodged the C.I.D. men.  He was in company with Deputy Hogan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. BOLAND Mr. BOLAND">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>He could keep with a worse man.  On Monday, 25th June, while driving home and dropping a friend en route, C.I.D. with guns &ldquo;stuck up&rdquo; car.  On Wednesday, 27th June, he was arrested on tram car and brought to Lad Lane at 12.35, and released at 1.10 p.m.  That brings me down to yesterday.  Yesterday word came from Mr. O'Donnell's wife that her husband had been again arrested, and in order to have the evidence of our own eyes Deputies Derrig, Aiken and myself went to Lad Lane Police Station, and arrived about a minute later than Mr. O'Donnell, who had just gone in with a police officer.  We questioned the sergeant-in-charge, and asked why Mr. O'Donnell had been arrested.  He said that he did not know, and referred us to a Guard in civilian clothes.  We asked this Guard had he a warrant for Mr. O'Donnell's arrest, and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  We asked him had he any charge to prefer against him, and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  We asked what were his instructions, and he said they were to arrest Mr. O'Donnell and detain him pending instructions from Superintendent Ennis.  We asked him could we get in communication with Superintendent Ennis, and he said that Superintendent Ennis was not in.  I may mention that that is a dodge of Superintendent Ennis &mdash; he is never in when Mr. O'Donnell is arrested, and does not <Col N="1891" /> arrive for about four hours afterwards. Then he turns up and O'Donnell is released.  While we were on our way over to Pearse Street Station they were able to get in touch with Superintendent Ennis, so that when we arrived there we were informed that Mr. O'Donnell had again been released.  We asked to see Superintendent Ennis, and were told that he was not in.  Then we asked to see the officer in charge, but he would give no information.  I suppose he would not be allowed, just like the Minister says he will not be. Mr. O'Donnell has been arrested practically every day.  The practice has been to wait for instructions from Superintendent Ennis, who is generally out when O'Donnell is in.  I do not mean to make a laugh of this, because it is a serious matter.  The Minister belongs to that class of people who at all times stood for blind justice&mdash;strict law and order.  He was never, I think, a member of any irregular band, and, therefore, although in other cases he was the wrong man to speak to concerning prisoners, in a matter of this kind I think he is about the best of the bunch over there.  I put it to the Minister that a fundamental law has been broken, that the liberty of the subject is being interfered with in a grossly unfair manner, and that it is up to him to justify the conduct of his officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. O'Donnell is believed to belong to a criminal organisation.  We were told on many occasions here that all we ever could do was to say we believed things, to make an assertion and so on, and that there was no value in such things.  Here we have an assertion from the responsible head of probably the most important Department of State&mdash; certainly it is a very important one to the ordinary individual if his liberty can be interfered with in this way&mdash; that Mr. O'Donnell is believed to be in close association with certain criminal organisations.  I do not know of any country in the world where the authorities would persist in believing such a thing as that after having searched a man practically every day for two months, and finding nothing incriminating, in addition to raiding his house. The only interpretation I can put on it <Col N="1892" /> is that they simply want to break Mr. O'Donnell.  He has a very strong spirit, but he has not a very strong body, and he looked very weak when I saw him yesterday.  I think it is an outrage on civilisation that such a thing should be allowed and that the Minister should approve of it.  We are all Irishmen, and I appeal to the decency of Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies to insist that there should be something proved against this man before they are allowed to take him and treat him like a dog as they are doing.  This sort of thing was called the Cat and Mouse Act in England, but that Act applied only to persons who had been convicted and who were released and then arrested again.  This man has not been tried.  He is suspected of belonging to a criminal organisation.  I may be suspected of something.  I did belong to what some people, probably the Minister, considered a criminal organisation one time.  Why am I not arrested and thrown in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BOLAND</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit.  Do not think that for a moment.  The Minister, I suggest, has just got as much proof that Mr. O'Donnell is connected with a criminal organisation as that I am.  Mr. O'Donnell writes for a newspaper, and his views are expressed in that newspaper. If there is anything wrong or criminal in those views, what are the courts doing?  Mr. O'Donnell goes on platforms and makes speeches&mdash;everyone knows that he is going round the country speaking at meetings.  Why is he not prosecuted for these speeches? Is there anything in them he could be prosecuted for?  Not at all.  He is trying, by both voice and pen, to resurrect the dormant spirit of manhood in the Irish people, and that is his big and only crime.  I suggest that the Minister should take more pains with this case, that he should not flippantly tell me or other Deputies that he has nothing to add, and that he does not propose to disclose the instructions issued to the Gárda in any case of this nature.  That is not sufficient information to give any responsible Deputy.  I am speaking for <Col N="1893" /> the Fianna Fáil Party now, and, I believe, for some of the Labour Party, and I dare say for nearly half the people of Ireland.  I am sure that even the hearts of some of the Deputies opposite will be touched by this treatment of a man of the character of Peadar O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is very proud to enjoy the friendship of Peadar O'Donnell I want to add one or two words to what Deputy Boland has said.  As far as I can learn as one who is almost in daily intercourse with Peadar O'Donnell the dominating feature of his life is his love of the fishermen and the peasants of Ireland not merely of the Free State fishermen. He has won fame for Ireland by his works of fiction and by his work as an artist and it seems to me an extraordinary thing and a disgrace to the Dáil and the country that a man like that should be persecuted.  I have seen him as frequently as any man in the past two months.  His whole talk is of help for the fishermen and the peasant farmers of Ireland, trying to give them a chance, and to establish them in the country as the dominant force.  If that is an evil thing to do and a wrong thing to do then the Minister for Justice is quite justified in pursuing him as he does.  If it is a good thing to love the peasantry and to try and serve them, and if it is a good thing to attract the attention of the world to their suffering and their virtues, then I suggest that the action of the Minister for Justice in pursuing him is a very evil thing.  I would be surprised if Deputies on the other side of the House would support the Minister for Justice in the action he has taken.  I think it should not go without mention that when there were not many to serve Ireland, when people who were prepared to run grave risks in the service of Ireland were not many, not merely Peadar O'Donnell but Mrs. O'Donnell was the very valued friend of those in power to-day and that should not be forgotten.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I want to put this case without any rhetoric before the House. Peadar O'Donnell has been arrested twelve times because it was believed that <Col N="1894" /> he was in close relationship with certain criminal organisations.  He has been arrested twelve times on suspicion; he has been searched on most of those occasions and yet not once was there found anything on him to substantiate the belief which the Minister offers for this outrageous proceeding.  I ask any Deputy in the House&mdash;I do not care where he sits&mdash;is that justifiable and is he prepared to allow the Minister to justify it in this House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. DE VALERA Mr. DE VALERA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DE VALERA</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Justice, very definitely, whether it is with his approval that this line of conduct is carried on by the Gárda; whether he definitely stands for this sort of thing. Under what Act or what authority, either executive authority from himself, or general authority, are the Gárda acting in this way?  Some of us know the methods the British tried when they wanted to drive Tom Clarke out of this country.  They said they were going to drive him out and persecuted him so that he could not have a moment he could call his own.  He was under constant surveillance.  Are these the methods which the Executive are going to employ in driving out men who love their country and whose only crime is that they love their country?  I see no justification whatever for that line of conduct.  It is the same sort of thing as the judge has complained of.  I suppose we will be told that the judge's statements are mere obiter dicta and count for nothing.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister is he going to exercise more supervision than apparently he has been doing, or whether he stands for these acts of the Gárda which are in line with the conduct that brought a reprimand from a judge not merely a <Col N="1895" /> week ago, but also such as is to be found in this evening's paper in regard to a similar case.</P>

      <P>The only reason I mentioned it was to try and get from the Minister whether the Gárda is acting directly under his authority. Whether that is the policy he stands for?  Whether in the case of Peadar O'Donnell the same policy is being worked out?  As an example of the same thing, I may say that Deputy Houlihan was arrested in his own constituency. He was held up by a C.I.D. man in plain clothes a week or two ago. Is there to be any limit to the interference with the individual's freedom in this country?</P>

      <P>We heard a good deal of rhetoric, as Deputy MacEntee described it, to-night upon this subject.  Deputy Moore has spoken a great deal about Mr. O'Donnell's love of the fishermen and peasants of Ireland.  I have heard a certain amount about his literary abilities and things of that kind.  It is not, and Deputies know it is not, because he is an eminent writer, it is not because of whom he married, it is not because of his love of the fishermen and the peasants of Ireland that the action of which Deputies complain has been taken.</P>

      <P>The attitude which is taken up by the Gárda Síochána towards Mr. O'Donnell <Col N="1896" /> is this: that it is the duty of the Gárda to prevent crime in this country.  It is a necessary thing for this country, for the welfare and advancement of this country that crime should be detected and that persons who have committed crime should be convicted and punished; punished in order that they themselves may be reformed and punished also in order that other persons may be deterred from following in their footsteps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We know that Deputy Boland, in what Deputy MacEntee described as rhetoric, stated that Mr. O'Donnell was treated like a dog.  No violence has been used, no violence is alleged to have been used, and no matter how delicate his constitution may be&mdash;if he has a delicate constitution&mdash;no matter how delicate that gentleman's constitution may be, I do not see how the searching of him or even the detention of him in a barrack is injurious to his health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy had given the three days' ordinary notice I might have been able to have done so.  But I do not think, as a matter of fact, that whether it was five times or six times or ten times that this has happened is really of the substance of the thing. What is the substance of this matter is this&mdash;that the Gárda when they consider that a man is dangerous&mdash;and they are satisfied that this man is a dangerous man&mdash;they are satisfied that this man was associating with those persons who are endeavouring by criminal means to injure this State and to injure the citizens of this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
