      <NameTxt>Mr. SHEEHY</NameTxt>
      <P>(Tipperary) asked the Minister for Finance whether any application has been received from Patrick Ryan, Ballyhourigan, County Tipperary, for compensation for a gun taken by the Irish Republican Army in 1919 or 1920, and not returned; and if he will state why no compensation has been paid in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>No application can be traced from Patrick Ryan of Ballyhourigan, but the Deputy may refer to Patrick Ryan of Killoscully, on whose behalf a claim in respect of the loss of a shotgun in 1919 or 1920 was lodged.  As this application was not received before the prescribed date, 1st November, 1924, it was not considered by the Committee set up under the Indemnity Act, 1924.  I regret, accordingly, that no compensation can be paid in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. WARD</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the nearest employment exchange office to the town of Carrickmacross is situate at Dundalk, a distance of sixteen miles, and that when destitute persons have to make personal application for benefit they have to walk to Dundalk and back, and, if so, whether he will consider the necessity of re-opening the branch office at Carrickmacross.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNicholasDolan" hpid="PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. Dolan) James Nicholas Dolan">
      <NameTxt>PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY to MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. Dolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The nearest <Col N="1632" /> employment exchange to the town of Carrickmacross is, as stated by the Deputy, situated at Dundalk.  It is not, however, correct to state that persons residing in Carrickmacross who desire to apply for unemployment insurance benefit are obliged to travel to Dundalk for that purpose.  The rules governing the payment of unemployment benefit provide, inter alia, that claimants resident in Carrickmacross may be excused attendance at Dundalk for the purpose of claiming benefit.  In that case persons desiring to claim unemployment benefit may do so through the post, by which means they may also continue to prove unemployment and receive payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>The question of the necessity for reopening the branch office at Carrickmacross is at present under consideration, and I will arrange that the Deputy be informed of the decision reached in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister guarantee that this matter will not be disposed of?  There is a statutory limit of twelve days during which this matter must lie on the Table of the Dáil, and if the period is passed before attention is drawn to it, I will have no redress afterwards.  I am raising the matter now so that it can be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that I will be able to raise the matter after the statutory time has passed?  I want to be clear on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was handed in yesterday.  In the absence of the papers and in the absence of the personnel I cannot answer the question to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister will appreciate my difficulty.  The papers were tabled on the 7th.  Possibly the statutory number of days will have passed before the Minister will be in a position to give me a definite reply.  If I cannot get a definite reply within a week, I will have to table a motion asking the Dáil not to agree to depriving certain plotholders of what they have had for four years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point is that the time will have elapsed, and that the motion would be of no value?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that I will have the information to-morrow. If I have I will give it to the Deputy.  With regard to a motion, even if some days had passed from the time the information was tabled, and even if the Deputy did bring up a motion, it might take time before that motion could be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but clearly I would have raised the matter within the statutory time by tabling the motion. <Col N="1634" /> I am anxious to facilitate the Minister; I am not anxious to inconvenience him in any way, but clearly my position is obvious to anybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill, 1928. I do not think it would be useful to attempt to reply to the very many points which were raised in the course of the debate on the Vote on Account. Most of these matters will arise very soon on the different Estimates, and can be more fully discussed when we <Col N="1640" /> are dealing with the Estimates.  On the general question of Government expenditure and economy, I would like to say, and I think it has been said already, that nothing will get less support, or will be less readily supported, in the House than any proposal for the reduction of expenditure, if we leave out one or two headings.  The cost of the Governor-General's establishment raises a political question, and there will always be calls for reduction there, and also in respect of salaries of a comparatively small number of the higher officials.  But, if we leave out these cases, the demand in the Dáil always has been for more expenditure Scarcely any proposal can be put before the Dáil by the Government without having demands arise that any expenditure that will take place under these proposals should be increased.  A Drainage Bill was introduced the other day for a type of drainage scheme that really should require no State contribution. Nobody criticised the Bill because a State contribution was provided. We did provide that contribution in order to oil the wheels, although we think that in reality no State contribution should be necessary for these schemes.  There was, however, no criticism about giving a State contribution; on the other hand, there were calls from all sides for an increased State contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Vote for the relief of unemployment is before the Dáil, no matter how much that Vote is, the demand is that it should be increased.  All along, except, as I say, in the case of one or two Votes where political points may be scored, the Government is faced generally with demands for increased expenditure.  Instead of having the Supply Estimates totalling something like £23,000,000, if we really tried to meet the demands of the House and tried to take what was a popular course in the House, we would have a Budget running to perhaps double that sum.  I would like to say, in this connection, that there are two sides to the question of economy, and that it is not a desirable thing merely to reduce expenditure. It is good to relieve the burden on the taxpayer and to relieve the burden on industry.  On the other hand, it <Col N="1641" /> may be a disadvantage to the whole community to reduce or abandon some of the services for which taxation is necessary. It was Deputy Lemass, I think, who said that taxation should bear a direct relation to the national income. It must.  But there is another factor to be taken into account, and that is the use that is made of the money that is taken out of the pockets of the ratepayers. We had recently before the Dáil a motion in connection with old age pensions.  The Government proposal was stated to be inadequate.  When the Bill, following a motion actually passed, came before the Dáil, we were faced with a fresh demand for increased expenditure, and it was stated that something more should be done for the blind.  I have already referred to drainage.  It is desired that more money should be spent on drainage, and the Land Commission is asked to speed up its work and to spend additional money on improvements, that it should in fact substantially increase its annual expenditure.  We have proposals for increases of expenditure under the head of education.  We have demands that certain classes of teachers, who are not at present entitled to pensions, should be given pensions.  We have had demands frequently for all sorts of increased services through the Department of Agriculture.  There is not a year in which demands do not come up for increased expenditure on cow-testing. That is very good expenditure, and very remunerative to the community. Increased money has been provided for it year after year, but we never provide sufficient money to meet the demand.  We have demands every year in this House for increased expenditure on forestry.  That is expenditure which, I think, at the best is only partly remunerative.  I do not think we can get recoupment of the capital and payment of interest out of any forestry scheme.  But whenever forestry is mentioned in this House the demand is that the amount appropriated to it should be increased.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Grant was doubled a year or two ago.  We were told that to double it was better than nothing but that that was all that could be said for what we were doing.  We have expended <Col N="1642" /> very considerable sums in the provision of housing.  These are not sufficient to solve speedily the housing problem and naturally we have demands for largely increased expenditure on housing.  We had demands for loosening the procedure in connection with the Land Improvement Loans, reducing the rates of interest and reducing all the other charges that fall on borrowers.  We had demands here after the fluke epidemic for very big votes for compensation to be paid to individuals whose losses in many cases were in part, at least, and in some cases wholly, due to their own neglect.  We provided credit facilities and we were pressed to provide these credit facilities on easier terms.  Yesterday, when Deputy Flinn was making statements about industry and commerce my opinion was that the statement practically worked out as a demand for increased expenditure.  He explained that certain things were not done and he asked that they should be done.  He indicated in a general way that less money should be spent on the enforcement of statutory duties.  He was much vaguer in that respect than where he was asking for additional services.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that always everybody says there should be economy, there should be a reduction of expenditure, but when we come to any individual head of expenditure, we have demands for increased expenditure in the case of every head of expenditure except in cases where some political consideration is involved.  I think that we really will have to get closer to the ground in this matter in future discussions in this House if we are to make any progress.  It was difficult, perhaps, to carry on discussions in the past owing to the fact that we had not the main Opposition actually in the House.  I think that in the new circumstances we ought really to make a bigger attempt to get down to realities.  If we conduct the thing on a propagandist basis we will make no progress at all.  We can take the various heads of expenditure and instead of talking about a reduction of £1,000,000 or £3,000,000 we can take individual Votes and we can see whether it is desirable to reduce an individual Vote by <Col N="1643" /> £1,000, £10,000, or £100,000, as the case may be.  We can point out what will be the consequence of reducing expenditure and we will be able to make up our minds whether it is better to reduce taxation by a certain amount and give up certain services; or whether a particular service is worth what it costs and should be continued or even whether it should be increased.</P>
    <P>I have been very anxious to reduce the burden of taxation, and to encourage enterprise, and to induce the individual undertaker of industry to go ahead.  But I have never taken up the point of view that if we can reduce expenditure, irrespective of how the saving is accomplished, we are doing well.  It seems to me that we do fail to bring the two sides of the problem together in the course of a great many discussions in this House.  We discuss on one day the need for reducing expenditure, and we discuss on another day the need for increased services, and very often the attitude that a particular speaker takes on one day is quite inconsistent with the attitude he takes on another.  It has been stated that we are carrying on expenditure on an Imperial scale.  I do not know that it is perhaps appropriate to go into that now at any great length.  But it is not true to say that we are carrying on expenditure on an Imperial scale.  We have reduced scales in all Departments. We have reduced the salaries paid at the top more, proportionately, than salaries further down have been reduced. If you take our Judiciary you will find that the salaries are lower than in the Six County area, and very much lower than the salaries paid here before the setting up of the Free State. The salaries paid to the heads of Departments are even lower.  We have pursued the policy of bringing down these particular charges.  But there is a limit to which we can fruitfully go along that line.  It is necessary to bring into your Civil Service a certain proportion of men of first-class ability.  If you do not attract these men or if you do not not offer them prospects which will induce them to stay, you can lose a great deal more than you can possibly save by the small amount by which the salaries would be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> We have pursued that line consistently, and on the debate on the Estimates I think what I said could very easily be demonstrated.  It may be that we have social and other services here that would not be in existence if there had been a separate State here for the last hundred years.  It may be that in some respects social services were introduced of a kind and on a basis which would not have been adopted for this country.  But it is very difficult to make fundamental alterations.</P>
    <P>There is a service which is often attacked here and which I, on the contrary, think is a very good service&mdash; that is, the National Health Insurance. It is quite possible we would have organised that differently if we had the doing of it ourselves, but the system is here, the whole machine is here, and it is exceedingly difficult and even expensive to alter that.  The same applies in various other respects.  It may be that we have not the cheapest or most suitable kind of machine; we may not have the sort of machine we would set up if we were doing it afresh.  But admitting that, and agreeing to that, it is quite a different thing from setting up a wholly different machine because you are always up against vested interests, rights and claims to compensation, and all sorts of difficulties, the surmounting of which may rob any reform of half its value.</P>
    <P>This is a poor country, a country which is suffering very much from the effects of the general economic slump, effects which have mostly hit the agriculturist. There are very difficult financial problems before us.  The problems are big enough and serious enough, from the point of view of the whole country, to be faced in a noncontroversial spirit, or at least in a non-propagandist spirit; to be faced solely with a view, not to scoring off anybody, but with a view to suggesting remedies.  It does not really serve any purpose at all to talk about an Imperial defence force, and it does not serve any good purpose to suggest, as one Deputy suggested, that if political conditions were different we could do with a police force that would cost only £300,000 a year.  There would be some sense in the remark if the Deputy had said that if the political conditions <Col N="1645" /> were different we might save £100,000 a year on the police; but when the Deputy talks about reducing the police charges to one-fifth of the present amount, that statement cannot be taken seriously.  One-fifth of the present cost of the police force, in view of the increase of motor traffic in cities and towns would hardly do much more than provide police for point duty, let alone for any other purpose.  It is difficult to deal with all these problems in a general debate such as this, but we can deal with them seriously and satisfactorily if we set about it in the right manner, on the Estimates.  I hope we will be able to commence consideration of the Estimates early this year.  I hope that we will be able to give a good deal of time to them and thresh out all the problems that arise.  I do not think I would care to say any more at the present stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked certain questions which I might have replied to if I were winding up a debate, but I am afraid that those matters would lead us very far from financial questions.  The Deputy asks about our policy in regard to partition.  He asks us to state whether we were seeking a republic. Now, if the debate had been confined to those matters, perhaps we could have dealt with them.  I do not want to go into them particularly now although, perhaps, I might give him a very brief answer.  In regard to partition, our belief is that the end of that can only come by consent; that there can be no question of attaining it by either military coercion or coercion of an economic character.  It can only come when conditions here have improved so much that it would be an attraction to people who are not in this State to come into a unified Irish State.  We believe, furthermore, that that can never come about, not within this generation or perhaps within two generations&mdash;I do not know what might happen after a long interval of time&mdash;it can never come about within a generation or two without the consent of Great Britain and it can never come about against the opposition of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point as to whether we are aiming at the establishment of an Irish Republic, we are not. <Col N="1646" /> We believe this country, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, can enjoy greater freedom and greater security than she could outside the British Commonwealth of Nations, and our policy within it is really to remove anomalies that exist in the relationship between the members of it. Several of these anomalies have been removed already as a result of our efforts &mdash;I think I may say, mainly as a result of our efforts&mdash;and we believe other anomalies can be removed; they are not numerous and they are not important. As I say, perhaps if I went on to that matter, we could start a fresh debate; but Deputy Lemass put those questions and I am just answering him briefly.  If his side desire, on some occasion, specially to discuss that matter, it may not be altogether unfruitful to discuss it.  Although I have no reluctance to discussing anything that is past&mdash;I should hope to discuss it with fairly good temper, without letting my own side down&mdash;I do think that so far as we can do it, discussion of future policy and of future action, will be more fruitful and will do more good to the country than a mere raking up of the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want on this Bill to go into matters that the Minister raised in the concluding portion of his speech.  I am anxious, however, that the House would get some opportunity of hearing a detailed statement of the Government's policy on these matters.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the procedure here to know on what particular item such a discussion could be raised.  I thought it could be, on the Vote on Account, brought up as a matter of general Government policy, particularly as I endeavoured to establish that it did seriously <Col N="1647" /> affect the burden of taxation upon the people.</P>
      <P>We are going to oppose this Bill for precisely the same reason that we tabled an amendment to the Vote on Account passed during the last two days, because we consider that £7,800,000 is a sum in excess of what the country can afford to pay for the service it is getting for the three or four months covered by it.  The Minister for Finance stated that the Government is constantly being faced with a demand for increased expenditure, and he made a speech on that assumption, although the demand on this occasion was for reduced expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>It was meant very seriously.  We hope during the discussion upon the Estimates in detail that we will be able to prove that such a reduction is possible, and that such a reduction is possible with an improvement in the efficiency of the machinery of administration.  That is, perhaps, a big undertaking for a Party in opposition without the resources of the Civil Service to supply it with information at its disposal; but, nevertheless, with only the facts that are contained within the covers of those Estimates, I think he will be able to establish that to the satisfaction of unprejudiced opinion. The Minister has stated what I was going to call attention to.  He said we may not have the cheapest and most efficient kind of machinery, and we may not have the machinery which we would create if we were starting afresh. I think the statement made by the Minister is an indication of the real truth of the situation.  It is not altogether a criticism of the Ministry to say that the machinery which they control now was taken over by them at a very critical and disordered time.  It was hastily adapted by them to their needs.  It was patched up in places, where it needed to be patched, and added to as occasion arose, with the result that a rather crazy structure now exists, a structure which, as the Minister said, &ldquo;if we were starting afresh to build up from the bottom would be altogether different in many important matters.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> Anyone with experience of administration knows that it is much easier to build up an establishment than to lower it after it has been built.  It is much easier to give positions to people with claims, political and otherwise, for them, than it is to take those positions away again when economy demands it. I am not satisfied that the arguments advanced by the Minister against such a reorganisation of the machinery of Government are sound.  He mentioned that they were up against considerable difficulties, but he did not enumerate the difficulties.  He said that they would be up against vested interests, but he did not enumerate them.  It is a fact that there are vested interests entrenched behind that machinery of administration which it will be very hard to remove and which can only be removed by a mighty effort.  Until this Government, or some other Government, steels itself for the effort, that reorganisation of the machinery of administration will not take place.</P>
    <P>It is being constantly stated in this House that the resources of the country are almost entirely the resources of the agricultural community.  If we take the case of an individual farmer and see how he is affected by the present situation, we will get a fair idea of how the whole country is affected.  The burden of taxation alone is not the main cause of the farmer's troubles. Of course I recollect the President endeavouring to prove to his own satisfaction, if to nobody else's, that the farmer pays no taxes, but Deputies on the Benches opposite as well as in other parts of the House who have some knowledge of the conditions in agricultural communities, know that the burden of taxation is a serious thing for the farmer.  The burden that is crushing the farmer to the ground and that is stifling his productive enterprise is the burden of taxation, plus the burden of rates, and land annuities. When we look at the burden that he is carrying we see one particular part of it that he need not have been asked to shoulder&mdash;that is the burden of land annuities.  Mind you, I am not asking that the farmer should pay no land annuities, but what I do say is that the land annuities that are <Col N="1649" /> being paid under the Acts prior to the Act of 1923 are a dead loss to the country, and I submit that they are being paid out of the country contrary to the dictates of justice or law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I do not propose to debate it.  I am merely indicating that, when we talk of the burdens of the country, we are not talking of the burden of taxation alone, and that when we say they can be lightened we mean that they can be lightened in various ways, besides lightening the burden of taxation.  I would like to remind the House that on another occasion, when the matter of the compensation that is being paid to distressed loyalists was under discussion here, the President admitted in the House that the 10 per cent. additional compensation given them was given them freely and voluntarily by the Government, without any request and much less without any pressure from the British Government.  Surely, when the head of the Government opposite undertook an additional liability of that kind of his own free will and not in consequence of a request, he had not in mind the condition of the distressed nationalists of the country, or else he would not have undertaken that additional liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our objection to the expenditure of this sum is due mainly to the fact that the country is not getting value for the money.  The Minister mentioned the various demands, which are and have been made for increased expenditure on particular items; for increased expenditure upon arterial drainage, the improvement of land, and things of that nature.  I would like to be able to prove, and I think it is provable if one had all the information necessary, that the increased expenditure is not necessarily impossible of achievement without increased taxation.  We are aware of the difficulties of the matter.  We are aware that it is possible that some time we ourselves will be called upon to make good our words, and that we will have to find the money, within the limits of existing revenue or within the limits of a reduced revenue, to enable <Col N="1650" /> these improvements to be carried out.  We hope to do it, as Deputy Flinn pointed out, by concentrating upon that section of the administration which is productive when increased expenditure is in contemplation, and by concentrating upon the section of the administration which is unproductive when savings have to be effected. Leaving out of consideration even the whole question of the reorganisation of the entire machine and its substitution by a simpler and cheaper method of administration, the method suggested by Deputy Flinn, which is the method adopted by great industrial trusts throughout the world when it is necessary for them to cut down their overhead charges, the method of putting in men with power to examine into every detail of expenditure and to carry out the necessary reorganisation and reduction without any thought for political consideration whatsoever, should, we believe, be adopted in the case of the present administration.</P>
    <P>We have no faith in the so-called economy committee of which &ldquo;the indication of appreciation&rdquo; is chairman. We believe that if a committee of this House, representative of all sections were given authority by the House to make that investigation and to report back direct to the House, if it was in earnest about its work, it could indicate methods by which considerable reductions in unproductive expenditure could be made.  I will give the Ministry the credit of saying that, however much they may shirk the idea of that investigation, I believe that once that possible savings were brought to their notice they would not hesitate to effect them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he was anxious to reduce the burden on the shoulders of industry and to facilitate the undertakers of industry in every way.  I do not like the word &ldquo;undertakers.&rdquo;. It seems to have a very direct bearing upon the present position of industry in this country.  If the Minister is so anxious to facilitate undertakers of industry in every way he could do so in many directions that would not involve the expenditure of an additional halfpenny.  I presume the matter of protection, tariffs and the like <Col N="1651" /> would be ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle, but we hope to indicate on some future date that the Government has in its power and under its control the resources which would enable it without increasing expenditure by a single halfpenny to give industry the fillip it is asking for to enable the different sections of it throughout the country to get on their feet and make progress, and consequently to give employment to the larger number of our fellow countrymen who are without it to-day.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on the Vote of Account we dealt fairly extensively with the matter of the Army and the Civic Guards and it is not necessary to deal with them in detail now.  I do not think any case has been made out to justify the maintenance of the Army as at present established.  I do not think any answer has been made to statements from these Benches that the Army is not being maintained to serve any national purpose.  There is no nation within striking distance of our shores that is likely under any conceivable circumstances to invade this country that cares one iota about your 15,000 men.  If they wanted to invade this country the 15,000 men here would not stop them.  If they wanted to establish themselves in this country a different kind of force would be necessary. As Deputy de Valera pointed out on a previous occasion, there is only one kind of defence possible for the Irish people against outside aggression, and that is to organise themselves to make the retention of that foreign aggression here so intolerable to the aggressors that they could not stay&mdash;to organise our defence in such a way that no foreign power could establish the machinery of government in this island.  That will not be done by the parade of highly-drilled troops organised on the model of the British Army, but by organising the manhood of Ireland on a volunteer territorial basis and getting men who are willing to serve in defence of their country without reward.  Many of them are willing to pay, as they have paid, for the privilege of serving.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the police force is of normal size, and that to maintain the ordinary normal policing <Col N="1652" /> of the country as many Guards as we have at present are necessary.  I think anybody who has travelled through the country and who has his eyes open will admit that in the little villages and small towns where police barracks are situated, occupied by five or six men in idleness, these men because they are doing nothing are driven by sheer boredom to the manufacture of crime and to the stretching of the law to exercise their political antagonisms.  I think with the development of motor transport a much smaller police force would suffice for the effective policing of the country, with corresponding saving to the taxpayers.  Altogether, I believe that if every Department of the Government was gone through by people with a knowledge of the conditions in their minds, and with the knowledge that all those arguments about the impossibility of reducing taxation did not count, but that the one fact that we must reduce taxation does count; if every Department was gone through in that spirit, I believe we would be able to effect the saving we have indicated in the amendment we proposed in the Vote on Account of £3,000,000 per year. We are not satisfied that we have received any indication since we came into this Assembly that the Government realises the seriousness of the situation, or that it has made any real effort to deal with it, and consequently we will vote against this Bill, as we did against the Vote on Account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the people of the country will suffer a great disappointment when they read the statement of the Minister for Finance.  In the first place, there is no reference in his statement to-day, or on the last occasion on which he spoke on this matter of expenditure, with reference to how the committee on economy is progressing, or what hope he can hold out as to economies that may be effected during the coming year.  We had also expected that the Minister would have given us some statement as to how he proposed to allocate the money recently raised under the National Loan.  He stated they were making provision under the present estimate for agricultural credit societies, and this question is of special importance this year on account of the flotation of the agricultural credit corporation.  This corporation has been greatly lauded by the Minister for Agriculture and other members of the Government Party throughout the country.  There is great expectation among the farmers that means will be found through the operation of this corporation to give them substantial loans to enable them to carry on.  What do we find?  We find that nobody has yet taken it on himself to state how this agricultural credit corporation is to carry out its operations; whether it is to work through the banks or through the local credit societies.  If the Government has, as I suppose it has, the interests of the farmers at heart, it would do what it could to forward the organisation <Col N="1654" /> of these credit societies throughout the country.  In that way the farmers would not be in the position that they would have to go to the banks.  As far as the farmers can see at present, they will be under precisely the same conditions in going to the agricultural credit corporation for a loan as they would if going to a joint stock bank.</P>
      <P>In the first place, inquiries will have to be made as to their title if they are getting out mortgages.  That will cause considerable expense.  In addition to that, the money will be borrowed at five per cent. interest and when you add to that the legal expenses in connection with the taking out of mortgages, making inquiries into title, and also the expenses of the Credit Corporation itself, I cannot see how that Corporation will benefit the farmer very much.  Furthermore, there is the point that if credit societies are not started and if the Government do not take steps to push them energetically and as soon as possible, even if the Credit Corporation comes to something, there is grave danger that small farmers will receive no benefit and that it will be only the large farmers, the men with 200 acres, the ranchers, whose applications for loans the banks for one reason or another can support, will get anything. This is a very important and serious matter, and as the question of agricultural credit has been mooted throughout the country and as there are many thousands of people interested in it, I say it is time that we had a clear statement from the Government as to what they are doing in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants to know what basis for discussion we should have in this House.  I can quite understand the impatience of Government Deputies who are going about privately and who, I daresay, have not been averse in their public statements to saying that there is extravagance in certain departments of administration, that certain departments are not doing their work, and that their operations should be speeded up.  I can quite understand their impatience while this discussion is going on at having to leave the matter entirely in the hands of Ministers on the Front Bench.  If they were allowed to speak there is not one of them who <Col N="1655" /> would not use the same arguments as we are using against the dilatory methods of some departments and their over-staffing.  The Minister for Education was very wise last night as the result, I suppose, of his long experience in the Board of Works.  I do not think that a more appropriate department could have been given to the Professor because under the old British régime the Board of Public Works was regarded by Irish Nationalists, who were looking for financial control and independence, as a joke.  It was referred to by a county man of mine&mdash;Sir Anthony MacDonnell&mdash;as &ldquo;the distinguished gentlemen of the distinguished Department of the Board of Works.&rdquo;  Nobody was ever able to find out what it was doing.</P>
    <P>Now, when it seemed that there was some prospect that the Board of Works would be called on to do something in the way of drainage schemes, the Government passed two Drainage Acts, and passed over the whole administration in connection with drainage schemes to local bodies.  That kind of thing will not do.  The local bodies are not able to bear any heavier burden.  The local ratepayers cannot pay any heavier taxation in connection with drainage schemes.  Therefore, I say it is up to members on the Government benches, as well as those on this side, to proclaim the fact that the Government are not doing justice to the local authorities by charging them with these services.  If necessary, let us give local authorities power to employ fresh officials and staff and let their powers be extended, but if that is going to be done, and if we are going to have this decentralisation and piling on of work to local authorities, let us get rid of institutions like the Board of Works, which are doing nothing except building police barracks throughout the country.  The Board of Works was referred to by Deputy Cooper when discussing this question last year.  Really, Deputy Cooper is a very humbugging sort of man, because he delivered quite a long speech last year in which he went into the details concerning each Government Department, and pointed out that there had been enormous increases in the staff, and that some Departments&mdash;like <Col N="1656" /> the Revenue Department, which has, of course, increased enormously, and for which perhaps there is an excuse&mdash;were the bad boys of the piece.  If I am not misquoting him, I think he referred to our friends, the Board of Works, as being also among the bad boys.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper stated last year that since the Free State came into existence the number of officials in the Board of Works had advanced from 193 to 314. There might have been a corresponding increase in the staff this year, but for some reason or another, they left it so. Under the old British régime the Board of Works cost only £43,000 with 93 officials.  Now, it has 314 officials, or three times as many as previously.  I am not going into the question as to why the expenditure on officials has increased. I quite agree that a case might be made out to show that, owing to the increase in the cost of living and so on, there is bound to be an increase, but when there is an increase in the number of officials, and when we have no case stated showing what these Departments are doing for the country or what services they are giving we must naturally take up the attitude, in regard to which I think Deputy Flinn rendered great service in bringing forward that the basis of our discussion of these Estimates ought not to be: &ldquo;Take what is here and see how you can improve it,&rdquo; but &ldquo;What is it that the Irish people can afford to pay?  Let us cut our coat according to our measure.&rdquo;  It has been proved, and members of the Government are well aware of it, by capable economists in this country that while the present rate of taxation is going on there is a steady drain, not alone on the capital reserve of the country, which is slowly being eaten up, but also on the subsistence allowance of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>That has been proved by one of our cleverest economists.  If that is wrong and if it can be shown in comparison with any other country, even in comparison with England, which has enormous wealth arising out of her foreign investments, that we in this country are comparatively well off, I would like the Government to prove that, and not be falling back on the civil war argument, which no longer exists, and trying <Col N="1657" /> to show that we were responsible for that.  They should not fall back on the silly argument that because you demand expenditure on certain services you have no right to demand retrenchment in others.  It is precisely because we have too large expenditure, too many Departments and too much over-staffing that we have not money available for the social services which the Labour Party want, and when Deputy Davin, or some other Deputy, asks me why I vote for a reduction I say it is because I am not convinced and no case has been put up to me that the Land Commission or the Board of Works are carrying out duties or rendering services equal to the cost of those Departments.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in regard to drainage, in which Deputy Davin is particularly interested, there is a reduction in the estimate of £30,000 this year.  Note that there is a reduction for drainage but not for expenditure in the Board of Works or a reduction in the number of officials.  There is, however, a reduction on the amount of money which would give employment to people throughout the country, even at 28s. a week, and a great many of them when not working are getting 28s. 6d. a week as unemployment benefit. That is very bad economy, and the sooner we can make money available from other sources to keep these people in employment the better.  The extraordinary thing is that while we have a reduction of £30,000 for drainage service, in the Land Commission, where it only cost £11,800 in 1923-24 for travelling expenses, it is now costing £34,000. Therefore the drainage scheme had to go wallop.  The employees on these schemes had to be thrown out of employment. They have been out of employment for very many months. Why?  Because the £30,000 was needed to pay for the travelling expenses of the officials of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of local loans.  There has been a steady decrease in Grants-in-Aid which would enable local authorities to go on with housing or urgent schemes.  I submit that the Government&mdash;so long as they refuse to make money available for housing and for urgent public services, while their <Col N="1658" /> estimates show that there has been a steady decrease even since the Free State came into being in the amounts available for these public services&mdash;are wrong in saying that we have no right to get up here and say that there must be retrenchment in certain Departments if the money cannot be got in any other way.  If the Minister can make money available from the National Loan to set on foot a large national housing scheme we should all be very glad.  In the meantime, we want him to show serious consideration and to believe with us that there is quite a large volume of opinion in this country, which wants the arguments of Deputy Flinn to be considered here, that we must work on the basis of what we can afford, that we must take that as the principle and that we must have some form of committee in which everybody can have confidence, which will go through the different Departments as has been suggested by other speakers and make economies which are necessary if these public works are to be gone on with.</P>
    <P>The Housing Grant in 1923-24 amounted to £963,000.  Last year the amount was only £502,000.  This year they have gone down to £419,000, a reduction since last year of £97,000.  I say when you have a reduction of that character in such an urgent public service as housing which has been held up since 1914 throughout the country it is time we ought to ask why reductions should not be made in the Departments or in some other manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Grants have decreased.  There has also been a steady decrease in the amount for local loans.  The country is paying its tribute to the British Treasury of £600,000 in respect of local loans that are said to to be due, but there has been a decrease since 1926-27 from £500,000 to £142,000 in the present year in respect of Grants-in-Aid.  Drainage schemes and sewerage schemes have been prepared all over the country. Local bodies are prepared to go on with them if they get facilities, and if the conditions are modified so that they will be enabled to carry them out on economic conditions.  We asked that the Government should consider this matter very seriously and let us have a comprehensive statement of their policy during the coming year.  As a matter of fact, I find that in 1926 the Minister, when discussing the Vote on Account, mentioned that the Government were then contemplating the issue of loans for the much longer term of 60 years. The Minister for Finance spoke of giving loans for a period of 60 years at that time, but nothing has been done since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other matters to which I would like to call attention. In the first place, the Road Fund is one of the services which come under the Central Fund.  On the 31st December, or perhaps before Christmas of last year, the labourers who were employed throughout the country on direct labour on trunk roads and on road schemes under the Road Department, were dismissed from employment because there was a shortage of funds.  I went to the Road Department and the Secretary <Col N="1661" /> there informed me that he was taking up the matter and that he expected that contrary to the usual custom, the Road Fund which had not hitherto been available until March, would be available in January so that there might not be any break in employment, and that the very great distress&mdash;and I can assure the House that very great distress was caused as a result of the drying up of the funds at the end of the year&mdash;would be done away with and that there would not be any necessity to spend even any of the Unemployment Grant in my constituency.  As a result of that there was no money spent by the Land Commission on bog roads or any other work of that nature. It is only now, after a period of three months, that the moneys which were promised before Christmas are forthcoming, and that those labourers who were dismissed in very large numbers &mdash;I think I can say in hundreds&mdash;in each of those two counties, Kilkenny and Carlow&mdash;have any prospect of being taken back into employment.  I suggest to the Ministry that it is merely a matter of bookkeeping to have always in the hands of the local bodies sufficient money to enable them to keep their labourers employed, and that it is not good enough that because of a certain system of Government accountancy hundreds of people should be thrown out of employment, merely because the Department of Finance could not pass this grant a few months earlier than usual.  There is also the question of motor vehicle duties.  There is a large number of poor people, some of them running buses and some private motor cars, and a great hardship has been caused to these people by the increase in taxation on old Ford cars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a Budget point.  The question of motor taxation arises on the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the House that we can all agree with the Minister for Finance that there ought to be a basis for discussion as to how our national Budget ought to be drawn up and on what lines our national expenditure ought to run.  A proposal has been put forward from these benches that we ought to take as the definite basis of any committee that is set up <Col N="1662" /> that the country is in a position of great depression at present.  Taxation has undoubtedly increased enormously. There is no proof that public services, as I think I have shown, that services to the community, or schemes which would give employment, have been increased proportionately.  The increase has almost gone entirely into the creation of officials and departments.  I suppose I will be told by the Ministry that I am attacking the Civil Service. I know, quite as well as the Ministry, that at the present time the Civil Service is not an attractive proposition for young persons leaving school, because the rate of wage is about £2 per week. It does not pay a boy or girl in the country, who has had a secondary education, to go to the expense of preparing for an examination and then enter the Civil Service and try to live in Dublin, in the way that he or she ought to live as a worthy member of the Civil Service, on £2 per week. Hundreds of temporary clerks have been dismissed.  Large numbers of them are being made enter for examinations, and after a great many years' service they are only getting £2 per week.  I submit that the reason for that also is that Ministers are not paying sufficiently close attention to the administration of their Departments&mdash; that they are too apt, as the Minister for Finance explained, to take it that there are too many difficulties in the way in respect of compensation, and so on.  They find the senior officials there they call on them for advice, and are guided by them very largely in their policy.  But they have also a duty to the country.  They have a very urgent call from the country at present to make reductions, where reductions are possible, and I think that can be done without doing any injustice to any man or woman who is working in the Civil Service at present.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Bill on account of the way in which public moneys are being appropriated and utilised for the purpose of bolstering up and obtaining votes for one particular party in this House.  I will make my case.  The Minister for Finance, in reply to a question a few months ago, stated that no moneys were voted last <Col N="1663" /> year for relief works.  I want to know out of what fund moneys were made available for work carried out last June on the eve of the election.  That is one question.  That is leading up to a question as to the negotiations for the starting of these works and the method of carrying them out, which I want to make known publicly.  There is one particular case in Rossinver, County Leitrim.  It appears that a road was required to be made there through a bog running over portion of the land belonging to a man resident in the locality.  There was no right of way existing there&mdash;in other words, there was no existing right by which the roadway could be made over this man's farm.  Negotiations, therefore, started with a view to getting this man's consent to the proposed road.  One would imagine that the ordinary method of negotiation would be through the officials sent down by the Land Commission or somebody representative of them.  Instead of that I shall read extracts from a letter to show how they were carried out:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">Sunday, 29th, 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dear Patrick,&mdash;Judging from some uncomplimentary remarks which your son James made yesterday, it seems to me that you think there is some conspiracy going on in connection with the road.  That idea is absolutely untrue, and from some statements which you made it would seem you do not understand the circumstances of the case.  Consequently I am writing you this letter to put the true facts before you and give you a chance to judge for yourself. In the first place, Ed. McKeon tells me that you gave unconditional consent on the day Mr. Morrison came to map the road, that the road. is mapped through the meadow, that the road must be made according to His business was to map the road. Mr. Morrison's map or not made at all.  Don't blame Ed. McKeon or anyone else; if you had any objection to make you should have made it when Mr. Morrison was on the ground.  Mr. Morrison is the chief engineer under the I.L. Commission. His business was to map the road. <Col N="1664" /> He could not sanction the road, he could only recommend it.  Every new work under the new scheme must be done according to Mr. Morrison's map.  Now the second man, Mr. Bennett, was not an engineer; he was an Inspector.  His business was to sanction or disallow the road. He had nothing whatever to do with the mapping of the road.  About a fortnight ago I asked Ed. McKeon was your road sanctioned under the new scheme; he told me it was.  I then asked him to try and get the work started before the election.  He was good enough to comply with my wishes.  He is greatly dissatisfied after yesterday.  I doubt if he will bother about your road any more. Now I ask you this question: Is it to your advantage to disappoint and insult people who are doing their best to help you?  Yesterday I told Ed. McKeon that if the road was going through the meadow that yourself and three sons would have to get work.  He said that was against the rules.  I said, rules or no rules, the four of you would have to get work. If the four of you were working it would bring over £5 per week, and, with a little strategy on our part, the work could be kept going for eight or ten weeks.  In my opinion that would be the safest, the surest and the best compensation.  Remember, it is not a wise policy to grasp at too much and lose all.  Don't take my advice, don't do anything on my account.  Consult your own interest and act accordingly.  If you think title to the land required to make the that I have any personal interest in the road you are making a mistake; I don't care a straw if the road was never made at all; the old ass-pass will do my day; but as President of the branch of C. nG.  I want to see the work undertaken.</P>
    <P>As a result of the negotiations an arrangement was come to, and here is a copy of the agreement that was subsequently signed:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">(Copy.)</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE DRUNGAN BOG ROAD.</P>
    <P>I, Patrick Brady, Drungan, Rossinver, agree to give up my right and <Col N="1665" /> title to the land required to make the necessary changes in the road.  The changes in the road shall be those marked out by myself, and Master Feely have already agreed.  We both shall block out the road.  I, myself, shall be ganger, and my sons shall get work.  I agree to carry out the instructions of the Supervisor as regards hours of work and the diligence of my gang as part of my duty as ganger.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) PATRICK BRADY.</P>
    <P>That is signed by Brady, whose land was being negotiated for.  As a result this agreement was signed, the Inspector from the Land Commission came along and got a copy of it.  He sanctioned it, and the grant was made and the work started.</P>

      <P>The work being started the usual procedure is under the scheme that a ganger should be appointed in charge of from 14 to 21 men. I think 14 is the number in this case. Brady, whose land was being used according to this agreement, was appointed ganger, and the extraordinary thing was that in addition to that, a second ganger was appointed in the person of the Cumann na nGaedheal, who had negotiated the work.  The work continued, I do not know for how long, but possibly until after the election. One of the men employed under these two gangers was actually sent by the President of the Cumann na nGaedheal to do work on his own farm, but was paid out of public funds as pay day came along.  The matter was mentioned by one of the workmen to the supervising ganger, but no notice was taken. This year the work was restarted. When it was first started it was probably not completed.  The work was to be re-started and the contract negotiated so well last year could not be held this year.  The money was given for the road, and here is another correspondence dated this year.</P>

I have tried again and again by reporting the matter to the various officials in charge without getting any satisfaction.  We are now asked here to give a vote on account, and I know that this money that I am speaking of has been misappropriated in this way and has been scandalously wasted and yet I am asked to vote in favour of it.

He proceeded to ventilate that charge according to himself to officials on the spot, but the Deputy had an opportunity of putting down a question on the Order Paper raising the matter and he has not done so.  He has not even written to the Minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary.  If the Deputy imagines or if other Deputies imagine that a Minister can answer without a moment's notice every case of complaint that may be urged, well, of course, he would require to be an encyclopedia instead of a Minister.

Every form of machinery that the Government could bring into effect, every form of terrorism that they could bring into being to terrorise the people, has been used, until they are brought to the state that it is at least very difficult to get them to come forward to give evidence of the existence of these things.  It is through an occasion like this, that that spirit will be brought back to the people whereby they will be able to stand up honestly and declare against injustice and unfairness, whether it comes from those in charge of the State or from those lower down.

      <P>When we on these Benches have been dealing with public expenditure, no matter how clear or how logical the statements were, all the logic in the world seems to go off the people on the opposite Benches like water off a duck.  All the main points were either ignored or deliberately misrepresented, and the clear cold facts given by Deputies Flinn, Lemass, Derrig, and others were all glossed over. All that appeared out of it, according to what we heard from the other side, was that we had advocated the abolition of the Gárda Síochána and the Free State Army.  The Minister for Finance last evening made the allegation that on these Benches we were advocating only these two particular things.  When I asked him to give us the names of the Deputies who had made the statements. he gave us an airy wave of his hand by way of answer. <Col N="1674" /> Those two things were drawn like a red herring across the trail and everything that had been pointed out, every means by which expenditure might have been reduced, and the moneys devoted to productive work were forgotten or misrepresented, with the consequence that it appeared&mdash;at least those on the opposite Benches tried to make it appear&mdash;that all we were doing was advocating the abolition of the Army and Civic Guard.  Deputy Flinn suggested that we should send along a committee with a new broom into some of the Government Departments, and sweep out all the passengers and the ballast, leaving people behind who were doing the work or were capable of doing the work&mdash;sweeping out the passengers they were carrying and by that means save some money and devote it to productive purposes.  Of course that was ignored.  Little Deputy J.J. Byrne referred to Deputy Flinn as the new apostle of something&mdash;I do not know what.  Evidently when Deputy Flinn makes any statement in this House Deputy J.J. Byrne takes it as if it were a red rag to a bull.  One day we are told by Deputy Byrne that we have all the power we want, that we can do anything in this Dáil, and he comes out with some momentous phrase such as turning men into women and women into men.  It reminded me of Theo Von Harbou in &ldquo;Metropolis&rdquo; and I almost picture to myself a metamorphosis taking place in Deputy Byrne, whom I can imagine as Rotwang, but I do not know whether we on these benches are going to be turned into Mary Pickfords or Mother Hubbards. Again yesterday he said all these things are all right on the hustings&mdash;we were talking airy nothings on these benches. We felt, I may tell you, as light as fairies when he was talking.  We felt we were going along listening to the Pipes of Pan and as the French phrase puts it sleeping &ldquo;á l'auberge de la belle étoile.&rdquo;  Unfortunately to spoil that along comes Deputy Davin who bounces up and down with the resilience of a rubber ball.  He wants to know &ldquo;Will Fianna Fáil tell me this?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Will Fianna Fáil tell me that?&rdquo; I happen to be one of those who were on hunger strike when Deputy Davin struck for <Col N="1675" /> two days and I was delighted to hear that he had not lost his job over it, but when he spoke so feelingly about it, I felt, and I am sure we all felt, ungrateful. I thought of the words of the song &ldquo;Blow, blow thou winter wind, thou are not so unkind as man's ingratitude.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, again, we are being educated when we attempt to say anything as regards economy by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture.  He deals out to us, with his cherubic smile, knowledge with a lavish hand&mdash;or at least he attempts to do so&mdash;and the only regret I have is that evidently we arrived too late, because we have not seen much of it since we came in.  He must have given it all away before we arrived. We were told by the Minister for Finance &ldquo;to come down to brass tacks,&rdquo; and were asked to show how we could reduce expenditure.  Last year £92,831 was spent on the Department of Fisheries, out of which £7,000 was in loans to fishermen&mdash;£7,000 out of £92,831!  Let us see how the loans operated.  At the end of last year I had a case here of four brothers who had obtained a boat which cost £3,000.  They obtained it on loan and paid back over £1,500, but because they could not keep up the instalments the boat was taken from them.  So much for the loan.</P>

      <P>Yes, but could not a smaller boat have been provided?  As a matter of fact, the boat was not much good and half of it would have been much worse.  There was no compensation whatever given to these four men, who were left to starve.  There was £7,000 spent on so-called productive work out of £92,831.  Could not some <Col N="1676" /> of the remainder of the money have been dispensed in providing boats and gear for fishermen?  That would have been productive work.  It was not.  It was spent on inspectors who had nothing to inspect, because there was no fishing.  The Minister cannot say that he spent it on repairs to slips or piers, because I have sent him at least seven communications relative to the repair of slips.  In each case the men were compelled to walk up to their waist to bring in their boats in stormy weather.  I have the replies off by heart: &ldquo;A chara,&mdash;I am instructed by the Minister to inform you that as there is not enough fishing being carried on in this area, he cannot recommend the expenditure of public moneys in repairs to this slip.&rdquo;</P>

Here is £7,000 which was spent last year out of £92,831 on productive work. I would not like to suggest that the brush would catch the Minister, but we might have a bit of a sweep around the Minister's Department, and if we could sweep out anything in the way of ballast we might at least have a little more money to devote to productive work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have shown briefly that if we were to go into these Departments &mdash;we were not allowed, remember, in spite of Deputy Davin, the bouncing Deputy, to go into details.  But if we were allowed to go into details, as we will when the Estimates come up, we could show, as we have shown already here, that there is wide room for improvement in each Department, and that the money that is now being spent on what I call passengers in a Department could be put into productive work.  It is not that we wish for these reductions so <Col N="1677" /> much from the point of view of saving the country as that the money that is being voted is not being devoted to the best interests of the country; and if there was more of it spent in productive work perhaps we would not be asking for a reduction in the amount, because the people would be far better able to meet the taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow the last speaker in his exceedingly entertaining and, in part, instructive speech; but I would like to call the attention of the House to what I regard as a very serious fallacy in the statement made by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister stated that there seemed to be a demand for a general expenditure.  He almost went so far as to say&mdash;and certainly he left me under the impression that he meant to say&mdash; that there was a demand for an all round expenditure, with the exception, it is true, of certain political or controversial matters to which he referred. I, for one, desire to take exception to that statement.  From my experience in this House, I have come to realise that the demand has not been so much for all round expenditure as for expenditure in certain directions, and curtailment in others.  The Minister also seemed to lay it down as a general proposition that the demand for increased expenditure necessarily meant increased taxation.  In that I entirely disagree with him.  There are two ways of raising money for the State.  One is by taxation and the other is by borrowing. Certainly I am of opinion that so far as abnormal&mdash;or perhaps it might be well to term it capital&mdash;expenditure is concerned, this should be raised not by taxation but by borrowing.  The Government generally make it out, and in this I am in agreement with them, that we are a perfectly solvent State.  We are a new State.  We have no National Debt worth speaking about, and, if money has to be raised for the purpose of expenditure upon abnormal items.  I submit that that money should be raised by borrowing and not by taxation. Take the question of afforestation, to which the Minister referred.  I may say, in passing, that I beg to disagree with him when he gave it as his view that reafforestation would not be remunerative <Col N="1678" /> in this country.  I believe that this country is particularly suitable for certain forms of afforestation and that eventually afforestation would be remunerative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly true that the State would not get what you might call its dividends all at once.  It would have to remain out of a certain amount of money, but there is no reason, I think to doubt that eventually the expenditure would be repaid.  What would a great scheme of afforestation mean? Why should we in this year of grace be taxed to pay for benefits that would accrue to the citizens of this State, say, twenty years hence?  I say that is a particular instance where the expenditure that would be involved upon afforestation should not be met by taxation, but should be provided for by borrowing.  To my mind, this whole question is not so much one of general curtailing of expenditure in all Departments, or an increase, as the Minister suggests, thereby of taxation, but rather it is a question of general readjustment both of taxation and of expenditure.  There are items in this Vote where readjustments could be made.  Allusion has been made to the Committee which is at present supposed to be operating in regard to economies and expenditure.  Whether that Committee is operating or not I am not personally aware.  I was never in favour of the form that that Committee took. Neither would I be anxious to see a committee such as is suggested from the Fianna Fáil Benches, composed of members of this House.  What I have advocated, and do still advocate, is that there should be a committee set up composed of people who would have the confidence of the great element of the business community, of the farming community, and of the taxpayers generally; a committee that would not be confined to members of this House, and a committee that would certainly not be composed of civil servants of this State.  What I have advocated is that that committee should be a committee on the basis of the Geddes Committee which operated so successfully across the water, and that that committee should make a wholesale search through all the Departments of the <Col N="1679" /> State to find out where, and how, economies could be effected.</P>
    <P>There is one item in connection with which, I think, economies could be effected.  Reference has again been made, and I made it many times previously myself, to the size of our National Army.  I have constantly had to contradict the statement that I was in favour of the abolition of the Army. I am in favour of no such thing; but I am not in favour of keeping up an army which, no matter what its dimensions might be&mdash;I go so far as to say that even if every man in this country was trained in that army&mdash;would in time of external aggression be of no use whatever to protect this State against the modern means of warfare. Let us have a standing army as a token, if you like, of our sovereignty and of our status as a nation.  But what is the good of this mock pretence of having an army which is supposed to be of some use in case of an attack by an external power.  Let us consider for a moment what use would that Army be if we were attacked from, say, the middle of the Irish Sea, or near the western coast by a naval squadron whose guns would reach, perhaps, as far as Athlone or Galway, or by a fleet of aeroplanes which would be able to devastate the country by bombs.  The idea of defence is preposterous.  The British Army to-day, nobody in his senses suggests, would be able to protect the shores of England against external aggression.  Therefore, I think that in this respect there could be a large and useful economy effected.</P>
    <P>I am glad that at long last the Government have thought fit to adopt a suggestion that I made many times previously in the nature of establishing something on the lines of a territorial force.  But I think they could go further than that.  I think they could limit the actual standing army to one of much smaller dimensions and then, if they liked, proceed upon a territorial basis to have something in the nature of a territorial force which, though it might be of no use as against external aggression, might be of service to the growing youth of the country, and might be of use in case of internal trouble.  That is only one instance <Col N="1680" /> where, I think, expenditure could be curtailed.  There are many others and, therefore, I desire at once to dispel the idea, if it does exist, as put forward by the Minister for Finance, that though demands are made for increased expenditure in certain Departments, that that necessarily means there must be increased taxation.  In the first place, increased taxation could be avoided by the curtailment of expenditure in other Departments and in the second place increased taxation could be avoided to a great extent by borrowing sums for the purpose of assisting and substantiating non-recurrent and abnormal expenditure. That could be done instead of raising the money, as is seemingly at present done, by means of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'REILLY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance told us that the tendency is to ask for more money from the Dáil. That is not a bit strange to me.  People generally look for money where money is to be found.  According to the system of taxation that has been adopted in this country, it seems to have been all drawn into the Dáil and all placed at the disposal of the Minister for Finance. The Minister also told us that he was compelled to adopt the systems which he found here; that for certain reasons he was unable to adopt any new system If we look back on former years we will find that one of the most potent methods of killing industry used by the British Government was this one method of taxation.  It is quite obvious to everybody in this House that that poison to industry is certainly very efficacious up to the present day.  We find that during the last five years industries are disappearing rapidly from the countryside and have almost disappeared from the City of Dublin. Such, no doubt, is the effect of taxation.</P>
      <P>The bulk of our argument is certainly against high expenditure, because high expenditure begets taxation.  We did not argue that money expended in reproductive industries is bad.  On the contrary, we welcome that method.  It is absolutely necessary by such means to stimulate our dying industries and try to establish the infant ones.  There are other means which may be adopted for that purpose, but I suppose at the present moment the Chair would not permit me to enter into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> We must all admit that we are not an industrial country.  We have not any industries.  We speak of agriculture as being our main, our fundamental, industry. To strangers who come to this country it would certainly be a dream and we would find it difficult to convince them that we were an agricultural country.  Our fundamental industry is in a very weak condition.  It would be impossible to expect that other industries would be in any sort of a healthy condition.  Taxation in the past and up to the present is the cause of that misfortune. Taxation directly affects production; the country that is heavily taxed cannot produce cheaply and the country that cannot produce cheaply cannot sell because there is no market. That is really the effect that taxation has on industry in general and it puts the people of this country into the position of looking to the Government for subsidies.  Their wealth has been drained from them and they look for relief from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government are very generous until that generosity comes to be examined.  You find magnificent schemes for house building and for drainage, but you find no drainage or house building going on in the country. I wonder what is the reason for that. I do not believe the county councils are too shy to ask for the money required. There must be some other reason why that work is not going on.  There must be some block put on the issue of the money to prevent work of that sort being carried out.  Industries cannot be started through the country without two things, namely, capital and housing. You cannot put the workmen in tents, and if they have not houses to live in you cannot start industries.  Therefore, housing is one of the greatest necessities in this State.  It is fundamental to the development of industry. Drainage is also most important, both from the point of view of the health of the nation and the productivity of the land.  Farmers do not find it worth their while to drain their lands or spend money on them.  They say that it is impossible ever to get a return from the land that is drained.  In Holland, which is an industrial country, the Government <Col N="1682" /> there spends millions on fighting the sea.  They put up defences against the sea, and simply rob land from the sea on which they put people, who are able to get a comfortable living from it. They are put in a position to produce wealth from that soil.</P>
    <P>We are not in that position in this country.  We are constantly producing but not getting the costs of production. In the farming industry, at least, we never seem to be able to get profits from it such as would enable improvements to be carried out.  We never seem to make profits from our industries such as are made in other countries to enable us to take steps to develop the marketing ends of our industries.</P>
    <P>If one is asked to explain why that is so, the only answer that can be given is that all available money has been all drained from our industries and that taxation is too high in the country.  We do not stand for a curtailment of expenditure as far as reproductive or social services are concerned, but we certainly do stand for curtailment in expenses as regards the official services. Honestly, I cannot see what we do with an army.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why something of a much cheaper class of defence force could not be brought into existence. As Deputy Redmond said, there are no enemies who are likely to invade this country that it would be possible for us to stop by force.  The only construction that I can put upon the Army is that it is a means of relieving unemployment. That means of relieving unemployment, perhaps, is justified, but there is no reproduction in that case.  Investments made by a poor country like ours, that do not give some return, are not things that, I think, should be followed up.  The sooner we admit that we are a poor country, I think, the better.  We may be solvent to-day, but if we continue to travel at the rate that we have been travelling at, it will not be very long until the bankers of this nation, the people.  will refuse to honour the cheques.  We will then be faced by quite another situation.  Every Deputy from the country will agree with me in this that away down through the country there are farmers who a few <Col N="1683" /> years ago were fairly well to do.  They are most respectable people, but to-day they have hardly sufficient to keep body and soul together.  There are farms of land in the country that are producing nothing.  Through some peculiar laws they are not allowed to produce.  That is a question that I, and every thinking Deputy, must face.  We must try and make every single unit a productive unit.  We must not, because of the laws that we happen to have adopted, prevent units from being productive.  We must try to relieve these unfortunate people who are too respectable to beg or to make known their cases.  Remember those people are suffering in secret, and their number is on the increase. For those reasons I join in the appeal that has been made for some relief on this question of taxation.</P>

In the debate on the Vote on Account the conduct of the Department of External Affairs was challenged.

      <P>I cannot resist the very kind invitation that has been extended to us from the opposite Benches. I thought that the eagerness of the Fianna Fáil Party to take part in this debate would have been so great that it would have been very unkind action on my part to intervene, and thereby prevent them having the participation <Col N="1684" /> which they so eagerly sought.  I listened with the very greatest care to the case that the Fianna Fáil Party put before the House to-day.  Deputy Lemass told us that he hopes to effect reductions. I regret he did not develop that proposition, and did not tell us how these reductions were to be made.  Deputy Lemass suggested setting up a Committee to examine into expenditure, and he hoped to obtain from it certain savings in the estimates now before the House.  We on those Benches have set up a Committee to inquire into these matters, and we are equally justified in expressing the hope that from that particular Committee, under the Chairmanship of Deputy Heffernan, certain savings and reductions will be effected in the expenditure we are now discussing.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to say that the difference between the Opposition Benches and ourselves regarding these Estimates has narrowed down very considerably. When I was on the hustings during the recent elections I heard, time and time again, the claim made that Fianna Fáil could run this State at half of what it cost the Free State Government to do it.  Since they have entered this House they have come to the conclusion that that was an utterly impossible proposition, and they have reduced that wild statement down to the narrow fact that the reductions in expenditure they hoped to make consists of a sum of £3,000,000.  I suggest that from the Committee over which Deputy Heffernan is presiding certain suggestions will come before this Aseembly which will have the effect of enabling considerable savings to be made in certain of the Estimates.  In the debate upon the Vote on Account, which has been passed by this House, I ventured to deal in some detail with the various items of expenditure.  I took the various Departments.  I put figures before the House, and I invited criticism upon any or all of these Departments.  I asked Deputies on the Opposition Benches to point out in which particular Department the savings they mentioned could be effected, and I still await an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endeavoured to show by these figures that the services of the country fell under two heads, the first being essential services, and the second services <Col N="1685" /> arising from the setting up of the Saorstát as a separate political entity. Included in the essential services are social services regarding which Deputies on the opposite side said they do not stand for any reduction.  We are spending on these social services £10,500,000, and on the other services, which are indispensable to the State, £6,000,000; that is £16,500,000 out of £22,000,000.  If this expenditure can be curtailed with safety to the State, I assure the Opposition Party that we on this side are just as anxious for that curtailment as they are, and would welcome their assistance in effecting it. Any concrete suggestions they put forward will have the most sympathetic consideration from those Benches.  I regret that the non-participation of Deputies on this side in this particular debate was considered rather in the nature of an affront.  We expected to hear something concrete, some suggestions of a sound and logical kind that we could apply to the Estimates.</P>

      <P>I will leave it to the House to judge for themselves.  We have been told that the main objection to the expenditure was that the country is not getting value for its money.  That is a very sweeping assertion, and it calls for some proof.  The great fault we on this side have with the Opposition members is that they get up and make the most sweeping statements and leave them standing there unsupported, without one scintilla of evidence as to whether they are accurate or not.  I suggest they are not treating this House or their constituents fairly, and that they are not dealing in a fair manner <Col N="1686" /> with this very important matter. If the country was not getting value for its money, if its finances were not being wisely administered, if there was waste or extravagance of any shape or kind taking place in this country, would the hard-hearted capitalists have subscribed to the National Loan at the very low rate of interest offered.</P>

      <P>Reverting to the subject under discussion, and leaving aside these silly interjections for the moment, I suggest that the capitalists who lent this money are very shrewd judges as to whether we are administering this State in the way it ought to be administered, that before that money was advanced they looked at the overhead charges and inquired as to whether the administration is sound and efficient, so as to see whether they could get security for the money they were lending. All these matters were examined by the financial experts solely from the financial point of view, and this country was not found wanting.  On the contrary, as I have pointed out, the money was advanced at a rate of interest two per cent. below that which Belgium could borrow for.  Deputy Lemass told us that there are resources at the disposal of the Government to give the necessary fillip to industry, but he did not tell us what these resources were. We would be very glad to hear how industry is to get the benefit of them. As a business man, I have some small interest in this matter, and I would be very glad to know how industry could get that fillip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> It is a well-known fact that most people and most firms are lucky if they can pay five per cent. on invested capital. Has it been suggested, even on that particular score, that the Government have done nothing to fulfil the duty imposed on them?  Is there no such Act in existence as the Credit Facilities Act?  Is there no Act in existence that will furnish money for the starting of industrial enterprise? Why has that money not been availed of?  Let us get to the bedrock of things.  One of the great things that prevents industries being developed in this country is the smallness of our internal market, and the only thing which Deputy Lemass pointed out, the only tentative suggestion he made, so far as resources are concerned, was to point out in a passing way what could be done by means of protection.  Even in that respect the Government has not been wanting, as under its aegis a hundred industries have sprung into existence and we have given employment to 10,000 men.  All these things take time.  When we build we lay our foundations deeply and well.  That is the policy the Government have followed.</P>

      <P>I say that it is not as prosperous as it was years ago. Anyone who knows anything of the subject knows that I am stating an absolute fact.  If we are to make progress in this country we must hasten slowly and build well.  The Government have been hastening slowly.  They have turned the corner.  The country has turned the corner.  They reduced the taxpayers' burden in five years by twenty millions sterling.  They raised the credit of the country to such a position that practically no other country in Europe, with the exception, perhaps. of England, can borrow money at a lower rate of interest.  All these things the Government have done with very little help, but rather great opposition from members on the opposite Benches. We hear suggestions thrown out that the Department of Fisheries should be swept away.  Would anyone say that that is a logical or constructive proposition? We have been told by Deputy Redmond that we should borrow money so that we could afford, or rather escape from, increased taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real point at issue here is not so much increased taxation as increased expenditure.  I suggest, with all respect to Deputy Redmond, that he misinterpreted the proposition which the Minister for Finance put before the House.  His proposition was that from <Col N="1689" /> all sides of the House and from every Party he was met with demands for increased expenditure.  There is a very old saying that he who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing.  We can borrow for a certain length of time, but that money has to be paid back.  We borrowed money the other day, but we shall soon have to pay interest on it. I suggest that this method of dealing with a matter of such importance is not dealing with it in the manner in which it should be dealt.  We have been asked: &ldquo;What is the necessity for an army?&rdquo; Is there any country that can do without an army?  Is there any country which can keep order internally or prevent external aggression without an army?</P>

      <P>I cannot say that I can substantiate all these things.  I believe that the Deputy who interrupted is interested in Soviet Russia. Whether that is true or not I am not in a position to say, but whether it is true or not there are many lessons in history which show why a country should have an army.  It has been suggested by Deputies on the opposite Benches that we have only one enemy in the whole world.  We are very lucky if that be true.  I do not know any nation of which that could be said.  I do not know that a valuable island like ours would not have greedy eyes thrown at it by stronger and greater neighbours. I suggest that there is a strong necessity for the maintenance of an army of certain proportions.  So far as our Army is concerned, it is suggested that its normal cost should be one and a half millions.  Is that an abnormal army for <Col N="1690" /> a country like ours, for a country situated in a critical geographical position as this island is?  One remembers that in the Great War the neutrality of Belgium, which was guaranteed by the Great Powers, was broken.  I suggest that it would not have been broken if a large army stood behind the forts of Liege.  These facts have been written on the pages of history, and these facts cannot be silenced by smiles on the Opposition Benches, or even by the intervention of Deputy Briscoe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Byrne for some time, I think that scarcely anything need be said from these Benches as to why anybody should vote against this Bill.  He spoke about a Committee, and said that he had every hope that the Committee, of which Deputy Heffernan is proud to be the Chairman, is going to do wonderful work in the way of economy and cutting down expense in Government services. I did not know, of course, that Deputy Heffernan was President of that Committee until I saw a letter from him the other day in the Press. Had I known that, however, on the first or second day on which we attended here after the election, when I met Deputy Heffernan coming in here, having been raised to that pedestal as a token of appreciation, and noticed the leader of the Farmers' Party in plus fours and coloured garters which would do justice to any Trinity College upstart, I would have convinced myself that there was little hope that either Deputy Heffernan or his Committee would do any good in effecting economies in Government services.  There are items before our eyes which I see every day, but in regard to them I do not see <Col N="1691" /> any attempt being made to practise economy.</P>
      <P>We have an Education Department in which there is a branch or some kind of Committee set up for the publication of books for Secondary Schools. I see where that Committee certified a book as being fit for use in Secondary Schools, at the expense of the nation and the public purse.  They published that book and on it the stamp of the Board of Education, certifying that the book was to be distributed, and was a fit book for use in secondary schools.  When the book came out it was discovered by the ecclesiastical authorities, I think, that it contained the most disgraceful things that could appear in any book not only for young people but for adults.  Of course, it was absolutely unfit for schools, with the result that the Education Department, which claims to be so very efficient, had to issue instructions withdrawing that book from the public.  As a result, the gentleman who wrote that book&mdash;I believe that, from a literary point of view, it was quite a good book for adults&mdash;is at the loss of his book, and the Irish people are at the loss of the money that was spent by the bungling Government Department, at least bungling in that respect, in giving that book to the secondary schools.  That is one item regarding which Deputy Heffernan might find some use for his Committee on Economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have also another item here for Army pensions.  You have in this country, or at least, being paid out by the Twenty-six County Government, a sum of £170,000 a year for Army pensions. A few of the items might be interesting to this House.  I see that you have Deputy Gearoid O'Sullivan drawing out of the public purse, as a pension for his services to Ireland, a sum of £350 annually.  You have Deputy Broderick drawing a fat pension out of the public purse.  You have Deputy O'Connell, I think from somewhere in the south of Ireland, drawing a fat pension out of the public purse.  You have Liam Tobin, who marshalled President Cosgrave and all his Ministers to execute them because they would not take a step further a few months ago, paid out of the public purse a <Col N="1692" /> sum of £350 as an annual pension.  Is this really a pension or is it hush money?  Are they paying to the mutineers, who marshalled them for execution because they bowed down to remain the British Empire, from £160 to £350 out of the public purse, while other men whom I know, and who are really entitled to pensions because of wounds, were absolutely refused even £1 per week?</P>
    <P>This, I claim, is not a pension.  It is not the result of work they did for Ireland.  It is because some of them did very dirty work.  It is hush-money for some of those gentlemen, and the greatest proof that I can give that it is hush-money for these gentlemen out of public money is the statement made to-day by the Minister for Finance, which, if he was really what I would call a true Irishman, was an absolutely traitorous statement.  Those gentlemen are now on the pay list drawing £160,000 a year out of the Irish purse, a sum which would be sufficient to give every old age pensioner a pension of £1 a week.  They are not preaching about freeing Ireland or winning Irish independence or raising the flag of an Irish Republic now.  The Minister opposite stated to-day that Ireland is now within the British Empire, that we must remain slaves for evermore within it.  Those people in receipt of pensions and getting hush-money can afford to sneer at that remark.</P>

We can give the name of the gentleman in the public service who approached many of us and our supporters to apply for pensions.  We wanted pensions for those who were suffering as a result of the war on account of their ill-health or for the dependents of men who were killed, but their cases would not be heard.  After all the preaching of these gentlemen opposite, they have the audacity to come out and tell us that Ireland is within the British Empire, and that we are free and content to remain there.  Many of them would try to justify that great list of pensions; many of them would try to justify the dirty work done by these men.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Deputy has let off a good deal of steam now, but really I suggest he is not in order.  The pensions are paid under an Act of the Oireachtas, and it is a general principle of procedure that on the Estimates and on legislation implementing the Estimates you cannot deal with matters that are provided by enactments.  That is, there is a way of challenging pensions and the provision of pensions by introducing either a repealing Bill or putting down a motion in favour of the repeal of the Act, but it is not in order on the Estimates or legislation implementing the Estimates.</P>

      <P>A point arises here that I would like to have ruled upon. The question of Governmental policy is, I think, in order for discussion when a Bill of this nature is before the House.  After all, it is as an implementation of the Government's policy that the Act was introduced to the House, and therefore I think that the Deputy should be permitted to point out the effect on revenue which the introduction <Col N="1694" /> of the Act had.  If Deputies can show that expenditure of a useless or harmful nature is taking place, even under the authority of the Act and in consequence of the Government's policy, they should be entitled to criticise the Government on that count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="ACTING-CHAIRMAN ACTING-CHAIRMAN">
      <NameTxt>ACTING-CHAIRMAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if the payments are made in accordance with the Act.  As the Minister indicated, the proper way to proceed is by way of a motion calling for the repeal of the Act. Under a motion like this, where money is being paid in accordance with the Act, any discussion that would involve a change in the Act would not be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. LEMASS Mr. LEMASS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LEMASS</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to make a case against the granting of the sum asked for in this Bill it would be necessary to criticise probably every Act on the Statute Book if that procedure were followed.  It is the whole Governmental policy that is open for criticism when a Vote of this nature is asked for.  It was part of the Government's policy to pay these pensions, and for that purpose they introduced this measure.  If we say that the payment of these pensions is imposing a burden of taxation on the people which the people cannot bear, we should be entitled to do so.</P>

      <P>The point I want to get a ruling on is this: if your ruling holds good, it practically means that Deputies could not criticise Government policy except in piecemeal and on a motion to repeal particular Acts.  We want to criticise Government policy as a whole, and that criticism does involve particular Acts, such as the Pensions Act.  We want to criticise the Government's policy in introducing that Act by showing what its consequences are.  Therefore I think a serious precedent for Deputies on the Opposition and Independent Benches will be established if your ruling is adhered to.</P>

Even the Auditor-General has stated that he has not been given proofs that these cases are based on the letter of the Act.  I think that is a sufficient case for allowing a discussion on the matter.  When you have the Auditor-General stating that facts which he demanded as proof that these pensions were awarded in accordance with the Act were refused, I think it is fairly good proof that holes can be bored in this list if we went to the trouble of going over the names one by one.  I know myself that if the Act was meant to compensate men for work that they did in the Army for years, and if they kept within that, there are many on this list that would not be on it.  If, on the other hand, as they always say they are so very careful of public money, and of how it is being spent, if they had any care for economy or how public money was being spent, they would not have, on this list, gentlemen, no matter what their services might be, who are strong, active, healthy men, and who to-day are in receipt of large salaries in public positions otherwise.  You have, on this list, gentlemen in the C.I.D. drawing very good salaries and at the same time getting £60 per year pension&mdash;strong, healthy young men, many of whom lost very little sleep in their work or fight for Ireland in the old days or in the new.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. CLERY Mr. CLERY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CLERY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite easily proved, and I think the proof is so strong that even Ministers will have to admit it, that there are many on this list of over £160,000 per year who are not entitled to army pensions.  If they gave to the Auditor-General the proofs that he required to satisfy him that they were entitled, it is quite possible that he even would have struck some off the list, but the proofs that he demanded to show that they were entitled to pensions were refused.  That one thing alone should be noted by the Deputies voting on this.  I will not read over the list any further.  Deputies on going over the list can come to their own conclusions.  When you find the Government so careful of public funds as to refuse to advance the old age pensions or the blind pensions, and, at the <Col N="1698" /> same time, voting that large amount, you can easily see what care they have for public funds.</P>
      <P>I now come to the question of the Army.  I was not out for the abolition of an army&mdash;the total abolition&mdash;but I must say, after the Minister for Finance's statement to-day, that I am now out for the whole-hog abolition of the Free State Army.  He has stated here that we are in, and are to remain in, the British Empire.  If we are within the British Empire, the British Empire is going to protect us.  She is going to save us from any outside aggression, and is strong enough to save us from any disturbance within.  Why, then, should this State have an army? Is it as an outpost of the British Empire?</P>

      <P>There is some of it that could be made in Ireland that is not made in Ireland.  I am, therefore, for the whole-hog abolition of the Free State Army, and I would point out that if it is the intention of the Minister that this little bit of a State is to <Col N="1699" /> remain in the British Empire then let him not take our advice as to reducing the Army, but let him increase it from 15,000 to 200,000, but I tell him that in spite of that he will neither have peace nor much ease within the British Empire.  Let gentlemen opposite be very careful of the statements they make here now after having fooled and bluffed all the gentlemen drawing pensions amounting to £170,000 a year.  They did not make that statement to Liam Tobins and Gearoid O'Sullivans in the fight a few years ago, when they threatened the execution of every member of the Executive Council.  The Minister did not tell them then that they were to remain in the British Empire, but they had not, of course, then their £365 a year pension.  We are sorry that they had not the manliness and the courage to stand up and declare that some time ago.  I think Deputies opposite should tell us a little of what they think on the Vote.  Outside the House Deputies opposite find great pleasure in criticising before the people in the country &mdash;on the hustings, I think, Deputy Byrne calls it&mdash;the amount of lavish expenditure that is going on in the offices in Dublin, and they tell the people what they are going to do to reduce it.  But when they come back to this House they sit on Benches at the back of the Government, hushed up as the gentlemen who are drawing their pensions are being hushed up.  I would suggest, in conclusion, a little addition to this Vote, namely, that as a mark of appreciation for the silence of their Deputies a Vote should be introduced to purchase for those Deputies little playthings to while away the time in silence while they wait for the division bells to ring to do their duty behind the Government machine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a certain amount of reluctance that I made up my mind to take part in this debate.  I have listened to a great many speeches in this House since the last election, and the general tone and general manner and matter of the speeches to which I have listened from the Opposition Benches have been such that I am almost tempted, as a tribute <Col N="1700" /> to my own personal decency, to take a vow of silence for the rest of my life. We have been treated here this week, and last week, to a series of what Deputy Carney calls cold facts, or the facts of hard logic, or something of that kind.  After listening to all the mass of abuse and propaganda designed for the country newspapers, which we have been listening to from the Benches opposite, I have made an attempt to sort out what might, by some stretch of the imagination, be called the arguments from the speeches of Opposition Deputies.</P>
      <P>They have approached this question from five or six different angles, every one of them contradictory to every other one.  The Government are asked by Deputy Ruttledge to reduce the expenditure to the pre-war level of 1913. They are told that this country cannot bear, in 1928, any more taxation than it could have borne in 1913.  And when the time comes to explain the means by which these great economies are to be brought about, we have, as I say, half a dozen different suggestions made hardly any one of them consonant with any other one.  I have made a list of the suggestions which Opposition Deputies have made, and I should like to consider them briefly.</P>
      <P>First of all we are asked by Deputy Lemass to bring about economies by establishing a republic.  The people of this country have had sufficient experience of the attempts made by Deputy Lemass and his colleagues to establish a republic four or five years ago to know very well how the process is likely to make for economy.  The people of North Mayo have had sufficient experience of Deputy Clary's economies some years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been paying pretty dearly for the economy of these Republican Deputies for a good number of years past, and know very well what the attempts of Deputy Lemass and his colleagues to establish a Republic in this year, or any time in the future, is likely to cost the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor TIERNEY Professor TIERNEY">
      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>One suggestion is that we should bring about economy by proceeding to establish a republic. That was generally implicit in what Deputy Lemass said the other day.  I ask Deputies to consider that calmly for themselves and to calculate in what exact way we would bring about economies by taking Deputy Lemass at his word and starting out on the process of establishing a republic in this country. I would like Deputy Lemass to take an opportunity of telling us in detail and with some explicitness the steps he would propose to take in that economical campaign.  I would like to know whether as part of that economical campaign he would adopt Deputy de Valera's plan for the punishment of the North of Ireland and I would like to know exactly how much Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera hope to save to this country by that part of their economy campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had wild accusations of improvidence <Col N="1702" /> against the Government, of being spendthrifts and of throwing public money about, from people whose best alternative to the policy the Government is carrying out, is to proceed to the establishment of a republic with all that that would entail for this country as laid down in the speeches of these Deputies themselves.  The people of this country are expected to take as serious criticism any talk about economy from a party the main plank in whose platform is that they would establish a republic in this country or attempt to establish it&mdash;because, of course, there is not the slightest chance that they would succeed in their attempt&mdash;and along with that the coercion or punishment as Deputy de Valera called it of one-third of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>We have had these people calmly coming forward before the country as economists, as people who would save money if they got into power, and we have them putting up arguments about how much this country cost in 1913, and insinuating that if they were allowed into power to repeat their glorious attempt to establish a republic in the teeth of the people they would bring the cost of government lower down than it was in 1913.  Very likely they would, because there would not be very much left in this country to govern after they had persisted in attempting it for a few months.  Once the fact is realised that the principal plank in the platform of Deputy Lemass by his own confession is to attempt to establish a republic, and with that the coercion of the North of Ireland, it seems to me that every basis whatsoever is taken away from any discussion of economy in expenditure from those Benches.  They have no right to talk about economy, and it is pure eye-wash and purely an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the people for Deputy Derrig to come along and talk about agricultural credits, saving money on the salaries of policemen. and so on, when their one object, if they get into power, is to proceed to plunge this country at the same time into a civil war and a foreign war.</P>

It came from the deep heart of Deputy Flinn, who has looked down into his heart and, after the fashion of his Party, found that economies can be brought about by the establishment of a commission.  The Fianna Fáil Party are getting quite fond of this commission idea.</P>

      <P>It is the same thing, to establish a great independent Commission of some kind, whether auditors, journalists, or evangelistic ministers, it does not matter&mdash;but a commission.  What I like about the suggestion is the remembrance that it brings into my mind of the Fianna Fáil policy in another respect.  We had the famous economic policy that Deputy Lemass hammered out.  Deputies will all remember the tone and the earnest labour with which he informed them of the fact.  That economic policy when examined was simply a project to set up a commission to think out an economic policy for the country.  Now we have a plan for reducing expenditure, and a great plan, and we get no other details except that outside experts are to be called in&mdash;someone from Vickers is called in to do our business for us.  I except when we come to the third aspect of the Fianna Fáil policy if we do come to the question in real deadly earnest of setting up the Republic, Deputy Lemass, or some other of the deep-hearted Deputies in Fianna Fáil, will bring up a suggestion that a Commission should be set up to establish the Republic. There is nothing that cannot be done by getting other people to do it for you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third suggestion for economy from the Opposition, which the Ceann Comhairle would not allow to be discussed, was the famous suggestion that we should repudiate the Land Commission annuities.  I am not going to discuss that.  I hope that we may get an opportunity of discussing it in some other manner than by means of interjections across the House.  I will just ask one question in relation to that. What sum of money would a Fianna Fáil Minister of Finance ask the Dáil to give him in order to recoup holders of National Loan or National stock in general, to whom this State owes obligations for the loss of credit and the <Col N="1706" /> general loss that the policy of repudiating Land Commission annuities would bring about?  How would that balance out with the sum he would save on this magnificent scheme of repudiating our debts?  That is another item on the economy programme that I would very much like to go into.  Another suggestion came, I think, from Deputy Little, that we could bring about economy by passing a vote of sympathy with the people of Egypt.  It was a worthy suggestion to come from the Deputy. When all these brilliant suggestions have been analysed, except for the usual gibes and the usual street corner propaganda about the army and the police, which is the gist of the Fianna Fáil economy programme, what conclusion could any sensible Deputy or any sensible citizen draw from them?  He could draw the conclusion that it is going to be a very bad day for this country if the Fianna Fáil Party ever get within 100 miles of power.</P>

      <P>Some of us have been listening to debates on Estimates in this House for a fair number of years.  I can compare this debate that we have been listening to for the past couple of weeks with the sort of debate we had when the Labour Party was in Opposition, and I can certainly say in all sincerity that in spite of its larger size the Fianna Fáil Party are making a far worse job of their opposition than the Labour Party made when it was not one-fifth of their size.  From the Labour Opposition at any rate there was some attempt to get down to details. One got something else besides a suggestion that we should establish a Commission to do that and to do this and that we should have economy by starting a civil war.  One got something better than propaganda.  One got something better than the kind of mare's nest, for instance, that Deputy Derrig is so expert at finding, the mare's nest about the withdrawal of funds from certain objects from which the funds are being withdrawn in the natural course because there is no demand for them.  The Opposition has made no attempt at constructive effort to deal with the question of economy and I can <Col N="1707" /> certainly say, as one accused of being held in leash by the Government, and who has been accused of restraining my natural instinct to oppose by the fact that the evil eye of the Whip is always on me, that if I was a single man in opposition, sitting alone on those benches, I would make a better job of it than the whole Fianna Fáil Party together ever made of it.</P>

      <P>What the Fianna Fáil Party have dealt with, solely from the point of view of street corner propaganda, is the Army and the police.  When they cannot think of any other expert scheme for economy they always switch on to the Army or the police.  They do not say, of course, that we should not have an army, but they insinuate that by a turn of the hand millions would be saved out of the sum that we are spending at present on the Army.  Of course the police, which we keep for the special purpose of persecuting the Fianna Fáil Party, could be dispensed with altogether. There is just one thing I would like to say to Deputy Lemass and the Fianna Fáil Party in general on the matter. We will have high expenditure on the Army and on the police as long as doctrines of the type that have been put forward from the Opposition Benches are put forward as national doctrines. As long as doctrines of the type that anyone has the right, because he has a political bee in his bonnet, to go and shoot a neighbour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I mean by it is simply this, that the Fianna Fáil Party in this House has always adopted the attitude of trying to keep a foot in both camps, to keep a foot in the constitutional camp and another foot in the camp which is not constitutional, a camp which is involved in the using of arms against citizens of this country by other citizens of this country and if you like, trying to keep a third foot in a third camp.</P>

      <P>As long as we have that attempt being made; as long as we have a big Party in this country <Col N="1711" /> trying to compromise, as I say the Fianna Fáil Party is doing, between constitutional agitation and agitation which is not constitutional, we are faced with certain alternatives.  Deputy Lemass stated very clearly in this House the other evening that that was what his Party was doing.  As long as we have that Party in this country, we are faced with one of two alternatives. Either that Party must be on top or we must have a big police force to look after the non-constitutional activities of the members of that Party and its friends.  The talk from a Party like that of cutting down expenditure on the police force is not quite exactly as bad as the wolf objecting to the watch-dog, but it is not very far removed from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a good deal in this debate also about Deputy de Valera's famous idealistic campaign for the reduction of salaries.  About a year ago Deputy de Valera believed that no man in this country was worth £500 a year, but since he and his Party went through the famous operation of last Autumn, they have decided that their value has gone up, apparently, and that now there are some people in this country who are worth £1,000 a year, but not more&mdash; not one penny more.  Every man who aspires, or has the cheek to aspire, to enter into the public service, is to be kept within the strict limit of £1,000 and he is not to get one penny more.  That is a subject about which a great deal could be said.  The attitude of mind which puts forward a doctrine like that seems to me to argue either very great innocence on the part of the person who puts forward that doctrine, or else that he is by no means innocent.  Neither Deputy de Valera nor Deputy Little is sincere in believing that they can get people in this country to take salaries of £1,000 a year, when these people know very well that they are capable of earning £2,000 a year in other avocations besides the public service&mdash;those Deputies seriously believe they can do that, or else they are hoping to delude people or compel people into taking salaries of that kind.  The attitude Deputy Little takes would amount to this, that it is a sort of offence for a person to be able to earn a salary of more than £1,000.  There is <Col N="1712" /> a kind of puritan aspect in the attitude the Deputy adopts.  It comes to this, that any person who is able by his character or ability to earn more than £1,000 a year is doing something that is impure and he should be compelled by law, apparently, to put his character and his ability at the service of anybody who likes to ask for it at less than £1,000.  I would like to see that doctrine applied logically all round.  If it is to be applied to civil servants, why not to doctors, lawyers and farmers?</P>

      <P>I know very well that Deputy Anthony holds a lugubrious doctrine that there are no farmers in this country who earn anything; but I know something about farmers and I do not agree with him. Why should not that doctrine be applied to shopkeepers and, indeed, to everybody else who earns money by the very same means that the civil servant earns money?  The shopkeeper has no more right to make £2,000 or £3,000 a year, and a good many of them are doing it.</P>

      <P>Why should the doctrine not be applied to lawyers who are earning far more than £1,000 a year?  Why should civil servants, because they happen to be the one class devoting themselves to the public service, be singled out?  Excepting perhaps, doctors, civil servants are the one class who are devoting themselves to the public service, and they are the one class upon whom a cheese-paring politician can put his hand.  They are selected for attack and they are to be compelled to accept a certain salary in this country, which is next door to a country where there are unlimited opportunities for ability and character. The doctrine is put forward that we are going to compel men of ability and character to live in this country and put their ability and character at the service of this country for some arbitrary salary which is to be fixed by the united wisdom of Deputies de Valera and Little.  I do not know whether to believe that the doctrine springs from innocence or the reverse, but certainly the only hope I have is that by the <Col N="1713" /> time Deputy de Valera and Deputy Little have a chance of putting their doctrine into force something may have happened which will put their price up a little bit further, and those Deputies may be inclined to agree that a few men may be worth something more than £1,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor TIERNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>All this question about salaries seems to me to spring from an attitude completely incompatible with the policy of declaring a Republic and punishing the North. These are, if you like, unrealisable ideals, foolish ideals, ideals which would cost the country far more than could possibly be saved, or that the united efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party for fifty years afterwards could save. But they are, at any rate, ideals.  The fact that they are put forward means, at any rate, that there is a spark of decent belief and a decent hope and a fine ideal in the breasts of the Party that puts them forward.  But this policy that you can make progress and do good to this country by seizing on a few unfortunate public servants who happen to be exposed to any cross-road propagandist that likes to make remarks about them here or anywhere else; the notion that you can make progress by attacking people of that kind and taking from their livelihood meanly, and supposing that you can compel them to sell their brains and ability at a lower price than the ordinary market price they can get anywhere else&mdash;that ideal or that notion has nothing in it that is fine or that is at all admirable.  On the face of it, it would seem that it was designed for a totally different object from the other objects in the Fianna Fáil policy.  It was not designed for the men who believe in getting a Republic for all Ireland, or who foolishly imagine that Deputy Little or Deputy Lemass or Deputy O'Kelly would be able to get a Republic for them.  It was not designed for that type of person.  It was designed for a different type, a type of person who judging from the utterances of the Fianna Fáil Party, they believed to be the majority in this country.  It was designed for the mean type of man, the type of man who is <Col N="1714" /> jealous of everyone who has a penny more than himself, the type of man who, in general, is not able to make any kind of a decent living for himself, but envies everybody who is.  It was designed to catch the vote of that type of person, and, if the Deputies on the opposite Benches are able to get votes from that type of person by that type of policy, they are welcome to these votes.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long, but there is one item that comes under this head of expenditure which I presume I will be allowed on this occasion to develop, having been precluded from doing so on a previous occasion.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Finance, or in his absence from the President, if it can be clearly shown that an item of expenditure which comes within the province of the amount of money specified in this Bill is not being spent in accordance with the letter of the Act which brought about such expenditure, that we should get at least some assurance that the matter will be regularised, and that any irregularities in the matter will be put right.  I want to refer to the Military Service Pensions Act.  I regret that Deputy J.J. Byrne is not here.  I see he is a member of the Public Accounts Committee which studied this particular matter and debated it at considerable length and detail.  The report of the Committee has just been issued under the signature of the Chairman, Deputy Davin, in which the members of this Committee, in full agreement, in dealing with this, in the following paragraph state that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Comptroller and Auditor-General, in paragraph 66 of his report, stated that he has admitted expenditure on Military Service Pensions amounting to £66,150 11s. 1d., in accordance with paragraph 18 of the Report of the Public Accounts Committee, dated 30th March, 1927. In connection with the accounts for the year now under review, he again directs attention to the fact that his audit of these pensions has been confined to an examination of the amount of pension awarded, that this amount was based on the reports of the Board of Assessors, but that the <Col N="1715" /> data on which these reports are based were not available for his inspection. In sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph 18 of the report of the Committee already referred to, it was held that the withholding of such data was justifiable on the grounds therein stated.  On further consideration, however, this Committee is of opinion that it is undesirable to deal with a charge which recurs annually in a manner which appears to limit the powers conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who is required by the terms of the Statutes defining the duties and powers of his office (The Exchequer and Audit Act, 1866, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, 1923) to examine on behalf of the Dáil every Appropriation Account (other than those in which a specific indication to the contrary, appears on the face of the Estimate.) This Committee is, therefore, of the opinion that immediate steps should be taken to remove this anomalous position and to regularise the audit of expenditure (amounting in a normal year to about £147,000) arising from the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 and 1925.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The question of the availability of documents for the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the matter of payments under the Military Service Pensions Act, which I understand has been reported upon by the Public Accounts Committee, could arise in one of two ways.  As was indicated before here in connection with the Supplementary Estimate, it will arise again on the <Col N="1716" /> main Estimate for Army Pensions, or it might arise incidental to a motion arising out of the Public Accounts Committee's Report, or it might arise on the consideration of the Report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It would certainly seem to be the better procedure to take this matter (which, although in one sense a detail, is at the same time an important matter) when the Public Accounts Committee's Report was being considered, or when the Vote to which the Report has reference is being taken.  There is another matter, of course, and that is, that the Minister for Finance issued a Finance Minute dealing with the recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The whole matter can hardly be properly debated until the Finance Minute has been issued or until sufficient time has elapsed to allow of the question being raised.  It might be better, in order that this matter should be properly discussed, that it should not be raised as a side issue on a general debate arising out of the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill.  I think that is the better scheme.</P>

I do not want to pursue it any further until such time as it will be regularised by the House.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat loath to rule the matter out of order, because most of the details mentioned on the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill would, on strict ruling, be out of order, or a great many of them would be out of order.  I feel that there is a very strong case for leaving this matter either for the main Estimate on Army Pensions or until <Col N="1717" /> such time as on the initiative of the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee the matter of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts is raised in the House.  I feel that these are the two ways of raising the matter.  As Deputy Briscoe himself is aware, the Committee considers questions from the purely financial aspect, and it does the work in a particular way.  Its report this year is no exception to the reports presented in former years.  It is, therefore, better that this matter should be discussed in a specific way rather than that something in the report should be drawn across a particular Bill.  The report of the Committee of Public Accounts is not intended to provide material for making points, so to speak.  It is a Committee of very great importance; its usefulness to the House is very great, and it would be better to have a debate regarding the expenditure under the Military Service Pensions Act raised specifically rather than to have it raised now.</P>

The Deputy will agree that the Minister for Finance has a busy season from December up to the time of the introduction of the Budget, and this work in connection with the Public Accounts Committee would obviously take away at rather an anxious time some of the officers engaged in work in connection with the Budget, the very work they are at present engaged in.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it a great privilege to belong to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I consider that every member of it did his work in a most impartial manner, and, taking into consideration matters only from the point of view of finance, the members of the Committee came to a conclusion, after cool, calculated deliberation, after discussion from every angle, that in this particular item, anyway, there was a change needed.</P>
      <P>We discussed this point in detail, and I now put it to the House. Throughout the debates on this particular Bill we have been asked to cite a case where something is wrong, where it has been brought to the attention of the proper authorities and has not been righted.  Here is a case which has been under consideration by the Department of Finance, the Department of Defence, the Public Accounts Committee, and by the House for a period of over one year, and yet it has not been regularised.  I want to show at this stage that the Act specifies that pensions shall be paid to certain individuals, and for what service such pensions shall be paid.  There is no suggestion in the Act that an audit of the expenditure under it shall be restricted in any manner whatsoever. In the introduction to the Estimates, if a certain sum of money is required in respect of expenditure for which no audit is necessary and from which this House and the Comptroller and Auditor-General are precluded from knowing the details, that is specifically set out.  That is done, for instance, in the case of the Secret Service Vote and grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this particular matter, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, feeling that he could not give to the Committee an absolutely finished report that this particular expenditure had <Col N="1720" /> been audited in accordance with the terms of the Act under which his duties are discharged, explained that he was not in a position to examine into all the cases of those who received pensions under the Act to see whether such cases came within the terms of the Act. The Public Accounts Committee took a serious view of this.  In their report they say that they are of opinion that immediate steps should be taken to alter the position that exists, and to regularise the matter.  I hold that that message from the Public Accounts Committee to the House cannot be lost sight of, and that it ought to get a sympathetic response from the House.</P>
    <P>We have heard from the previous speaker, Deputy Tierney, a justification for this expenditure, but not any counter suggestions to those made by us.  His whole speech was a tirade of abuse of the Fianna Fáil Party.  One would imagine from Deputy Tierney that Fianna Fáil were running the Government, that we were asking for this money, and that Deputy Tierney was opposing it.  The policy of Fianna Fáil is put up and torn to shreds.  The position, of course, is quite the opposite. The Government is asking for the money.  They have the spending of it and many Deputies on this side have criticised their expenditure from different angles.  We believe that the present taxation is too high.  In order to bring taxation down I believe that expenditure must be reduced.  We do not say &mdash;at least I do not say&mdash;that every penny the Government spends is wasted. I do not say that they can cut out a Department here or there or a half a Department here or there.  We have got the feeling, however&mdash;I certainly have got it&mdash;that there is extravagance in certain Departments and that we are not getting our money's worth from these.  We asked that an Economy Committee be set up to go into the question of expenditure.  We here can only go on the information at our disposal which either gives us confirmation of our feelings in the matter or puts us right on the matter from the Government point of view, and therefore puts us in the position of agreeing with them.</P>
    <P>Here is a case that I have taken a particular interest in.  I am not so sure <Col N="1721" /> that every member who benefits under that Act is entitled to a pension.  The reason I have for saying that is because of a case that was brought to the notice of the Public Accounts Committee where money was received by a particular person under a different Act altogether, an Act from which the Comptroller and Auditor-General was not precluded from examining into the details.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, in that particular case, discovered that a person who was not entitled to it was receiving a pension.  It is quite conceivable, of course, that a mistake can be made.  I say that even if it is to avoid the expenditure of one per cent. by a mistake, that very fact justifies the existence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General as well as the examination of all expenditure by him. I do not suggest that everybody's service should be made public, if it is desirable to withhold it, but I say the details in regard to it should be there for examination by the officials of the State and particularly of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I hold, also, that it should be at the disposal of any Committee selected by this House to go into it, in case there was any doubt as to the absolute regularity of such expenditure.</P>
    <P>I hold that in this particular case there is nothing in the Act which justifies the action taken by the Minister for Defence in withholding the information that the Comptroller and Auditor-General requires.  When that Act was introduced there was nothing in the discussions that took place here which gave rise to the slightest suggestion that the Board of Assessors had the right to promise to individuals claiming a pension that the basis on which they were claiming was going to be accepted in confidence and treated in confidence and kept from the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I introduce this particular matter now because it gives me a definite cause to believe that there must be some reason other than that stated originally to the original Public Accounts Committee which brought this out.</P>

      <P>May I ask Deputy Briscoe a question?  Did not all the parties who sat on the Public Accounts <Col N="1722" /> Committee join with the representatives of the Party to which he belongs in recommending that this expenditure of money should be regularised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne would not have asked that question if he had been in the House when I started to speak.  I then stated that I regretted that he was not present.  I mentioned the fact that he has just stated, that all the members of the Committee worked in complete harmony and without any partiality, and that they were absolutely unanimous in coming to this finding. I did not take any credit for myself or for any member of our Party for this finding.  I mentioned the Committee as a whole.  I contend that if the Government do not regularise this particular item they will give every reason for people to believe that there is something wrong.  If they agree to regularise this without a motion going to the House, or if the Minister for Finance will say that he is prepared to agree to that, the matter is settled as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>On this particular item I believe there will be some clarity at a future date. As the details have not been given in this particular case, I maintain that there is something wrong&mdash;that there must be something wrong&mdash;and I feel that members of the Public Accounts Committee, no matter on what Benches they may sit, knowing all that, and who still vote for this Bill, will be voting here against their own decision.  Unless we get an assurance from the Minister for Finance that he is prepared to regularise this particular item, members of the Public Accounts Committee who are not of this Party, will not, in my opinion, be relieved from voting against this motion.</P>

      <P>As the subject has been discussed, I would like to say a word or two.  I hope Deputy Briscoe will not charge me with a tirade of abuse, because it is really not a party matter.  It is a technical matter, and a matter of accountancy.  I stand by the agreed report of the Public Accounts Committee that the procedure in this matter should be regularised.  I am not quite sure if Deputy Briscoe and I agree on what regularisation means. <Col N="1723" /> Deputy Briscoe, in his last words, said that there must be something wrong. I am not at all satisfied that there is anything wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. BRISCOE Mr. BRISCOE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BRISCOE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the correction, but I do not think it can be regularised on the Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill.  I think there is a case for regularisation at some future date, possibly even by legislation, but I do not think it can be done by way of amendment to the Central Fund Bill. It cannot in my opinion, be regularised here and now.  The Minister for Finance is here now and possibly we may have some statement from him on the matter.  I was on not only the Committee which Deputy Briscoe was on, and he rendered very valuable service on it, but also I was on the Committee in the previous year which dealt with this matter.  It was made clear that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was in possession of the names and addresses of every person receiving a pension.  These are available. Deputy Corry, I think, put down a question, and he was then able to inform the Dáil that the persons who had been receiving military pensions had been able &ldquo;to walk in their sleep and cut down trees.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite hear what the Deputy said.  I have cut down a tree for my own amusement, but it was my own tree.  To divert from that, the facts are there, but the details are not available.  The details that are not available are as to pre-truce and National Army activities.  I have seen some of the application forms for these pensions.  Some misguided applicants seem to think I could advise them as to their pre-truce activities.  I have seen these forms, and they required in the first instance a statement of pre-truce activities, and, secondly, they required two persons who could vouch <Col N="1724" /> for the activities.  Regarding the pre-truce activities there are persons who applied for those pensions who are not living in the Saorstát.  Some are living outside the boundaries of the Saorstát, and it might injure them if any details of their pre-truce activities were published. Deputy Briscoe said all these particulars should be available to the Auditor-General.  In normal circumstances I agree entirely with him in that, but anything dealt with in the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General is and must be a public document. It would be a great misfortune if it was a private document.  He is entitled to and should have the details of every case which came under his observation.  He might easily in the discharge&mdash;the rightful discharge&mdash;of his duty call attention to some case which might identify the claimant to a pension, and he might if he was not living in the Saorstát do serious injury to that applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I approached the case without any great prejudice in favour of the applicant.  I approached it from the point of view of a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and I was of opinion that publication of such details might be of great danger to individuals.  Every applicant would require to supply the names of two persons who could justify his claim as to pre-truce and National Army activity. National Army service could be proved more easily.  Those whose names were given as vouching for the applicant's claim were, I believe, approached by the Military Service Pensions Board, and told that their information would be regarded as confidential.  The Board may have had no right to tell them that &mdash;possibly they had not&mdash;but it would be a grave injustice to private individuals who when asked to say what they knew of the applicant if they gave the information on a pledge of confidence, if that pledge were disregarded and their information was subsequently published.  If the Auditor-General has any effectual access to the information he must be free to publish it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The late Minister for Justice stated on the introduction of the Constitution on the Committee Stage:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now I hold&mdash;and I think in what I am going to say now I am expressing the mind of a great many people throughout the country&mdash;that in the case of a Treaty signed under circumstances and conditions like that, the position is simply that at any moment in the future the majority will of the Irish nation can publicly and absolutely without dishonour repudiate that Treaty if they consider it wise to do so&mdash;if they consider it advisable to do so, if, weighing the pros and cons of the situation, they are prepared to take the consequences of doing so; therefore, in our opinion at any rate, the majority will of this Nation is at all times sovereign.  It is sovereign now, it will be sovereign at all times in the future, and we do not deny and we do not limit that sovereignty.  It is for that sovereignty we are fighting now, and as long as the Treaty is the policy of the Nation then the Treaty in all its bearings and implications must be the policy of the Nation and the Nation will stand honourably by that policy.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="1729" /> Deputies can read that at their leisure if they doubt it.  I adhere to that, and I have adhered to it on every platform on which I ever appeared during the last five years.  That is still the policy, and I invite Deputies on the opposite side to examine their policy in the last five years and its varying fortunes. I will say no more than that, except that a smile was visible on certain faces when I asked them to examine their policy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Derrig referred to housing and drainage and I observed that he kept off the lines adopted by Deputy Flinn yesterday evening.  Deputy Flinn, notwithstanding his proximity to a Deputy who I think did not agree altogether with what he said, got very near some fundamental principles in connection with the prevailing situation in the country.  He said that what was really required. was production.  As far as Government assistance to housing is concerned, the policy is unchanged from the policy that has prevailed over the last four years, practically since the first Housing Act was introduced.  Each year a certain sum of money has been made available for housing.  There may be a closer relation to the sum of money likely to be spent, in this year's Estimates, than there was last year or the previous year.  Each year, having regard to our experience and perhaps to the fact that we have more time for a closer examination, we get closer to the sum that we require.  If a larger sum is called upon to provide for the requirements of the coming year, a supplementary estimate will be introduced to deal with that.  At the moment this question is to some extent in abeyance by reason of the activities of the Committee on Unemployment which reported <Col N="1734" /> a short time ago and which I have no doubt Deputy Flinn read carefully before he made his speech.</P>
      <P>All these statements about housing, about business and all the speeches about economics are very fine in their way but the people outside are looking for some results and our policy is shown by the housing activities of the last three or four years.  The other day when Deputy Briscoe was speaking about housing, I asked him had he made any experiments in the matter himself. I would have very much more respect for criticism coming from a man who had made experiments, who had seen the costs and who knew what the problem was like than a person who stands up and says you should solve the problem in a Gaelic or national way.  In the same manner our policy in regard to drainage is the same as last year. There is a closer relation to the estimate than there was in last year's estimate and there is no slacking up of our activities in regard to drainage.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that in the Estimates in so far as they affect administration of the Acts there is only £28,000 provided as against £50,000 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that there is a sum of £50,000 and on the opposite side&mdash;I am speaking now from recollection&mdash;a sum of £28,000.  I think there are some other smaller sums provided in one or two other cases.  That question, however, and other questions arising out of it fall more properly for discussion on the Estimates than on the Bill that is before us, on which general principles and matters of that sort should occasion most discussion.  The Deputy is right &mdash;sums of £3,000, £10,000 and £15,000, but while £50,000 was on the other side for last year, it is a nice question as to how much of that was spent.  It is more likely that we have approached more nearly to the correct Estimate, the corresponding Estimate of £28,000, than in the other case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in the amount.  If we take it that that £28,000 could have been doubled, we would simply have an untrue estimate.  Deputy Derrig, I think, said that there had been a change in policy and that we are now placing upon local authorities a responsibility which was not theirs last year.  The Bill is at present before the Dáil and it does not introduce any change in policy.  It is rather an extension of the policy of arterial drainage, and one which may prove very beneficial.  I do not think that other statements call for any particular reply.  Most of them had reference to the expenditure of last year. In one case where the Estimate was £52,000, a Deputy added on the Appropriations-in-Aid, and compared his small sum with the total of the two sums.  That was, I think, in the case of fisheries, where Deputy Carney was concerned with a sum of £7,000 out of £92,000.  The actual sum in the Estimate, as far as voting is concerned, would be £52,000.  I submit that we do not get very far by manoeuvring figures into such a position that they do not bear a correct relation to each other. The exact figure ought to be mentioned, and not figures which may be likely to mislead people.  Yesterday evening Deputy Flinn, I think it was, when dealing with the saving that would accrue from doing away with the Senate capitalised the sum.  I have never heard anything like that before. Perhaps it was not Deputy Flinn, but some other Deputy.  I must say that that statement absolutely amazed me. Deputy Cooper has answered, to my satisfaction at any rate, the case made by Deputy Briscoe as to the Military Pensions Act, 1924.  That matter can be discussed on the Report of the Public Accounts Committee, as all Reports of that Committee are entitled to be discussed here at the proper time, and not on the Estimates.  If there are any other matters that I have not dealt with, perhaps the Minister for Finance will deal with them.</P>

      <P>The President said he would rather hear from someone who had tried an experiment in the matter of housing than hear general statements about policy.  I confess that I have been the victim of one experiment at least.  In the course of that experiment I had an opportunity of seeing exactly why it is that the subsidies which are granted to local bodies had not been availed of.  One reason is that at a certain time, which the President will remember very well, there was a sudden closing down of credit by the banks as a kind of active war against the President.</P>

Anybody who was looking for a market for houses that he was building could not get it, because no one could pay.  Suddenly the source of credit had been cut off.  That was one reason.  Another was that it was impossible to raise money generally for the building of houses.  The third difficulty which was insurmountable from the point of view of making money out of housing schemes, was the enormous cost of building materials which was due to the ring in this country.</P>

      <P>It happens that if anybody is enterprising enough to organise the business they can get building materials from the Continent at 33? per cent. cheaper than through the ring in this country.  The Government never <Col N="1737" /> looked to do that.  They never looked anywhere to get over that ring, because they are under the control of that ring, and of that set of interests in this country, beginning with Guinness and ending I do not know where&mdash;in general terms it is called Freemasonry, but to tell the truth I do not think that term quite applies to it; it is a series of self-interests in this country, a congeries of self-interest which is paralysing the country and impoverishing the people.  There is another point about building which I make, not so much because I want to confute anybody, but because I hope something may be done to remedy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been drawn off the subject by interruptions.  The other point I wanted to deal with is that in certain legislation the restrictions are so tight and close in the granting of these loans for building that you get absurd situations something like this: A constituent in County Waterford wrote to me to ask me to see what could be done in his case.  He had, in a very enterprising way, bought over a building out of which he proposed to make a number of houses.  He said that if he could get a loan of about £60 for each house he could complete from six to ten houses. The difficulty was that, according to the Act, it requires a population of 500 people in a town before you can <Col N="1738" /> get the necessary loan.  Dunmore East is a place which has a floating population owing to the fishing industry. During the fishing season at times the population will go far above 500, but because it happens that, technically, under the census&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will not follow it, except to point out, in answer to the President, that there are reasons why the public bodies and the public generally have not been able to take advantage of loans from the Government, and so the money is lying dormant. Dunmore East, normally, has a population only of 410, and because of that restriction you have the reason, and also an answer, to the President. I hope I am not out of order in adding this remark, that I hope he will see it is remedied in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. LITTLE Mr. LITTLE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, the President's attitude on this question of building is very like the attitude of the gentlemen with the three thimbles.  He says all you have to do is to put your finger on the thimble underneath which the pill is.  We foolishly take up the thimble, but there is no pill, there.  But he goes on asking the same question: &ldquo;How is it that public bodies have no availed of the money which is there?&rdquo; I hope this, to some extent, is an adequate answer to him.  You have on one hand an extraordinary need for houses.  In Waterford City alone they require at least 800.  There you have conditions where people are actually put out upon the road because the houses are condemned as not safe to live <Col N="1739" /> in.  You have people turned out upon the road, and the only place where there is a possibility of their going is the deserted and derelict Union, and self-respecting workers have the strongest possible objection to be put into the old buildings in the Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LITTLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting a letter from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
      <P>It produces a sort of ghostly effect sometimes when you find that a Deputy who has attacked you when you get up to reply has disappeared.  That applies to Deputy Tierney to-day.  He made a series of misrepresentations of a very gross kind against Deputies on this side. He talked about the false statements made at street corners and the platform oratory on this side, but for sheer misrepresentation I never listened to anything like Deputy Tierney.  He suggested, for instance, that we were going to repudiate certain financial agreements, that we were going to repudiate the payment of annuities.  That false statement was several times repudiated from these benches.  We do not stand for an incoherent policy.  What we stand for is the re-opening of that agreement in order to get better terms for Ireland.  He asked a question:&mdash; Supposing the annuities are not devoted to the payment of the interest on the land loan where is the money to come from?  Our whole contention is that this is a British loan, not an Irish loan.  It is not a private loan.  It is a public British loan and the responsibility rests upon the British Government and not upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said that my method of reducing expenditure was to advocate a <Col N="1740" /> vote of sympathy with Egypt.  That, of course, is a total distortion of the facts.  What happened was that the question of Egypt as a question of external affairs was raised on the External Affairs Vote and out of that came a certain reply from the Minister for Defence.  In reply, I made some remarks backing up the attitude that the Vote should not be passed because the foreign policy was wrong from the point of view of the development of this State towards Irish freedom and Irish unity.  He, also, several times attacked the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party and he did me the honour of mentioning my name in connection with the question of salaries being limited to £1,000 a year.  He suggested that my attitude was one of puritanism, that I seemed to think no one should get more than £1,000 a year.  I do not think I made that suggestion in any shape or form.  I did not suggest that shopkeepers or traders were not entitled to make more, but there are several considerations that enter into the question of a person in trade as against persons in Government employment.  The Government position is more secure and it has, at the end of it, a pension.  A trader takes his chances.  One year he may make a profit in business and other years he may not.  His business may decay and he has no security as to getting a pension at the end so it is not reasonable to compare the income of a shopkeeper which at one time may be two or three thousand with the salary of a permanent official.  The fact is you can get the very best value for a £1,000 a year.  Those people who claim that £1,000 a year is not sufficient are people more interested in the salary than they are in doing the public work attached to the salary.  It was suggested also by Deputy Tierney that we were attacking the Civil Service.  We were not attacking the Civil Service.  The best and most sincere Civil Servants are very like good workers in any office.  They want to see the office getting on well and the work done well, and they are very glad to see those who are not good workers put aside and not paid out of proportion to the work they do. Loyal Civil Servants do not object to seeing the Civil Service organised upon the most efficient basis.  If Deputy <Col N="1741" /> Tierney thinks that by propagandist methods he is going to make bad blood between us and the good Civil Servants of this country he is not, I submit, paying a compliment to the loyalty of the Irish people to those Civil Servants.</P>
    <P>He misquoted Deputy de Valera when he said that a year ago Deputy de Valera said £500 a year was sufficient, and that now he fixed a thousand pounds.  It is more than a year ago since Deputy de Valera said anyone ought to be satisfied in this State with £1,000 a year for any position, no matter how dignified.</P>

      <P>Deputy Redmond raised an interesting point about the Army.  He pointed out that it was useless, as had been pointed out before, so far as protecting the shores of Ireland was concerned.  I suggest the alternative to having a navy for Ireland is to have a proper policy in external affairs.  One of the most deplorable things about the present situation is that there is no common view upon the international policy of Ireland towards the world.  In England and other countries there is a common view, as opposed to everyone outside, between <Col N="1742" /> the Government and the Opposition.  In times of danger the sovereignty of Ireland should come first.  So, if there were a proper policy on the opposite Benches, it would make for the neutrality and freedom of Ireland and would render it absolutely safe from being ever swept by the guns either of America, on the one side, or of England on the other.  That was the policy strongly put forward in the old days, and it supplies a peaceful line of progress for this nation both towards freedom and unity.  That the Government does not pursue this policy is in itself sufficient condemnation and ample reason why we should not vote for this motion.</P>

We have had hours of talk here about republics.

      <P>As one who has taken a deep interest in the country for the last fifty years, I stand here and have <Col N="1743" /> no doubt about my clothes, as was insinuated against another Deputy on this side.  My suit of clothes was made in Bantry, in my own constituency.  I am shod by a tradesman in Skibbereen who has shod me for the last fifty years.  I venture to ask the Deputies opposite if their clothes are of Irish manufacture?  They talked to the President on that question.  I challenge them to say if they are wearing imported boots or boots made by Irish tradesmen?  Let them dissect that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the debate, we are here to build up the nation.  We are going to stand by the Treaty.  All honour to President Cosgrave, who was attacked because of his loyalty to that Treaty. I may tell him, as one coming from the south, that he has three-quarters of the people behind him in standing for the Treaty.  No matter how you may sneer at or attack the Treaty, generations will yet bless President Cosgrave and his Party for loyally standing for it for the last five years.  You think you are going to uproot it now.  I tell you you are on the wrong track and on a disastrous track for the Saorstát.  It is most disgusting to hear your talk about 1916 and 1918.  In the name of God, why do not you talk of how you will be in 1929 and 1930?  Look forward towards progress.  Bury the hatchet. Do not look to the past.  Start with the day the Treaty was signed.  The Treaty is the foundation of Irish liberty.  Every generation coming after us will proclaim the fact that Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, when they went fearlessly across the Irish Sea, when others shirked their duty, did noble work for the country.  To you, members of the Opposition, I say you are on a mistaken track.  You have not your own minds made up.  Deputy Mullins, when in Skibbereen, made his address under the shadow of the national monument which we erected in 1898 to the brave, patriotic Irishmen of '98 and '67 and '48.  If he were in power, the first act he would do would be to uproot that monument and put up one of Lenin.  That is the monument they want.  The Irish people will realise that when they hear some more speeches from Deputy Mullins, Deputy <Col N="1744" /> Lemass is always harping on this question. How can he say he is a Republican when he has taken the oath like myself and has come into the Dáil? The only real Republican whom I admire and take off my hat to is Miss MacSwiney, who has the courage of her convictions.  She is outside alone. You have deserted her.  You manufactured reasons for coming in here.  I hope the Dáil will stand loyally by the Government and show the country that we have no faith in Deputy Lemass's republic or the republic of Deputy Mullins.</P>

      <P>It was not necessary for him, but Deputy Tierney said at least this much: that his single opinion was as good as the collective opinion of all the Deputies on these Benches. As far as I remember, he said that his little daughter of four, with slight training, would be able to give an opinion as good as the collective opinion of the Deputies on these Benches.  I would suggest that the solution of the Seanad problem would be now quite easy.  We could make it a one-member Assembly.  Dissolve the Assembly which is sitting and send for Deputy Tierney.  The Deputy said that we attacked the Civil Service and the salaries of civil servants.  He said that people could not be got to work in the Civil Service for salaries less than were being paid.  He asked why the salary of a doctor should not be cut down to £1,000 the same as that of the civil servant.  May I inform the Deputy that the salaries which doctors in the public service receive are far removed from £1,000 a year, and these doctors have <Col N="1745" /> much more professional and university training than the civil servants who cannot do with less than £1,500 or £1,700 per year.  Doctors can do in the public service with £200 a year, and in County Mayo and other places with £150 a year.</P>

      <P>Practically.  And they work day and night, not like civil servants. I do not deny that there are, in the Civil Service to-day, men with plenty of ability who deserve a decent living wage.  But there are in the Civil Service men in high positions whom I know well.  These men in the same positions in the British Civil Service&mdash;the Civil Service of a Great Empire&mdash;would enjoy a maximum salary of £500 or £600, plus bonus.  Yet we are told that we cannot get their services at less and that they cannot live on less than £1,500 per year.  The whole question is: what is the country able to pay?  I think it was Deputy Coburn who said that agriculture&mdash;the staple industry of the country&mdash;is in a most depressed condition.  It is in as bad a condition now as it was in 1914, if not worse.  Yet the country is asked to pay practically double the amount it was asked to pay in 1914. Agricultural produce is very little dearer than it was in 1914.  The market price of live stock is very little better than it was in 1914.  Yet the people are asked to pay double the amount they were asked to pay in 1914.  The whole question is: what are the people able to pay?  We should frame our scheme of Government with a view to the people's ability to pay, and the services of the country should be reduced to the extent that the people can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond mentioned the Army.  There is no reason why the Army should be maintained on the present grandiose scale&mdash;no reason whatever. It cannot do anything against external aggression, and it is only there to keep down internal turmoil, as we will hear from the Benches opposite. In addition to that, we have the huge list of Army pensions.  The people who are drawing the pensions are supposed to be the law-abiding people of the country.  We were told that we must keep the Gárda Síochána force at its <Col N="1746" /> present strength.  If we did away with half the young pensioners, half the Gárda could be done away with.  In the constituency I come from, the only people who give the Guards any trouble are the people who are drawing these pensions.  We, on these Benches, maintain that on these three services a huge reduction can be made, and should be made, because the people cannot pay the present charges.  Agriculture&mdash;our main industry&mdash;is not able to stand this strain, and sooner or later the reduction must be made.  If the Deputies on the opposite Benches cannot bring down taxation to a level commensurate with the people's ability to pay, then their obvious duty is to get out and let others do so.  We will show them how.</P>

      <P>I was very gratified when the President made his statement: that their policy would not, and should not, prevent this country becoming a Republic if the people desired a Republic at any future date. The Minister for Finance had left us under the impression, earlier in the day, that the talk of a Republic was over and done with; that, as far as his Party was concerned, they were going to remain part of the British Empire, and that they thought that was the proper thing to do.  Now, we understand from the President that they still think that is the proper policy&mdash; that it is better to remain in the British Empire&mdash;but that they have no objection, if I may use that word, to any other Party doing their best to defeat that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the Government cannot be run on less than it is being run at present.  As was mentioned several times before, the other side of the question should be looked at.  Why are we so very anxious about getting an efficient staff, keeping them well-paid, and making sure that no ex-National Army man or Civic Guard will be thrown out amongst the unemployed when the course that is being pursued at present is every day driving farmers all over the country not alone out of their houses, not alone out amongst the unemployed, but out amongst the starving in what are now called County Homes, and which used to be called Workhouses?  If the people of the <Col N="1747" /> country cannot bear the present expense, why should not the Government look around and see if they cannot set up a system the cost of which the people could bear?  We are often told that the Government are the servants of the people, and that they are there to do their best for the people.  If the people are not able to pay for big expensive departments why do not the Government make some attempt to cut down expenses?  It is all very well to talk about giving grants and subsidies. What is the use of putting one hand into the farmer's pocket and extracting money, and then going round and putting back portion of it in the other pocket by way of subsidy?  The farmer would want no subsidy if the taxation of the country were on a proper level. We have often been told here&mdash;I think the President was responsible for the statement on one occasion&mdash;that the proper policy was to increase exports, if the country were to become more prosperous.  It is true we must pay for our imports.  If we desire to import as much as we are importing at present&mdash;admittedly, we must import a good deal, because the people are hungry as it is, and we do not seem to be importing enough&mdash;the only way we can pay for that is by exporting more.</P>
    <P>How can we expect to compete in the British market with the British farmer or with any other producer, as long as our taxation is as it is at present? The Minister for Finance in his speech here in this House on the 9th December, 1925, when they were discussing this financial agreement, said that it was estimated that Ireland's taxable capacity compared with Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 1.5. Great Britain, I presume, agreed to that, and probably they did not put the figure too low at 1.5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That requires a personal explanation.  What I actually said at the time was that the British Government had suggested that as the figure on which we might proceed to discuss the question of liabilities.  I did not say it had been agreed by anybody.</P>

      <P>Suppose we take the figure as a means in order to try to find out whether we are overtaxed or not.  The tax revenue of Great Britain in 1926-27 was £663,000,000.  If we take what our tax revenue should be, according to that, it would be £10,000,000, and we actually paid in 1926-27 in tax revenue £21,000,000. There is a sum of £11,000,000 too much. That is what the farmer here had to pay, £11,000,000 in taxation or £2 for every pound that the British farmer has to pay.  And we are supposed to be able to produce cattle and everything else here and pay the same expenses with regard to food and so on and pay freight on cattle going to England, and the taxation of £2 for every one pound that he pays, and then we are expected to compete in the British market and be well off.  We know that the British farmer is not well off, even with conditions as they are.  What must be the condition of the Irish farmer at the present time?</P>

      <P>According to the Irish Trade Journal for February, 1928, the index figure for farm produce is 31 per cent. higher now than it was in 1911 or 1913 and the cost of living is 87 per cent. higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Farmer when he goes to the merchant to buy anything, such as clothes, boots, machinery or anything else, has to pay an average of 87 per cent. higher than in 1911 or 1913 and he gets for his farm produce 31 per cent. higher.  He is paying twice as much for what he is buying now.  And then compare his condition with the condition of the British farmer.  We have to take all these things into account and we have to ask ourselves how is this country ever going to get out of the mess it is in at the present time?  I know that President Cosgrave, <Col N="1749" /> if he were here, would perhaps say the same as he said on the 27th October, 1927, that the Irish farmer if he does not consume intoxicating liquors, if he does not use tobacco, if he does not buy stocks and shares and does not use coffee does not pay any taxes to the State.  Who is paying the taxes?  Who is paying the taxes if it is not eventually the farmer?  He may not be paying the taxation directly but it comes down to him.  Who has to contribute this £21,000,000 that is raised by tax revenue?  Does the President or any other Minister think that they get their salaries from the income tax that is collected from the Civil Servants?  That £21,000,000 must come from somewhere and the only place it can come from eventually is from the producer, and the only producer we have in this country is the farmer.  The result is that you have that £21,000,000 placed on the Irish farmer and then when we come to examine the Budget we see that that £21,000,000 is not sufficient.  We find that the Budget for 1925-26 at any rate has not been balanced.  After taking the normal expenditure against the normal revenue we find that the normal expenditure exceeded the normal revenue by £2,000,000.  Then we find that year after year the balance of trade has been ranging somewhere from £17,000,000 to £20,000,000 against us. If we want to go further we find that the people in the country are not getting sufficient nourishment or clothes or the other necessaries of life. If those people are to be treated decently and get what they are entitled to, there should be further production in this country of about £10,000,000 a year.  Put all these figures together, put the £11,000,000 over-taxation that the farmer has to bear, the £2,000,000 in which the Budget is unbalanced, and the £17,000,000 adverse trade balance and another £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 which should be produced in order to give the people proper nourishment in this country and you get the enormous total of £40,000,000 which we must make up before we can consider ourselves a normal country producing as much as we are using.  All we are asking here is that the Government should take a serious view of these cases.</P>
    <P>I was looking up the speech of the <Col N="1750" /> Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Telegraphs, who was a severe critic of the Government last year, and he pointed out the many things which I have been pointing out now.  He said it was not his business to suggest a remedy, that there was a Government there, and it was their business to find a remedy.  Neither is it our business to suggest how they should do it.  We can look at this as a business concern. If you have a board of directors running a business, and if it pointed out that they are not managing that business concern as it should be managed you have the position that we are putting before you now.  It is quite evident that the Government are not managing this business when you find that people down in the country are being driven from their houses, that they are being driven into the County Homes, or that they are being driven over to their friends in America.  Under such conditions, it is quite obvious that they are not managing the concern properly, and if they cannot find a remedy, or if they are unable to see the end in view, it is up to them to make way for somebody else.  To ask across the House: &ldquo;What can you suggest?&rdquo; is not an answer to the argument that they have done badly.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>In the absence of Deputy O'Reilly, I asked a question of the Minister for Defence yesterday with regard to the late Frank O'Grady, of Glenbeigh, Co. Kerry.  I asked if the Minister was prepared to hold an inquiry into this case, and secondly, if he was prepared to make some provision for the relatives of O'Grady owing to his death.  The Minister replied that he was not prepared to do either.  I asked him then if he was <Col N="1751" /> aware that this boy, Frank O'Grady, was shot by an officer of the National Army in the presence of 200 people, while a prisoner, and his answer to that question was a question: Did I know that he was in arms against the Government of the country?  I consider that as a very insufficient answer.  I did not think that even a Minister who, three or four years ago, held the views that the Minister for Defence did, would publicly take responsibility for making a statement that it was sufficient justification for shooting an unarmed prisoner to say that he had previously taken up arms against the Government.  Therefore I said I would like to raise this matter on the adjournment.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, 11th March, 1923, a batch of prisoners was being removed to Killorglin. They were to be met at Mountain Stage by an escort from Killorglin. This escort was under two officers named Lyons and McGuinness.  When this escort from Killorglin reached Glenbeigh they divided into two detachments, and one went by what is known as the Curragh road, and the other went the main road.  McGuinness on his way searched the house of a man called Sullivan, and arrested there this Frank O'Grady along with another boy called Michael Cahill.  Frank O'Grady did not give his own name; he gave the name of O'Shea.  Eventually the two parties met; that is, the party under Lyons and the party under McGuinness met at Mountain Stage, and there also they met a party which was coming towards Killorglin with other prisoners. As it was a Sunday morning, people were going to Mass, and they rounded up big numbers&mdash;they had almost 200 prisoners in all by the time the three parties met at Mountain Stage.  Now, it was McGuinness who with his detachment arrested Captain O'Grady and Cahill.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it might be better if the Deputy did not mention the names of the officers at all.  Rather than mention any names, would it not be better to refer to them as officers?  Would it not be better not to mention the names of individual officers&mdash;not to refer to individual <Col N="1752" /> officers by name at all in a matter like this, seeing that a particular accusation is being made?</P>

      <P>On principle it is wrong to do so.  If the Deputy would say that there were two parties under two officers, and not mention them by name, it might be better. A name, of course, was mentioned yesterday, but as a general principle it is undesirable that the name of any particular person should be mentioned in the Dáil, particularly when a certain accusation is being made.  Of course there is complete privilege in regard to any statements made in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. AIKEN Mr. AIKEN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. AIKEN</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that when we bring up these cases here the Minister invariably denies all knowledge and insists in sneering at the relatives of people who were murdered by his troops during the civil war.  We have nothing left to us but to give the full facts of the case.  I suggest that Deputy Ryan should be allowed to give the full facts, as the Minister has again treated the murder of this prisoner with contempt.  I think you should allow Deputy Ryan to go ahead and give the full facts of the case and allow the House to decide on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is no objection to Deputy Ryan giving the full facts of the case, but he can do that without mentioning the names of individuals.  A particular accusation is being made, and I have suggested that the Deputy might confine himself to mentioning officers without giving their names.  Deputy Aiken himself has mentioned a word just now.  I think he used the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; and referred to the murder of a prisoner.  The use of such words is likely to raise ill-feeling, and that is the sort of word than can be bandied about considerably.  The privilege of using it, if it is allowed to be used at all, could not possibly be confined to one side.  Deputy Aiken speaks of the murder of a prisoner. That really amounts to an accusation in the House against a particular individual. I would prefer if the names <Col N="1753" /> could be kept out of this debate altogether.  In fact, as regards the word &ldquo;murder,&rdquo; it is a most disorderly word, and owing to our peculiar position perhaps we have not sufficiently emphasised that certain words must not be used.  As a general principle Deputies themselves will realise&mdash;and I think it will apply for all time to the House&mdash;that accusations against definite individuals, officers of the State or otherwise, by name, should not be made, and the reason is that these individuals have no redress&mdash;none whatever. Deputy Ryan is giving what he will agree is his own statement, one side's statement of the case.  That statement, having been made, it may contain a name or names.  Deputy Ryan can make any statement he chooses to make.  The rules of order here are altogether different from the rules of a court.  The Deputy may make any statement he pleases, but if he makes a statement against an individual, that individual has no remedy whatever except in so far as whatever the Minister may state subsequently. On the whole, I think it would be better to refer merely to an officer of the National Army.</P>

      <P>As I said, the three detachments met at Mountain Stage and they had about 200 prisoners.  Some of them were only rounded up going to Mass.  This boy O'Grady was unknown to the officer who arrested him, and he had given the name of O'Shea because he was very well known in the district and he knew that if he gave his own name he would be arrested and, if he did not, he might possibly get off. When he was brought to Mountain Stage the people naturally all said: &ldquo;There is O'Grady,&rdquo; and that identified him.  A certain officer walked up to Frank O'Grady, put out his hand to <Col N="1754" /> him, and said: &ldquo;How are you, Frank?&rdquo; and as Frank put out his hand this officer struck him with a Peter the Painter on the head.  The second officer remarked: &ldquo;Why dirty your hands on the&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; calling him an offensive name, and the first officer again pulled his Peter the Painter and fired at O'Grady point blank, shooting him, and again when on the ground he fired a second bullet into him which killed him.  Afterwards one member of the party, who was not an officer, fired from a rifle as O'Grady was on the ground, but missed him.  At any rate, the officer who shot him asked if there was first aid about and one of the prisoners stepped forward but found that nothing could be done for O'Grady, that he was practically dead. He was brought into a house where he was found to be dead, and the Free State officers and soldiers marched away with the remaining prisoners, not taking them all, but taking certain prisoners to Killorglin.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm, at any rate, to mention the names of witnesses and their addresses, witnesses who are prepared to swear to a certain officer shooting Frank O'Grady, an unarmed prisoner, without any provocation whatsoever.  In fact, as I mentioned, while Frank O'Grady was putting out his hand to shake hands with the same officer he was hit, knocked down and then shot.  The witnesses who are prepared to testify to that are:&mdash;Michael O'Connor, Railway Cottage, Curragh, Glenbeigh, Kerry; Michael Cahill, Glenbeigh, Kerry; Maurice Burke, Mountain Stage, Glenbeigh, Kerry; Mrs. Johanna Digges, Mountain Stage, Glenbeigh, Kerry; Michael Digges, Mountain Stage, Glenbeigh, Kerry, and Mrs. Bridget Sugrue, the same address. Unfortunately, most of the witnesses who, however, might not be considered as impartial witnesses by the Minister for Defence&mdash;that is, the prisoners who were with him&mdash;are now in America, but those I have mentioned were in the vicinity at the time going to Mass and they saw this being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those names are available for the Minister for Defence, and he can get statements from these people if he wants them with regard to this crime. I am not sure but that the Minister <Col N="1755" /> may say he is powerless to act in the matter as the amnesty may cover it.  I I do not know whether he is powerless or not.  At any rate, he is not powerless to act with regard to the second part of the question, in which I asked if compensation would be paid to the relatives of this man.  Frank O'Grady was an only son.  His father, mother, two sisters and himself lived on a small farm near Glenbeigh.  One of the sisters is married, and the other is at home at present with her father and mother, both of whom are old.  They have no one to look after the little bit of land they have, and they are very poor.  I think this is a case in which the Minister for Defence might consider giving them something as compensation for depriving them of their only son.  I know, or at least I can make a fair guess, that when the Minister replies he is going to talk about anarchy and men being in arms against the Government.  He will perhaps say to me as he said yesterday: &ldquo;Can you prove that he was not in arms against the State?&rdquo; He was not armed when he was arrested, but I think that he would possibly have taken up arms, or had taken up arms perhaps against the National Army.  I am not sure about that.  I have no doubt about this, that he was a well-known figure in the Anglo-Irish war, and a well-known fighting man in Kerry against the British.  He may not have thought it right to change his opinions when the Treaty came along and take his side with the Minister for Defence.  He may have thought, like many another young person at that time, that he was bound to abide by the oath that he had taken, saying, &ldquo;I will support and defend the Irish Republic and the Government of the Irish Republic, which is Dáil Eireann, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&rdquo;  That is all I have to say on the case.  Personally I am not out for vengeance in this matter now that the case has gone so far, but I would appeal to the Minister for Defence to see that these people are not left in poverty as a result of their loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I was really asked two questions in one.  One was &ldquo;Would I have an inquiry held?&rdquo; and <Col N="1756" /> the second was &ldquo;Would I pay compensation to this man's people?&rdquo; The Deputy suggests that my question to him yesterday had it been proved that this man had not been in arms against the State&mdash;meant that I considered it perfectly justifiable for an unarmed person under any circumstances whatsoever to be shot.  I meant nothing of the sort.  As to No. 1 question would I hold an inquiry I answered &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The reason is, as was read out in the Dáil on the 11th November, 1924, that an amnesty was granted for all acts committed or purported to be committed in furtherance of an armed rebellion against the State, or in the suppression of it.  During the last few days Deputies have been complaining of certain people being in jail.  I believe it is possible if that amnesty had not been granted that many, or some, of the Deputies opposite would still be in jail.  I have no doubt that if it had not been granted many of their friends would have been duly executed.  An amnesty was granted.  I look at the utility of things.  If all that the Deputies say, and that their friends like to say from time to time, are true is there any useful effect to be got from the holding of an inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider, and I know a certain amount about this case, that even if all the Deputy says were true an inquiry is useless.  There was again the question &ldquo;Would I grant compensation&rdquo;?  The Deputy opposite said that when I came to reply it was likely I would use the word &ldquo;anarchy,&rdquo; and I will.  When you have a state of anarchy with armed people going about waging war against the Government and the people of the country it is inevitable, I think, that certain innocent people suffer by wounding, loss of property, or by being killed.  If it was suggested that this man was a decent upright citizen and had not taken part in this criminal offence, naturally it would be brought home to me there was a question for compensation.  Although I know a certain amount about this case, I have not that absolute assurance that I am always right and perfectly informed which is such a feature of the speeches on the other side.  If I had proof that this man was a decent citizen who had been shot unwarrantedly, not having taken <Col N="1757" /> part in the rebellion, I would consider that there was a case for compensation, but as long as I am in my present office I am not going to recommend&mdash; though I may have every sympathy with the parents of this man, who might be decent people&mdash;that the people who wage war upon the Irish people shall be given ex gratia grants from the Government.  We suffer from the great disadvantage that we are the Government. We cannot get up and ask the gentlemen opposite are they going to pay out of their own pockets the people who suffered through their acts, or for the acts of the unfortunate people who were misled by them.</P>

      <P>If I am allowed to continue we may be able to finish in time.  Deputies have asked is it murder for an unarmed prisoner to be shot. It may be or it may not be, according to the circumstances of the case.  National soldiers had, I think, about the previous day met their death by violence at the hands of the enemies of this State.  There was a state of great danger there.  Deputies referred, I think, the other day to escapes from Mountjoy.  They asked if a prisoner escaped would anybody blame him. Deputies on the other side do not.  But in the circumstances here in March, 1923, the officer in this case had a number of prisoners.  Under the circumstances he could not take a risk if he legitimately considered that a prisoner was trying to escape, especially a man who, as the Deputy admitted, had taken an active part in warfare that led to deaths.</P>

      <P>So far as a man who took part in warfare against this State, and met his death as a result of that, or of something that purported to be a result of that, I am not prepared to recommend compensation.  We are told these men went out ready to give up everything, but when it comes to the point they want to get paid for it. As to the case put up to me, I have no intention, on the facts as I have them, of paying any compensation.  I asked the Deputy could he give me any proof that the man was not a participant in this.  I believe, I may be wrong, that he was not only a participant but a particularly active participant, and that by his actions a few days before that men in the service of the Government had met their death.  I do not feel called upon to recommend ex gratia grants for people who had taken the lives of men who were serving this country.</P>

      <P>That is all I have to say on the matter.  I know that these things are largely brought up for the purpose of propaganda.  I have no doubt, under the circumstances, regrettable and unjustifiable cases happened, if you like, on each side.  That might easily be.  Deputies on the other side can get up and give their stories, not strictly correct, coloured ones and make ex parte statements.  As far as I know the circumstances of this case are that this was a man who had taken part in fighting on the previous day.  Deputies say he was unarmed on this occasion.  That may be the case.  I know that they had a habit there of picking up their guns and shooting and then running away and hiding.  I do not know how long before <Col N="1761" /> this he was armed.  He was arrested in a house some distance up the road and brought down with other prisoners.  He was lined up with these prisoners when they were being questioned. The Deputy says that the officer did not know this man, and on the other hand he said that the prisoner was putting out his hand to shake hands with him.  I cannot myself quite picture how that could happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the evidence I had.  It seems to me this man was arrested and brought down and lined up with certain other prisoners.  We are told that he gave a false name to the officer.  This officer was in a dangerous situation there, as he had only a small body of troops.  I was told, and I believe that this man once he was known, had a very good chance of being executed.  I quite believe that Deputies opposite will say: &ldquo;Would you blame the man for making an attempt to escape?&rdquo; It <Col N="1762" /> comes to the question as to whether the officer in charge really believed that he was attempting to escape.  That is a thing which neither Deputies on the other side nor I can know for certain. I believe the officer was bona fide convinced that the man was attempting to escape.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he can state whether an application for marriage allowance has been received from No. 13912, Private O. Maher, 13th Battalion Infantry, and, if so, on what date this application was received, and if he is in a position to state when this allowance will be granted.</P>

      <P>An application for marriage allowance was received from Private Maher in November, 1926. He did not then fulfil certain conditions laid down for the issue of the allowance and consequently his name was not then included on the marriage roll.  As the quota of non-commissioned officers and men in respect of whom the allowance is payable is already full, it cannot be stated when the allowance will be granted in Private Maher's case.</P>

      <P>The Committee for the Relief of Unemployment was set up to consider and report as to the steps which might be taken for the immediate relief of unemployment generally within the limits set out in their terms of reference.  The fact that there is no specific reference to female unemployment in their Report suggests, what is, indeed, generally recognised, that the problem of unemployment amongst female workers cannot effectively be met by immediate or temporary schemes.  Certain important aspects of this matter have, however, been the subject of a consideration by the Commission on Technical Education <Col N="1637" /> whose Report is at present being examined.</P>
