      <P>Grants amounting to £1,000 have been sanctioned as a contribution towards expenditure on road works undertaken as a measure for the relief of unemployment in County Westmeath on condition that the County Council shall contribute not less than £2,000 towards the cost of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works received petitions under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, in respect <Col N="248" /> of two proposals in this area&mdash;the Rochfortbridge and Milltownpass.  In the former case they have decided, as a result of investigation, to prepare a detailed drainage scheme for submission to the occupiers of affected lands, and their Engineer hopes to complete the necessary survey as soon as flood conditions improve.  The scheme when prepared will be submitted to the occupiers, and should a majority of them assent and the scheme be confirmed the execution of the works will be put in hand.</P>
      <P>The Milltownpass proposal has not yet been approved by the Commissioners of Public Works.  It has been inspected by their Engineer and Valuer.  Their reports are at present under consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the number of British ex-Servicemen serving as non-permanent Government clerks who were transferred by the Imperial Government to the Irish Provisional Government (under the Transfer of Functions Order, 1922) on the 6th December, 1921, and the number of those men who have been dismissed the service, and if he will also state the number of those dismissed officers from whom claims for compensation under Article X. of the Treaty have been received, and how many of those claims have been dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No returns are available from which the information asked for in the question could be obtained. I am not aware whether the various Departments have any information as to the number of temporary clerks employed since the change of Government who were British ex-Servicemen.  With two exceptions the applications for compensation received from discharged temporary employees do not indicate whether the applicants fall within that category.  These applications in common with others made for compensation under Article 10 await the reconstitution of machinery necessary to deal with such claims.  The collection of returns necessary to give the information asked for in the question would <Col N="249" /> involve a considerable amount of labour in all Departments which I do not consider would be justified by the results.</P>

      <P>The completion of the actuarial examination has been delayed by difficulties in ascertaining details of the basic information required by the actuary.  Having regard to the further delay that might be occasioned by an endeavour to clear all the points in doubt, it has been decided to proceed with the formulation of a pension scheme without waiting for the receipt of the actuary's report, and it is hoped that the instructions for preparation of the proposed necessary legislation will be given at the end of next week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that persons who have contributed during their lives to benevolent or other funds and so become entitled to pensions in their old age are penalised by the present regulations by which such pensions are taken into consideration for the purposes of the Old Age Pensions Acts, and whether he will consider the advisability of introducing proposals for legislation whereby, in the cases of such pensions not exceeding 15/- per week, 10/- per week thereof shall not be reckoned as &ldquo;means&rdquo; for the purpose of calculating the old age pension to which the pensioner becomes entitled.</P>

      <P>The Adrigole boys' and girls' national schools are in one building, but are under separate management.  From the information at the disposal of the Department of Education, it would seem that the condition of the building is not suitable.  The question whether the proper remedy is reconstruction of the existing building or the erection of new schools has been referred to the Board of Works.  No direct application with regard to reconstruction or the erection of new schools has been received from either manager.  When such application is received it will be considered in the light of the report from the Board of Works, and of the comparative urgency of the case.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the condition of the road referred to.  Work would have been carried out on it out of the Road Fund Grant allocated in March, 1927, to the Dingle area, but for the fact that certain new water supply pipes had not then been laid.  No road fund grants can be given at present for such special works, and the grant for the relief of unemployment has already been fully allocated.  The matter will, however, receive consideration as soon as circumstances permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The road referred to has been reconstructed in bituminous macadam under the national scheme and is completed less than a year.  It is now in first-class condition as far as a modern surface goes.  All modern surfaces fail in affording as good a foothold for horses as did the old-fashioned plain macadam.  The latter is, however, prohibitive in cost of upkeep under a volume of motor traffic such as it at present using the Navan Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in reply to Deputy Moore's question of the 2nd November, 1927, the problem of finding a road surface at a reasonable cost, and which will afford good foothold for horses as well as a smooth passage for motors, is <Col N="253" /> the subject of continued experiment in this country and elsewhere.  It is hoped also that with a horse-shoe better adopted to the new surfaces and with horses getting more used to the new conditions there will be less difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the meantime hay traffic is only a small fraction of the total usage of the road in question, and there are alternative routes along which better foothold can be found with only slight additional length of journey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with materials, both from the point of view of making the roads more suitable for horse traffic and from the point of view of getting materials that can be produced in the country.  As the Minister is doubtless aware, practically all the materials are imported at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of different classes of surfaces have been laid down throughout the country, and it is only out of practical work of that particular kind at present that we can do research work that will be of any use to us.  But no experience that we can get from which to profit is at present being left unobserved.</P>

There is no occasion for the Department to do any propaganda in regard to prevention.  People know how to prevent it, but they are not quite clear as to how to treat it when it does occur.

The existing station is in a position to deal with all the samples submitted for testing by farmers and traders, as well as with samples taken by inspectors under the Weeds and Agricultural Seeds Act, under the operations of which the quality of seeds used by farmers has been brought, generally speaking, to a very satisfactory standard.  The nominal fee of 3d. per sample is charged to farmers, and it is not proposed to modify this arrangement.</P>

In the view of the Department of Agriculture it would not, however, be reasonable to ask that the Port of Waterford should be so opened until the position has become somewhat clearer.  The Deputy may rest assured that as soon as the Department are satisfied that the resumption of stock shipments from Waterford might safely and reasonably be made, representations to that effect will be made to the British Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister has given this matter every consideration, but may I ask whether he is aware that the port of Waterford is over 40 miles from the affected area and that there are two rivers between counties Wexford and <Col N="267" /> Waterford?  The counties are not contiguous. I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind and also the fact that there is only one possibility of cattle coming from County Wexford getting into Waterford and that is over the bridge at Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter of personal explanation, may I take this, my first, opportunity of contradicting a statement which, according to a report contained in to-day's &ldquo;Irish Times,&rdquo; was made towards the close of the debate last evening upon the amendment to the motion of Deputy Lemass? According to this report, the following remarks are attributed to Deputy Flinn:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There had been quoted in that House a considered judgment of Mr. Justice Hanna, and the Minister for Justice had the impudence to dismiss it in a single word by saying that it was wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House, I have never stated that a judgment of Mr. Justice Hanna was wrong.  If the Deputy is correctly reported, he has entirely misstated what I said.  He did not give us, or give the House, any particular allusion to the date to which he referred, but, so far as my recollection goes, the only occasion upon which I made any reference in any way to Mr. Justice Hanna was in a debate which took place on the 10th November last.  In that debate I did not say that the decision of Mr. Justice Hanna was wrong.  I did say, to use a technical expression, that an &ldquo;obiter dictum&rdquo; contained in that judgement was wrong.  Perhaps I had better define what the expression &ldquo;obiter dicta&rdquo; means.  It means statements made by judges which do <Col N="268" /> not go to the foundation of their judgments, which are not necessary for their judgments, or have nothing at all to do with the judgements which they are delivering, and which, in consequence, cannot be taken as statements laying down the law.  I will now quote from the official report of that date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. O'CONNELL: We have again a statement of a High Court judge, and it is on that I founded a statement which I used here before, that, in fact, this Act did create a new crime of being a suspect.</P>
    <P>Mr. FITZGERALD-KENNEY: That is wrong.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'CONNELL: The judge may be wrong, but we will leave is between the lawyers.</P>
    <P>I expressed the view that a statement made by a High Court judge entirely &ldquo;obiter&rdquo; was wrong.  I am still of that view, but that is an entirely different thing from stating that a decision given by a High Court judge was wrong.  The duty of the judges in this State is to lay down the law, and their judgments, as far as they are declaratory of the common law, or as far as they are interpretative of statutory law, are binding on this House, and should not, must not, and ought not to be challenged in this House, and I certainly would not challenge them.  If that be the occasion to which Deputy Flinn alluded, then Deputy Flinn has made a misstatement of fact.  If that be not the occasion, I challenge the Deputy to state to what occasion he referred.</P>

I am quite clear, having read the official report of that particular debate, that the judgment given by Mr. Justice Hanna on the occasion referred to was not debated or canvassed here.  A statement by the judge, which, as the Minister has explained. was not necessary to his judgment, was debated as a matter of opinion.  It is not for us here to discuss &mdash;we have never done it, and I do not intend that we ever shall as long as it falls to me to determine questions of order here&mdash;judgments given in the courts.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the Second Reading of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) <Col N="270" /> Bill.  In dealing with the incidence of rates, there are two rather important matters that have to be kept in mind.  One is in order that the local administration may be responsibly carried out those who vote for the election of representatives will also be persons who contribute to the rates, so that there will be an element of responsibility both in the voters and the elected representatives.  The second matter is that for the purpose of facilitating economy in the collection of rates persons who shall be ratepayers shall be people of some substance and permanency of domicile.  The Local Government Act of 1898 took cognisance of the first matter when it put primary responsibility for the poor rate on the occupiers of dwellings.  In fact certain landlords did continue to pay the rates, either by agreement with the tenant or otherwise.  Recently certain developments have taken place which affect very much the second matter.  In the first place, the Restriction of Rent Acts prevented landlords from raising their rents beyond a particular point, and the landlords began to transfer to the occupiers of small dwellings the onus of paying the rates. In the second place, a judgment was given in the case of Bradshaw against McMullen to the effect that if even there was a contract that the landlord would pay the rates which were legally due to be paid by the occupier such contract was void.  This particular judgment and the effect of the Rent Restrictions Act began the movement by which the landlords allowed to go back to the occupiers of houses the onus of directly paying their rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result has been that rates became due to be paid by very small holders, persons of not very great substance, and local rating bodies have experienced a considerable amount of difficulty in collecting rates from such persons.  There has been an agitation on the part of the local rating authorities for the purpose of getting legislation passed to make the landlords responsible for the payment of rates in respect of small dwellings.  Quite a large number of rating bodies have appealed to the Minister for Local Government on the matter and the Association <Col N="271" /> of Muncipal Authorities has passed a very definite resolution.  It is desirable to facilitate the collection of rates and to make the collection of rates as inexpensive as possible.  The Department of Local Government have had to consider the question from the point of view of reconciling the two important principles that we have referred to, and the result is the Department and the Government are quite clear that it would have a very bad effect on the carrying out of local administration if any large section of the people were freed from the responsibility of paying rates, or were allowed to get into a position in which the rates did not matter to them.  The present Bill, however, reconciles these two principles, I think.  It extends to all rating authorities with the exception of town commissioners.  The reason for excluding town commissioners is, in the first place, that in the areas where town commissioners exist there are two rating authorities, the county council and the town commissioners.  The rating powers of the town commissioners are small; their rate cannot be more than 2/- in the £ where water is not provided and cannot be more than 2/6 where water is provided.  Invariably the town commissioners strike their rate at a different time from the date of striking the rate by the county council. It has been found desirable to leave the town commissioners out of it so as not to complicate the scheme.</P>
    <P>I think it might be said in passing that it is inevitable that the whole question of rating will be gone into with a view to simplification.  There are very great complications in the whole business of rating at present and it is probable that in any rearrangement of the system of rating, instead of town commissioners being a direct rating authority, matters would be arranged so that they would make their demand on the county council in the same way as the county council makes its demand on the urban district, or in the same way as the Board of Health makes its demand on the county council.  However, the town commissioners have been left out of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In respect to the other rating bodies, <Col N="272" /> county councils, county boroughs, boroughs or urban districts, this Bill applies.  It proposes that owners of small dwellings not exceeding £6 in valuation will be the persons responsible for paying the rates.  The figure of £6 has been chosen as being a fair average among the figures that have been suggested to the Department by local bodies.  It is taken as rather too low a figure than too high.  On discussion of the matter it may be found that in the case of county boroughs it may be desirable to modify the proposals so that a higher valuation can be quoted, but generally £6 is quoted as the most satisfactory figure.</P>
    <P>Owners will be responsible for the rates, and in the case of owners not paying the rates before they pass on ownership to a subsequent owner, the subsequent owner can be made liable for the rates with a two years' limit. Where an owner is not now paying the rates and becomes under this Bill responsible for the rates, he is authorised to increase what I shall call the original or contract rent as distinct from the standard rent that is mentioned in the Rent Restrictions Act.</P>

      <P>Where an owner is not now paying the rates he becomes under this Bill responsible for paying them.  He may increase the original rent payable by his tenants by the amount of the rates.  That is, if there is a tenant at the present moment paying rent and rates, that rent is a definite thing; I call it for the moment the original rent.  That continues to be the rent, subject to any changes that may from time to time come about as the result of a change of contract.  The present occupier is relieved by this Bill of paying the rates, the owner becoming responsible; but the owner can increase the rent by the extent of the rates for the current year. The proposal is that if the tenant is a weekly tenant, after the striking of the rate and for the twelve months following the striking of the rate, the landlord shall charge rent to the tenant which shall be the original weekly rent plus one fifty-second of the total year's rates.  If the tenant is a monthly <Col N="273" /> tenant the landlord will charge him for the twelve months after the striking of a particular rate the original rent plus one-twelfth of the total annual rate.</P>

That will be treated as the standard rent for the purposes of the Rent Restrictions Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>A landlord will not be entitled under this Bill to salt the tenants for rates under the facilities given to him in the Rent Restrictions Act and salt them as well under this particular measure.  The occupier is safeguarded against being made responsible for a double dose of rates as a result of this Bill being read in connection with the Rent Restrictions Act. The Bill itself proposes that it will come into operation as from the 1st April, 1929.  The rates for the current year are in many cases being struck, and in order in the first place, not to introduce complications as a result of this Bill becoming law some weeks or months after the rate for next year has been struck, and to give the landlord and tenants time to make the necessary adjustments with regard to rent, it is desirable that the Bill should not become law or that the incidence of rating would not, under this Bill, begin to take place until the 1st April, 1929. I think that will be regarded as reasonable. Where at the present moment for any reason&mdash;the cases will be few&mdash; there are cases in which there is an <Col N="274" /> agreement of any particular kind by which the occupier of a small dwelling is paying both the rent and the rates in one sum, the Bill provides with reference to the rates for the year beginning on the 1st April, 1928, that a deduction will be made from what the tenant is now paying so as to arrive at the current contract rate.  So that where the tenant is at present paying rent and rates, the Bill makes an arrangement by which the definite amount of the current year's rates is taken from the present payment in order to arrive at the contract or basic rate to which his payments for future years will be referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated that in the case of the rate for any particular year being struck the deductions will extend over the complete twelve months.  That is weekly or monthly payments in respect of rates by the tenant will extend over a complete twelve months.  But it may happen that if one year's rates are struck by a rating body a month or six weeks either before or after the date on which the previous year's rates were struck, there will happen, in practice, cases where, say, a weekly tenant may be paying for two or three weeks the basic rent, plus the amount in respect of, say, the year A, plus the amount in respect of year B.  The simplest arrangement that we could come to was an arrangement by which the rating amounts would be spread over the whole twelve months, whether the twelve months overlapped or left gaps for the space of a week or two.  There is another part of this Bill which makes arrangements with regard to unoccupied premises.  The position at the present moment is that different classes of rates&mdash;the poor rate, the town rate, the borough rate, special local rates, of which a large number exist&mdash;fall in different ways on unoccupied dwellings. It is desired to clear up that particular position.  Section 6 makes an arrangement for that.  In fact, while the Rent Restrictions Act continues in force, the position will not be materially affected by the proposals here.  But except fresh legislation is brought in&mdash;and nothing that I am saying now prejudices that position one way or another &mdash;the present Rent Restrictions Act expires <Col N="275" /> in June, 1929.  If it does expire in June, 1929, it is considered very desirable that the position with regard to unoccupied houses and their rates would, so far as small dwellings are concerned, be uniform, simple and clear.  This Bill makes provision for that.  Here and there the Bill looks a bit complicated, but that is simply for the reason that rating legislation generally is comlicated at present, and the Bill has to make reference to that.  But I feel certain that the working of the Bill will be simple, easy and uncomplicated. We will, in fact, get rid of certain complications.  I move that the Bill be read a Second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who has been identified with a local body within the last five or six years in this country will welcome this Bill.  As the Minister for Local Government and public Health has said, the rating system in this country generally is very complicated, and I do hope that the Bill we have before us to-day will not make it more so.  One knows quite well what the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is aiming at, but his interpretation of the various sections of the Bill has not made it very clear to me at any rate.  For some considerable time past I have been advocating a Bill of this kind, and I am rather sorry that the Minister has not brought in a Bill to enable it to be put right from the beginning of the financial year, commencing in April next.  In connection with the question of valuation, the amount mentioned (£6) is, so far as old houses are concerned, reasonable. The Minister knows that very few houses that have been built since this Government came into power&mdash; since 1922&mdash;are under a valuation of £8.  These houses have been built to a great extent at the cost of the Government, and the President has repeatedly told us that he could not recommend that the valuation should be lowered more in accordance with normal times.  I think that in this connection there should be some differentiation made as between houses built since 1922 and houses built previously. Houses built since 1922 have a valuation far and away greater than the <Col N="276" /> houses of an equal size or equal capacity built before 1922.  I ask the Minister to give some consideration to that aspect of the situation.  That is to say that this Bill should apply, say, to houses built before 1922 and of a valuation of £6, and that for the new houses built since 1922 that figure should be raised to £8.  It may lead to some complications, but I think the President will agree that it is a matter which certainly needs attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another matter and that is the question of labourers' cottages in rural areas.  As the Bill stands I do not think it would apply to these cottages because the county councils or the county boards of health would be both landlord and collector of the rates.  I think it would be welcomed in the country areas by farm labourers if the county boards of health would adjust the rent to enable the rates to be collected in the rent.  I ask the Minister to have some section inserted in the Bill to make it mandatory on county councils to have this done.  I think it is under Section 4 of the Bill that power is given to the landlord to increase rents, but I am not very clear, even after the Minister's explanation of the section, as to what is intended.  The position in this country is this: up to the year 1920, in most if not all the urban areas in the country, the landlords paid the rates direct to the local authority.  I think it is correct to say that because of the fact that Sinn Fein got into power in that year, the landlords immediately ceased to pay the rates direct to the local authorities.  We must assume that up to the year 1920, when the landlords paid the rates direct to the local authorities, they were collecting the rates in the rents&mdash; that is to say, the rates were included in the rents&mdash;from the householders. What I want to know from the Minister is, if under this section the landlord will have power to demand an increase in rent to cover the rates&mdash;that is to say, if he will be entitled to take the rent that the tenant is paying now and to demand an increase on it commensurate with all the rates that have to be paid: poor rate, water rate, borough rate, and all the rest, and add <Col N="277" /> all that to the present rent.  I think it is only right that that question should be answered more satisfactorily than the Minister answered Deputy Morrissey's question.  We are entitled to assume that up to the year 1920 the rates were being collected in the rent as landlords have not been so foolish in this country as to pay something they never got themselves.  I would like to see something more definite and specific inserted in the Bill than the section as it stands, so that both landlords and tenants would be able to have more guidance in the matter.  What makes me think that the Minister has not paid due attention to that particular aspect of the matter is the fact of his having quoted the case of Bradshaw <i>v.</i> MacMullen.  If that is the basis upon which he is working in connection with Section 4 of this Bill, then I do not think the tenants have much to gain. As one identified with local bodies for a great number of years, and therefore being in a position to realise the difficulties which public bodies generally have had to contend with in the matter of getting in the rates, I certainly welcome the Bill.  In a great many cases since the year 1920 landlords have given up paying the rates direct, especially to urban authorities.  In conclusion I hope that when the Minister comes to reply he will give us a fuller explanation with regard to Section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'KELLY Mr. O'KELLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Corish, that the principle underlying this Bill is a good one.  My own opinion, and I would have thought it would have been his too, is that the main principle underlying the Bill is entirely undemocratic.  Instead of doing everything we could to interest individuals who have to pay rates, by seeing that they pay them directly, this Bill takes the contrary course, and enables the local authority to get at the owners of small as well as large dwellings and get the rates from them. In my opinion, that does not tend to encourage the occupiers of small houses to become as interested in the administration of local affairs as they ought to be.  If they had to pay the rates themselves they would know that at certain times of the year the rate collector was going to call on them for <Col N="278" /> payment of the rates.  If they are put in that position they will naturally be inclined not only to examine and scrutinise the particulars on the rate, but also its administration.  They would be likely to do that to a far greater extent than if the payment of the rates is not extracted from themselves individually. Therefore, in my opinion the principle of the Bill is wrong.  It is not one that we, who are supposed to be a democratic people, ought to encourage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish is a member of local bodies and I realise the difficulties that exist: that the rate collectors have a great deal more trouble in collecting the rates by having five or six or maybe more ratepayers on their books than would be the case if this principle were adopted.  They would not have so many names on their books, or so many people to collect the rates from, if the principle that is sought under this Bill to be introduced is allowed to go through.  If the principle be adopted, who knows but that in a year or two the valuations of the houses in respect of which this principle is sought to be carried into effect would be increased perhaps by £10 and in a few years later by £20.  In my opinion, the principle is entirely undemocratic and one that we ought not to stand over in this House.  As I have said, there are difficulties undoubtedly, but there should be some other way of getting over them, of getting the rate collector's work done and of getting the rates in, than by adopting the undemocratic principle set forth in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corish that Section 4 in the Bill is not clear.  It does not state definitely that the landlord or owner of the house is not entitled to increase the present rent on the tenant.  In my opinion something more clear and definite in connection with that will have to be put into the Bill in order to ensure that tenants coming under the Bill will not find, when the measure starts to operate, that power has been given to the owners of their houses to increase their rents to some extent at least.  Another point in the Bill, the principle of which I do not care for, is the relief in respect of unoccupied premises.  To my mind, <Col N="279" /> the amount of relief to be given in the case of unoccupied premises and unoccupied houses at the present time should be the minimum.  There are too many people looking for houses, small, large and all kinds of houses, and there are too many who are unable to find houses or parts of houses or flats. Despite that, we know that there are houses all over the country, small and large, that are unoccupied and that ought not to be unoccupied and that would not be unoccupied if there was some penalty attached to the keeping of these houses unoccupied for a long period.  Under present conditions, I would be in favour of penalising people who own houses and allow them to remain unoccupied unless they get exorbitant rents for them.  The relief that is sought to be given here may not be very great relief from the payment of rates, but I think that if at least half the rates were demanded from the owners of unoccupied houses they would be very much more inclined to let them and to relieve the present pressure on housing authorities generally.</P>
    <P>There are too many houses vacant, large and small.  The larger ones could be divided up, and if the relief set out in the Bill were not granted, landlords and houseowners would be much more inclined to let houses on reasonable terms.  The principle is not one we could stand over.  I do agree that local authorities have grievances; that they have difficulty in getting in their rates, and that the rate collectors are pestered; but another method should be found to deal with the situation. Above all things, we in a democratic institution such as this should not stand for an undemocratic policy such as is set out in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CAREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of Southern urban councils, I welcome the Bill.  We never found much difficulty in the urban districts in collecting the poor rate, but we found it very difficult to collect the general rate.  The levying of the whole of the general rate on the tenant is not fair, and I would suggest to the Minister that he should allow the landlord to recoup only half the rate.  I think that would <Col N="280" /> meet the case fairly, because some of the tenants in the urban districts are occupying these houses for the past 20 or 30 years, or perhaps longer.  They are paying 2/6, 4/- or, some of them, 5/- per week for these cottages, and it is with the utmost difficulty that we can persuade the landlords to instal proper sanitary arrangements, even though there may be a perfect system of sewerage.  We find that many of the tenants complain of bad doors, falling ceilings, and defects of that nature. They come to us with their complaints, but, of course, it is up to the doctor, who is the official responsible, to see that the houses are fit for human habitation. We have no remedy in that respect; but I do say that it is too much to allow the landlords to recoup the whole rate.  I suggest to the Minister that he should put a clause in the Bill allowing the landlords to recoup only half the rate.  Of course, I understand that if the rates are reduced by the different urban councils, that could be adjusted between the landlord and tenant, but I fail to see how the Increase of Rent Act of 1914 would come into operation at all in these cases.  I would like the Minister to make it perfectly clear that under no circumstances can that Act come within the provisions of the Bill that he is now bringing forward for the ratification of this House.  The greatest hardship that can be found is in the collecting of the general rate.  It is only right and just that this measure should be brought forward for the relief of tenants occupying houses under £6 valuation.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding what Deputy O'Kelly stated about this measure being undemocratic, I desire to say that I approve of the principle of it.  I could understand Deputy O'Kelly's argument if there was a clause in this Bill relieving tenants altogether of the responsibility of paying rates, but as a matter of fact, if I read this Bill correctly, by its passing through this House it will make it obligatory, and I might say make it possible, for people in this country, to pay rates who have been unable to pay them up to the present.</P>

      <P>Yes, obligatory. It is all very fine to talk about people paying their rate directly and in a lump sum, but we know very well that the average tenant of the type of house which is dealt with by this measure will find it very difficult at the end of half a year to hand over £2 or £3 to the rate collector when he comes along. It would be much more convenient if they were able to fulfil their obligations by paying so much per week.  Let me give a case in point.  I am a member of a local authority and we are losing at the moment in irrecoverable rates roughly 1/3 in the £.  That means that other ratepayers, the people who pay the rates, have not only to pay rates for their own houses but have to pay 1/3 in the £ extra to make up for the people who are not able to pay their rates.  It must be remembered that this measure will make landlords responsible for the rates, and the landlords, it will be found in most cases in the urban districts throughout the country, are the type who have a lot of slum property. I think it is a good idea to make these landlords responsible for the payment of rates and not be making other ratepayers in the towns who have no interest whatever in slums or other property pay rates for them.  If this measure is passed through the House and the rates are collected and paid to the local authority of which I am a member, that 1/3 in the £ would help us to finance a very nice housing scheme for the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I want to agree with some of the criticisms that have been expressed on the measure both by Deputy Corish and Deputy O'Kelly. I would remind the Minister with regard to Section 4 that prior to the passing of the 1898 Act the landlords were responsible for the payment of rates on all houses under a valuation of £4.  In order to meet that obligation the landlords in fixing the rent included the rates in the rent, and while it is true to say that many landlords, even after the passing of the '98 Act, continued to pay rates, many of them&mdash;I think I can safely say the majority of them&mdash;took advantage of the '98 Act and refused to pay rates but did not give any corresponding reduction in the rents.  If this section is put through as it stands <Col N="282" /> it will mean that many of the landlords will be getting two additions to the rent in order to meet the rates.  What Deputy Corish stated with regard to 1920 is I take it known to every member in the House who was either at that time or since a member of a local authority.  It was quite noticeable around 1920, when there were very drastic changes in the personnel of local authorities, that many of the landlords who had until then been agreeable to pay the rates refused to pay them, and the result was that the amount appearing under the head of irrecoverable rates steadily increased from year to year.</P>
    <P>One matter that I would like to get clear on&mdash;I am afraid I was not able to follow the Minister on it&mdash;is with reference to sub-section 4 of Section 4, which mentions the Increase of Rent and Mortagage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  I would like the Minister to deal with this point when replying: Are we to take it that a landlord will be entitled to add to the standard rent imposed, the amount of rates which he will have to pay, for the purposes of the Rent Restrictions Act&mdash;in other words, for the purposes of obtaining the percentage of the free bonus which is allowed under the Rent Restrictions Acts of 1923 and 1926? If that is so, this section would need to be re-drafted, because it is sufficient that the landlord should be allowed to increase the rent by the exact amount of the rates, and I do not think he should be allowed to make a profit on it.  While I personally do not wish to be unjust to landlords more than anybody else, I put it to the Minister and the House that landlords should not be allowed to increase rents twice over. If it can be shown that a landlord did not increase the rent in order to cover his obligation for the rates, he should be allowed to increase it now.  On the other hand, if it can be shown that a landlord some years ago increased the rent to meet his liabilities for the rates, he should not be allowed to increase it again now.  I hope the Minister will look into that point.</P>
    <P>I put it to Deputy O'Kelly that the position in the country is very different from that in Dublin city.  In Dublin I understand the rate collection is almost <Col N="283" /> one hundred per cent.  Unfortunately, that is not the position in the country. In some urban districts that I know of the rate collection varies from seventy to ninety per cent., and in very few cases is it as high as ninety-five.  Somebody has to make up the differnce.  Our point is that if the difference has to be made up, those who should make it up are the landlords who are drawing rents from slum property upon which they are making no outlay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. GOULDING Mr. GOULDING">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOULDING</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy O'Kelly that on the face of it this measure looks undemocratic. But, like Deputy Corish, I have had some experience of the difficulty of collecting rates on small dwellings in the country.  I think his estimate of the rate collection on small dwellings in country areas is too high. The Council with which I am connected have had time and again to strike off as irrecoverable a considerable amount of rates that could have been paid if the people were allowed to pay in small instalments.  Where I disagree with Deputy O'Kelly is that I would charitably assume that the Minister had no idea of being undemocratic when he introduced this measure.  If we are simply transferring the rates from the tenant to the owner, so as to make it easier for the tenant to pay the rates, it is the tenant who is all the time paying the rates, but in another form.  I know it would make it far easier for the councils concerned and their employees to collect the rate in this form.  I also know that the occupiers of small dwellings will welcome such a measure, because it is a comparatively simple thing for a person of small means to pay 2d. or 3d. a week, when he might find it extremely difficult to find a lump sum of 15s. or more.  For that reason I would be inclined to support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the rates on unoccupied dwellings, there is one very serious aspect, and that is, that in many cases farmers have bought farms other than the ones on which they reside.  On these farms very often there are fairly good dwellings that could be made habitable with very little repair.  As a result of the rating of unoccupied <Col N="284" /> dwellings the farmers have been compelled to reduce these buildings to ruin.  We are all aware of the terrible shortage of housing, especially for the labouring classes, and in this way we are practically compelling people to destroy houses.  That is one of the unfortunate results of the rating of unoccupied dwellings.  Some way should be discovered to prevent these people destroying houses which are so badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. G. WOLFE Mr. G. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seems to be a very simple one, but when you come to consider it, it seems to have a very confusing effect on the mind, and I am bound to say the speeches I have heard have confused me altogether. Before the Act of 1898 was passed landlords, I believe, paid the rates on dwellings under £4 valuation.  That Act provided that the occupiers should pay, no matter how small the valuation, no doubt with the idea that Deputy O'Kelly has put forward, of spreading the responsibility down from the top to the bottom.  The idea was, no doubt, extremely good, but, as far as I can understand, it has not worked in a great many country districts. There has been very great difficulty in getting rates from the small occupiers. A great many rate collectors complain bitterly about it.  A large number of property owners have been paying the rates from the very beginning on the houses, whether occupied or not, in order to save themselves trouble, as they did not think it worth while to fight the matter.  Of course, circumstances have possibly changed, and it is necessary apparently that some alteration should be made.  If there is an alteration made, it is right, if the landlord has to pay the rates, that he should be allowed to add a certain extra proportion in the cases where the tenants have been paying.  It is not easy to understand the matter, but as the discussion proceeds perhaps we will understand it better.  I think the payment of the rates by the landlord is the simplest way, although I agree that it is not the most democratic way. But you cannot always get perfection, and it is the way of least resistance. However, I think the matter will have to be considered in more detail on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points that I would like the Minister to make clear.  The definition of the expression, &ldquo;small dwelling&rdquo; in the second paragraph, Section 1, is &ldquo;a hereditament or tenement separately valued under the Valuation Acts, whereof the valuation under those Acts does not exceed £6 and the whole, or any part of which is actually used or is adapted for use as a dwelling.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister what does the expression &ldquo;separately valued&rdquo; mean.  Does it mean a building that is held by a tenant by itself or does it mean a building that is held jointly with a small holding of land?  Because, upon the demand notes, buildings are valued separately and a rate is struck on the building and a rate is struck on the land.  If it is the intention to include the rates on the land it will cut out a lot of small people.  If it is intended that the rates on the land should be included we want to know to what extent.  We know that on some of the buildings attached to farms of one, two, three or perhaps twenty acres, the valuation would not exceed perhaps £3 or £4.  Would such buildings as these be included under the term &ldquo;small dwellings&rdquo; as defined in the Section?</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I know it will facilitate local authorities in the collection of rates.  I also know that the people who live in these small holdings would be only too willing to pay their rates weekly instead of having to pay half yearly, when they would have to meet perhaps a demand of anything from ten to twenty or thirty shillings.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill, and I believe it will be welcomed by all the small holders in the country.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister upon the clarity he displayed in introducing this particular Bill.  The Bill has received general welcome, and I think it is a very good thing indeed for those concerned that the owners for the future will be liable for the payment of rates instead of the occupiers. I do not agree with Deputy O'Kelly that the Bill is undemocratic.  I do not think any member of this House should <Col N="286" /> encourage any section of the people to avoid the payment of rates, especially in view of the fact that those who do not pay rates escape at the cost of the people who do.  The only section of the Bill to which I wish to refer is Section 6.  I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy O'Kelly's argument adduced on that particular section.  I believe that some restriction as to amount of relief given in respect of unoccupied premises should be inserted in the Bill.  In transferring the liability for rates from one owner to another, the Minister has been careful to insert in the Bill a time limit.  But in the case of giving relief for unoccupied premises, no such time limit appears.</P>
      <P>My experience of country districts is not very great, but one Deputy has told us, and the statement remains unchallenged, that owners in the country have allowed houses to fall into disuse for, I presume, the reason that they were looking for higher rents.  Speaking with some little knowledge of the question in Dublin, I do feel that landlords have availed themselves to an extent to which they are not entitled of the relief of unoccupied premises. In Dublin, I know of my own knowledge, houses remained unoccupied for periods as long as three years, because the landlords or owners of these premises demanded extortionate rents. The city of Dublin is losing something like £12,000, and that figure is almost static.  If unoccupied premises which are referred to only in one particular clause were let at a reasonable rent there would be immediate relief in the rates by 2d. in the £.  If it was thought well to set a time limit for the liability to rates in the cases of various owners of property, I do appeal to the Minister to take into view the fact that there should also be a time limit as to the amount of relief to which any owner of property should be entitled and I respectfully suggest to him that he should fix that time limit at six or twelve months, but certainly some time limit should be inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I rise to challenge the statement made by Deputy Goulding, and I challenge it on behalf of the rural districts.  Everybody knows that <Col N="287" /> owners cannot find tenants for the big houses in the country because the cost of upkeep of these houses would be too great, and because these houses are removed from the direct channel of rail communication and from the towns. You cannot find a tenant for this class of house no matter what you do.  When the Deputy suggested that some farmers have two farms and let down their houses because they cannot find tenants, he is either misinformed or he has made a vindictive statement which is also untrue.  The suggestion is, why not let the house inside the farmyard to a labourer.  That could not be done. You do not want a labourer who is not working for you on an out-farm when you cannot dispossess him.</P>

      <P>I do not think that this Bill is so undemocratic when one examines it closely as it may seem at first sight.  The occupiers of those small holdings do not appear to be deprived of any of their civic rights.  A large percentage of rates on holdings under £6 valuation have proved to be irrecoverable. These houses are occupied very largely by the poorest section of the community, who cannot really afford to pay rates at all, and who certainly cannot afford to pay the rates in a lump sum.  I think if they are able to contribute towards the rates at all that the contribution collected weekly by the landlord will be the form of contribution that will be most suitable. Under the Bill the landlord will, of course, have power to increase his rent by an amount corresponding, roughly, to the rates but I certainly think that, while he will have power to increase the rent, he will not get an increase equivalent to the amount of the rates for the reason that he cannot in many cases recover the present rent without any increase at all.  The actual effect of the Bill will be that rates that are irrecoverable at the present time will <Col N="289" /> become recoverable, and as a result the rates on the general ratepaying community will, to that extent, be reduced. I do not think that on close examination it can be found to be a very undemocratic principle to transfer this liability for the rates from the small occupier to the landlord.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this debate will be very brief. I welcome this Bill, and I welcome the coming to light of the Minister and his Government.  I put forward a similar proposal in my Town Tenants Bill, which they thought fit to reject.  I did not perhaps go quite as far as the Minister, because I placed the limit under £5, and here it has been advanced to £6.  I think that the principle is a good one, and one that should be supported from all sides of the House. Undoubtedly if the rent is raised&mdash;and I presume in most cases it will be&mdash; owing to the payment of rates by the landlord, no tenant will like to have what he considers his rent raised. Would the Minister consider the advisability of segregating in some way or other. for the information of the <Col N="290" /> tenant or occupier, the amount that he will be asked to pay in rent and the amount that will be due to the repayment or recoupment of the rates paid by the landlord.  I think that would be a good thing from the point of view of making the tenant see that his rent is not actually being increased, but that the increase is due to the rates having been paid by the landlord.</P>

      <P>I quite realise that this method of collecting the rate will benefit town tenants, but I would like to see the landlord made solely responsible for separate charges,&mdash;that is, for water rents and cemetery charges, so that no portion of the amount should be charged to the tenant.  With respect to labourers' cottages, the rates will have to be paid by the county board of health.  I should like to know before we pass the Bill if it is the Minister's intention to bring in a Bill to sell these labourers' cottages to the tenants.  I would like to see the rates charged on unoccupied houses.  Houses are left unoccupied by landlords to get high rents, and I think it would be a good thing if the rates were charged on them and the landlords made responsible.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Corish's point, as I said, the £6 is selected for discussion as being a figure that is rather too low than too high.  I have come to the conclusion that £6 is the better figure, the arrangement here being rather experimental. But in county boroughs I admit that we could, perhaps, go further.  However, if the Deputy is prepared to support this figure of £8 by convincing arguments we will see how far we can go to meet him.  As far as the labourers' cottages are concerned, I think the provisions of the Bill will be such that the county board of health will take the rates weekly or monthly, or according to whatever arrangement is made, from the tenants in the same way as it is contemplated that they will be taken from the general small dwellings holders.  With regard to the rent, remember that we are dealing here with small dwellings, that they all come under the operation of the Rent Restrictions Act, and that <Col N="291" /> under the Rent Restrictions Act of 1923 there is a definite way of determining what the standard rent is.  The small-holders are protected by the Increase of Rent and Mortgage (Interest Restriction) Act, 1923, with regard to their standard rent.  Certain increases over a previous rent or over the original rent are allowed under the Act of 1923 when making up the standard rent, and one of these increases allowed is an amount not exceeding the amount for the time being payable by the landlord in respect of the rates charged and which, but for certain provisions, would be chargeable to the occupier.</P>
      <P>In estimating the standard or the basic rent for the purposes of this Bill, we expressly prevent the landlord from making that increase, so that there is no possibility of the landlord charging a rent which will include this increase in respect of rates and will include the increase which is the future annual rates as well.  Whether I have been able to make it clear by this explanation or not, the fact is that the tenant cannot be made responsible for two sets of rates, but he can and will be made responsible for the rates of the future, because Section 4, sub-section (3) makes any arrangement between the tenant and the owner to the effect that the tenant will not be charged rates void in law.  So that, in so far as we are able to do it by law, we are making clear the principle, No. 1, that we referred to, that is, that people who elect representatives to local bodies will bear the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>

If X is the amount of the contract rent, he will pay it plus 6d. a week one year, or X plus 5d. a week next year.  The amount of the addition to his contract rent will <Col N="292" /> be fluctuating according as the rate in that particular area fluctuates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

      <P>The debate is being concluded by the Minister. Perhaps Deputy Corish would sit down.  It is the practice on the Second Reading to allow questions, but I am afraid these questions will not be easily solved, particularly if the President and Deputy Corish intervene.  Perhaps, as the matter concerns a particular section of the Bill, the point is really one for Committee, and it can be raised in Committee on the section as between the Deputy and the Minister, and the Deputy will have given more thought to it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of unoccupied houses, that position also is covered by the Rent Restrictions Act of 1923, Section 16 as modified by the Rent Restrictions Act, 1926, Section 9, and I do not think that the objections that have been taken to it are well grounded.  The difference existing, apparently, between urban and rural interests will have to be fought out on Committee Stage.  As to the question raised by Deputy Holt with regard to selling labourers' cottages, I think that is another matter that might be considered some other time.  There is one other point to which I will refer, and that is that Deputy Byrne suggests that there is a limit of liability for the payment of rates. Where an owner responsible for paying the rates did not pay them, and a subsequent owner enters on the property, that subsequent owner is liable for the outstanding rates, but there is a limit of two years in respect of that subsequent owner.  In respect of a person who is the actual owner, if he avoids paying rates for two years or more, that does not mean that he is not liable.  It is a continuing liability. Deputy Colohan raised a question about land together with buildings.  If there is a case in which there is a cottage value for £4 and land valued for £3, the valuation is £7 altogether, and that would not be a small dwelling within the terms of this Bill.  But if the cottage is valued at £2 10s. Od. and the land at £3, that brings that land and cottage within the terms of this Bill.</P>

      <P>18c. In page 10, Section 28, line 62, before sub-section 2, to insert 6 new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The first examination under this section shall be prescribed and held after the expiration of five months and before the expiration of six months from the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>(3) Any of the persons named in the Second Schedule may (unless he has aready passed an examination prescribed and held under this section) demand that such an examination be held, and may make such demand at any time after the holding of the first such examination and not less than one month before the expiration of two years from the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>(4) Whenever an examination is demanded under this section an examination shall be prescribed and held under this section as soon thereafter as conveniently may be, or where an examination has been held under this section within six months before such demand, at the expiration of such six months and public notice of such examination shall be given and every one of the persons named in the Second Schedule to this Act shall be entitled to attend and be examined at such examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) Before the establishment of the Board a demand for an examination under this section shall be made in writing to the Minister, and <Col N="295" /> after the establishment of the Board, such a demand shall be made in writing to the Board.</P>
    <P>(6) Before the establishment of the Board every examination to be prescribed and held under this section shall be prescribed and held by the Minister, and after the establishment of the Board every such examination shall be prescribed and held by the Board.</P>
    <P>(7) Nothing in this Act shall operate to prohibit any of the persons named in the Second Schedule to this Act from practising or representing himself or holding himself out as practising or prepared to practise dentistry or dental surgery during the period between the passing of this Act and the publication of the results of the first examination held under this Section.</P>
    <P>We have come to certain agreement with regard to amendments 18 and 19, and in order to get the force of the agreement properly before the House I suggested that we should report progress last night, and I now suggest the amendments, typescript copies of which have been circulated in the House, in order to meet what was put forward last night.  The effect of the insertion of these amendments in the sub-section and the deletion of certain words brings about this position, that the period within which the persons mentioned in the Third Schedule must take out examinations has been reduced from 7 years to 2; that those on the Second Schedule are allowed to continue in practice without taking any examinations for a period of six months after the passing of the Act, and that the examination must be held not earlier than five and not later than six months.  Those who succeed at that examination, of course, go on the register and those who do not succeed go out of practice&mdash;go off the register&mdash; but may attend such examinations as are held up to an extreme period of 2 years after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>The new sub-sections (3), (4), (5) and (6) are to give these people the right to demand an examination within the six months' period and every six months after that up to two years.</P>

    <P>(4)  A person whose name has been erased from the register under this section may be restored to the register by order of the High Court under this Act or at any time by special direction of the Board given with the consent of the Medical Council but not otherwise, and when a person is so restored to the register by the Board the Board may with the consent of the Medical Council attach such conditions (including the payment of a fee not exceeding the fee which would be payable by such person for registration if he was then being registered for the first time) as the Board with the approval of the Medical Council thinks fit.</P>

    <P>These amendments were, I think, first moved by Deputy Ryan in Committee, but I asked that they should be held over in order to give me an opportunity of discovering whether there was any reason for having the Medical Council brought in instead of giving the Dental Board the right over penal cases.  I have not been able to make much in the way of investigation, but any investigation which I have made led me to believe that there is no reason why the Medical Council should be brought into the Dental Board's procedure, any more than they will be represented by three Medical Council representatives on the Board.  I am moving these amendments to do what Deputy Ryan proposed to do in Committee.  It will mean that so far as penal cases are concerned the Dental Board is given full right over its members subject to appeal to the Courts which is brought in in a further section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will not press his amendment. I do not think it is important.  In fact, I think it is quite the reverse.  I wonder whether the Minister has consulted the Medical Council before bringing it forward.  From any information which has come to me, I am inclined to think that they would not approve if they were consulted.  I think the objection largely lies in this: namely, that what we want to secure between the two bodies is the very closest co-operation. I have looked back to see what was said about the amendment in Committee, and I found that Deputy Ryan did not seem very keen on it.  He said that he put it forward for consideration and did not wish to press it, but asked the Minister to consider the point.  I think it was well worth consideration.  The worst that could be said about the procedure outlined in the Bill is that it is a little cumbrous, but experience shows that where it has been cumbrous it has not been without its use.  We should take advantage of experience gained by the working across the water between the General Medical Council and the Dental Board there.  The experience there has been to show that the procedure outlined here in the Bill is advantageous <Col N="299" /> and I urge the Minister to retain it.  The effect of his suggestion would be to set up more and more closed compartments within the medical profession and the dental profession, and the only link between the two would be the representation on the Dental Board of the three Medical Council representatives.  Anything we can do to put the two bodies into the closest contact would be of great advantage. I strongly advocate the retention of the procedure originally outlined by the Minister which appears in the body of the Bill and which went through the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Thrift.  I do not think this suggestion is a good one.  It is not a matter on which I feel very strongly, but I think that the amendment will not have the effect of maintaining good feeling between the dental and medical professions.  The Medical Council are in closer touch with what is regarded as misconduct in a professional sense, and if the amendment is carried it will leave the Dental Board the power to order the erasure of the name of a man guilty of misconduct from the register instead of allowing the report to go forward to the Medical Council and allowing that Council to make the order. There is not much difference between the two, but experience has shown that the Medical Council has much more experience in these matters, and it will relieve the Dental Board of a certain amount of responsibility by being able to send on the report to the Medical Council, who will be more in touch with what is regarded as professional misconduct. If the Minister's further amendment is carried limiting the practice of dentistry so far as doctors are concerned, these doctors will be practising dentistry only inasmuch as it applies to their professional work and if they do not conform to the law&mdash;and no one knows what that is&mdash;they will be tried by the Dental Board and to that I have the greatest objection.  I think the Minister is making a mistake in interfering with the supervision by the Medical Council over the Dental Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument we have been listening to has proceeded <Col N="300" /> on the basis that dentists are an inferior type as compared with doctors. Deputy Sir James Craig states that it would be to the benefit of the dentists to be relieved of responsibility.  That is putting them in a childish position, and regarding them as doctors not come to maturity.  I do not think that is the proper way of looking at this question.  Deputy Sir James Craig has suggested that for the sake of uniformity the Medical Council should be asked to decide when it comes to a question of striking a dentist off the register, but it might be equally said that for the sake of securing uniformity the Dental Board should be asked to decide when it comes to a question of striking a medical man off the medical register.  We are setting out on a new line.  We have with regard to the Medical Council a new system, that is to say that professional misconduct and matters of that sort will in the first instance be diagnosed and pronounced upon by the Medical Council, but there is an appeal to the court.  Similarly, with regard to dentistry, in England a question of professional misconduct pronounced upon by the Dental Board can be made the subject of appeal to the courts.  In the end these courts will give uniformity.  If a case of professional misconduct is brought before the Dental Board and a decision is arrived at to strike a name off, and that is appealed, the Medical Council are going to take note of that, because the system of professional etiquette would be much the same in one case as in the other.  It is a matter for the House to decide.  I do not see that any case has been made proving that dentists are not capable of deciding on a matter of misconduct within their ranks.  I think they should be burdened with responsibility in this matter and asked to act up to it.  Three representatives of the Medical Council are on the Dental Board.  We have a Council that for the first five years will consist of ten people.  Three of these will represent the Medical Council.  I think that gives sufficient guarantee there is not going to be any wide divergence between the Dental Board and the Medical Council. I do not feel strongly about the amendment, or the words I am moving to delete and that Deputy Dr. Ryan <Col N="301" /> moved in the first instance.  I am sorry he is not here to go in more detail into the arguments he used in the Committee Stage.  Any investigation I have made in the meantime, and it has been little, has brought me to the point of agreeing with Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the statement that dentists are quite capable of taking charge of dental affairs.  They are more conversant with the details of any complaints that would arise than medical men <Col N="302" /> would be.  Medical men have been adjudicating on matters relating to the medical profession, but the Dental Council will have to consider matters of a different kind.  I think it should be dentists for dentists in the matter of control.  There will be three representatives of the Medical Council. Although dentists are only a branch of the medical profession, they are quite capable of taking charge of that branch in a manner becoming to their profession and with satisfaction to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to be a matter of first-class importance to prevent a decision on any matter being arrived at by these two Boards which would be made a matter of appeal.  It is because of that I would urge the withdrawal of the amendment, and I would vote against it.  This procedure does not involve any inferiority in the case of dentists as compared with doctors, because I regard dentists purely as a section of the general branch, as Deputy Sir James Craig says.  What I want to secure is that there shall be the closest kind of co-operation between the two Boards, and that there should not be a tendency to split, and giving one a separate jurisdiction entirely away from the other.</P>

      <P>25.  In page 16, Section 45, to delete sub-section (1), lines 37 to 42, and substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Save as is otherwise provided in this section, it shall not be lawful for any person to practise or to represent or hold himself out, whether directly or by implication, as practising or being prepared to practise dentistry or dental surgery unless such person is a registered dentist or is a duly qualified medical practitioner who was so qualified at the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>26.  In page 16, Section 45, before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section a duly qualified medical practitioner who becomes so qualified after the passing of this Act may practise dentistry and dental surgery to such an extent as is incidental to his practice as a medical practitioner but shall not practise or represent or hold himself out, whether directly or by implication, as practising or prepared to practise dentistry or dental surgery further or or otherwise than as incidental to his practice as a medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>28.  In page 16, Section 45 (2), line 43, to delete the words &ldquo;The provisions of the foregoing sub-section&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>29.  In page 16. Section 45 (2), to delete lines 45, 46 and 47.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of these four amendments, number 26 is the important and vital one.  It will be remembered that when this Bill came before the Committee the provision in what is now Section 45 was that only qualified medical practitioners <Col N="306" /> who were qualified medical practitioners on the date of the passing of the Act could continue to practise dental surgery.  There were varieties of amendments brought forward to extend that provision.  After a considerable amount of debate it was agreed that an amendment which was on the paper should be accepted as a ground for argument for the Report Stage.  That amendment changed the Bill as brought in to this point: it left it that any registered medical practitioner, whether qualified before or after the passing of the Act, could continue to practise dentistry although he could not for the future hold himself out as a dental surgeon.  I entered certain objections to that, and in the end it was agreed that an amendment should be considered to limit that full freedom with regard to dentistry which was being given to registered medical practitioners under the amendment which appears now embodied in the text of the Bill.  I propose to limit what is in the Bill by amendment 26.</P>
    <P>Amendment 25 restores the old position with regard to people who are qualified at the passing of the Act. That re-establishes the rights which qualified medicals had prior to this Bill being introduced.  I want to limit the matter, and the limitation is in amendment 26.  That amendment meets the one case of hardship that was put up in this House on the Committee Stage. that case being attendance on the poor where one was faced with the dilemma that a duly qualified dentist would have to be appointed just the same as there are qualified medical men appointed to hospitals and unions, or else a medical man would have to be allowed to continue as a dentist.  This meets the case. It allows qualified medical men to practise dentistry such as is incidental to their medical practice and not otherwise, and forbids a medical man qualified after the passing of the Act to hold himself out as a dental surgeon ready to practise dentistry.  I think the amendment meets the only case of hardship put up, and at the same time does not give the complete freedom given in the amendment accepted as a basis for discussion.  I still hold that if there is going to be a separate dental class, then there should not be this <Col N="307" /> permission given to registered medical practitioners to practise dentistry, to hold themselves out as likely to practise dentistry or engage in it.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose this amendment.  It appears to me to be very little different from the original section in the Bill.  It is more carefully worded, if you like, and it appears in language that does not strike one as being just as objectionable, but the principle is the same.  By these two amendments, if accepted, doctors who become qualified after the passing of this Bill into law will not be allowed to hold themselves out as being competent to practise dentistry, only in so far as it is incidental to their ordinary medical practice.  That is the language of the section.  The question will arise: who is to decide when the practise of dentistry becomes incidental to a man's practice as a medical man?  Apparently in future a doctor will be liable to be brought into court to have it decided whether a certain dental operation that doctor has performed is incidental to his ordinary practice.  If a doctor becomes specially skilled in surgery of the mouth, if he should have a well-developed bump for dentistry and takes up this particular branch of surgical science and becomes a specialist, he will be liable to prosecution if the Minister's amendment is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of only two doctors in Ireland who practise dentistry as such and have chosen this particular branch of medical science as their forte.  But the fact that it has not been universally practised by the doctors who take up this particular branch of medical science is not a reason why doctors in the future should be debarred by law from taking up this branch.  To my mind it is an insult to the medical profession to prevent future specialisation in this any more than in the other.  If you like, it is a highly specialised branch of medical science.  That will be granted at once.  But surgery of the eye and ear and surgery of the throat, surgery of the brain, abdominal surgery, gynecological surgery and bone surgery are all highly specialised branches of medical science.  There is nothing in the law as it stands at present, nor, as I hope, in the future, that <Col N="308" /> will debar a medical man from taking up any of these branches of medical science and becoming a specialist in it and placing his services and talents at the disposal of humanity for the relief of their ills.  I do not think it will be argued that any process of dental surgery requires as high a degree of technical skill as is required by a surgeon who removes diseased vertebrae out of the spinal column and transplants there a piece of bone from the shin.  That requires a high degree of skill and a knowledge of surgical science higher than any process that the dental surgeon would be called upon to carry out. And yet if bone surgery were to be protected as dental surgery has to be protected under this Bill, a medical man could not apparently take up this branch.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the reciprocity side of it in the various stages of this Bill, and I am beginning to wonder how is that reciprocity going to work out if these amendments are passed.  A doctor who takes out his degrees in the capital of Ulster at the present time and who practises in that area is practically free under the British Dental Act to practise dentistry. But if he should become, let us suppose, highly skilled as a dentist, practising in that part of Ireland, and if we should require his services in the Sovereign State, and if he comes across the Border to place his services at our disposal, no matter what degree of professional excellence he may have reached, he will be liable to a prosecution.</P>
    <P>I do not know, but the Minister will probably be able to explain, how the reciprocity will work in such a case as that, but I venture to suggest that his Majesty's Government would take steps to protect his Majesty's subjects in that part of Ireland in such an eventuality.  I think it is not in the interests of the dental profession or of this branch of medical science that the Minister should push this amendment, because friction is bound to arise between these two branches of the medical profession, between the parent body and one of its offsprings if you like. Such friction will not be to the benefit either of the dental or medical profession.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy Ward in his protest against this amendment.  On the first day that this Bill was debated here I pointed out that a case of urgency was one which the doctor would have to decide there and then.  I cannot, I candidly confess, see much difference between &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; and &ldquo;incidental to his practise as a medical practitioner.&rdquo;  Take, for instance, the case of a person who comes to a dispensary in the country suffering, say, from rheumatoid arthritis or chronic rheumatism.  In any of these cases the first thing the doctor would naturally do would be to look at the person's mouth to see what sort of teeth he had.  In most cases there is what is commonly known as pyorrhea as an accompaniment.  Will the Minister tell us if the treatment of pyorrhea is dentistry or &ldquo;incidental to his practice as a medical practitioner&rdquo;? To my mind, the Minister would have to issue a list of what is dentistry and what is medicine or surgery. He would have to issue such a list or else the doctors in the country will not know what to do.  They will render themselves liable to a prosecution if they do things in contravention of this Act.  They will not know what is in contravention of the Act, and will want to know what is dentistry and what diseases are &ldquo;incidental to their practice as medical practitioners.&rdquo;  I think, except that this amendment is more carefully worded, that it is simply reverting to the old section to which such great objection was shown when the Bill was introduced.  It is just another way of putting the old section back into the Bill.  I object and protest against that.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with the last two Deputies.  I think these amendments are just as objectionable as the original suggestion that appeared in the Bill.  I think there is just as much objection to, and as great a difficulty of knowing, what is intended by the words that are now suggested as there was before.  When you take the phrase &ldquo;dental surgery&rdquo; or &ldquo;incidental to his practice as a medical practitioner,&rdquo; it would be utterly impossible, as the last Deputy pointed out, in many cases to say <Col N="310" /> whether a certain thing came under the category of dental surgery or whether it did not.  Take, for example, certain cysts in the mouth.  I am informed by those who know that, though they are often treated by dentists, in many cases they should not be treated by dentists at all.  They really come under the wider term of surgery, and yet they might be considered as covered by the term dentistry.  Neither can anyone say what is covered by the term &ldquo;incidental to his practice as a medical practitioner.&rdquo;  Neither do I agree with the Minister that the omission of these words would interfere with the poor man's dentist.  I do not think so. I do not think he would argue, clever as he is in his argument, that it is incidental to a doctor's practice in his dispensary that he should be obliged to treat cases of dentistry that come to him.</P>
      <P>The effect of the original suggestion in the Bill and of the amendments before us is to protect dentists against doctors, because the Bill gives dentists a protection which doctors have not got.  It becomes a legal and a punishable offence for anyone to practise dentistry in the future with few exceptions. There is no such kind of protection given on behalf of doctors.  Beyond giving a medical certificate, anybody can practise medicine provided he is prepared to take the consequences of his ill-success.  That will not be possible in the case of dentists in the future, and the result is that the dentists will be better protected than the doctor.  If the amendment before the House is accepted, dentists will be protected against doctors.  I agree with what has been said by the previous Deputies with regard to reciprocity. These amendments would make reciprocity cease to be reciprocity.  Anyone qualifying in Ulster, for example, could as a doctor go there, and he would be put in quite a different position with reference to his rights and privileges to one qualifying in the Free State.  I do not think that the argument that has been put up in support of the amendment is quite adequate.  I agree with what has been said by Deputy Ward, and I am prepared to oppose these amendments as strongly as I can.</P>

      <P>I find it very hard to oppose the pleas made by Deputy O'Dowd and Deputy Ward, who, in this matter, are following the precedent set in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, because I am sure they would not have made such pleas without some very strong reasons indeed.  It seems to me that their arguments and the arguments they used in opposing the previous amendment, rest on the basic assertion that dentistry is a branch of the medical profession.  Is that so or is it not?  Historically, I do not know whether Hippocrates practised dentistry, but coming down through the centuries there is no doubt that both dentistry and medicine had a common ancestor.  I hope that I shall not offend Deputies who are qualified doctors when I say that their common ancestor was the barber surgeon, who cut your hair, pulled your teeth, and, if required, let blood.  He still cuts your hair, but he has relinquished the other practices. The doctor got away first, but for a long time he continued to pull teeth as well as cut hair.  At any rate, both branches had a common ancestor. Deputy Ward talked about the parent body and referred to dentistry as one of its offsprings.  I think this is a case of a brother and sister and not of a father and son.  The brother in this case does seem to me to be somewhat ill-advised if he attempts to control the movements of his sister.  If it is a case of dentistry being a branch of the medical profession, how does that work out in practice?  I want some enlightenment. The professions of barrister and of solicitor are, as we know, both branches of the legal profession, but it is easier for a solicitor to become a barrister than it is for a layman to become a barrister.  Certain facilities are given to solicitors to become barristers, and I believe barristers sometimes&mdash;I will not say sink&mdash;transfer their activities to the other field and become solicitors.  It is possible for a member of either branch of the legal profession to become a member of the other branch much more easily than it would be for a layman. Is that the case as regards dentists? Can a dentist become a doctor more easily than a layman?  Do his qualifications in the dentistry branch of the medical profession entitle to admit <Col N="312" /> him more easily to the parent branch? As far as I know, that is not the case. On the other hand, it is not only illegal, but it is unusual for a dentist even to administer an anæsthetic.  If he does it he runs a certain risk.  Should anything happen to the patient while under the anæsthetic&mdash;should the patient die&mdash;he may be unable to get a doctor's certificate as to the cause of death.  I may be wrong on these points.  I have only the knowledge of a layman and am hoping to get some information.</P>

What I want to be assured of from the Minister is: is he quite sure that the restriction which this amendment appears to place on doctors in country areas will not interfere with the simple, easy and rapid treatment necessary in simple cases of the sick poor?  It is a very much more important question.  There is no difficulty when you are dealing with a town population or the population of big cities, where there are plenty doctors and plenty practising dentists.  I can see a real difficulty in areas like these country districts.  I know places where there are really no qualified dentists at all and no likelihood of there being qualified dentists, and where the only alternative before a person who is suffering, or who is in any way in need of dental treatment, is either to get the treatment from the dispensary doctor <Col N="314" /> or else have recourse to the old-fashioned remedy of the string and the jamb of the door.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Cooper I want to say that a dentist can become a doctor more easily than a layman.  When he is going through his curriculum he has to take precisely the same subjects for two years as a doctor.  It is with very much pleasure that I recall when I was studying for the dental profession taking out my lectures under Deputy Sir James Craig&mdash;the very same lectures which medical students attend.  The same lectures are given in surgery, physiology and pathology.  Deputy Cooper also asks what does an ordinary dentist know of some of the specialised subjects in medicine and surgery.  He knows as much about it as an ordinary pass doctor.  The Deputy wants to know what special training or what practice a dentist has before he is allowed to practise.  He has the same training any surgeon or physician receives. A throat and nose specialist receives the very same training, but he afterwards specialises in diseases of the throat and nose.  Even the dental profession is now specialising in particular branches.  There is a branch of dental work called orthodontia.  Some men practising dentistry do not attend to any branch of the profession except this branch.  There was a case recently <Col N="315" /> where a practitioner found that he could, by constructing appliances with springs and wires, make a person suffering from a deformity of the mouth presentable.  A dentist who wishes to qualify as a doctor is allowed for the subjects in which he has already qualified.  The course is a four years' course, but it is not strictly a four years' course.  It is a four years period, but two of these years are given over to strictly medical and surgical subjects.</P>

      <P>I think this Bill was considered at least three times on Second Reading, and on each occasion I pointed out that this was the one serious blot on the Bill&mdash;this limitation that is placed upon medical practitioners. I want to answer one or two questions put by Deputy Cooper.  In the first place, I want to tell him that a barber can still practise medicine and surgery if he wishes.  There is no protection whatever for the medical profession. Dentists have now got protection against a layman practising dentistry, and in this amendment they seek protection against medical practitioners. I have objected all through to the contention that dentists are not a branch of the medical and surgical profession.  I say that it is quite unfair when the medical profession have no protection against anybody that the dentist should be given not only protection against laymen, but against their parent or sister profession, whatever you like to call it.  As to the next point raised by Deputy Cooper, I may say that in the general hospitals we have a dental department attended by a qualified dentist who teaches all our students the elementary principles of dentistry.  I do not say that they get the training which the students of the Dental Hospital receive, but I do not want them to get that training.  Nor do I put forward the claim that medical practitioners should, as a general rule, practise dentistry. But I object to the principle involved in this, that there should be protection for the dentists against the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point has been dealt with sufficiently fully, namely, that there should be no limitation of the practice of a doctor as far as dispensaries are concerned.  As was pointed out on a previous occasion, in many parts of the <Col N="317" /> country there are areas thirty miles in extent in which no dentist practises, and when a poor man wants some dental work done he will have to get a day off, pay for a car or a train to travel thirty miles, and then pay a dentist to do the work that he might have got done free in the dispensary.  I want to say a word with regard to reciprocity. I know the Minister does not agree with me in this, but I am convinced there is substance in it.  Our students when qualified can place their names upon the General Register.  When they place their names upon that Register, there is no prohibition on them with regard to the practice of dentistry.</P>

On the other hand, if a graduate of an English or Northern University comes to practise here and puts his name upon the Irish Register, if the Minister's amendment is carried he will be debarred from doing what doctors are allowed to do on the other side.  I have been told that if the Minister's amendment is carried it will jeopardise the Bill altogether.  I merely put that forward for what it is worth.  I am not a lawyer and I do not know the meaning of these things, but I state the position as it appears to an ordinary layman.  The third point is the most important of all. Who is going to judge what is dental surgery to such an extent as is &ldquo;incidental to his practice as a medical practitioner?&rdquo; That is quite as absurd as the words I found fault with on a previous occasion.  If a doctor interferes in a case that dentists think he should not be allowed to interfere in, what is going to happen?  As I already pointed out, apparently the doctor is going to be hauled before the Dental Board to be dealt with.  I consider that is a most serious matter.  I would ask the Minister to be content to adopt what is contained in the English Act:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing in this Section shall operate to prevent the practice of dentistry by a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;  I ask him not to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to <Col N="318" /> emphasise the remarks of Deputy Sir J. Craig and other medical deputies who have spoken.  If the Minister persists in this amendment, the effect will be to limit the scope of the practice that may be undertaken by a medical practitioner. I regret that I must say that the passage of this Bill through this House has been made the occasion of making a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; in dentistry&mdash;of making special privileges for dentists. If a man wants to practise as an oculist, he has to take out the whole course of the medical curriculum.  He has to pass a comprehensive examination in medicine, surgery and midwifery, though he has no intention of practising in any of these branches.  I think he is all the better oculist because he has gone through all these courses, and the dentist would be all the better dentist if before he specialised in dentistry he had to take out a medical degree.  We know that dentists every day are giving local anaesthetics, if not general anaesthetics. No man should be allowed to give a local anaesthetic unless he knows everything about the physician's part of the work, and is able to examine a patient's heart in order to satisfy himself that a local anaesthetic would do the patient no harm.  I do not like to impute anything to the Minister, but I wonder is he carrying out the arrangement he made here on another occasion when we objected to anything in the Bill that would limit the scope of a medical practitioner's practice.  He introduced one amendment that preserves the rights of the existing doctors, but he denies that right to future doctors.  There is discrimination there.  If existing doctors are entitled to practise dentistry, there is no reason, except we are inclined to make a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; for dentists, why the doctors of the future should not do it. If the public would suffer by existing doctors being prevented from practising dentistry, they will suffer equally if those who are not yet qualified are prevented from practising dentistry.  I would appeal to the Minister to give this careful consideration, as I foresee endless trouble about it.  Now that he has constituted the Dental Council the sole administrative body in connection with the penal sections of the Bill, he should be careful not to raise the question <Col N="319" /> of what is medical practice and what is dental practice.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate with an unprejudiced mind, I must say I am deeply impressed with the arguments advanced by Deputy Tubridy and one or two other medical men who say that if the amendment is passed it will be practically impossible for dispensary doctors to do the ordinary dental work that they have been accustomed to do for the poor in the areas where dentists are few.  Taking that as a fact, I would say it would be wise for the Minister to reconsider his position upon this amendment.  If this is to mean that the poor are to be deprived of that necessary attention and assistance because of the fact that dentists are not as common and that there are no dental dispensaries as there are medical dispensaries, then we ought to hesitate and go very slowly indeed before depriving the poor of what they are in the habit of getting through dispensary doctors.  Taking the statements of those men primarily from the West of Ireland, and knowing that when they speak they speak of that with which they are familiar, I urge upon the Minister to reconsider this amendment.</P>

      <P>I listened to the arguments in this debate without any particular knowledge of the subject myself, and I feel compelled by what I heard to vote against the amendment. I should like to impress upon the Minister the desirability of putting forward some very strong arguments in favour of this amendment.  The case made against the amendment is something like this from the general point of view.  The object of the Bill is to protect the public from practitioners who have not got medical qualifications. The real danger to the public from unauthorised practitioners is that they may do things that may involve all kinds of danger from the medical point of view to patients, and that they may not be able to deal with those dangers when they arise.  Without the amendment this Bill provides very efficiently for such protection.  This amendment seems to go a great deal <Col N="320" /> further.  It seems to protect not only the public against people who have no medical qualifications but to go a long way towards protecting the dental profession against competition from a profession which is very often equally well qualified to deal with the case dentists have to deal with.  A great deal of dental practice is surely very simple in its nature and does not require any qualification from the practitioner except that he should know how far his work may endanger the general health of the patient.  It seems to me, from the point of view of the public, all that is required is protection against men who have no medical qualification.  This amendment goes too far in giving protection to the dental profession and setting up practically a monopoly against people qualified, to a large extent, for dealing with these disorders.</P>
      <P>It seems to me also that making that distinction that is made between doctors qualified at the passing of the Act and doctors who will be qualified after the passing of the Act is very arbitrary and unnecessary.  There is no virtue whatever inherent in doctors qualified before the passing of the Act that should put them in a favoured position in comparison with doctors qualified after the passing of the Act.  The only thing in favour of the amendment is that it gives dentists, as they would be constituted under the Bill, a kind of monopoly against the medical profession, a monopoly which is not in the slightest degree in the interest of any part of the public, and which is only in the interests of the small body of dental practitioners.  The public is not served by this amendment in the least. The public will be sufficiently protected if it is laid down that only those who have medical qualifications are allowed to engage in dental practice.</P>

      <P>If I may be allowed to speak again, I would like to dispel the idea that dentists have no medical or surgical qualifications.  They have to attend, not as dental, but as medical students, for one whole year at a general hospital, and during that time they see cases that have no relation whatever to dental surgery.  That is considered sufficient medical qualification to let them use a little more <Col N="321" /> than horse sense to enable them to do their work.  But the point is that they are examined in medicine and surgery after going through one year's course in the general hospital.</P>

      <P>The main argument used against this amendment and the whole point made is that it will be injurious to the sick poor.  With all respect to what Deputy O'Kelly said with regard to the views of Deputies Tubridy and O'Dowd, they may be very well qualified as medical men, but this is not a medical question or a dental question.  It is a question of the interpretation of a section of a Bill.  This section was brought in to meet the very sound objection raised in the Committee Stage.  It is the draftsman's best effort to put beyond the possibility of doubt that dispensary dental treatment by doctors is permissible and will be permissible in the future.  If that is not achieved, then the amendment can be altered and changed so as to make that possible and to put it beyond doubt.  This is the draftsman's best effort to see that that is the case.  I bring it forward in good faith in the way that it was given to me.  I regard that as settled, and if it is not settled, if the amendment does not meet the point, then it is a question of changing it in detail.  There is no intention of depriving the poor of the dispensary treatment they receive at the hands of doctors.</P>

      <P>And at the hands of the doctors of the future.  That is why the general phrase &ldquo;incidental to the practice of medicine&rdquo; is used.  That is expected to cover it, and it is believed that it does cover it.  The phrase is used specially and deliberately to cover that type of practice.  If it does not cover it let us see in what way it does not cover it, and let us have another formula that will meet the point.  I believe that my amendment is the best form of words available, and it was given to me in that way by the person selected to draft the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That for the sick poor.  As regards the reciprocity, it is a matter to argue. <Col N="322" /> I have one point of view, Deputy Sir James Craig obviously has another.  It is a matter that might have to be argued elsewhere, but at the moment I put forward this argument, that when we enter into a reciprocal agreement it does not mean that everything a doctor on the English Register did up to date, or anything such a doctor might do in the future, will be allowed to doctors in this country.  I can see&mdash;it is, possibly, not so far off&mdash;a date when certain types of work that are now classed as medical work might be considered in the peculiar ethical view of this country malpractices, and that doctors would be prohibited from and penalised for carrying on these malpractices in this country.  And because men who qualify in England can come over here as doctors and are allowed in England to continue, outside the arm of the law, to practise in that way, it does not mean at all that under the reciprocal arrangement we will allow them to do here everything that they are allowed to do in England.  All that we are bound to under the reciprocal agreement is that we make no distinction between an Irish qualified doctor and a man qualified in England in relation to practice in this country, and in return we demand that the Irishman, qualified here and going on the General Register in England, shall have all the rights and all the obligations that the medical man qualifying in England has for practice in England.  That is the beginning and end of the reciprocal argument.</P>
    <P>We may put many more limitations on doctors in this country than are on them at the moment, and we are not to be deterred from putting on these limitations simply because we have an agreement with England and because doctors qualifying in England may have different rights there.  As long as we have the same rules for everybody allowed to practise over here we keep to the reciprocal agreement.</P>
    <P>There are two or three points with regard to which there is confusion on this matter.  I am asked to define what is &ldquo;incidental to the practice of medicine.&rdquo; I do not propose to define it.  I will ask anybody to define and state a case for me as to what is &ldquo;dental surgery,&rdquo;<Col N="323" /> a much more difficult thing to define; and yet the whole basis on which this is built up is the practice of dental surgery.  Because I do not presume to be able to answer all the cases that may be put to me, are these things &ldquo;dental surgery&rdquo; or are they &ldquo;incidental to the practice of surgery,&rdquo; I do not think that is an argument against the amendment, and it is a false argument to say that it is going to be tested out eventually by prejudice in the case of the Dental Board. This will never come before the Dental Board; it will come before the courts. If anybody takes practice that is considered contrary to the Act there will be a case in the courts; someone will be brought up for unauthorised and illegal practice, the judges will have finally to determine, and only on a basis of judicial decision will there be ascertained the true meaning of &ldquo;dental surgery&rdquo; in the first place, and &ldquo;incidental to the practice of surgery&rdquo; in the second, as to whether a dentist ought to be a doctor, or as to whether a doctor ought to be a dentist, and how far they can easily interchange their professions.</P>
    <P>I am getting to the point that Deputy Tierney made.  It is quite right to say that a dentist may more easily become a doctor than a layman may. But why is it right to say that?  Simply because he has had two years of a particular type of education.  I might also say this, that a man who has taken a course in a secondary school, a course which entitles him to a matriculation examination, will find it easier to qualify as a dentist or a doctor than a man who has not taken that course. But I do not consider that courses leading to matriculation in this country are specialised, either for doctors or dentists.  The dentist has to do two years of a medical course.  From that one cannot derive the conclusion that medicine and dentistry are in the relation of parent and daughter sciences. By no means.  You can take that argument down to the primary school and say that a person who has been at a primary school is much more likely easily to qualify as a dentist or a doctor than a person who has not been to a primary school, but there is no argument <Col N="324" /> to be founded upon that.  Deputy Tierney goes more to the root of the matter.  He says that the main object of the Bill is to protect the public against unqualified or unauthorised men practising dentistry, and that, setting out with that object, it has gone far beyond it in trying to protect the public, not against unqualified men, but against doctors.  The doctors, from the point of view of specialised dentistry, are unqualified men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put this, in answer to any question: Would it be permissible for a dentist with two years' equivalent course to that of the medical man to be allowed to practise what Deputy Tierney has rightly described as a simple, light type of work in medicine?  I certainly think that the medical profession would object to that.  I do not think there would be much harm in it as long as you confined it to certain small things.  We are not going beyond the point at which Deputy Tierney said we aimed.  Take what will be in the Bill if the amendment passes.  The qualified doctor can do such dental surgery as is incidental to his practice. There are certain other limitations and there are certain other allowances. Where there are no registered dentists he can perform certain operations and carry out certain simple work, and the public is given all the service it ought to be given.  At the same time, the dentist who has specialised is set a little bit apart, and that is perfectly right when one considers the specialised course he goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ward has ventured into the region of prophecy.  It is doubtful if any law will contain distinctions between the general surgeon, the gynecological surgeon and the surgeon dealing with the eye.  Supposing Deputy Ward had been speaking a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago, he might have shuddered with horror at the idea of medical men not being able to deal with veterinary science, not being able to deal with every branch of what was then included in medical practice.  We are getting to the stage where certain things are <Col N="325" /> being considered more and more as specialised work, and we have long since arrived at the day when dentistry is regarded as a specialised type of work.  Dentists go through a specialised course and devote their lives to one limited field of work.  They go through a four years' course.  They have certain basic things to learn before they enter upon the specialised side of it, and if we keep to the point where the dentist and the doctor are supposed to be equal for all things, instead of bringing forward a Dentists Bill we should simply put certain things in a Medical Bill allowing for some break-away and allowing for something to be recognised as dental surgery, just as we recognise something that is called midwifery and something that is called medicine, apart from surgery.  But there are specialised classes; it is not now that these become specialised; it has taken place long since, and it is time that we had the whole matter properly regulated, as it is to be regulated by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy is doubtful if I have met what was promised on the Committee Stage.  I think I have fully met what was promised.  In fact, I am now trying to get from the House what the House promised me on the Committee Stage.  Deputy Hennessy, I think, alone on the Committee Stage, raised objection to any Dentists Bill whatever &mdash;at least he almost went so far as to say that it was a limitation of the large field that medical men previously occupied, and he almost went root and branch against the Dentists Bill, or at any rate he would weaken a Bill which was finally allowing every medical man to be a dentist in practice.  I never promised to meet that point of view. There was an amendment advanced <Col N="326" /> here which was accepted by the House simply to give us something better to base a further amendment on, and I was asked to bring forward amendments of a particular type.  At that time my mind was running on the anxiety of the medical men who wished to practise dentistry registering themselves as dentists and paying a fee for such registration.  On consideration it seemed to me that that was getting even to a worse stage than the amendment that was put in, and the best way to get out of the difficulty was to get such an amendment as would cover the case of the sick poor who have to be attended to in dispensary areas where one must recognise that they do not always have a dental man in attendance. An amendment has been brought forward to meet that, and it has not been shown to me that it does not meet that.  Somebody ought to show me some case and say whether it covers that case, or they should get an improved formula to cover it.  But this has been brought forward in the interests of the sick poor, and also to take away this very large power that was given to all medical men to engage in the practice of dentistry.  On that Deputy Ward, I think, complained of this amendment that it would, for the future, prevent a medical man holding himself out as ready to practise dentistry. It does not require an amendment to effect that.  The Bill as it stands prevents that.  As the Bill stands a doctor may engage in a certain type of dental practice, but he may not hold himself out as ready to practise dentistry. He may not call himself a dentist; he may simply take dental practice as and when it comes along, and that point should be recognised if Deputy Ward's point had any force in it.</P>

      <P>Before going into Committee and in order to avoid, if possible, intervention by the Chair during discussion, it might be well to point out that discussion on estimates is confined to the sums and to the items under which the sums are being actually asked for in the Estimates. It is not possible, in the discussion on supplementary or other estimates, to advocate new legislation, the amendment of existing legislation, <Col N="332" /> or to criticise existing statutes.  In the case of supplementary estimates only reasons for increase can be debated.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim bhreise ná raghaidh thar £1,800 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1928, chun Costaisí fén Representation of the People Act, 1918, fén Acht Timpeal Toghachán, 1923, agus fé Acht na gCoistí Dháréag (Leasú), 1924.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,800 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1928, for Expenses under the Representation of the People Act, 1918; the Electoral Act, 1923, and the Juries (Amendment) Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>This sum of £1,800 which is being asked for, arises out of transactions which took place in the year 1921-22. As Deputies may be aware, the expenses of registration under the Representation of the People Act, 1918, are payable by the county councils in the first instance.  These expenses include such matters as the expenses of secretaries or clerks to county or district councils, expenses of rate collectors, and printing and other expenses involved in the preparation of the register. One half of the expenses paid by the county councils was recouped out of voted moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accounts of the county councils were examined by the auditors for the Local Government Department and certified by them.  During 1921 and 1922 a number of councils refused to pay registration expenses.  In those cases the British Government deducted sums from the grants going to the local <Col N="333" /> authorities and paid the expenses. Subsequently the local authorities in most cases refunded the money that had been paid, and on their doing so the recoupment grants became payable to them, but in the case of four councils&mdash;Galway, Kildare, Mayo, and Tipperary North Riding&mdash;the matter was not settled until a few months ago. These councils have now made payments of the amounts paid on their behalf, and, consequently, the sums due on recoupment became payable at once.  The amounts payable to these counties are: Galway, £767 1s. 1d.; Kildare, £432 3s. 2d.; Mayo, £1,215 18s. 8d.; Tipperary North Riding, £369 5s. 4d.; the total amount being £2,784 8s. 3d.  As full provision had not been made for this contingency in the original estimates, it is necessary now to take this additional sum of £1,800 in order that these amounts may be paid to the county councils concerned.</P>

      <P>Estimates are prepared nearly 18 months before the end of the year to which they relate.  Estimates for the year 1927-28 were prepared in the departments in November, 1926.  They were then passed on to the Department of Finance, and discussions took place between that department and the departments preparing the estimates.  Finally, the estimates were printed and issued to the Dáil about the 1st March, but they were really prepared about 17 months before the end of the period to which they relate. All estimates are wrong to some extent. In certain cases we have excesses, and in other cases supplementary estimates have to be introduced.  Sometimes an entirely new type of charge arises, and although there may be enough of money to cover it, as it was not covered by any sub-head, a token estimate has to be introduced.  The object aimed at is not to ensure that there shall be no supplementary estimate, but rather to get an estimate as near as possible to the amount required, so as neither to have an excess or require a supplementary.  You cannot get close accuracy in estimates, as the period covered is too long and too many contingencies have to be taken into account.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £26,100 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for expenses of Criminal Prosecutions and other Law Charges, including a Grant in relief of certain expenses payable by Statute out of Local Rates.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D (Prosecutors, etc.) covers a variety of matters.  The expenses of prosecutors and of witnesses in certain cases of felony are chargeable on the local rates and the expenses in cases of larceny in the District Courts are also chargeable on the local rates. The expenses incurred by the police in the conveyance of prisoners are similarly chargeable.  Since 1859-1860 the practice has been to recoup the local authorities a great part of these expenses up to a limit not exceeding £14,000.  This sub-head also provides for the payment of the expenses of witnesses in Departmental prosecutions, the expenses of medical and expert witnesses and a number of minor expenses. The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the claims for recoupment by county councils.  A number of the county councils did not send in any claims for several years, and it was impossible to estimate the amount of these claims when the original estimate was being framed.  Claims had been received from Tipperary South Riding County Council and from the Kildare County Council.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head F (General Law Expenses) provision is made for the expenses of locked-up jurors, for jurors' luncheons, reports of judgments, defences of poor prisoners, the cost of the defence of certain pre-Truce prisoners; taxed costs awarded against the State, and other miscellaneous items.  The additional sum now required is chiefly due to the decision in the Wigg and Cochrane case, and the fact that a considerable number of actions have arisen out of that.  When the original estimate was being framed, <Col N="336" /> it could not be foreseen how the Wigg and Cochrane case would go, or that litigation such as we have experienced would arise out of it.</P>
    <P>The biggest sub-head in the Supplementary Estimate is the expense of litigation about the Dáil Funds.  This sum is required to meet the bill of costs of the American lawyers who appeared for the State in the American litigation about the Dáil Funds.  The total bill amounts to 150,000 dollars.  The litigation continued from July, 1922, to March, 1927.  The total cost to the Exchequer will be about £36,000.  The litigation ended, as Deputies are aware, in the appointment of receivers to divide the funds pro rata amongst the contributors.</P>

      <P>I suppose, in a general way, it is not too much to expect that there might be a discrepancy, such as is set out here, under sub-heads D and F in any one year.  However, out of a total estimate of £4,000 under sub-head F (General Law Expenses) to have to add £1,000, seems rather under-estimating to a greater extent than ought to be necessary, having regard to the experience of the last four or five years.  In the case of sub-head G (the expenses of litigation about the Dáil Funds), it is evident that the decision came as a surprise on the gentlemen opposite.  They estimated that the legal expenses they would have to pay would be £4,500.  Instead of that they have to pay, according to this estimate, £29,000.  If I understood the Minister for Finance correctly, up to some time in 1927 they have had to pay £36,000.  Does that estimate of £36,000 cover the whole expenses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'KELLY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the expenses up to date.  Well, that is a large sum.  It is a big sum of money for people like us to throw away, as was, in my opinion, done.  Not only was this money thrown away, but some millions of money, that could have been made available for purposes that are very urgently in need of money here at home, were practically thrown away.  Not alone have we had to pay £36,000, but a sum of over half a million pounds that could have done a world of good if spent in the <Col N="337" /> Gaeltacht, is lost to us.  The losing of that money is due solely to bad management, and to want of foresight on the part of the gentlemen who occupy the Government Benches.  If I remember rightly, some time early in 1925, having in mind the probability that something like what has happened would happen&mdash;that the decision that has been given or some decision of that kind would be given by the American courts&mdash;Deputy de Valera made an offer that so far as he and those he represented were concerned they would be glad to end the litigation and to end the expenses of the litigation, and to use their influence to get that half-million of money, roughly £600,000, then held by certain banks in America, handed over to be used for the benefit of the Gaeltacht. That offer was made publicly and turned down by the members of the Front Bench opposite, with the result that the Gaeltacht lost that money. Not alone did they lose that £600,000, which was so badly needed, but we have now to foot a bill of £36,000 along with it, because those gentlemen were too high and mighty.  They thought they had nothing to do but to go to America and dictate to the American courts what they were to do with the money.  They made an effort to dictate.  They got certain decisions in the courts here and endeavoured to get the best advocates they could on the American side to argue the case for them in the American courts that the decision given here by the judges nominated by themselves should bind the American courts.  Of course they did not get that decision, as we know to our cost.  They could have avoided that.  They could have the money, and they could have avoided all the discredit, in some respects, of our fighting this out&mdash;fighting out disagreements and difficulties of that kind in the American courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody on this side of the House was anxious that the money should be frittered away by payments even to Irish lawyers, and certainly not to American lawyers.  We certainly were not anxious that legal discussions about matters that we should have endeavoured to settle in some way at home <Col N="338" /> should be dragged into the American courts.  But the gentlemen opposite would not have anything of the kind, and now they have lost that £600,000 to you and to me, and the ratepayers of this country have to foot a bill for £36,000 as well.  That is hardly good enough.  It is due to a want of foresight. It is, to my mind, even worse. They were so bigoted, so narrowmindedly hostile that they turned down any friendly discussion with the people on this side as to how that money might best be used to the advantage of Ireland in general or to the advantage of the Gaeltacht in particular, because that was a subject on which we thought there might be general agreement amongst our people.</P>
    <P>They were so uppish and narrowminded and they had such little foresight they felt certain that they had nothing to do but ask the judges in America to agree to what they wanted. They had won their military victory here.  &ldquo;We have beaten the Republicans&mdash;we have beaten them in the field.  We have established our Free State courts.  Our courts are recognised, and you Americans have recognised the Free State.  Therefore, you will hand us over the money.&rdquo;  But they got a drop, to use a slang phrase. There is not much satisfaction for Ireland in that, even though a great deal of that money is coming back into Republican funds.  It would have been better for Ireland if all that money could have been spent in the way suggested by Deputy de Valera.  It would have saved the ratepayers here the additional £36,000 they are now asked to pay.  There is no credit to Ireland in general; no credit to any party in the way the matter has been handled.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I think I might also mention.  I am not quite sure, if the case is taken into the courts by some of the subscribers to the loan, that American subscribers might not get a decision that not alone are they entitled to the funds that remain in the bank which are now being divided pro rata amongst the bond holders, but certain legal men associated with this case who won it so far as it has been won for the bond holders are of opinion that the Free State has made itself liable to pay back all the money collected <Col N="339" /> in America, and that means paying out another three or four million dollars.  They are fortified in that opinion by statements made by President Cosgrave himself and by the Free State representative in Washington, Professor Smiddy.  Not alone have they publicly declared it, but they have sworn affidavits which were handed in when this case was being tried in America, pledging the honour of the Free State and its Government to pay back all money that was raised on loan in America during the years 1919-1921.</P>
    <P>It is quite on the cards that action might be taken in the American courts by bond-holders on the basis of the affidavit sworn by President Cosgrave that your body here has accepted responsibility. Having insisted on that responsibility, they took over the Republican funds, £80,000, that remained here in certain banks, and certain moneys in America.  Not alone have they made affidavits and public declarations in your name, but they have by specific and legal action done everything possible to assure anybody who was interested that they have accepted responsibility.  Therefore, it is quite possible the £36,000 the Minister for Finance puts down here as the ultimate limit of the amount that will have to be paid in the way of legal expenses in connection with this Dáil Bonds litigation may by no means be the limit of the amount that may have to be paid by the taxpayers here.  But that is supposition.  I know, however, that the matter has been discussed, and I know that lawyers connected with the case, who have succeeded so far in getting this money for the bond holders, have discussed it with certain bond holders.  What they have decided to do I do not know, but it is quite on the cards that further legal action may take place and further costs may be asked for from the citizens here towards expenses as a result of this litigation, and, again I say it, as a result of the want of foresight, the want of patriotism, generosity and broad-mindedness on the part of the gentleman opposite in not, at any rate, offering to discuss, in a friendly, practical, patriotic way, for Ireland's interests, <Col N="340" /> the offer made as far back as 1925&mdash;that all this money be drawn out of the banks, that the litigation be dropped, and that the money be used for Irish purposes.</P>
    <P>What purposes the money will be used for now goodness only knows.  I have seen in American papers all sorts of associations formed trying to get a share of this money.  There are churches in San Francisco and Los Angeles, public bodies in Boston, Massachusetts and other places, all appealing to the bond holders to give them their bonds, so that this money might be used for various public works in America.  I think Ireland, the Gaeltacht particularly, wants that money more than any public institution in America.  We would have it if the gentleman opposite had any sense of patriotism when the offer was made. However, there is no good in regretting that now, but we have to bear in mind that because of their want of patriotism the citizens and the taxpayers geneally are paying through their noses.</P>

      <P>My contention is that that money would not be required if there was not extravagance in using money for following up political prosecutions. Therefore, we should oppose this vote tooth and nail.  The Free State is one of the few States in Europe where political prisoners are treated as criminals.  I look at this matter from the point of view of public policy, the dignity of the State, and from the point of view of real humiliation for the citizens.  You had men arrested and tried as criminals, and even the State grows ashamed and issues a nolle prosequi, as in the case of Mr. Rooney.  In the case of O'Reilly, he was kept in prison for nine months and then tried, and the jury acquitted him.  So long as public money is used in this extravagant manner for political purposes it is necessary to protest. It is used in an odious manner, calling political opponents criminals, trying to make out men of honourable character as criminals.  I think no allowance should be made, and we should vote against such an amount.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words in general support of the statement made by Deputy Little in connection with the Vote under sub-head D.  There is an extra £500 required for prosecutions.  I think it would be found that that sum of £500 would not be required were it not for the general policy of the Executive Council whenever a crime is committed to immediately arrest the most prominent Republican in the neighbourhood and put him on trial, even though there is no evidence whatever against him and that he is ultimately acquitted.  We have many examples of that policy in full operation whenever a crime, particularly of a character that is likely to arouse considerable public feeling, occurs.  It was done after the shooting at Cobh, and after the shooting of the late Minister for Justice.  It is done repeatedly in smaller cases throughout the whole country.  Whenever a crime is committed prominent Republicans are arrested.  They are put on trial and remanded from week to week until finally, when the State has to admit that there is no evidence against them, they are released.  It is no wonder that an additional sum of £500 is required. Perhaps if the same policy is to be continued throughout next year additional sums will again be required. It is part of a general campaign which the Government has conducted of using the positions which they happen to occupy for the purpose of securing political advantage.  I might also say that I am in full agreement with the remarks made in connection with the Vote under sub-head G.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had placed in our hands a statement as to the Government policy in connection with the Gaeltacht Commission's Report.  On item after item it is stated that &ldquo;this recommendation is good, but that unfortunately the money is not available to put the recommendations into operation.&rdquo;  The money could have been available&mdash;the money was offered&mdash;the £500,000 to which Deputy O'Kelly referred and which he stated will possibly be used to build certain public institutions in America.  That could have been secured here.  There is no need, I am sure, to tell any Deputy what a tremendous <Col N="343" /> difference the expenditure of that money would have effected in the Gaeltacht area instead of it being frittered away as it was in consequence of the Government policy.  In view of these facts.  I think it is up to the House, composed as it is of the people's representatives, to pass a vote of no confidence in the Government and to reject the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

For years since the Treaty those of us who stand for the Republican policy have been completely misrepresented by our opponents, the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation, and by the Imperialist Press of this country.  Here was the first opportunity where an unbiased tribunal had a case presented before it, the best case that could possibly be made, and with the most skilled advocacy that money could buy.  A decision was given, not in favour of the Government Party in this House, not in favour of the Government propaganda in this country, but in favour of those who stood for Deputy de Valera.  Possibly in view of that fact, if only people are allowed to realise it, the money may not have been ill-spent. Nevertheless, it is a pity, considering the economic situation in some districts in the country and the decline in population in the Gaeltacht, that the offer which was so generously made by Deputy de Valera was not accepted by the Government.  It is no wonder that they have preserved silence on that head.  Had they accepted that offer in the same magnanimous spirit in which it was made, they would have done something to have prevented the drain of emigration that has taken place from the Gaeltacht.  They could have done something to make good the professions that they offered to this people six years ago when they advocated the acceptance of that Treaty, but the knowledge that their own weakness engendered prevented them doing it.  I <Col N="344" /> think the House ought to reject this estimate which the Minister has not justified by one word.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us whether it is the policy of his Government to accept responsibility for the payment of these Dáil bonds in full, or whether a declaration made by President Cosgrave represents the attitude of the Ministry.  I am going to quote from the &ldquo;Irish World&rdquo; of the 4th February.  They give a declaration which they say is taken from an affidavit made in the Dáil Bonds case by President Cosgrave, in which he says: &ldquo;Speaking on behalf of the nation in whose behalf these funds were collected and with the voice of the nation I say that we desire to repay those moneys to the subscribers, and they can do what they wish with them when they get the money repaid.&rdquo;  In the same paper a statement made by Mr. Smiddy, the Minister at Washington in 1922, is printed.  He made an affidavit in which this occurs: &ldquo;The Irish Free State recognises fully as its own obligations the obligations to the holders of the certificates in question, and the Irish Free State will comply fully with the terms thereof.&rdquo;  I do not want to take the Minister for Finance at a disadvantage, but I am asking him if that is their policy still&mdash;their policy as it was supposed to be at that time when these affidavits were made presumably. I also call attention to this statement which President Cosgrave is reported to have made recently in the course of an interview in New York.  It perhaps emphasises the statement made in 1922 according to the affidavit to which I have referred.  He said here, referring to the Republican loans, that &ldquo;he regretted that the New York authorities had not seen fit to accept the compromise offered by his Government whereby the Free State would have accepted the obligations incurred by the Republicans on condition that they received their assets.  No further action seemed possible at present.&rdquo; According to the report of that interview, he referred there to an offer that was made by and in the name of his Government of a compromise.  That statement was brought under the notice of the judge who tried this case, by the <Col N="345" />&ldquo;Irish World.&rdquo;  They sent their representative to the judge and called his attention to the statement of President Cosgrave.  Judge Peters authorised him to publish this statement of his in answer to President Cosgrave:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No such offer ever was made. The Free State authorities wanted the money given to them without any condition whatever.  For me to have complied with that suggestion would have been a violation of every principle of law and justice.  I gave judgment directing that the money should be returned to the bond holders.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have asked will the Minister state which is the policy of the Free State Government&mdash;the policy as stated in the affidavit sworn in 1922, or the policy according to that interview, if the interview be correct, now adopted by President Cosgrave, speaking, I presume, for his Government.  In fine, I would like to know what the intention is with regard to the Dáil bonds, whether the Ministry accepts responsibility for the whole amount or whether that responsibility, which was stated in several affidavits as having been accepted, is now repudiated by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. MOORE Mr. MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in connection with Item D that I think would alone justify the reduction of this estimate.  I allude to the continued persecution and the waste of time and of money in following a certain number of prisoners who are guilty of the awful crime of escaping from Mountjoy Jail in December, 1925.  I think there is no Deputy who believes that these men were criminals, and after that space of time has elapsed, after all these men have suffered&mdash;and some of them have suffered a great deal, as is very well known&mdash;in trying to escape their pursuers during that time, surely the Government is not such a mighty Government that it could not afford to drop its pride and allow them to return home.  Only last week you had the case of one man, Michael Carolan, who is as good an Irishman as any Deputy on the opposite benches.  His crime was that when the doors were opened for him in December, 1925, he <Col N="346" /> had the audacity to walk out.  I think that it is time that we should at least call a halt.  Goodness knows, there is enough trouble in the country and there are sufficient ways of spending money without wasting money on persecution of that kind.</P>
      <P>It happens that I am particularly interested in the case of these men, because the morning after they escaped I had a visit from half a dozen stalwarts who thought they were in bed with me.  Three of them spent half an hour in my room.  Then two of them retired, and the other man was so sick of his job that he sat down on the side of the bed and spent half an hour talking to me.  I could have been a lot better employed having a sleep during that time, and they could have been much better employed at that hour of the morning.  I do not mean to say that the law should not be maintained.  I do not think that there is any Deputy here but believes in maintaining the law, but this is a matter in which all our sentiments are with the prisoners. I venture to say that the heart of every man on the Government Benches who is worth while was with these prisoners on that occasion.  I suggest we should not pass any estimate to defray such foolish, idiotic expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on two or three occasions on the question of the repayment of the American Loan, and I have been perfectly clear that we were bound to repay the Loan.  I do not see how it would be right for us to take advantage of any decision to escape liability to the bond-holders.  So far as we were concerned, we regarded the results of the American litigation as moderately satisfactory because this money will now go to the bond-holders and will lessen the amount that we will have to pay them, because if a bondholder gets paid, say, 25 per cent. of the amount that is due to him, we will only have to pay him the remaining 75 per cent.  Consequently, except in so far as double distribution may mean additional expense, we are quite satisfied with the result of the litigation.  Of course, possibly the distribution by the agents of the Court will be more expensive than the type of distribution we might have arranged.  It will involve a <Col N="347" /> second distribution of the monies that will be provided.  Legislation is already in existence for the carrying out of that.  There will have to be a second distribution.  Which will involve additional charges.</P>
      <P>So far as the home loan is concerned, we require that consent be given to any transfer of bonds.  The reason of that is that people might be induced to part with their bonds without receiving value, and we certainly would only pay to the original bond-holder or to somebody who had paid a fair price for the original bond.  I knew a case here at home of a man who had, just a month or two before the loan was repayable, acquired certificate bonds at £1 each, the original price, and that man would have got 28/- each for them within a couple of months.  I refused to recognise the transfer, because the bargain had not been a fair one to the original subscribers. We will have to make some arrangement in regard to repayment in America to safeguard the original subscribers. When they get the money they can do whatever they like with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to rake up a great deal of history in connection with this matter, but I think if an offer had been seriously intended it should have been to have the money paid over to the Exchequer of the State, and disposed of according as the Dáil would direct. I do not think any other offer could possibly have been entertained.  A great deal of litigation expenses had been incurred before there was any suggestion of an offer.  In any case, it is not a fact to say that £500,000 or thereabouts has been lost.  It has not been lost.  It is going back to the bond-holders, and to that extent it is relieving the liability of the State towards those bond-holders.  I do not know whether the remarks of Deputy Moore and other Deputies in regard to prisoners and the arrest of people were in order on this Supplementary Estimate. In any case the duty of the Government is to enforce and carry out the law.  If men were legally under arrest, had been legally sentenced, and escaped from prison, it is their clear <Col N="348" /> duty to re-arrest them when opportunity offers, and to return them to prison.</P>

      <P>If he Deputy would not try to get so many allegations in, it would be easier to answer the question. So far as the home loan is concerned, there has been no avoidable delay.  If the Deputy will examine it, he will find that it is an extremely difficult thing to prepare an authentic register which will contain the names of genuine subscribers, and no other names.  The particulars in respect of certain districts are available, and there has been no delay there, so that we may leave that aside for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> In regard to the other matter, we could not come to any decision until we knew what was going to happen in the courts.  We had the view for some time that what did in the end happen was quite likely to happen.  But in any case, until there was a decision in the courts we could not form any scheme for repayment.  Since that decision was announced it has not been possible, owing to various circumstances, to get ahead with the preparation of the scheme.  But a certain amount of consideration has been given to it, and it will be possible, before very long, to determine the exact lines on which we will proceed with regard to the repayment. The delay there was delay due to the litigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The people with whose interest we are concerned are the original subscribers, and we must see that if a subscriber, for any reason, is induced to part with his bond without value that he will have to get the money that is to be repaid, and he will have to settle with the person to whom he has passed it over.  That is simply taking ordinary steps to protect the original bond-holder I do not know whether Deputy de Valera took me up rightly when I said three or four months.  That was with reference <Col N="350" /> to the decision as to a scheme. Actual payment.  I do not think, can be made until a great deal more progress has been made with the distribution of the sum over there.

      <P>Go ndeontar suim bhreise ná raghaidh thar £67,500 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thicfidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1928, chun Congnamh Airgid d'íoc ar scór Siúicre Bhiatais (Uimh. 37 de 1925).</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £67,500 be granted to defray the Charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1928, for payment of Subsidy in respect of Beet Sugar (No. 37 of 1925).</P>
      <P>When the original estimate, amounting to a sum of £198,000, went before the Dáil, I stated that the total provision in that estimate was for a production of sugar of slightly over 13,000 tons, and I said that it would be well to say that that sum would not be sufficient, and that additional moneys would have to be provided.  As the amount of subsidy payable depends on the amount of beet grown and the amount of sugar produced, when the original estimate was being prepared, a month or two earlier than this last year, it was not, of course, possible to arrive at an exact figure. The total production of sugar, in the first season was 11,979½ tons.  The amount of sugar produced this year is something over 17,500 tons.  As a matter of fact, a few thousand pounds more than what is actually in the estimate will be required in respect of this year's crop.  The area under sugar beet in 1926 was 9,500 acres.  In the present year the area under beet is about 17,000 acres, but owing to less favourable climatic conditions the yield per acre and the sugar content is less than in the first season.  The information that is available in regard to the present year goes to show that the factory rate has decreased from 10 tons to about 8 tons, and the sugar content is down from about 17½ per cent. to about 16.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. DERRIG Mr. DERRIG">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DERRIG</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity that this Party has had of discussing this very important estimate. A new industry has been created in this country with the intention of giving farmers a guaranteed price for a certain <Col N="354" /> crop, and on this side of the House we are particularly interested to know whether the farmers are having quite as good a bargain as is popularly imagined.  The Minister has just stated that the conditions last year were not quite so favourable as during the preceding year.  As a matter of fact, I think the House is pretty well acquainted with the fact that the yield the preceding year was quite exceptional, and it was not taken as a criterion of the conditions which would ultimately develop.</P>
      <P>This year, according to the Minister's statement, the sugar content has considerably decreased, and although the acreage under beet has increased, not alone in Carlow, but in various other counties, that is not an indication that the beet-growing proposition is as profitable to the farmer as we think.  In the first place, there is exceptional depression in the farming industry; in the second place, there is a guaranteed price, and we all know that in a period of declining prices and great depression the farmer is only too anxious to seize any straw and to grow any crop which would give him a guaranteed price, even though, if his accounts were actually made up, it would be found that his margin of profit was very slender.</P>
      <P>As I understand the conditions governing the sugar beet factory, they state that the farmer is to be paid 54/- for every ton of washed beets, and that includes delivery at the factory&mdash;from that 54/- the farmer has to deduct the cost of transport.  When this question was being discussed here before, it was stated that favourable arrangements had been made with the railways company for cheap transport.  I am not quite sure that that has been the case, and I would like to have some statement from the opposite benches as to what is being done to meet the farmers and the farmers' representatives with regard to transport and in other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides the cost of transport, there is also the question of the determination of the sugar content, and I am told by the growers in Carlow that a great many subtractions are made which they cannot understand in determining the tares.  I would like to know <Col N="355" /> whether the promise which was made originally when this matter was discussed here, that the farmers would have an opportunity of having a representative there who would see that they got fair weight and that the sugar content was calculated in a fair manner for them, has been carried out.  Furthermore, I would like to know how the scheme which was stated to have been put on foot by the factory for the supply of cheap fertilizers is working. One of the chief causes, apparently, of the high cost of production is the cost of fertilizers, and if the scheme is to go ahead on economic lines these matters, in which the farmers are particularly interested, will have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Government has a duty to the growers as well as to the factory.  The farmer is assured of 54/- per ton for his beet.  The factory, as I understand it, is guaranteed 69/-, and unless I am contradicted I must take it that that means that the factory is getting its beet free and in addition is getting 15/- a ton towards the cost of manufacture.  As well as having this favourable condition, the factory has also the advantage of having a contract which has been signed for ten years, and there is no guarantee, as far as I know, for the farmer. It is a great cause of complaint with the farmers in my constituency that, after the first three years' term has expired, they will not know what to do.  It has been stated that the subsidy here is less than in England. It is also the case that the higher the sugar content is, the lower, I might say, is the proportion which the farmer gets; when it goes beyond 15.5 he gets a lower price for the extra content, and while the factory is guaranteed the subsidy for ten years, after a period of three years the farmers will be thrown on their own resources.  The Government cannot refuse to accept responsibility for what will happen to the farmers at the end of the three years.</P>
    <P>When they started this factory they had before them the example of the beet sugar industry in England and in other countries.  They knew that the question of providing a huge annual <Col N="356" /> subsidy from the taxes was bound to be an insurmountable problem in due course.  They accepted the proposal of the foreign syndicate on experimental grounds.  Now they have had a certain amount of time in which to develop the experiment, and the farmers, who are somewhat disturbed by fears and anxieties, would like to have a guarantee that their interests, as well as the interests of the factory, will be looked after.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister for Agriculture as well as the Minister for Finance laid special emphasis on the fact that this was only experimental, and although he knew that the financial basis of the thing would become a matter of great difficulty after some time, the Minister said in 1926: The growth of the beet crop at the rate of ten tons &ldquo;was a small fortune,&rdquo; that &ldquo;£26 a statute acre was a very fine profit&rdquo; and &ldquo;if the farmers were asked to take a lot less, as they would be later on when the business became commercialised, I will not have much sympathy with them.&rdquo; In other words, when the time would come that the question of the abolition or the reduction of the subsidy would have to be very seriously considered, the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues, who did so much to encourage the growth of this crop all over the country, are prepared to let the farmers down and to put them in the position of making the best terms they can with the syndicate.</P>
    <P>A discussion that took place in the British House of Commons a few weeks ago, in which this whole matter was mooted and the representative of the producers, a Mr. Alexander, pointed out that while during the subsidy period the growers were assured of 46/- when the subsidy ended, and when they were in the position that the producers will be in this country at the end of three years, when they will have no contract to fall back on, 16/- was all they could get where they were formerly getting 46/- or 48/&mdash;in other words, a reduction of two-thirds.  It is very easy for the Minister for Agriculture to come here and lay down the economics of a 200-acre farm, especially when he is able to eke out his remuneration from the farm with a salary, <Col N="357" /> a pension, and emoluments of various kinds.  But when the Minister for Agriculture is reduced to the position of the farmers of Carlow, who are trying to grow a few acres of beet, and who do not know what is going to happen to them when the three years' contract has expired, perhaps he would have a little more feeling, and perhaps he would then try to put into operation that economical adage which I read in one of his speeches, that when you have producers you ought to try to keep these producers in until you get more producers.  Well, our opinion of the Minister for Agriculture is that whenever a producer is in a decent way to keep himself on a footing and to make himself solvent, he and his colleagues take every possible opportunity they get to drive him out of business and out of the country as well.</P>
    <P>The alternative which I suggest the House might consider is, in this matter, as in other matters connected with agriculture, the transfer of the factory in some measure to the control of the farmer.  As a matter of fact, when this proposal was first brought forward there was a suggestion that the Government should accept responsibility for half the share capital, and that the factory should not be run on the present basis, but on the basis of a sliding scale arrangement by which, while the subsidy might not be as large as it was in the beginning, it would be run on a sliding scale and be dependent on the duty on sugar.  It seems to me that that arrangement might become permanent and there might be a real basis to-day which would enable it to live, and furthermore, if the Government were represented on the directorate of the factory they would have a considerable say in the policy and in the development of the factory, and, what is more important, the development of subsidiary industries around about it.  We have heard a great deal of criticism about the economics of the raw sugar-beet factory, and it has been argued that in order to keep the industry going properly, and make it last we ought to have a refinery and make any further sugar-beet factories subsidiary to it.  If a refinery were started it would open up the way to <Col N="358" /> jam factories and to the development of the fruit-growing industry in this country.</P>
    <P>The Government ruled itself out of all that because at the time that this alternative proposal was before them the Minister for Finance decided that the £150,000 which was demanded would be an ultimate loss, and that the Government could not undertake the responsibility.  Even under the management of the Department of Finance, I think the Minister would have had a very good chance of getting his £150,000 back, because the factory has earned, for the period for which its accounts have been published, a profit of £114,000, after paying all expenses for the raw beet, for other raw materials of manufacture, salaries and wages, and so on.  There is a gross profit of £114,000.  That works out at a gross profit per ton of sugar of £9 11s. 9d.  If we work that down further, assuming that 12,000 tons of sugar were produced, the net profit would be about 4/7 per cwt.  That is the profit the factory is making, but no part of that profit is going to the Government, although the Government is subsidising the industry to this extent.</P>
    <P>The items in the balance sheet and the accounts are worthy of examination. Generally, when the directors of an enterprise publish their accounts for the first year we expect that they would be rather conservative, and put a sum of money aside for reserves, and to meet future contingencies.  They will not pay very big profits.  In any case, they will hardly have very big profits to pay, because they will have heavy preliminary expenses and so on.  But the sugar beet factory for the period from its incorporation to the 30th June, 1927, as well as having a gross profit of £114,000, has been able to pay off £40,000 for depreciation of plant and machinery.  The plant and machinery cost originally £382,000, so that, roughly, one-tenth has been written off. It seems to me that that is a very large amount for the first year, particularly when we take into consideration that the factory is only working for 100 days.  That £40,000 represents depreciation in machinery and plant of £400 per day.  That, of course, reduces the <Col N="359" /> amount of the net profit.  In addition to that it has been able to pay off all the preliminary expenses, amounting to nearly £10,000.  In most enterprises that would take a period of several years.  Most remarkable of all, the wages sheet, according to the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal,&rdquo; came to £100,000, a figure that I think is grossly exaggerated, because the employment in the factory represents about 500 men for 100 days.  That is about £1,000 weekly for 14 weeks, or £14,000.  Of course, there is a maintenance party kept for the rest of the year, but there are only a very small number of men employed in that way.  That £15,000, or perhaps £20,000, is a very small figure in comparison with the handsome remuneration that the directors have paid themselves.  I notice that in concerns which the Government is responsible for bringing into existence we have twice as many directors as in private enterprises. While five or six men can run the Munster and Leinster Bank or the Provincial Bank, we have to have twelve directors to run the sugar beet factory.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they are engaged for the whole year round, but, in any case, they are paid £4,252 for the period; in other words, £236 5s. for each director per year.  I want to call attention to these figures.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance will point out that he has no responsibility for them, but his Government were responsible for setting up the factory in the first instance.  They are faced with a very serious responsibility towards the people whom they instructed to grow beet all over the country, and in a short time, now that President Cosgrave has seen fit to be take himself to a healthier atmosphere, probably the question will loom in the air.  I want to have a definite statement from the Minister in regard to the development of the factory and the subsidiary industries connected with it, and to the question of giving the farmers some representation and control in the management of the affairs of the factory which concerns them.  Finally, I want to know whether the Minister is satisfied that the farmers are getting a fair deal in this matter, <Col N="360" /> and whether he regards the accounts and profits of the syndicate as reasonable.</P>

      <P>I would like to take up the story of the Carlow sugar beet factory where Deputy Derrig left it down.  I would like to know whether I would be in order at this stage in moving to reduce the Vote.  I would like to explain that this House is in the position of having been committed to the payment of the subsidy.  At the same time, we desire to get some means by which the House can express its disapproval of the unsatisfactory part of the transactions.  If it is not in order to move a reduction, we can divide on the motion.</P>

      <P>When we on this side of the House entered this Assembly, I recollect President Cosgrave standing up and telling us that we should take everything which Ministers say as true, that we should not question their statements, and that whenever they made a statement of fact that was the fact.  The Deputies who were in this House before us will recollect that when the Carlow Sugar Beet Subsidy Act was being introduced certain facts were placed before the House by the Minister for Finance.  He gave the House to understand that the total production of sugar estimated from the factory for a period of ten years, during which the subsidy was payable, would not exceed 86,000 tons, and that the total figure to which the subsidy would run during that period would not exceed £2,000,000.  The House, on the strength of these facts supplied by the Minister for Finance, passed the Act.  From the figures now given it appears that the total production of sugar for the ten years is likely to be double that which the Minister originally estimated.  I understand that he stated that 17,500 tons were produced this year.</P>

      <P>In other words, the Dáil is committed to the payment of a sum which will probably run to about £1,000,000 in excess of what was anticipated. Deputy Derrig has shown that there are several matters in relation to the management of the factory which require serious consideration by this House.  We have the fact that a gross profit of £114,000 was made in the period up to the 30th June last, and as a result the Company was able to set aside a sum equal to ten per cent. of the value of the plant and machinery in addition to paying the shareholders a dividend of ten per cent. In other words, at the end of ten years the shareholders will have completely wiped out their capital liability, and in addition will have drawn a sum equal to its capital liability during the period.  They will have made a very substantial profit and can be in the position of thoroughly congratulating themselves on being connected with the enterprise.  The effect of that is that the shareholders have already in the back, if not the front, of their minds that when the ten years is up and the total subsidy received by them, they will not continue to work the factory. If the subsidy was given for the purpose of benefiting agriculture and giving the farmers a profitable crop that would promote tillage this is not the way to go about it.  It is the wrong <Col N="362" /> way, because as a result of what is coming the set back agriculture will get is likely to be considerable.  Considerable proof is available that the policy of the factory is, as I have stated, to run for ten years and then close down.  I have been in touch with people who have had business dealings with the factory.  In no case did I find the factory was taking any steps an ordinary firm would take to consolidate trade relationship that would survive when the ten years period had run its course.  The manager of one factory who was in a position to purchase large quantities of sugar annually told me that in one consignment of sugar he found a quantity of glass.  He wrote making a complaint, and the reply he received from the factory was:&mdash;&ldquo;We note that some glass was found in the sugar delivered to you.  It was probably due to the accidental breaking of an electric light bulb.  If you think the incident is likely to recur cancel your contract.&rdquo; Would any business firm anxious to build up its trade and establish sound relations with its customers treat a serious complaint in that flippant manner? In every case I examined I found they were merely drawing profits and making no provision for the future.</P>
